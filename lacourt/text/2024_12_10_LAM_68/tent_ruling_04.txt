RULING: Denied
Defendant Marriott International, Inc.  moves to compel arbitration on the complaint
filed by Plaintiff Maria Rodriguez. Defendants Marriott International, Inc.,
Sheraton Operating LLC and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC filed a
second motion to compel arbitration, which is concurrently set for the same
hearing date. Plaintiff filed a single joint opposition to both motions. Defendants
submit a combined reply. The court therefore consolidates the motions into a
single order.
 
Defendants maintain all claims are subject to
arbitration under the terms of the agreement, the agreement in no way presents unconscionable
terms, and all parties are subject to the agreement as subsidiaries of Starwood.
Plaintiff in opposition challenges enforcement of the agreement on grounds of
the lack of an ability to enforce the agreement with the non-signatory parties
to the agreement. The reply reiterates the existence of the agreement, and
third party beneficiary and equitable estoppel basis for compelling as to the
non-signatory parties.
 
The
court first considers the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). “The FAA shall govern
the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement. If the FAA is held not to
apply to this Agreement for any reason, and the state or district in which
Employee is employed recognizes the enforceability of this Agreement and the
arbitration award, then this Agreement and the arbitration award or decision
are enforceable under the laws of the state or district in which Employee is
employed.”
 
Defendants
represent engaging in interstate commerce and therefore contend FAA rules
govern pursuant to the terms of the agreement. [Declaration of Mariela
Palomares-Cortez.] Plaintiff offers no challenge. Barring a conflict supporting
a preemption of a specific provision under FAA, the court adheres to the
California standard for compelling arbitration in that FAA and California
adhere to the same standards for review of arbitration agreements. The court finds
no conflict with the FAA under the terms of the agreement. (Volt Information Sciences, Inc.
v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University (1989) 489 U.S.
468, 477–479; Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman
Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 346; see Adolph
v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, 1119; Viking River Cruises, Inc. v.
Moriana (2022) 142 S.Ct. 1906.)
 
“A written
agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy
thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such
grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.) “On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the
existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party
thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the
petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines
that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines
that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or
(b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
 
The
law creates a general presumption in favor of arbitration. In a motion to compel arbitration, the moving party must prove by a
preponderance of evidence the existence of the arbitration agreement and that
the dispute is covered by the agreement. “‘Under “both
federal and state law, the threshold question presented by a petition to compel
arbitration is whether there is an agreement to arbitrate.”’” (Long v. Provide Commerce, Inc. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th
855, 861.) “Private arbitration is a matter of
agreement between the parties and is governed by contract law. (Platt Pacific, Inc. v. Andelson (1993)
6 Cal.4th 307, 313.) In a motion to compel arbitration, the moving party must prove by a
preponderance of evidence the existence of the arbitration agreement and that
the dispute is covered by the agreement. The burden then shifts to the
resisting party to prove by a preponderance of evidence a ground for denial
(e.g., fraud, unconscionability, etc.). (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin'l
Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413-414; Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 158, 164–165; Hotels
Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr., Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 754, 758.) Any challenges to the formation
of the arbitration agreement should be considered before any order sending the
parties to arbitration. The trier of fact weighs
all evidence, including affidavits, declarations, documents, and, if
applicable, oral testimony to determine whether the action goes to arbitration.
(Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr., Inc., supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at
p. 758.)
 
Defendants present an undisputed copy of the
arbitration agreement which includes signature on September 2, 2011. [Palomares-Cortez Decl,
Ex. 1.] Plaintiff also offers no
challenge that the subject matter of the instant action as covered within the
scope of the arbitration clause, though neither party addresses the wage and
hour causes of action and potential exemptions under FAA versus California
Arbitration Act enforcement. 
 
“Actions
to enforce the provisions of this article for the collection of due and unpaid
wages claimed by an individual may be maintained without regard to the
existence of any private agreement to arbitrate.” (Lab. Code, § 229; Ware v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith, Inc. (1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 35, 45; see see Kirby v. Immoos Fire Protection, Inc. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1244,
1256-1257.) State law exclusions are preempted where Federal Arbitration Act
(FAA) preemption occurs. (Carbajal v.
CWPSC, Inc. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 227, 238; Hoover v. American Income Life Ins. Co. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th
1193, 1207-1208; see Lane v. Francis
Capital Management LLC (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 676, 68-688.) Given the
finding of FAA applicability, all potential exempt claims are therefore
preempted. 
 
The
court therefore finds the claims subject to arbitration as to all contracting
parties. Plaintiff raises no defense on the issue of unconscionability. (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 102; Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc. (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1531; Kinney v. United HealthCare Services,
Inc. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1322, 1329.) 
 
On the disputed issue regarding the parties to
the agreement, Defendants rely on the plain language of the agreement identifying
all defendants, or alternatively enforcement via estoppel or third party
beneficiary. Plaintiff challenges any third party beneficiary relationship, and
offers no apparent challenge to the estoppel claim. The court addresses both
given the burden on moving party to establish estoppel. (Hernandez v.
Meridian Management Services, LLC (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 1214, 1219.)
 
The
doctrine of equitable estoppel allows for a non-signatory party to compel
arbitration “‘when the causes of
action against the nonsignatory are “intimately founded in and intertwined”
with the underlying contract obligations.’” (JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court (2011) 193
Cal.App.4th 1222, 1237; Goldman v. KPMG, LLP (2009)
173 Cal.App.4th 209, 217-218; Crowley
Maritime Corp. v. Boston Old Colony Ins. Co. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th
1061, 1070 [Under equitable estoppel, a party cannot avoid participation in
arbitration, where the party received “a direct benefit
under the contract containing an arbitration clause…”]; Boucher v.
Alliance Title Co, Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 262, 271.) 
 
“Every California case
finding nonsignatories to be bound to arbitrate is based on
facts that demonstrate, in one way or another, the signatory's implicit
authority to act on behalf of the nonsignatory.” (Jensen v. U-Haul Co. of
California (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 295, 304; Harris v. Superior Court (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d
475, 478–479; Rowe v. Exline (2007)
153 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1290.) “A nonsignatory can be compelled to arbitrate when
a preexisting relationship existed between the nonsignatory and one of the
parties to the arbitration agreement, making it equitable to compel
the nonsignatory to arbitrate as well.” (JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th
1222, 1240.) “Examples of the preexisting relationship include agency, spousal
relationship, parent-child relationship and the relationship of a general
partner to a limited partnership. (Citations.) In the
absence of such a relationship, or third party beneficiary status, courts will
generally not compel a nonsignatory to arbitrate.” (Crowley Maritime Corp. v. Boston Old Colony Ins. Co. (2008)
158 Cal.App.4th 1061, 1070; see Hernandez v. Meridian Management Services,
LLC, supra, 87 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1218-1222.) 
 
The court interprets the
arbitration clause like any other contract, including determination of the
intent of the parties and ambiguities. (Gravillis v. Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Co. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 761, 772.) “‘A contract must be so interpreted
as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at
the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.’ (Civ.
Code, § 1636.) ‘The language of a contract is to govern its interpretation, if
the language is clear and explicit, and does not involve an absurdity.’ (Civ.
Code, § 1638.) ‘When a contract is reduced to writing, the intention of the
parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone, if possible; subject,
however, to the other provisions of this Title.” (Civ. Code, § 1639.) “The
whole of a contract is to be taken together, so as to give effect to every
part, if reasonably practicable, each clause helping to interpret the other.’
(Civ. Code, § 1641.) ‘A contract must receive such an interpretation as will
make it lawful, operative, definite, reasonable, and capable of being carried
into effect, if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.’
(Civ. Code, § 1643.) ‘The words of a contract are to be understood in their
ordinary and popular sense, rather than according to their strict legal
meaning; unless used by the parties in a technical sense, or unless a special
meaning is given to them by usage, in which case the latter must be followed.’
(Civ. Code, § 1644.) ‘However broad may be the terms of a contract, it extends
only to those things concerning which it appears that the parties intended to
contract.’ (Civ. Code, § 1648.) ‘Repugnancy in a contract must be reconciled,
if possible, by such an interpretation as will give some effect to the
repugnant clauses, subordinate to the general intent and purpose of the whole
contract.’ (Civ. Code, § 1652.) ‘Stipulations which are necessary to make a
contract reasonable, or conformable to usage, are implied, in respect to
matters concerning which the contract manifests no contrary intention.’ (Civ.
Code, § 1655.)”


(Siligo v. Castellucci (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 873, 880–881.)
 
“A
contract term should not be construed to render some of its provisions
meaningless or irrelevant.” (Estate of
Petersen (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1742, 1754 (footnote 4).) “A
well-settled maxim states the general rule that ambiguities in a form contract
are resolved against the drafter. (Citations.) But that is a general rule; it
does not operate to the exclusion of all other rules of contract
interpretation. It is used when none of the canons of construction succeed in
dispelling the uncertainty.” (Oceanside
84, Ltd. v. Fidelity Federal Bank (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1448.)
 
The relied upon section of the arbitration
agreement states in part: “In consideration of Starwood Hotels & Resorts
Worldwide, Inc. ("Starwood") having extended an offer of employment
to me and/or having hired me, I agree that all disputes and claims that I may
have, now or in the future, with or against Starwood, any of Starwood's
affiliated or subsidiary companies and/or any of Starwood's partners or joint
venturers, and/or any officer, employee or agent of Starwood, any affiliated or
subsidiary company, or partner or joint venturer (collectively, ‘claims’),
shall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association to be resolved and
determined ...” [Palomares-Cortez
Decl, Ex. 1.]
 
Reliance on the existence of the language identifying
“partners or joint venturers, and/or any officer, employee or agent of Starwood,
any affiliated or subsidiary company, or partner or joint venturer” in no way
establishes the other defendants as parties to the contract simply based on the
contractual terms. Written terms identifying potential, but otherwise
unidentified parties, insufficiently establishes formation and assent among all
moving parties.
 
In support of the estoppel and third party
beneficiary relationship, Defendants present a single unchallenged declaration
which states in relevant part: “Sheraton and Starwood are affiliates of
Marriott. Sheraton is the employer of employees working at the W Hollywood
Hotel. Prior to 2023, Sheraton was known as Sheraton Operating Corporation.
Sheraton is an affiliate of Starwood, formerly known as Starwood Hotels &
Resorts Worldwide, Inc. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. converted
to Starwood in September 2016. To the best of my knowledge, Starwood Hotels
& Resorts WW Inc. and W Hollywood Hotel and Residences are non-existent
entities; no entities with those names are subsidiaries or affiliates of
Marriott.” [Declaration of Andrew Wright, ¶ 3.] Notwithstanding the denial of
any “W Hollywood Hotel” entity, the agreement itself states “W HOLLYWOOD” at
the top of the page, though, as cited above, the agreement lists Starwood as
the apparent employing party. 
 
Regardless, Defendant
offers no definition or expressed legal implications of the affiliate
relationship between the entitles. A court considering the meaning of the term
essentially found an affiliate addresses a part of an organization associated
with a larger organization, which can include a branch or subsidiary. (Iqbal
v. Ziadeh (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 1, 9-11.) In considering the
relationship in context of the contractual language, the court finds no
meaningful evidence regarding participation of the “affiliated” co-defendants,
such as a parent subsidiary or principal agent. (See Hernandez v. Meridian Management Services, LLC, supra, 87 Cal.App.5th at p. 1220; Waste Management, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 105, 110; Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 548.) 
 
Plaintiff
challenges the language of the agreement as not conveying any intended third
beneficiary relationship between the entities. Plaintiff cites to a three part
test for determination of a third party relationship in the employment
arbitration context: The court must “examine the
express provisions of the contract at issue, as well as the relevant
circumstances of the contract's formation, to determine not only (1) whether
the third party would benefit from the contract, but also (2) whether a
motivating purpose of the contracting parties was to provide a benefit to the
third party, and (3) whether permitting a third party to bring its own breach
of contract action against a contracting party would be consistent with the
objectives of the contract and the reasonable expectations of the contracting
parties. The proponent must satisfy all three elements for the third party
action to proceed.” (Hernandez v. Meridian Management Services, LLC, supra,
87 Cal.App.5th at p. 1222.) The court lacks any evidence regarding a beneficiary
determination as to the handling of administrative
decisions leading to the termination of Plaintiff. 
 
The
court therefore finds no contractual basis for arbitration as to Marriott
International, Inc., and Sheraton Operating LLC.  Again, the motion
lacks sufficient evidence of establishment of a relationship binding the
parties. 
 
While
Starwood makes a valid case for arbitration, the court, as a matter of policy,
avoids potential piecemeal adjudication of cases, and maintains all parties
either participate in arbitration or remain with the court. “On petition of a
party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement
to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate
the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy
exists, unless it determines that: … (c) A party to the arbitration agreement
is also a party to a pending court action or special proceeding with a third
party, arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions
and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or
fact...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.) 
 
The right of a trial court to refuse arbitration on the
possibility of conflicting rulings remains an upheld statutory rule. (Whaley
v. Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th
479, 485-486; Henry v. Alcove Investment, Inc. (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d
94, 101-102.) The motion is therefore
denied on this basis as well, due to the inability to determine the basis for
compelling all parties to arbitration.
 
The motion is therefore
denied in its entirety. This order is appealable. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1294, subd.
(a).)
 
The court will concurrently conduct the case management
conference.
