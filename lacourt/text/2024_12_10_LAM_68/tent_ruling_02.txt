to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents (set one)
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Altman Apartments, LLC (Altman) manages certain
residential properties in Los Angeles. Plaintiff alleges an agreement with Defendant
People Assisting the Homeless (PATH) for the placement of qualified
individuals and families into Altman managed units in exchange for certain
negotiated rates. Plaintiff alleges payments stopped for certain tenants,
thereby leaving an outstanding balance of $335,323.44.
 
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint for 1. Breach
Of Contact; 2. Common Count; Account Stated; 3. Common Count: Open Book
Account; and 4. Negligence. On March 11, 2024, PATH answered the complaint, and
filed a cross-complaint against Altman for Indemnification, Apportionment of
Fault, and Declaratory Relief. Altman answered the cross-complaint on March 13,
2024.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff
Altman Apartments, LLC (Altman) moves to compel responses to Request for
Production of Documents (set one) served on Defendant People Assisting the
Homeless (PATH). Plaintiff served Request for Production of Documents (set one)
on April 5, 2024. [Declaration of Thomas Vincent, ¶ 2, Ex. A.] At the time of
the filing of the motions, no responses were received. [Id., ¶ 5.] Defendant in
opposition represents that former handling counsel left the firm on short
notice, thereby requiring reassignment of the cases. Upon discovering the
motion and missing discovery responses counsel proceeded to prepare responses
and represents service of responses by the time of the hearing date.
[Declaration of Serena Nervez.] Plaintiff in reply reiterates the propriety of
the motion given the lack of initial responses, and the entitlement to
sanctions. 
 
Because
the opposition lacks proof of service of any responses, and only presents a
representation of responses by the time of the hearing, the court must motion
grant the motion. Defendant PATH is ordered to serve verified responses to form
interrogatories, without objections within ten days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a-b).)  
 
If
responses are determined served at the time of the motion, the court will
declare the motion moot. The court will not consider the quality of any
responses. (See Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 408–409.) Plaintiff may bring a motion to compel
further responses, if deemed necessary.
 
The
court appreciates the circumstances, but generally adheres to a policy of
sanctions when a valid motion only leads to responses after the filing of the
motion. Sanctions in the amount of $1,000, which represents the mandatory
minimum amount of sanctions for document production motions to compel initial
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.050, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (c),
Sanctions imposed joint and severally against both counsel and PATH and payable
within 30 days of this order.
 
Trial set for April 14, 2025.
