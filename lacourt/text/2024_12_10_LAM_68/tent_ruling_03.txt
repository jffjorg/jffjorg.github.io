amended complaint brought by City of Redondo Beach. On November 7, 2024,

RULING: Denied/Moot.
Defendant
City of Redondo Beach moves to deem Request for Admissions (set one) served on Plaintiff
Kelly Deckers admitted. Defendant represents service of requests for admissions
on July 12, 2024. [Declaration of Aleen Hashmi, ¶ 3, Ex. A.] The responses
remain outstanding at the time of the filing of the motion. [Id., ¶ 4.]
Plaintiff Deckers in opposition represents service or responses, thereby
rendering the motion moot. The delay in responses was the result of an internal
calendaring error. Plaintiff therefore moves for relief from any waiver of
objections caused by the late filed responses. [Declaration of Thomas Shelly.]
Defendant in reply maintains all objections should be waived, as the delay
lacks justification, and denies any meet and confer requirement. Defendant
reiterates the request for sanctions.
 
Plaintiff
in opposition presents proof of responses, which consists of five responses
with “admit.”  [Shelly Decl., Ex. 2.] Given
proof of service, the court denies the motion and deems the motion moot. “As one court put it: ‘If the party manages
to serve its responses before the hearing, the court has no discretion but to
deny the motion. But woe betide the party who fails to serve responses before
the hearing.’” (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 776.) The court acknowledges
the request for any waiver of objections, but notes the responses present no
objections and admit all items. The court therefore also finds the subject
request moot.
 
Even if objections were submitted, the court finds sufficient
justification for relief. The harshness of a waiver of objections to admissions
on the basis of inadvertent error unfairly prejudices Plaintiff.
 
Normally
the court imposes sanctions when response are only provided after the filing of
the motion. The court declines to impose sanctions given the circumstances
leading to this first time discovery motion on the subject action, and given
the municipal defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Multiple
demurrers and a motion to strike between December 17, 2024, and January 27,
2025.
 
Defendants
