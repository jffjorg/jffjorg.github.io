And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion to deem requests for admissions admitted and finds that the motion is moot. The requests for admissions were served on July 12, 2024, and the responses were provided before the hearing, rendering the motion unnecessary. The Court also finds that the delay in responding to the requests for admissions was due to an internal calendaring error and therefore justifies relief from any waiver of objections. The Court declines to impose sanctions on the plaintiff given the circumstances leading to this first-time discovery motion and the municipal defendant. The Court orders that the requests for admissions be deemed admitted and that any objections be waived.
