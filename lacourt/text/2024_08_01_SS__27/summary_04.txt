Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel initial discovery responses. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests, which were served on March 7, 2024. The responses were due on April 9, 2024, but the plaintiff has not provided any responses. The defendant requested code-compliant responses by April 26, 2024, but the plaintiff has still not responded. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide complete and verified responses to the defendant's requests without objections within 20 days of the hearing date. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not opposed the motion and that the defendant did not request sanctions.
