Requests for Production and
Interrogatories¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A defendant may make a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time.
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd.
(a).) A plaintiff may make a demand for production of documents and propound
interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of
the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed,
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).) 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).) 
¿¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements. 
¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)

Discussion 
 
On March 7, 2024, Defendant Mark Walsh served
Plaintiff with a first set of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,
and a Request for Production. As these discovery requests were served
electronically, Plaintiff's responses were due on April 9, 2024.
On April 18, 2024, Defendant requested that
Plaintiff provide code-compliant responses to the discovery requests without
objections by April 26, 2024. As of July 8,2024, the date in which the present
motions were filed, Plaintiff has yet to produce any discovery responses.
Plaintiff now moves the Court to compel initial discovery responses. No
opposition to this motion has been filed.
 
It is undisputed that the initial discovery
responses at issue were not provided by the statutory deadline. No opposition
or any other documents were filed indicating that the initial responses were
provided prior to the hearing. Thus, the Court grants the present motions.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide complete and verified responses to Defendant’s
Requests for Productions, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special
Interrogatories, Set One, without objections within 20 days of today. 
 
Defendant did not request for sanctions.
