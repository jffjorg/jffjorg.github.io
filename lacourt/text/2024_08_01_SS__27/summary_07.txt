And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion to continue trial filed by the Defendant County of Los Angeles. The parties have requested a continuance to complete discovery and to have the Defendant's motion for summary judgment heard. The court finds that this request is reasonable, considering the case was filed less than a year ago and the parties have not requested previous continuances. The court also notes that no parties have filed an opposition alleging prejudice. The trial date is set for December 18, 2024, and the final status conference is continued to December 4, 2024.
