Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling orders Defendant Brent Stein to provide initial discovery responses to Plaintiff Kathy Boxer's Special Interrogatories, Set One, within 30 days. The Court grants the motion to compel responses due to Plaintiff's failure to provide responses by the statutory deadline. The Court also orders Plaintiff and her counsel to pay sanctions of $1000 to Defendant for their failure to respond. The Court finds that Plaintiff did not act with substantial justification and that Defendant's sanctions request was excessive, so the Court reduced the amount of sanctions from $2590.00 to $1000.00. The parties are advised to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
