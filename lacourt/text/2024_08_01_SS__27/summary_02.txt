And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service and set aside default. The motion was filed because the court had previously dismissed the lawsuit against the defendant. However, since the lawsuit has been dismissed, there is no ongoing litigation against the defendant, making the motion moot. If a party intends to submit to this tentative ruling, they must email the court by the specified date and time. If all parties submit, they will not need to appear in court. If they do not submit, they should be prepared to appear remotely or in person to argue the motion.
