And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to deem the Requests for Admissions (Set One) admitted, as the plaintiffs failed to provide discovery responses by the statutory deadline. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $1517.50, as the plaintiffs did not act with substantial justification. The judge orders the plaintiffs and their counsel to pay the sanctions within 30 days. The parties are notified of the need to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person at the hearing, and failure to do so may result in the court taking the motion off calendar or adopting the tentative ruling as the final order.
