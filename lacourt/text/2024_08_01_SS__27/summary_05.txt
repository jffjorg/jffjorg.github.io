Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the Pitchess motion to August 12, 2024, to be heard on the same day as Defendant's motion to continue trial and discovery cutoff date. The motion was originally filed by Plaintiff Horacio Galvan seeking discovery of Officer Valiente's personnel records, but was denied without prejudice on July 2, 2024. Plaintiff filed a renewed motion on July 3, 2024. The Court notes that the current discovery cutoff date of July 26, 2024, has passed, and agrees with Plaintiff that denying the motion would be prejudicial if the trial and discovery cutoff date are continued by the Court. The Judge concludes that continuing the motion is necessary to ensure fairness and equity in the case.
