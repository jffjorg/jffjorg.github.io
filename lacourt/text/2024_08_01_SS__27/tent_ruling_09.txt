Requests for Production and
Interrogatories¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A defendant may make a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time.
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd.
(a).) A plaintiff may make a demand for production of documents and propound
interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of
the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed,
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).) 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).) 
¿¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements. 
¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)

Discussion 
 
On March 1, 2024, Defendant Brent Stein served
Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Plaintiff Kathy Boxer. Defendant granted
Plaintiff’s request to extend the response deadline to April 26, 2024. As of
June 17, 2024, Plaintiff has not provided the discovery responses at issue or
communicated to Defendant whether the responses are forthcoming. Defendant now
moves the court to compel initial responses.
 
It is undisputed that the initial discovery
responses at issue were not provided by the statutory deadline. No opposition
or any other documents were filed indicating that the initial responses were
provided prior to the hearing. Thus, the Court grants the present motions. Plaintiff
is hereby ordered to provide complete and verified responses to Defendant’s
Special Interrogatories, Set One, without objections within 30 days of today.
 
            Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $2590.00. Sanctions
are mandatory when a party’s non-response forces the opposing party to file the
present motion to obtain compliance. The Court does not find Plaintiff to have
acted with substantial justification. Having said that, the Court finds
Defendant’s sanctions request to be excessive. Based on the simplicity of the
issues and lack of opposition, the court reduces the amount of sanctions to
$1000. Consequently, the Court orders Plaintiff and her counsel, jointly and
severally, to pay sanctions of $1000 to Defendant within 30 days of today’s
date.
