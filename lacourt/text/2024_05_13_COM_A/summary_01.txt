And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motion for determination of good faith settlement. The court finds that the settlement between Plaintiff and Defendant Guevara was made in good faith. The settlement was the result of arms-length negotiation, and Guevara's ability to contribute to the settlement was constrained by the limits of his insurance policy. The court also considered the settlor's financial condition and the fact that Guevara had no other insurance coverage. The Defendant City did not meet its burden of demonstrating that the settlement was not made in good faith. Therefore, the good faith determination bars any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from making any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution or partial or comparative indemnity based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.
