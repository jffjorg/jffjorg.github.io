Significant Statements:
  - "After six months from entry of default, a trial court may still vacate a default on equitable grounds even if statutory relief is unavailable."
  - "One ground for equitable relief is extrinsic mistake—a term broadly applied when circumstances extrinsic to the litigation have unfairly cost a party a hearing on the merits."
  - "To set aside a judgment based on extrinsic mistake one must satisfy three elements: First, the defaulted party must demonstrate that it has a meritorious case. Second, the party seeking to set aside the default must articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. Last, the moving party must demonstrate diligence in seeking to set aside the default once it is discovered."
```

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to set aside the defaults without prejudice. The court notes that the defendants' attorney, Joseph Hobaica, failed to protect their interests and misrepresented the status of the case. The court also finds that the defendants' delay in seeking to set aside the defaults and their lack of diligence in pursuing the case are unacceptable. The court concludes that the defendants' motion is untimely and lacks sufficient grounds to set aside the defaults.
