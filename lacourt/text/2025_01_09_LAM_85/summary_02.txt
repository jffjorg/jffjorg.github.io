And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition filed by the Estate (Petitioners) against Metrolink, seeking late claim relief. Metrolink argues that the Estate's complaint for damages against them was filed prematurely, which moots the petition and frustrates the purpose of the Act. The judge notes that Metrolink cites no authority to support this claim and that the Estate fails to show excusable neglect. Therefore, the judge rules that Metrolink is not required to show prejudice, as the Estate has not demonstrated excusable neglect. The judge's ruling is tentative and subject to change after further consideration.
