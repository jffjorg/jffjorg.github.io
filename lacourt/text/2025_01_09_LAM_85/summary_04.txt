And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues related to a court hearing. First, the judge scolds counsel for failing to follow the court's order regarding electronic filing and advises them to provide courtesy copies of their papers going forward. Second, the judge rules on Wilmington's written objections to evidence and directs the clerk to electronically file the court's rulings. Third, the judge addresses Wilmington's argument that it funded a loan in accordance with the loan documents, which Vermont disputes. Finally, the judge rejects Wilmington's argument that Vermont's objection to the ex parte appointment bond is untimely, as it was not filed within the required five-day period. The judge also declines to address Wilmington's remaining argument that Vermont's motion is an untimely motion to reconsider.
