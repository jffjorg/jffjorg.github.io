[1] Both counsel generally failed to comply with the
Presiding Judge’s First Amended General Order re: Electronic Filing by
providing courtesy copies of their papers. 
Counsel are admonished to lodge courtesy copies of their papers in all
future matters in this court.


[2] The court has ruled on Wilmington’s written
evidentiary objections.  The clerk is
directed to scan and electronically file the court’s rulings.


[3] Wilmington
argues (without evidence) that it funded the Loan in accordance with the Loan
Documents.  Vermont would submit draw
requests to Wilmington for the purpose of funding the construction.  After reviewing the draw request and
utilizing the services of a third-party inspector, Wilmington would approve the
draw request in full or in part, in accordance with the Loan Documents.
Wilmington funded all of the draw requests that were approved by the
third-party inspector. Opp. at 11.


[4] Wilmington argues that Vermont’s objection is
untimely under CCP section 529(a), which requires an objection to an injunction
bond be made within five days after service of the injunction.  Opp. at 10. 
There are three bonds required for an ex parte appointment of a
receiver: the receiver’s bond under CCP section 567(b), the applicant’s bond for
ex parte appointment under CCP section 566(b), and the supporting preliminary
injunction bond under CCP section 529.  CRC
3.1178.  Vermont is complaining about the
ex parte appointment bond under CCP section 566(b), not the preliminary
injunction bond under CCP section 529.


[5] The court need not address Wilmington’s remaining
argument that Vermont’s motion is an untimely motion to reconsider. Opp at
14-15.
