Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and rules that the motion for summary judgment filed by Saul Arevalo and Velos Towing, Inc. (erroneously sued and served as Valos Towing) is denied. The motion was filed on April 19, 2024, and is set for hearing on January 3, 2025. Alvarenga, the plaintiff, has not filed an opposition to the motion.

The judge finds that the moving defendants have not carried their initial burden on summary judgment. They argue that Alvarenga cannot establish any fact or produce any evidence that the defendants committed any act or omission that would support the plaintiff's causes of action against the defendants. However, the judge finds that this evidence does not negate the possibility that Alvarenga could present evidence supporting his claim that Arevalo was negligent and that Arevalo's negligence caused or contributed to the accident.

The judge orders the moving parties to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days. The case is set for trial on April 3, 2025.
