On
January 21, 2022, Plaintiff Jose Rodriguez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Byambadorj Tsendayush, Uber Technologies, Raiser LLC, Raiser-CA LLC,
and Does 1-50 for negligence. 
On
October 2, 2023, Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc. (erroneously sued as Uber
Technologies), Rasier, LLC (erroneously sued as Raiser LLC), and Rasier-CA, LLC
(erroneously sued as Raiser-CA LLC) (collectively, “Uber”) filed an answer. 
On
October 4, 2023, Defendant Byambadorj Tsendayush filed an answer. 
On
October 9, 2024, Uber filed a motion to deem admitted the truth of matters
specified in requests for admission, set three, served on Plaintiff.  The motion was set for hearing on January 3,
2025.  On November 5, 2024, Plaintiff

PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Uber
asks the Court to deem admitted the truth of matters specified in requests for
admission, set three, served on Plaintiff and impose sanctions on Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)  
DISCUSSION 
On August
12, 2024, Uber served requests for admission, set three,
on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not serve timely
responses and had not served responses by the time Uber filed this motion.  Uber asks the Court to deem admitted the
truth of matters specified in the requests for admission. 
Plaintiff
opposes the motion, stating that he served verified objection-free responses on
October 17, 2024. 
The
Court denies the motion to deem admitted the truth of matters specified in the
requests for admission.  (See Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  
Sanctions
are mandatory.  (See Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Uber requests $1,800.00
in sanctions based on 4.25 hours of attorney time at a rate of $300.00 per
hour and .5 hours of attorney time at a rate of $575.00 per hour.  The attorney with the $300.00 per hour
billing rate spent four hours to prepare the moving papers and .25 hours
attempting to meet and confer and anticipated spending one hour to attend the
hearing.  The attorney with the $575.00 billing
rate spent .5 hours reviewing the motion prior to filing. 
The
Court awards Uber $500.00 in sanctions based on two hours of attorney time at a
reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES the motion of Defendants Uber
Technologies, Inc. (erroneously sued as Uber Technologies), Rasier, LLC
(erroneously sued as Raiser LLC), and Rasier-CA, LLC (erroneously sued as
Raiser-CA LLC) to deem admitted the truth of matters specified in requests for
admission, set three, served on Plaintiff Jose Rodriguez. 
The Court GRANTS in part the request for sanctions of
Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc. (erroneously sued as Uber Technologies),
Rasier, LLC (erroneously sued as Raiser LLC), and Rasier-CA, LLC (erroneously
sued as Raiser-CA LLC) and orders Plaintiff Jose Rodriguez and his counsel to
pay Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier, LLC, and Rasier-CA, LLC $500.00
by February 3, 2025. 
Moving parties are ordered to give notice of this
ruling. 
Moving parties are ordered to file the proof of
service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
