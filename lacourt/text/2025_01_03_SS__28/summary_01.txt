And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to undergo independent medical examinations by three specialists. The defendant sought to examine the plaintiff about their alleged sexual dysfunction and mental suffering, but the judge ruled that the motion was filed after the deadline for hearing discovery motions had expired. The judge also noted that the defendant had not shown that it had acted diligently and that the examinations were not necessary. The judge cited relevant California laws and precedents, including Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310 and Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568.
