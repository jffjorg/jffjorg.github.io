The judge has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Daniel Neman, filed a complaint against La Mesa Restaurant and Lounge and others for general negligence and intentional tort. La Mesa filed an answer and later sought leave to file a cross-complaint against Power House Security LLC. The judge has reviewed the relevant California Code of Civil Procedure sections and determined that La Mesa's motion should be granted. The judge finds that the cross-complaint is transactionally related to the main action and that La Mesa has not filed its motion in bad faith. Therefore, the judge grants La Mesa's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Power House Security LLC and orders La Mesa to file and serve the cross-complaint within 30 days of the hearing.
