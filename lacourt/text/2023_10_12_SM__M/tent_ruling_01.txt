for Attorneys’ Fees

Legal
Standard
 
With respect to attorney fees and costs,
unless they are specifically provided for by statute (e.g., CCP §§ 1032, et
seq.), the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law
is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties.¿(CCP § 1021.) The
prevailing party on a contract, which specifically provides for attorney fees
and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is entitled to reasonable attorney
fees in addition to other costs.¿(Civ. Code § 1717(a); CCP §§ 1032, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).)¿The
court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing party
and shall fix, as an element of the costs of suit, the reasonable attorney
fees.¿(Civ. Code § 1717(a), (b).)¿Any notice of motion to claim attorney fees
as an element of costs under shall be served and filed before or at the same
time the memorandum of costs is served and filed; if only attorney fees are
claimed as costs, the notice of motion shall be served and filed within the
time specified in CRC 3.1700 for filing a memorandum of costs.¿(CRC 3.1702; Gunlock
Corp. v. Walk on Water, Inc. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303, fn. 1.) 
 
“It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]” (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily
“begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson
Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A] computation of time
spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a
determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin v. Reg’l
Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing
factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].) Such an approach anchors
the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the
attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id.
at 48, fn. 23.) The factors considered in determining the modification of the
lodestar include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) 
 
In challenging attorney fees as excessive
because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging
party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and
citations to the evidence.¿(Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)¿General
arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice. (Ibid.) 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff requests attorneys’ fees
of $19,570.00. There is no dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing
party in this action. Further, there is no dispute that Plaintiff is entitled
to contractual attorneys’ fees. This action relates to a breach of a lease
agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant. (See Ex. B.) In paragraph 36 of the
Lease, it stated that in the event of a lawsuit regarding enforcement of the
lease agreement, the parties agree the losing party shall pay to the prevailing
party its costs and attorney’s fees.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel claims 52.2
hours spent pursuing this action at rates of $450.00 and $350.00 per hour. (See
Nussbaum Decl., Ex. C.) Nussbaum performed 13.7 hours of work in this matter at
$450 per hour. Uss performed 1.2 hours of work in this matter at $350 per hour.
Stillman performed 29 hours of work in this matter at $350 per hour. Gina
Nalbandian spent 3.5 hours at $350 per hour. Nussbaum anticipates an additional
5.5 hours of work to respond to any opposition to this motion, and appear for the
hearing on the motion.
 
Defendant objects to the hourly
rates. Plaintiff asserts that all counsel has extensive experience as attorneys
specializing in real estate litigation. However, Defendant correctly notes that
there is no substantive evidence of counsel’s experience or qualifications. Counsel
merely concludes that their rates are “commensurate with reasonable hourly
rates prevailing in the Los Angeles area for attorneys with similar experience
and qualifications.” (Nussbaum Decl., ¶ 3; Stillman Decl., ¶ 3; Uss Decl., ¶
3.) No further statement is made on the subject, such as counsels’ experience
or education. In fact, Gina Nalbandian does not even provide a conclusory
declaration to justify her claimed rate. 
 
The Court requires substantive
evidence of counsels’ experience and education in order to conclude that the
claimed hourly
rates are reasonable.  
 
Accordingly, the motion is CONTINUED to
