Meta Platforms Inc. objected to the subpoena on multiple grounds, including that Plaintiff must direct the request to the user (Defendant), that the subpoena is overly broad, unduly burdensome, vague, or not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and that the information is protected attorney-client or other applicable privilege, or confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information. The Judge has denied the motion, citing the lack of a separate statement and the ability to acquire the same information from the Defendant.
