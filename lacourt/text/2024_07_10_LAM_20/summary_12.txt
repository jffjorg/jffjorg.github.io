And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by plaintiff Terrance Marshall, a pro per litigant, seeking leave to file a third amended complaint against multiple defendants. The plaintiff claims that the defendants committed various acts of fraud, perjury, and harassment. The court has previously granted the plaintiff leave to file a second amended complaint, and now allows the plaintiff to file a third amended complaint. The court instructs the plaintiff to file the new complaint within 10 days and to incorporate any changes into the second amended complaint. The judge also notes that counsel are strongly encouraged to submit on the tentative ruling rather than appearing in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
