And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion for summary judgment/adjudication filed by the defendants and has denied the motion. The defendants argued that the declaratory relief, contract, injunction, and Civil Code Section 4775 claims fail because Plaintiff cannot establish that Valleyheart has not properly discharged its duties, and that the alleged damages are insufficient to support the claims. The defendants also argued that the IIED claim fails because Plaintiff does not allege extreme and outrageous conduct.

The Court found that there are factual disputes on these claims, particularly as to whether the defendants intentionally exposed the Plaintiff to toxic chemicals and delayed repairs to vex and harass him. The Court also found that the Plaintiff's claims for age, religious, and disability discrimination are supported by some evidence, despite the defendants' arguments to the contrary.

The Court granted the motion as to the battery and negligence claims, finding that there are factual disputes as to causation and damages. The motion was denied as to the remaining claims, and the parties are ordered to give notice.

The Court encourages counsel to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
