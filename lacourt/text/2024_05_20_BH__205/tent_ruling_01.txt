Bluestone Lane Coffee  CASE NUMBER:  22SMCV01778  COMP. FILED: October 7, 2022    PROCEEDINGS:  REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY:  Carmen Aguilar  RESPONDING PARTY: Bluestone Lane Coffee   This is a personal injury case.  Plaintiff Carmen Aguilar was struck on the head by an outdoor umbrella belonging to Defendant Bluestone Lane Coffee.  The incident caused serious injuries to Plaintiff’s head, neck and right shoulder.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and suffered post-traumatic headaches.   On October 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant.  The Complaint alleges two claims for general negligence and premises liability.  On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Statement of Damages, seeking (1) $1,000,000 for pain, suffering and inconvenience; (2) $500,000 for emotional distress; (3) $50,000 for medical expenses, and (4) $250,000 for future medical expenses.    Plaintiff personally served Defendant with the Complaint and Statement of Damages on December 1, 2022.  Defendant was obligated to respond.  Defendant did not do so.  Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of Defendant’s default, which was entered by the Clerk’s Office on March 11, 2024.    Plaintiff now seeks default judgment.  However, Plaintiff has not properly completed her proposed judgment (JUD 100).  Item 6 of the form is left blank.  Plaintiff seeks damages and costs but no amounts are stated for either.  Given the failure to properly complete the JUD 100 form, the Court denies without prejudice the request for entry of default judgment.     The Court sets an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for lack of default judgment on July 23, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
