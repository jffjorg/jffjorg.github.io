And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the request for entry of default judgment in the case of Carmen Aguilar v. Bluestone Lane Coffee. The plaintiff, Carmen Aguilar, was struck on the head by an outdoor umbrella belonging to the defendant and suffered serious injuries. The plaintiff filed a complaint and statement of damages, which included claims for general negligence and premises liability. The defendant failed to respond to the complaint and statement of damages, and the plaintiff successfully requested the entry of default. However, the plaintiff failed to properly complete the JUD 100 form, which is necessary for the court to enter a default judgment. As a result, the court denied the request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The court has set an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for lack of default judgment for July 23, 2024.
