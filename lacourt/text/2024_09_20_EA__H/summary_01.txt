And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on Jesse W Paz's claim of exemption to October 25, 2024. The hearing was originally scheduled for June 26, 2024, but was continued several times due to various notices issued by the court. However, the judge is unsure if Paz was properly notified of the September 20, 2024 hearing date, as there is no indication in the docket that Plaintiff's counsel provided notice as directed. As a result, the judge is continuing the hearing to ensure that all parties are properly notified.
