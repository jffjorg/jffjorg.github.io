  Case Number:  19PSCV00918    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2024    Dept:  H ORDER CONTINUING HEARING ON CLAIM OF EXEMPTION
The Hearing on Defendant/Judgment
Debtor Jesse W Paz’s Claim of Exemption is CONTINUED to October 25, 2024, at
9:00 a.m.
In October 2019, Plaintiff National Collegiate Student Loan Trust 2007-3 (“Plaintiff”) initiated this student loans collection case by filing a
complaint, asserting a cause of action against Jesse W. Paz (“Paz”), Joan M.
Wiederholt (“Wiederholt”), and Does 1-15 for breach of contract.On
February 3, 2020, Plaintiff dismissed Wiederholt, without prejudice. On
September 9, 2020, the Clerk entered default against Paz. On February 16, 2021,
the Court entered default judgment. On April 2, 2024, a writ of execution was issued.On
June 10, 2024, Paz filed a claim of exemption. Plaintiff opposes the Claim of
Exemption. A hearing was originally scheduled for June 26, 2024, pursuant to a
“Notice of Hearing on Claim of Exemption” filed (and served via mail) on May
31, 2024 by Plaintiff’s counsel. On
June 10, 2024, the Court issued a “Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and
Order,” wherein the June 26, 2024 scheduled hearing was continued to July 29,
2024; notice was given to Plaintiff’s counsel only. On June 11, 2024, the Court
issued another “Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order,” wherein the July
29, 2024 scheduled hearing was continued to August 6, 2024; notice was given to
Plaintiff’s counsel only. On July 26, 2024, the Court issued another “Notice
Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order,” wherein the August 6, 2024 scheduled
hearing was continued to September 20, 2024; notice was given to Plaintiff’s
counsel only. Each of these notices directed Plaintiff’s counsel to “give
notice by mail forthwith [of the rescheduled hearing date] to all parties and
to file proof of service of such notice forthwith.” On August 5, 2024, this
case was transferred from Department K to Department H, located at Pomona
Courthouse South.The Court has reviewed the docket in
this case, and there is no indication that Plaintiff’s counsel has provided
notice of the September 20, 2024 hearing date, in compliance with the Court’s
July 26, 2024 directive. Because it is not clear to the Court whether Paz has
been provided notice of the September 20, 2024 hearing, the Court will continue
the hearing to October 25, 2024, at 9:00 a.m., in Department H
at Pomona Courthouse South, 400 Civic Center Plaza, Pomona, California 91766.Counsel
for Judgment Creditor is to provide notice and file a proof of service forthwith.
