Restocrete, Inc. et al. 
Defendant Restocrete, Inc.’s
Demurrer with Motion to Strike.
 
BACKGROUND  
            This
motion arises out of the negligent breach of contract and fraud claim. 
            Plaintiff
Edward Melnick alleges that defendants RestoCrete, Inc (RestoCrete) and
Mauricio Marenco breached their contract and committed fraudulent business
practices.  
            Plaintiff
alleges six causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Violation of Business and
Profession code section 17200; (4) Misrepresentation; (5) Negligence; and (6)
Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
            RestoCrete
demurs to the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Cause of Action. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Demurrer
As
a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  “A demurrer
tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.”  (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs.
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.)  As
such, the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or
implied factual allegations.  (Id.)
 The only issue a demurrer is concerned
with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)
Where
a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d
335, 348.)  The burden is on the
plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC
(2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.)  However,
“[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good
cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.”  (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Motion to Strike
A
court may strike any “¿irrelevant, false or improper matter¿inserted in any
pleading¿” or any part of a pleading “¿not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.¿” (¿Code Civ.
Proc., § 436¿.) “¿The grounds for a motion to strike shall appear on the face
of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is required to
take judicial notice.¿” (¿Code Civ. Proc., § 437¿.)¿ 
 
DISCUSSION
Demurrer
            RestoCrete,
Inc demurs to the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Cause of Action on the
grounds that Plaintiff fails to state sufficient facts and is too uncertain to
constitute a cause of action.  
Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing – Second Cause of Action
            The
elements of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing are (1) the
existence of a contractual relationship; (2) an implied duty; (3) breach; and
(4) causation of damages.  (Smith v.
San Francisco (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d
38, 49.)  RestoCrete demurs on the basis
that Plaintiff does not allege a sufficient cause of action because Plaintiff
fails to allege that (1) all conditions required for performance were met, (2) RestoCrete
interfered with Plaintiff’s right to receive benefits, and (3) the cause of
action for breach of implied covenant of good faith does not rise to a separate
cause of action from the breach of contract. 
            Plaintiff
alleges that (1) RestoCrete and Plaintiff entered into a contract to supply and
install polished concrete flooring, including a warranty that the floor would
be free of material defects.  (Complaint,
¶ 10-11.)  The parties entered into a
written contract, but RestoCrete failed to provide Plaintiff with a fully
executed copy.  (Complaint ¶ 12.) (2) RestoCrete
warrantied that the flooring would be free of defects.  (Complaint, ¶ 11.)  (3) Plaintiff paid RestoCrete a portion
upfront for the services, and made an additional payment when services were
complete.  (Complaint, ¶ 13-14.)  About six months after installation,
Plaintiff noticed defects.  (Complaint, ¶
15-17.) An inspection discovered the cause of the defect was “improper
preparation, curing and/or water content in the mixture of materials during
installation.  (Complaint, ¶ 18.)  After being notified of the breach of
contract, RestoCrete failed to remedy the defect.  (Complaint, ¶ 44.)  (4) Defendant suffered damages.  (Complaint, ¶ 26.)
            Plaintiff’s
allegations are sufficiently certain to allege a cause of action.
            In
its reply, RestoCrete raises a new argument that the Second Causes of Action is
barred by the economic loss doctrine. 
The court declines to consider this new argument. 
The
Court overrules the demurrer to the second cause of action. 
            Violation
of the Business and Professions Code section 17200 – Third Cause of Action
            There
are three prongs to Business and Professions Code section 17200.  Plaintiff alleges the unfair business
practices prong. 
            The
elements of an unfair business practice are (1) a business practice, (2) that
is unfair, unlawful or fraudulent, and (3) an authorized remedy.  (Bus. &
Prof. Code § 17200.)  
            Plaintiff
alleges that (1) defendant failed to properly and professionally do the work
contracted for, failed to investigate the defective work, and failed to repair,
remedy or refund the damaged flooring. 
(Complaint, ¶ 50.)  (2) This was a
pattern of unfair and deceptive business practices.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 49, 51.)  The fraud is evidenced by the provision of
the warranty and failure to remedy the issue. 
(Complaint, ¶¶ 11, 44.)
            Plaintiff
has sufficiently pleaded the second cause of action; therefore, the Court
overrules the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action.
            Misrepresentation
– Fourth Cause of Action
            The
elements of misrepresentation are (1) assertion of an untrue fact; (2) believed
by defendant to be true; (3) lack of reasonable grounds for the belief; (4)
defendant’s intent to induce plaintiff’s reliance upon the representation; (5)
plaintiff’s justifiable reliance upon the representation; and (6) resulting
damage.  (Melican v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 168, 182.)  
            Plaintiff
pleads (1) RestoCrete asserted that it would provide quality service and that
the defects Plaintiff noticed were “normal and temporary.”  (Complaint, ¶ 55.)  (2) Plaintiff believed these
misrepresentations.  (Complaint, ¶
55.)  (3) RestoCrete was informed of the
defect in the installation process and continued to assert that the issue was
with Plaintiff.  (Complaint, ¶ 19.)  (4) RestoCrete intended to induce Plaintiff
to pay for its services.  (Complaint, ¶
55.)  (5) Plaintiff relief on these
assurances when Plaintiff purchased Restocrete’s services.  (Complaint, ¶ 55.)  (6) Plaintiff was damaged.  (Complaint, ¶ 58.)  
            Plaintiff
pleads both intentional and negligent misrepresentation in the complaint.  The elements of fraudulent misrepresentation
are (1) misrepresentation; (2) knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to defraud
(induce reliance); (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage.  (Conroy v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1244, 1255.)  Fraudulent misrepresentation must be pleaded
with heightened specificity.  (Hills Transportation Co. v. Southwest Forest
Ind., Inc. (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 702, 707.) 
Fraud must plead facts as to “how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means.”  (Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73.)  
            Plaintiff alleges that RestoCrete made
written and verbal representations, including a quality warranty.  (Complaint, ¶ 11.)  These representations occurred on July 16,
2018, August 9, 2018, and March 1, 2020. 
(Complaint, ¶¶ 11, 12, 15.) 
Representations were made to Plaintiff directly.  (Complaint, ¶ 11.)  This meets the heightened pleading
requirement. 
            Therefore, the Court overrules
demurer to the Fourth Cause of Action. 
            Negligence
– Fifth Cause of Action 
            The Statute of Limitations for
negligence is 3 years.  The complaint alleges that the work was
completed around November 11, 2019. 
(Complaint, ¶ 14.)  Plaintiff
discovered that the flooring was installed defectively sometime after March 1,
2020.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 15, 18.)  Plaintiff filed the complaint on November 07,
2024.  Plaintiff fails to allege that the
discovery rule applies, the date of discovery, or that the statute of
limitations has tolled. 
            The Court sustains the
demurrer with leave to amend. 
            Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress – Sixth Cause of Action
            The
elements of negligent infliction of emotional distress are (1) a legal duty to
use due care; (2) breach of that duty; (3) damage or injury; and (4) causation.  (Huggins v. Longs Drug Stores California, Inc. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 124, 129.)
            Like
the Fifth Cause of Action, the Sixth Cause of Action fails under the statute of
limitations.  Therefore, the Court
sustains the demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action with leave to amend.
Motion to Strike
            RestoCrete
requests the Court strike three sections requesting punitive damages and a
prayer for pre- and post- judgement interest. 
Because the Court overrules the demurrer to the cause of action for
fraud, the Court denies the motion to strike the demand for punitive damages in
the Second Cause of Action and the Prayer for Relief.  The Court sustained the demurer to the Sixth
Cause of Action, therefore, the motion to strike is moot.  
            In
a cause of action alleging oppression, fraud or malice, pre-judgment interest
does not require “presence of previously determinate damages.”  (Greenfield v. Insurance Inc. (1971)
19 Cal.App.3d 803, 813.)  Therefore, the
Court denies the motion to strike. 
 
CONCLUSION
            The
Court sustains in part and overrules in part Defendant’s Demurrer.  The Court sustains the demurrer to the Fifth
and Sixth Causes of Action with leave to amend. 
The Court overrules the demurrer to the remaining causes of action.  
            The
Court denies the Motion to Strike. 
            Defendant
to give notice.
