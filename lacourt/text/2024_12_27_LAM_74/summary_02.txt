And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Restocrete, Inc. to the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action. The court finds that the demurrer to the second cause of action (implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing) is without merit and overrules it. The court also finds that the demurrer to the third cause of action (violation of the Business and Professions Code section 17200) is without merit and overrules it.

The court sustains the demurrer to the fifth cause of action (negligence) because the plaintiff failed to plead the discovery rule or tolling of the statute of limitations. The court sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action (negligent infliction of emotional distress) for the same reason.

The court denies the motion to strike the demand for punitive damages in the second cause of action and the prayer for pre- and post-judgment interest. The court also denies the motion to strike the request for punitive damages in the fifth cause of action.

The court gives notice to Restocrete, Inc. of the tentative ruling and invites any objections or further arguments.
