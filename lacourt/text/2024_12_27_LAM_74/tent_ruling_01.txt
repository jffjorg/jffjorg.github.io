  Case Number:  22STCV10967    Hearing Date:   December 27, 2024    Dept:  74 Edwards v.
The Estate of Francis Dudley et al. 
Defendant Fermin Santiago Toral’s Motion
to Expunge Lis Pendens
 
BACKGROUND  
            Plaintiff
Deanna C. Edwards (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendants the Estate
of Francis Dudley and Fermin Santiago Toral (Toral) to establish title in
residential real property located at 20950 Souder Street, Perris, California
92570 (the Property). 
            On
April 4, 2022, Plaintiff recorded a Lis Pendens based on her claim for quiet
title. 
            On
October 3, 2024, the Court granted Toral’s Motion for Summary Judgment.  On December 9, 2024, the Court entered
Judgment for Toral on the Quiet Title action. 
            On
October 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, which the Court of Appeal
dismissed on December 24, 2024. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
The
possible grounds for a motion to expunge a lis pendens include (1) that the
complaint does not contain a real property claim (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.31);
that plaintiff cannot establish the probable validity of the real property
claim by a preponderance of the evidence (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.32); (3) that
adequate relief can be secured to the claimant by the giving of an undertaking
(Code Civ. Proc., § 405.33); and (4) that there is a defect in the statutory
service and filing requirements.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.23).  
Unlike
most other motions, the party¿opposing¿the motion to expunge bears the burden
of proof.  The lis pendens claimant bears
the burden of establishing the existence of a “real property claim” that is
“probably valid.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
405.30, 405.32; Malcolm v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County (1981)
29 Cal.3d 518, 525-526, superseded by statute on other grounds.)  
 
DISCUSSION
            Toral
asks the Court to expunge Plaintiff’s Notice of Lis Pendens on the Property. On
December 9, 2024, the Court entered judgment for Toral on Plaintiff’s claim to
quiet title from which Plaintiff appealed. On December 24, 2024, the Court of
Appeal dismissed the appeal. A “trial court must grant the motion [to expunge]
unless it finds it more likely than not that the appellate court will reverse
the judgment.”  (Amalgamated Bank v.
Superior Court (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1003, 1015.)  Here, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition
to the motion to expunge and the Court does not know of any reason the Court of
Appeal will reverse the judgment. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion. 
            The
court finds that Toral is the prevailing party on his motion and is entitled to
an award of his reasonable attorney’s fees and costs in making the motion.
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 405.38.) The Court further finds that the requested
amount for attorney’s fees ($3,210.00) is reasonable.  (Coe Decl., ¶ 8.)
 
CONCLUSION
            The
Court grants Defendant’s Motion to Expunge the Lis Pendens on the real property
located at 20950 Souder Street, Perris, California 92570.  The Court awards $3,210.00 in attorney’s
fees.
