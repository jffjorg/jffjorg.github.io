[1] Ultimate facts are those “constituting the cause of
action” or those upon which liability depends, e.g., duty of care, breach of
the duty and causation (damages).  (See
Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “To survive a
demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff's proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872 [at pleading stage, plaintiff need
not specify which of the defendant’s employees committed negligent acts or
omissions].)
 
“[T]he term ultimate fact generally refers to a core
fact, such as an essential element of a claim. Ultimate facts are distinguished
from evidentiary facts and from legal conclusions.”  (Central Valley General Hosp. v. Smith
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 501, 513 [cleaned up]; see also Rodriguez v. Parivar,
Inc. (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 739, 750–751 [“The elements of a cause of action
constitute the essential or ultimate facts in a civil case”].)
