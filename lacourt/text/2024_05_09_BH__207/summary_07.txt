And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge grants Katherine Taylor Kahn's motion to set aside the judgment entered against her on January 30, 2024. Kahn claims that she vacated the subject property in April 2023 and did not receive notice of the lawsuit or the judgment. She also alleges that the judgment was entered against her without her knowledge or consent, and that she did not sign the motion to quash or answer filed in her name. The Judge finds that Kahn's allegations are credible and grants her motion to set aside the judgment. The Judge also strikes all pleadings filed by Kahn before the entry of judgment and orders her to answer the complaint on or before May 23, 2024.
