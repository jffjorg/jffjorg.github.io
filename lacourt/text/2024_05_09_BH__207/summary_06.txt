And here is the English text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court's preliminary consideration of the issue of ultimate facts in a civil case reveals that ultimate facts are those core facts that constitute the essential elements of a claim. In contrast, evidentiary facts are distinguished from ultimate facts, as are legal conclusions. The Court notes that the pleading stage of a lawsuit does not require the specification of which employees of the defendant committed negligent acts or omissions. The Court's consideration of this issue is guided by precedents such as Doe v. City of Los Angeles, C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist., and Rodriguez v. Parivar, Inc.
