```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled in favor of Bank of Utah's motion to quash service of summons. The court finds that the service of summons on Bank of Utah was defective, as it did not comply with California Code of Civil Procedure section 474. The court also finds that it lacks personal jurisdiction over Bank of Utah, as it does not have sufficient contacts with California to establish either general or specific jurisdiction.

The court notes that Bank of Utah's contacts with California are limited to maintaining an office in Los Angeles, providing trustee services to Reliant, and issuing small loans in Utah collateralized by assets in California. These contacts are insufficient to establish general jurisdiction, as they are not continuous and substantial.

Furthermore, the court finds that Bank of Utah did not purposefully avail itself of California laws or the California forum, and therefore, the court does not have specific jurisdiction over Bank of Utah. The court notes that the claims alleged by the plaintiff arise from a breach of fiduciary duty, which sounds in tort, and not contract.

Finally, the court denies the plaintiff's request for leave to conduct jurisdictional discovery, as the plaintiff must first cure the defects identified in the service of summons.
