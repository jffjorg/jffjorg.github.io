[1] Plaintiff refers to the Declaration of Rebecca Skolnick but failed to file the declaration with the court. [2] In Plaintiff’s supplemental brief, Plaintiff adds several new issues:  Defendants lack of a contractor’s license and Mr. Kazem Moghim’s (owner of the Neighbor’s Property) allegedly aggressive conduct.  While these may be potentially relevant to some issue, these are detours from the relevant issue: whether Defendants destroyed evidence.  For the reasons stated herein, the court finds that Plaintiff does not make an initial prima facie showing of spoliation.[3] In its reply, Plaintiff indicates that Defendants now deny the Neighbor’s Property encroaches on Plaintiff’s Property.
