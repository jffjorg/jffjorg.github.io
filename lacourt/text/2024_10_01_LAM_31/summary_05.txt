And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering the discovery plan submitted by the plaintiffs in the case of Howard Scott Jordan II and FlightHelp v. Irina Ioana Ciochiu, Ion Ciochiu, and Wynn Capital Management SRL. The plaintiffs are seeking jurisdictional discovery to establish Wynn's "nerve center" in Los Angeles and to prove Wynn's continuous and systematic contacts with California.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiffs' discovery plan is overbroad and has restricted the number of written discovery requests to Wynn and Irina to 25 Requests for Admission, 25 Special Interrogatories, and 20 Requests for Production of Documents. The judge has also deferred its ruling on the depositions pending the defendants' responses to written discovery.

The judge has set a status conference for December 2, 2024, to resolve any disputes regarding the discovery plan. The court has also continued the hearing on Wynn's motion to quash service of summons to December 2, 2024.

The judge's ruling is based on the court's finding that the plaintiffs' discovery plan is overbroad and that they failed to attach drafts of the proposed subpoenas to Doe Defendants for the court's review. The judge has also stated that alleging alter-ego does not throw open wide the door for jurisdictional discovery.
