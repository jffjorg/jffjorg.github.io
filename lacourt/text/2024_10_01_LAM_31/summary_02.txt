And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions and injunctive relief against the defendants, AKBH LLC and Urbino Construction, Inc. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendants destroyed evidence of an alleged encroachment onto the plaintiff's property, making it impossible for the plaintiff to prove the encroachment. The judge ruled that the defendants did not destroy the evidence, as the wall in question is still intact and can be examined by an expert to determine whether it is encroaching on the plaintiff's property. The judge also noted that the plaintiff did not meet its burden of showing that the defendants' actions had a substantial probability of damaging the plaintiff's ability to establish an essential element of its claim.
