Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Kerry Bensinger has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Fred Goldstein v. Joshua Driskell, et al. (Case No. 22STCV25084). The case involves a legal malpractice action, where Plaintiff Fred Goldstein alleges that the Defendants, Joshua Driskell, Primuth Driskell & Terzian LLP, and Lagerlof LLP, failed to properly represent him in a probate action filed in November 2018.

The Defendants demurred to the Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint, and the Court overruled the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action. The Court sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action without leave to amend.

The Plaintiff then filed a demurrer and motion to strike all affirmative defenses asserted in the Defendants' First Amended Answer. The Court sustained the Plaintiff's demurrer to the Defendants' affirmative defenses nos. 1-6, 8-20, and 22-27, and overruled as to affirmative defenses nos. 7 and 21. The Plaintiff's motion to strike was deemed moot, and the Defendants were granted leave to amend.

The Defendants filed their Second Amended Answer, and the Plaintiff filed a demurrer to the Second Amended Answer. The Court has now issued a tentative ruling, holding that the Plaintiff's demurrer is overruled, and the Defendants' affirmative defenses are sufficient.

The Court has also held that the Defendants have alleged new facts in support of each at-issue defense, and that the Plaintiff has been apprised of the basis for the Defendants' affirmative defenses. The case is set for a trial date of August 11, 2025.
