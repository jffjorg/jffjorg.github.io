 Case Number:  22STCV25084    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  31 Tentative Ruling   Judge Kerry Bensinger, Department 31   HEARING DATE: October 1, 2024   TRIAL DATE:   August 11, 2025  CASE:   Fred Goldstein v. Joshua Driskell, et al.  CASE NO.:    22STCV25084    DEMURRER WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Fred Goldstein   RESPONDING PARTY:  Defendants Joshua Driskell, et al.   I. INTRODUCTION   This is a legal malpractice action.  Plaintiff, Fred Goldstein, a self-represented litigant, alleges that he retained Defendants, Joshua Driskell, Primuth Driskell & Terzian LLP, and Lagerlof LLP, in November 2018 to represent Plaintiff in the underlying probate action filed as 18STPB11264 in the County of Los Angeles.    On July 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Third Amended Complaint (TAC) alleging causes of action for (1) Legal Malpractice/Negligence, (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duties, (3) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and (4) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.  Defendants demurred to the TAC.  On February 9, 2024, the court overruled Defendants’ demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action, and sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action without leave to amend.  On February 14, 2024, Defendants filed their Answer to the TAC.  On February 26, 2024, Defendants filed their First Amended Answer.  The First Amended Answer asserts a general denial and 27 affirmative defenses.  On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a demurrer and motion to strike all affirmative defenses asserted in the First Amended Answer.    After hearing oral argument, the court took the demurrer and motion to strike under submission.  On May 12, 2024, the court issued its order sustaining Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendants’ Affirmative Defenses Nos. 1-6, 8-20, and 22-27, and overruling as to Affirmative Defenses Nos. 7 and 21.  Plaintiff’s motion to strike was deemed moot.  Defendants were granted leave to amend.   On May 31, 2024, Defendants filed their Second Amended Answer to the TAC.  On July 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Demurrer to the Second Amended Answer.1  Defendants filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied.  II. LEGAL STANDARD   A verified complaint must be denied positively or according to information and belief.¿ A general denial is effective to controvert all material allegations of an unverified complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (d).)¿ Anything less than a general denial of the whole complaint is a “qualified” or “specific” denial.¿ A defendant can direct his or her denials to specific sentences, paragraphs, of parts of the complaint.¿ Although not widely used, a defendant can also effectively deny allegations in the complaint by alleging contrary or inconsistent facts.¿¿ ¿ In addition to denials, the answer should contain any and all affirmative defenses or objections to the complaint that defendant may have, and that would otherwise not be in issue under a simple denial.¿ Such defenses or objections are “new matter.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (b).)¿ Generally, a defendant bears the burden of proving “new matter” and, as such, must be specifically pleaded in the answer.¿ (California Academy of Sciences v. County of Fresno (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1436, 1442.)¿ “The phrase ‘new matter’ refers to something relied on by a defendant which is not put in issue by the plaintiff.”¿ (Walsh v. West Valley Mission Community College District (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1546.)¿ Where the answer sets forth facts showing some essential allegation of the complaint is not true, such facts are not new matters but are denials.¿ (Ibid.)¿¿¿¿ ¿ The same pleading of “ultimate facts” rather than evidentiary matter or legal conclusions is required as in pleading a complaint.¿ The answer must aver facts as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of action and which are alleged in the complaint.¿ (FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 384.)¿ The various affirmative defenses must be separately stated and must refer to the causes of action to which they relate “in a manner by which they may be intelligently distinguished.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (g).)¿ Defenses must be pleaded in the nature of “yes, the allegations [of the complaint] are true, but . . .”¿ (FPI Development, Inc., supra, 231 Cal.App.3d at p. 383.)¿ In pleading the Statute of Limitations it is not necessary to state the facts showing the defense, but it may be stated generally that the cause of action is barred by the provisions of Section ____ (giving the number of the section and subdivision thereof, if it is so divided, relied upon) of The Code of Civil Procedure; and if such allegation be controverted, the party pleading must establish, on the trial, the facts showing that the cause of action is so barred.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 458.)¿  III.  DISCUSSION   Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ affirmative defenses nos. 1-6, 8-20, and 22-27 fail to state facts sufficient to constitute an affirmative defense.  The court disagrees.  Contrary to Plaintiff’s position, Defendants have cured the defects noted in the court’s previous order.  Defendants have alleged new facts in support of each at-issue defense.  (See Second Amended Answer, pp. 2:18-3:8 (First Affirmative Defense); 3:14-4:12 (Second Affirmative Defense); 4:21-5:17 (Third Affirmative Defense); 5:26-6:24 (Fourth Affirmative Defense); 7:2-10 (Fifth Affirmative Defense); 7:16-26 (Sixth Affirmative Defense); 8:13-9:14 (Eighth Affirmative Defense); 9:20-23 (Ninth Affirmative Defense); 10:2-22 (Tenth Affirmative Defense); 11:1-12:2 (Eleventh Affirmative Defense); 12:11-13:4 (Twelfth Affirmative Defense); 13:12-13:18 (Thirteenth Affirmative Defense); 13:24-14:25 (Fourteenth Affirmative Defense); 15:7-12 (Fifteenth Affirmative Defense); 15:18-16:18 (Sixteenth Affirmative Defense); 16:26-17:3 (Seventeenth Affirmative Defense); 17:10-18:10 (Eighteenth Affirmative Defense); 18:16-19:16 (Nineteenth Affirmative Defense); 19:22-20:22 (Twentieth Affirmative Defense); 21:5-8 (Twenty-Second Affirmative Defense); 21:15-18 (Twenty-Third Affirmative Defense); 21:27-22:3 (Twenty-Fourth Affirmative Defense); 22:9-13 (Twenty-Fifth Affirmative Defense); 22:19-25 (Twenty-Sixth Affirmative Defense); 23:6-24:6 (Twenty-Seventh Affirmative Defense).             “The office of pleadings is to outline the issues so that the parties may know what is involved in the litigation.”  (Fibreboard Paper Prod. Corp. v. E. Bay Union of Machinists, Loc. 1304, United Steelworkers of Am., AFL-CIO (1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 675, 708.) Here, Defendants have alleged sufficient facts to apprise Plaintiff of the basis for their affirmative defenses.                    VI. CONCLUSION  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.    Defendants to give notice, unless waived.    Dated:   October 1, 2024   ¿ ¿¿ ¿¿¿¿ ¿¿ ¿ Kerry Bensinger¿¿¿ ¿ Judge of the Superior Court¿¿ ¿
