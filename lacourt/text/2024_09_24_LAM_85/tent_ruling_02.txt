[2] Key requests judicial
notice of (1) the court's May 14, 2024 decision (RJN Ex. 1); (2) the judgment
entered on May 14, 2024 (RJN Ex. 2); (3) a notice of entry of judgment served by
HHCA’s counsel on May 30, 2024 (RJN Ex. 3); (4) a June 4, 2024 writ of execution
(RJN Ex. 4); (5) a notice of appeal filed on June 18, 2024 (RJN Ex. 5); (6) a notice
of involuntary lien and abstract of judgment (RJN Ex. 6); and (7) a notice of judgment
debtor exam (RJN Ex. 7).  
The notice of involuntary lien recorded with the Los
Angeles Registrar/Recorder’s Office (RJN Ex. 6) is subject to judicial notice
and the request is granted.  Evid. Code
§452(c).  The remaining requests for
judicial notice are denied.  There is no
need to judicially notice RJN Exhibits 1-2 and 5 because the court can always
view documents in the instant court file. 
Exhibits 3-4, and 7 are not in the court file and not subject to
judicial notice.


[3] In reply, Key cites Kaiser
Foundation Health Plan, Inc. v. Superior Court, (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th
1125 and UVVA-TWO LLC v. Impact Development Group, LLC, (“UVVA”) (2020)
48 Cal.App.5th 985.  Reply at
3-4.  While both cases cite section 1287.4,
it was only for purposes of stating a rule on whether the trial court’s
decision was appealable.  Kaiser
held that a trial court judgment confirming an interim arbitration award was
not appealable (13 Cal.App.5th at 1138-42) and UVVA held that the
judgment enforcing the arbitrator’s award was appealable (48 Cal.App.5th
at 1002).


[4] The HHCA explains that
section 1021 provides that “parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to
their costs, as hereinafter provided.” 
“Actions” and “proceedings” are the two classes of judicial remedies
available in courts of justice defined in sections 20 to 23.  An arbitration is neither.  McRae v. Superior Ct. for Los Angeles County,
(1963) 221 Cal. App. 2d 166, 170 (“the arbitration itself is not a ‘special
proceeding’ as contemplated by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. .
. Historically ‘an arbitration is a substitute for proceedings in court.’”). Section
1032(a)(4) similarly utilizes terminology associated with court actions and
special proceedings -- e.g., “party,” “plaintiff,” and “defendant”.  Opp. at 13.


[5] Once there is a judicial
proceeding such as confirmation of an arbitration award, “[t]he court shall
award costs upon any judicial proceeding under this title as provided in
Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 1021) of Title 14 of Part 2 of this
code.”  §1293.2.
