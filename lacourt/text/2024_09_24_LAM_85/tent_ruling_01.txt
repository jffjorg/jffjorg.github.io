  Case Number:  21STCP03001    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  85 
Sarah Key v. Hidden
Hills Community Association, et al, 21STCP03001 
Tentative decision on motion to enforce stay of judgment pending appeal:  denied



 
 
 
Petitioner Sarah Key (“Key”) moves to stay enforcement of the
judgment in favor of Respondent Hidden Hills Community Association (“HHCA”)
pending her appeal.
The court has read and considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of the Case
1. First Amended Petition 
Petitioner Key commenced this proceeding on September 13,
2021.  The operative pleading is the
First Amended Petition (“FAP”), filed on April 18, 2022, against the HHCA and
Land Mark Electric, Inc. (“Land Mark”) alleging claims for writ of mandate,
declaratory and injunctive relief.  The FAP
alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
Key is the owner of the real property located at 24835
Eldorado Meadow Road, Hidden Hills, California 91302 (“Key Property”) and a
member of the HHCA per Civil Code section 4160. 
FAP, ¶5.  The HHCA is a common
interest development subject to the Davis Stirling Common Interest Development
Act (“Davis-Stirling” or the “Act”) under Civil Code section 4800 et seq.  FAP, ¶6. 
As such, the HHCA is obligated to maintain and manage common areas and
separate interests that arise out of or related to the common interest
development.  FAP, ¶6. 
In July 2021, Land Mark submitted development plans to the HHCA
proposing to cut and fill 1,880 cubic yards of dirt to remove a hill on
property it owns at 5949 Spring Valley Road, Hidden Hills, California 91302
(“Land Mark Property”) and to construct a driveway across the strip of land
owned by Key (“Flag Strip”) without her consent.  FAP, ¶13. In January 2022, the HHCA’s
Architectural Committee provided input that it did not like Land Mark’s
plans.  FAP, ¶13.  Land Mark has represented in its pleadings and
declarations filed with the court that it plans to build driveways on the Key
Property to obtain access to Eldorado Meadow Road.  FAP, ¶14. 
Land Mark has represented to the court that it does not accept that Key
owns the Flag Strip between the Land Mark Property and Eldorado Meadow
Road.  FAP, ¶14.  Land Mark has never conceded that there is no
easement that would permit it to build structures and/or driveways on Key’s
land to get to Eldorado Meadow Road.  FAP,
¶14. 
The HHCA violated Davis-Stirling and engaged in unlawful
conduct in violation of Civil Code section 4205 by failing to inform Land Mark,
the owner of the Land Mark Property, that building any driveways or other
structures over the Flag Strip owned by Key to access Eldorado Meadow Road is
trespass in violation of the law and will not be permitted.  FAP, ¶11. 
On or around July 27, 2021, and August 6, 2021, Key made
demands for record inspection from the HHCA pursuant to Civil Code Sections
5200-5240 relating to the development project on the Land Mark Property.  FAP, ¶20. 
The HHCA failed and refused to provide the records requested.  FAP, ¶20. 
On or around August 13, 2021, the HHCA’s General Manager
Cary Brackett sent an email stating that the records requested were in the
google link provided.  FAP, ¶20.  None of the documents in the google link
related to the development project proposed for the Land Mark Property.  FAP, ¶20. 
The HHCA violated Davis-Stirling and engaged in unlawful
conduct in violation of Civil Code sections 4925(b) and 5000(b), and the
Governing Documents Bylaws section 7.8 by failing and refusing to permit Key
and other members of the HHCA to speak at architectural meetings.  FAP, ¶¶ 21-22. 
The HHCA violated Davis-Stirling and engaged in unlawful
conduct in violation of Civil Code section 4360 when it approved Amendments to
the Architectural Standards on October 27, 2021 (the “Amendments”) without
disclosing in writing the “purpose and effect” of the proposed grading
amendment in Section 10(f).  FAP, ¶23. 
The Southern California Gas Company (“SoCalGas”) has two
high pressure gas transmission pipelines running directly through the Key
Property and Land Mark Property.  FAP,
¶24.  At a meeting on February 16, 2021,
many members of the HHCA reported to the Board of Directors their safety
concerns regarding the SoCalGas pipelines. 
FAP, ¶52.  The HHCA’s Board
members voted to obtain experts to do a study independent of SoCalGas regarding
the public safety issues surrounding the two high pressure gas transmission.  FAP, ¶53. 
Key provided the HHCA Board with a list of three independent
high-pressure gas transmission pipeline experts with their resumes.  FAP, ¶53. 
On March 15, 2021, Key also provided the HHCA Board with more than ten
pages of safety and safety related issues pertaining to the SoCalGas
pipelines.  FAP, ¶53.  On March 16, 2021, the HHCA Board announced
at a meeting, without notice to the members and without an agenda item, that it
would not address any of the safety issues that it had begun investigating
relating to the SoCalGas pipelines.  FAP,
¶54. 
In 2021, SoCalGas sent Key a safety notice stating that it
needed clear access to the high-pressure lines to inspect, maintain, repair,
and/or replace the pipelines.  FAP,
¶59.  Land Mark obtained a letter from
SoCalGas regarding the safety protocols that must be followed with respect to
what development may be permitted in the vicinity of the SoCalGas pipelines.  FAP, ¶62. 
The HHCA’s Architectural Committee moved forward with the plans to
develop the Land Mark Property.  FAP,
¶62.  
Petitioner Key seeks a writ of mandamus and declaratory
relief commanding the HHCA, its Board of Directors, and its Architectural
Committee to (1) mandate that Architectural Standards require a permit
applicant to obtain a variance to excavate the hills and basements at Hidden
Hills; (2) refrain from declaring that a variance is not necessary for the
proposed development at the Land Mark Property to excavate, compact, and grade;
(3) observe the safety requirements set forth in the SoCalGas’ safety notice regarding
high pressure gas transmission pipelines and to comply with the safety
protocols of SoCalGas for any development at the Land Mark Property; (4) comply
with Civil Code sections 4925(b) and 5000(b) and the Governing Documents Bylaws
section 7.8 permitting Key and other members of the HHCA to speak for a
reasonable time at any meeting of the Architectural Committee; (5) comply with
the HHCA’s February 16, 2021 meeting minutes; (6) determine that the Amendments
are illegal; (7) and declare that Key owns the Flag Strip that borders the Land
Mark Property.  FAP, at 24-25. 
Petitioner Key also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief
against Land Mark that (1) declares Key owns the Flag Strip, (2) there is no
easement of any kind permitting Land Mark to build driveways or any other
structures across the Flag Strip owned by Key, (3) declares the non-exclusive
road easement is to the Hidden Hills Corporation, not the HHCA, (4) Land Mark
cannot traverse or build on the Flag Strip owned by Key without her prior
written permission, (5) Land Mark does not have permission to traverse or build
on the Flag Strip, and (6) Land Mark be ordered to remove its fencing from the
Key Property.  FAP, at 25-26.
 
2. Course of
Proceedings
            On
September 13, 2021, Key filed the Petition.
On April 14, 2022, the court granted the HHCA’s motion to
compel arbitration. 
            On
April 18, 2022, Key filed the FAP.
On May 14, 2024, the court entered judgment confirming the
arbitration award in favor of the HHCA for $278,606.81.
On June 18, 2024, Key filed a notice of appeal from the
judgment.
On August 2, 2024, the court heard and denied Key’s ex
parte application to stay enforcement of the judgment pending appeal.  
On August 7, 2024, the court heard
and denied Key’s ex parte application for the court to reconsider its stay
ruling.  The court ruled that Key failed to show an emergency justifying
ex parte relief and that she could make a noticed motion.
On August 26, 2024, Key filed the instant motion to stay enforcement
of judgment.  The HHCA timely filed its
opposition on September 11, 2024. 
 
B. Applicable Law
            An
appeal may be taken from a judgment, except an interlocutory judgment.  Code
of Civil Procedure[1]
§904.1(a)(1).  “[T]he perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the
trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters
embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or
order…”  §916(a).  “The purpose of the automatic stay provision of Section
916, subdivision (a) ‘is to protect the appellate court's jurisdiction by
preserving the status quo until the appeal is decided.  The [automatic stay] prevents the trial court
from rendering an appeal futile by altering the appealed judgment or order by
conducting other proceedings that may affect it.’”  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino,
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 189. 
            An
exception to the automatic stay is set forth in section 917.1(a), which
provides that money judgments are not stayed “unless an undertaking is given.”  The undertaking required to obtain a stay of
enforcement of a money judgment is one and one-half times the amount of the
judgment and is calculated based on the entire judgment, including
court-awarded costs. §917.1(b), (d). 
An exception within this exception is provided in section 917.1(d)
which states that “no undertaking shall be required pursuant to this section
solely for costs awarded under Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 1021) of
Title 14.”  “At the very least, the plain
language of section 917.1, subdivision (d), suggests that many attorney
fee awards can be part of a ‘costs-only’ judgment that need not be bonded to
stay an appeal.”  Quiles v. Parent,
(“Quiles”) (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 130, 140. Where a judgment debtor
appeals from a trial court’s order after judgment assessing costs and
attorney’s fees, it is not required to file an appeal bond to stay an execution
on the unpaid amounts so long as the appeal is limited to the order awarding
costs.  Ziello v. Superior Court, (“Ziello”) (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 651, 652.
            A
judgment entered on an arbitration award has the same "force and effect
as, and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment in a
civil action."  §1287.4; Wade v.
Shrader, (“Wade”) (2008) 168 Cal. App.4th 1039, 1045.
 
B. Statement of Facts
1. Key’s Evidence[2]
            Petitioner Key lives in and is the
sole owner of the real property located at 24835 Eldorado Meadow Road, Hidden
Hills, California 91302 ("Key Property").  Key Decl., ¶1.  Key is a member of the HHCA. Key Decl., ¶1.  After Key filed the notice of appeal, the HHCA
levied on Key’s bank accounts, recorded an involuntary lien clouding title to her
property, and attempted to serve her personally with process.  Key Decl., ¶2.  
            The
court's judgment was issued on May 14, 2024. Key Decl., ¶16. The abstract of judgment
was signed by HHCA’s attorney Johnny White, Esq. (“White”) on May 31, 2024.  Key Decl., ¶16. The abstract of judgment was
issued by a deputy clerk on May 31, 2024 and recorded against the title to the
Key Property on June 5, 2024.  Key Decl.,
¶16.  A notice of involuntary lien and
accompanying documents were mailed to Key on June 7, 2024. Key Decl., ¶16. 
Following the filing and service of Key’s notice of appeal
on June 18, 2024, the HHCA caused a notice of levy to be delivered to the Los
Angeles County Sheriff (“Sheriff”) for a levy on Key’s bank accounts.  Key Decl., ¶6.  On June 27, 2024, the Sheriff levied on Key’s
bank accounts, resulting in the seizure of $2,225.73 in one account and $252.03
in a second account. Key Decl., ¶6.  The
HHCA did not communicate to Key that it was seeking immediate payment of the
costs awarded and no one from the HHCA contacted Key or her attorney, William
B. Hanley, Esq. (“Hanley”), to request immediate payment.  Key Decl., ¶7. 
            On
July 18, 2024, a process server arrived at the Key Property. Key Decl., ¶15.
The Key Property is located within a gated community and the process server was
personally escorted by the HHCA’s private security, Covered-Six.  Key Decl., ¶15.
            On
July 21, 2024, Key received a “notice of levy” in the mail. Key Decl., ¶14. The
notice of levy stated that it was mailed on June 27, 2024. Key Decl., ¶14. The
following documents were included within the envelope: "Writ of Execution
(Money Judgment)"; "Exemptions from The Enforcement of
Judgments"; "Claim of Exemption (Enforcement Judgment)"; "FINANCIAL
STATEMENT (Wage Garnishment - Enforcement of Judgment); "CURRENT DOLLAR
AMOUNTS OF EXEMPTIONS FROM ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS Code of Civil Procedure
sections 7 703.140(b) and 704.010 et seq. EXEMPTIONS UNDER SECTION
703.140(b)". Key Decl., ¶14.
Key is concerned that the HHCA’s collection activities will
prevent her from paying her utilities, bills, buying groceries, and making
other necessary purchases.  Key Decl., ¶3.
The HHCA’s refusal to stop levying on Key’s bank accounts has caused her emotional
and financial distress. Key Decl., ¶5.  
 
            2.
The HHCA’s Evidence
            The
HHCA was awarded $206,351.25 in attorney fees and $48,464.28 in costs. White Decl.,
Ex. A.  On or around June 26, 2024, the
HHCA caused a levy to be served on Key’s Bank of America accounts. White Decl.,
¶4. In response to the levy, Bank of America transmitted $2,477.76 to the
Sheriff, which was later disbursed to the HHCA net of levying officer fees.  White Decl., ¶4.
            On
July 8, 2024, Key’s attorney wrote to the HHCA’s counsel, expressing her
position that enforcement of the judgment was stayed pending appeal without the
need for posting an undertaking, and threatening a motion if the HHCA did not
agree to withdraw its bank levy.  White Decl.,
Ex. C. The HHCA did not agree and invited Key to file her motion. White Decl.,
Ex. D. 
Over the next three weeks, the HHCA sent several
communications asking Key to obtain a hearing date before the debtor
examination so that her contention that enforcement was stayed could be
resolved before the examination. White Decl., Ex. D.  On July 23, 2024, Key’s attorney accepted
service of the order for her to appear at her examination on August 23, 2024,
subject to his reservation of rights and position that enforcement was stayed. White
Decl., Ex. D.

Analysis
Petitioner Key moves to stay enforcement of judgment in
favor of Respondent HHCA pending her appeal.
 
1. Reconsideration
Key’s motion is, in fact, a motion to reconsider the
court’s August 2, 2024 ruling denying Key’s ex parte application to stay
enforcement of the judgment pending appeal.  On August 7, 2024, the court heard
and denied Key’s ex parte application for the court to reconsider its stay
ruling.  Key’s argument was based on section 1287.4.  The court ruled that Key failed to show an
emergency justifying ex parte relief and that she could make a noticed motion.  As a result, on August 26, 2024, Key filed
the instant motion to stay enforcement of the judgment.  
HHCA argues that Key’s motion to reconsider does not meet
the requirements of section 1008(a) because it is not based on new or different
facts, circumstances, or law.  The motion’s
asserted ground is that the court raised a distinction between court costs and
arbitration costs for the first time at the August 2, 2024 hearing.  Hanley Decl., ¶3.  HHCA argues that it raised this very issue in
emails between counsel weeks earlier in July 2024.  White Decl., Ex. D.  The motion also was not filed within ten days
of the August 2 ruling.  Opp. at 16-18.
Reconsideration under section 1008(a) is a two-step
process.  The court first decides whether
it should reconsider.  If so, the court
reconsiders the merits of the decision. 
The court authorized Key to make a noticed motion and will not deny it
as non-compliant with section 1008(a).   See Reply at 7-8.
Thus, the court will reconsider its August 2 ruling and
address the merits of Key’s motion.  
 
2. Pertinent History
On December 14, 2023, the Arbitrator issued a final award
that dismissed all of Key’s claims and awarded the HHCA $254,815.53 in
attorneys’ fees and costs, including arbitrator fees. HHCA was awarded
$206,351.25 in attorney fees, which the Arbitrator found was reasonable and was
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation in part for the reasons
articulated in the HHCA fee motion.
The HHCA fee motion argued that the HHCA should be awarded
costs on all of Key’s claims, including her open meeting and record inspection
claims under Civil Code sections 4955 and 5235. 
Even though the right to costs for such claims is presumptively
unilateral in favor of the homeowner, an association may be awarded its costs
where “the court finds the action to be frivolous, unreasonable, or without
foundation.” Civil Code §§ 4955(b), 5235(c). 
The Association argued that Key’s open meeting and record inspection
claims were unreasonable and without foundation, and the Arbitrator agreed.   The Arbitrator also awarded HHCA $48,464.28
in costs, including court costs and JAMS fees.  White Decl., Ex. A, p. 7. 
On May 14, 2024, the
court denied Key’s motion to vacate and/or correct the arbitration award and
granted HHCA’s petition to confirm the arbitration award.  The court noted that the Arbitrator
interpreted Bylaws section 14.7 to permit an award of costs, including the cost
of the Arbitrator.  Hanley Decl., Ex. 20,
p. 9.  This contract interpretation may
not be overturned by the court.  Gueyffier
v. Ann Summers, Ltd., (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1179, 1182.  The Association’s fee reply, relied on by the
Arbitrator, argued that Key’s open meeting and record inspection claims (third
and fifth claims) were unreasonable and without foundation.  Hanley Decl., Ex. 20, pp. 7-8.  The Arbitrator adopted this reasoning, and
costs were properly awarded with respect to all of Key’s claims.
The court ruled that
the HHCA was entitled to a judgment in its favor confirming the arbitration
award, $254,815.53 in fees and costs awarded by the Arbitrator,
post-arbitration costs of $60 and attorney’s fees of $16,500, and
post-arbitration award, pre-judgment interest of 7% on the $254,815.53
awarded.  The resulting judgment was for
$278,606.81.  See RJN Ex. 2.
Key’s August 2, 2024 ex parte application for
a stay relied on Chapala Management Corp v. Stanton, (“Chapala”)
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1546, which held that an award of attorney fees to
a prevailing homeowner association defendant as a routine or incidental item of
costs awarded pursuant to contract or statute is a matter of right under
section 1032.  Such fees are awarded by a
trial court without discretion other than their reasonableness and cannot be
characterized as a judgment “directing the payment of money” under section
917.1(a).  As a result, an award of
attorney fees qualifies as an award solely for costs under section 917.1(d) and
no bond was required for the automatic stay of enforcement.  Id.
The court denied Key’s
ex parte application based on the HHCA’s argument that an arbitration award
has the status of a contract between the parties.  Law Finance Group,
LLC v. Key, (2023) 14 Cal. 5th 932, 946, n. 1; §1287.6.  The court did not award attorney fees; it
only confirmed the Arbitrator’s’ award, enforcing the contract.  As such,
the judgment is not an award of costs under 1032.  Additionally, Chapala
and other cases refer to routine or incidental costs that are automatically
stayed.  Arbitrator fees are not routine any more than expert witness fees
were in the California Supreme Court case of Bank of San Pedro v. Superior
Court, (1992) 3 Cal.4th 797, cited by Chapala. 
 
3. Merits
 Section 917.1(a)(1) provides that judgments for “money
or the payment of money” are not stayed on appeal “unless an undertaking is
given.”  An exception is provided in section
917.1(d) which states that “no undertaking shall be required pursuant to this
section solely for costs awarded under Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 1021)
of Title 14.”  Section 1032 concerning
costs awarded to a prevailing party is located in Chapter 6.
Key contends that the Arbitrator’s award was based on the
arbitration agreement in HHCA Bylaws section 14.7, which states that the
prevailing party in any arbitration proceeding or court action shall be awarded
its reasonable attorney fees and court costs. 
Mot. at 4-5.  The court’s judgment
confirmed the Arbitrator’s award of fees and costs.
Key argues that a judgment solely for attorney fees and
costs is not classified as a money judgment under section 917.1(a)(1) and falls
within the exception for a “costs only” judgment that does not require an
undertaking in section 917.1(d).  Quiles,
supra, 10 Cal.App.5th at 140.  Ziello, supra, 75
Cal.App.4th at 652.  Mot. at 3.
Key reiterates her point from the August 2 ex parte
application that a costs-only judgment is not subject to a bond.  Numerous cases have confirmed the automatic
stay of a judgment exclusively for attorney fees and costs because such a
judgment is not a money judgment within the meaning of section 917.1(a)(1),
including Chapala, Ziello, Quiles, Vadas v. Sosnowski,
(“Vadas”) (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 471, 475 (under sections 917.l(d) and
917.9(a)(3), a judgment for "routine costs" alone -- i.e.,
ordinary costs of suit pursuant to sections 1032 and 1033.5 -- is automatically
stayed when an appeal is perfected without the necessity of posting a bond); Nielsen
v. Stumbos, (“Nielsen”) (1990) 226 Cal. App 3d 301, 305 (judgment
awarding only contractual attorney fees is deemed a judgment for "routine
costs" stayed automatically on appeal). Mot. at 8; Reply at 2, 5.
In Bank of San Pedro v. Superior Ct., supra, 3
Cal. 4th at 800–01, the California Supreme Court explained that “[c]osts of
suit are awarded to the prevailing party in nearly every civil action or
proceeding. . . [I]f a judgment for costs awarded under section 1032 were a
money judgment within the meaning of section 917.1, virtually every judgment
would be within the scope of section 917.1 . . . The exception in section 917.1
to the automatic stay provision of section 916 . . . would subsume the general
rule.”
In Chapala, a homeowner’s association prayed for
recovery of attorney fees pursuant to statute and contract.  186 Cal. App. 4th at 1546.  The court concluded that the association's
judgment for attorney fees was automatically stayed pending any appeal on
grounds that attorney fees are awarded as a routine or incidental item of costs
as a matter of right to the prevailing party. Id.  Chapala held that, in a suit to
enforce an architectural restriction, the statutory attorney fee award to a
condominium association under former Civil Code 1354(f) was part of a routine
cost award under sections 1032 and 1033.5. 
It was not a money judgment; it was a judgment for costs that includes
attorney fees and therefore stayed under section 917.l(d). Id.   
Key distinguishes the court’s August 2 ruling that the
Arbitrator’s award was a contract between the parties, and that the court’s
judgment merely enforced that contract, by relying on section 1287.4, which
provides that a judgment entered on an arbitration award has the same
"force and effect as, and is subject to all the provisions of law relating
to, a judgment in a civil action."  Wade,
supra, 168 Cal. App.4th at 1045.  Wade
states: "Once an arbitration award obtained in the course of contractual
arbitration has been reduced to judgment, the judgment has the same force and
effect as, and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment
in a civil action of the same jurisdictional classification; and it may be
enforced like any other judgment of the court in which it is entered, in an
action of the same jurisdictional classification." Id.  at 1045. 
Wade confirms that section 1287.4 "counsels that such a judgment
must be treated like any other judgment."  Id. at 1046. 
Key concludes that whether a judgment confirms an
arbitration award or is entered by a court is a distinction without a
difference.  Section 1287.4 and Wade
confirm that a judgment entered on an arbitration award is treated the same as
any court judgment.  Nielsen, Vadas,
Ziello, Quiles, and Chapala make clear that a
"take-nothing" judgement awarding only attorney fees and costs is
deemed a judgment for "routine costs" and is automatically stayed on
appeal.  The fact that the judgment
includes the enforcement of both Arbitrator and court-ordered costs and
attorney fees is a distinction without a difference since section 1287.4
confirms that a judgment entered on an arbitration award "is subject to
all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment in a civil action ...."
HHCA has violated Key's rights by continued execution on the judgment that was
automatically stayed by the notice of appeal on June 18, 2024.  Mot. at 9-10; Reply at 2-3.[3]
The California Supreme Court in Bank of San Pedro v.
Superior Court, (“Bank of San Pedro”) (1992) 3 Cal.4th
797, held that a costs-only judgment including expert witness fees awarded
under section 998 was not stayed pending appeal without an undertaking because
it was not routine or incidental to judgment.  
Id. at 803-05.  The court
reasoned that the basis of case law that appeal from a costs-only judgment
stays enforcement of judgment was based on a rational that costs are awarded in
every case.  Because section 998 costs
are not awarded in every case and a judgment directing the payment of expert
witness fees is, by any practical or semantic measure, a judgment directing the
payment of money, section 917.1(a)(1)’s undertaking requirement applied.  Id. at 804.
The HHCA notes (Opp. at 13) that the appellate court in Quiles
stated that the Legislature’s 1993 amendments to section 917.1 narrowed Bank
of San Pedro by expressly stating certain costs requiring an undertaking
for a stay on appeal and by codifying the costs-only judgment rule in section
917.1(d).  10 Cal.App.5th at
143-44.  The Quiles court stated
that these amendments made it possible for courts to simply determine whether
costs were awarded under sections 1021 to 1038 without reference to their
routine or incidental nature.  Id.
at 144.  The court hastened to add that
it was not disagreeing, and could not disagree, with Bank of San Pedro;
it merely concluded that much of the Supreme Court’s analysis was superseded by
the 1993 amendments.  Ibid.  As the costs were awarded under section
1033.5, no undertaking was required under section 917.1(d).  Id. at 148.  
The HHCA concludes (Opp. at 6), and the court agrees, that
the legislative distinction between court costs and arbitration costs is
dispositive of this motion.  The HHCA’s costs
were not awarded by the Arbitrator pursuant to Title 14,  Chapter 6 (e.g., §1032).[4]
They were awarded pursuant to the arbitration contract between the parties.  Without that contract, there was no right to
costs in the arbitration.  See
§1284.2 (“Unless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides or the parties to
the arbitration otherwise agree, each party to the arbitration shall pay his
pro rata share of the expenses and fees of the neutral arbitrator, together
with other expenses of the arbitration. . .”).  The parties’ agreement controls the allocation
of costs in arbitration proceedings and section 1032 is inapplicable.[5]  Opp. at 6.
All of Key’s case authority involves judgments entered
following actions or proceedings pending in court, and none concerns an
arbitration.  Yet, a judgment confirming
an arbitrator’s costs award is not the same as a court judgment awarding
costs.  See Tipton v. Systron
Donner Corp., (1979) 99 Cal. App. 3d 501, 507 (“The California arbitration
statutes distinguish between arbitration costs and costs of related judicial
proceedings”); Dickinson v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, (1980) 112 Cal.
App. 3d 952, 954 (“the Legislature has carefully distinguished between costs
incurred in the arbitration and costs incurred in superior court”); Austin
v. Allstate Ins. Co., (1993) 16 Cal. App. 4th 1812, 1815–16 (“It is
apparent that the Legislature has distinguished between costs incurred in an
arbitration proceeding and costs incurred in superior court to enforce an
arbitration award, allowing costs to the prevailing party only in the
latter.”); Carole Ring & Assocs. v. Nicastro, (2001) 87 Cal. App.
4th 253, 261 (“the statutory scheme and case law compel the conclusion that
Nicastro is entitled under the contract to post-arbitration attorney fees and
costs, notwithstanding the arbitrator’s denial of same at the arbitration
level.”).  Applying the Quiles
approach, Key’s contention that the HHCA was awarded costs pursuant to Chapter
6 of Title 14 fails.  
As the HHCA adds (Opp. at 14-15), even if the judgment was
an award of costs by a court, the Arbitrator awarded fees and costs awarded
pursuant to Civil Code sections 4955 and 5235 and arbitrator fees.  The Arbitrator awarded Civil Code sections
4955(b) and 5235(c) fees Key’s claims were unreasonable and without
foundation.  These costs are not routine
costs available as a matter of right. They are discretionary and more akin to
sanctions or a money judgment. As such, they are unconnected to Title 14, Chapter
6 routine costs.  Similarly, there is no
provision in Title 14, Chapter 6 that permits the award of arbitrator fees or
recognizes such fees as an allowable cost of suit in a court action.  They also are non-routine costs. 
Key argues that Chapala rejected the HHCA’s argument by
holding that attorney fees awarded to a homeowner association for an architectural
dispute under former Civil Code section 1354(f) (sic.) were routine
costs, not a money judgment, and not subject to a stay.  Reply at 6. 
Key ignores the fact that former Civil Code section 1354(c) required an
award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.  Chapala, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th
at 1546.  The bilateral nature of the fee
award made it ministerial, not discretionary, and therefore within the routine
or incidental criteria of Bank of San Pedro.
Finally, the HHCA correctly notes that the state has a
policy of encouraging arbitration as a speedy and efficient alternative to
civil litigation, and arbitration awards are afforded only limited appellate
review.  There is nothing to indicate
that confirmed arbitration awards are the cost-only judgments awarded under
Title 14, Chapter 6 that the Legislature envisaged as exempt by section
917.1(d) from an appeal undertaking. 
Opp. at 15-16.
This analysis disposes of Key’s reliance on Wade and section
1287.4, which provides that a judgment entered on an arbitration award has the
same "force and effect as, and is subject to all the provisions of law
relating to, a judgment in a civil action."  "Once an arbitration award obtained in
the course of contractual arbitration has been reduced to judgment, the
judgment has the same force and effect as, and is subject to all the provisions
of law relating to, a judgment in a civil action of the same jurisdictional
classification; and it may be enforced like any other judgment of the court in
which it is entered, in an action of the same jurisdictional
classification."  See Wade,
supra, 168 Cal. App. 4th at 1045. 

Key correctly argues that Wade confirms that section
1287.4 "counsels that such a judgment must be treated like any other
judgment."  Id. at 1046.  As such, it may be appealed and enforced just
like any civil judgment.  But the underlying
basis of the judgment against Key was not made pursuant to an award of court costs.  Instead, the basis for the judgment was
arbitration costs.  Such costs are not
made pursuant to Title 14, Chapter 6 and they are not routine or incidental
court costs.  Treating the judgment as
any other judgment, its underlying basis requires an undertaking on appeal
pursuant to section 917.1(a)(1).
 
4. The Stay on Post-Award Costs
The HHCA asks the court to modify its August 2, 2024 order
which stayed execution on the post-award costs, including attorney’s fees in
the amount of $16,560, awarded by the court in confirming arbitration award
under CCP section 1032.  The HHCA argues
that CCP section 918(b) limits the court’s authority for such an order by providing:
“If the enforcement of the judgment or order would be stayed on appeal only by
the giving of an undertaking, a trial court shall not have power, without the
consent of the adverse party, to stay the enforcement thereof pursuant to this
section for a period which extends for more than 10 days beyond the last date
on which a notice of appeal could be filed.”  Notice of entry of judgment was given on May
28, 2024, and the last date on which a notice of appeal could have been filed
was July 29, 2024. Pursuant to CCP section 918(b), the court lacked the power
to impose a stay beyond August 8, 2024. The HHCA requests that the Court vacate
the portion of its August 2, 2024 order imposing a partial stay.  Opp. at 18-19.
The HHCA’s request is procedurally improper and
misunderstands the court’s ruling.  Procedurally,
the court explained at the August 2, 2024 hearing that the HHCA could make a
noticed motion to lift the stay.  The
HHCA cannot piggyback on Key’s motion to request this relief in
opposition.  Nonetheless, Key does not oppose
on this procedural ground.  See Reply
at 8.
Substantively, the court did not impose a stay under section
918(b) against enforcement of a judgment that required an undertaking; it
imposed a stay under section 917.1(d) for the portion of the judgment that was
for costs imposed under section 1032.  Nonetheless,
the case law makes clear that a judgment must be costs-only to not require an
undertaking.  If any portion of the
judgment appealed from requires an undertaking, then the portion imposed under
section 1032 does as well.  See Quiles,
supra, 10 Cal.App.5th at 138-39 (section 917.1(d) applied
because appellant was appeal was from costs awarded by court and not damages); Ziello,
supra, 75 Cal.App.4th at 655-56.  Key has appealed from the judgment confirming
the entire arbitration award.  As a
result, the $16,560 in post-award costs must be bonded as well.  The stay is ordered lifted.
 
            E.
Conclusion
            For
the foregoing reasons, Key’s motion is denied. 
The stay on execution of the post-award costs is ordered lifted.
