And here is a brief summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Marlon Bellini's petition for a writ of administrative mandamus, seeking to overturn the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board's (CUIAB) decision that he is ineligible for family leave unemployment compensation benefits. The ruling finds that Bellini failed to meet his burden of proof in showing that CUIAB abused its discretion in denying his claim. Bellini's documents did not meet the requirements of section 2708(c)-1, and he did not provide a certified birth certificate for his son. The ruling also notes that Bellini's opening brief was late and inadequate, and that he failed to present evidence favorable to the other side. As a result, the petition is denied, and CUIAB's counsel is ordered to prepare a proposed judgment.
