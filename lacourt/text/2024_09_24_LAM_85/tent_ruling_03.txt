Marlon
Bellini v. California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, 23STCP04436                   
 
Tentative decision on administrative mandamus: denied 
 
 



 
Petitioner Marlon Bellini (“Bellini”) seeks a writ of administrative
mandamus directing Respondent California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (“CUIAB”)
to set aside its decision that he is ineligible for family leave unemployment
compensation benefits. 
The court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Petition
Bellini filed the Petition for Writ of Administrative
Mandate on December 8, 2023.  The
Petition alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
Bellini was employed by Miller Milling Company at 5471
Ferguson Drive, Commerce, CA 90640.  His
leave benefits for the birth of his son were denied. 
Bellini filed a claim for unemployment compensation
benefits, which were denied by the California Employment Development Department
(“EDD”).  
Bellini appealed the determination, and an administrative
law judge affirmed the EDD’s denial, reasoning that Bellini had not submitted
sufficient documentation to establish evidence of a qualifying relationship to
a child to satisfy the requirements necessary for payment of benefits under
code section 2708(c) of Title 22 California Code of Regulations (“CCR”) section
2708(c).  
Bellini appealed the administrative law judge’s decision to
Respondent CUIAB, which found no material errors and adopted the issue
statement, the finding of fact, and the reasons for the decision.  CUIAB also declined to admit Bellini’s
additional evidence as it could not be authenticated and, even if
authenticated, it would still not satisfy the requirement of 22 CCR section
2708(c).  Ex. 3.  
Bellini alleges that CUIAB abused its discretion. 
 
2. Course of Proceedings
Bellini served Respondent
CUIAB by personal service on January 24, 2024. 
On May 31, 2024, CUIAB
filed its Answer.
 
B. Standard of
Review
CCP section 1094.5 is
the administrative mandamus provision which structures the procedure for
judicial review of adjudicatory decisions rendered by administrative
agencies.  Topanga Ass’n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los
Angeles, (“Topanga”) (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 51415.   
CCP section 1094.5 does
not on its face specify which cases are subject to independent review, leaving
that issue to the courts.  Fukuda v. City of Angels, (“Fukuda”)
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 811.  In cases reviewing decisions which affect a
fundamental vested right the trial court exercises independent judgment on the
evidence.  Bixby v. Pierno, (“Bixby”) (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130,
143.  See CCP §1094.5(c).  The court reviews an agency’s
determination of an application for welfare benefits under the independent judgment
standard.  Fink v. Prod, (1982) 31 Cal.3d 166 178-79. 
Under the independent
judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the administrative record for
errors of law but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence
disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  Bixby, supra, 4
Cal.3d at 143.  The court must draw its own reasonable inferences from the
evidence and make its own credibility determinations.  Morrison v.
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners, (2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 860, 868.  In short, the court substitutes its judgment
for the agency’s regarding the basic facts of what happened, when, why, and the
credibility of witnesses.  Guymon v. Board of Accountancy, (1976)
55 Cal.App.3d 1010, 101316. 
“In exercising its
independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong presumption of
correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the party challenging
the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the
administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.”  Fukuda,
supra, 20 Cal.4th at 817.  Unless it can be demonstrated by
petitioner that the agency’s actions are not grounded upon any reasonable basis
in law or any substantial basis in fact, the courts should not interfere with
the agency’s discretion or substitute their wisdom for that of the
agency.  Bixby, supra, 4 Cal.3d 130, 15051; Bank of
America v. State Water Resources Control Board, (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 198,
208. 
The agency’s decision
must be based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the
hearing.  Board of Medical Quality Assurance v. Superior Court,
(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 860, 862.  The hearing officer is only required to
issue findings that give enough explanation so that parties may determine
whether, and upon what basis, to review the decision.  Topanga, supra,
11 Cal.3d 506, 51415.  Implicit in CCP section 1094.5 is a requirement
that the agency set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw
evidence and ultimate decision or order.  Id. at 515. 
An agency is presumed
to have regularly performed its official duties (Evid. Code §664), and the
petitioner therefore has the burden of proof.  Steele v. Los Angeles
County Civil Service Commission, (1958) 166 Cal.App.2d 129, 137. 
“[T]he burden of proof falls upon the party attacking the administrative
decision to demonstrate wherein the proceedings were unfair, in excess of
jurisdiction or showed prejudicial abuse of discretion.  Alford v.
Pierno, (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 682, 691. 
            
C. Governing Law
California has
established family temporary disability insurance benefits that provide wage
replacement to workers who take time off to care for their family members.  Unemployment
Insurance Code (“UIC”) §3300 et seq. 
“Family temporary disability insurance shall provide up to eight weeks
of wage replacement benefits to workers who take time off work . . . to bond
with a minor child within one year of the birth.”  UIC §3301(a)(1).)  “Claims for disability benefits shall be made
in accordance with authorized regulations of the Director of Employment
Development.”  UIC §2706.
When filing a claim to bond with a new child after birth,
the claimant shall include a supporting document that provides sufficient
information to establish the relationship between the claimant and the new
child.  §2708(c)-1(a).  “The department may, at its discretion,
accept a supporting document that does not contain all of the information
prescribed under this section provided that the department can readily obtain
the information through reasonable means or ascertain that there is no intent
to defraud.”  Id.
The supporting document shall include the child’s name, date
of birth, gender, social security number, if available, but the absence of such
number shall not be disqualifying. 
§2708(c)-1(1).  If applicable, a
supporting document shall also include: (a) the date(s) of placement, (b) the
names of the parent(s), custodial parent(s), and/or registered domestic partner,
and (c) a dated signature of the social worker, director or authorized
designate.  §2708(c)-1(2).
To verify the birth of a child for a bonding claim,
supporting documents shall be provided as follows: (1) a certified birth
certificate, (2) documents from the hospital or birthing center attesting to
the birth of the child listing the claimant as parent, or (3) a letter from the
birthing center or hospital’s Director of Medical Records containing the
child’s name, date of birth, gender assigned at birth, social security number
if available, the names of the parents, and “a dated signature of the social worker,
director, or authorized designate.”  §2708(c)-1(b)(1)(A)-(C).

An individual who is deemed ineligible for state disability
insurance benefits may appeal the Department’s initial determination to an
administrative law judge.  UIC
§2707.2(a).  The administrative law judge
is empowered to “affirm, reverse, modify, or set aside any determination” of
eligibility for benefits.  UIC
§2707.8.  The beneficiary may appeal the
decision of the administrative law judge to CUIAB’s appeals board.  Ibid; see also UIC §1336.
 
D. Statement of Facts
1. The EDD Application
On August 26, 2022, Bellini submitted a claim for paid
family leave benefits beginning August 21, 2022 to bond with his son born on
August 13, 2022.  AR 43-45.  Bellini submitted the following documents in
support of his claim: (1) a “Record of Live Birth” that listed his son’s name,
height, weight, and birth date (AR 50); a “Proof of Live Infant Birth” from
Growing Healthy Together pediatric clinic dated August 16, 2022 that lists the
child’s name, height, weight, and male sex (AR 53); a “New Family Member Proclamation”
published in the Downey Patriot in September 2022 (AR 54); a “California Jurat”
apparently notarizing and referencing an August 13, 2022 birth certificate (AR
55); and a “New family member sacred trust Proclamation” apparently referencing
his son’s birth (AR 56).
EDD denied Bellini’s claim because he did not provide the
necessary documentary evidence of his qualifying relationship to the
child.  AR 2.  In its denial letter, EDD stated that Bellini
could be found eligible if he provided: (1) the child’s birth certificate; (2)
the child’s hospital discharge record; (3) a Declaration of Paternity; (4) the
child’s passport showing INS Stamp I-551;1 or (5) another document listed in section
2708(c)-1.  Id.  
 
2. The Administrative Appeal
Bellini appealed on September 28, 2022.  AR 3-4. 
He submitted the same documents that he provided with his initial
claim.  AR 3-4.
The appeal hearing was held on February 8, 2023, before
administrative law judge Faith I. Mitchell (the “ALJ”).  Bellini appeared on his own behalf.  EDD submitted a declaration from Appeals
Representative Lilibeth Anadeo-Latimer (“Anadeo”) in lieu of an
appearance.  AR 35-37.  
Bellini testified that his wife delivered the baby at home,
he assisted with the birth, and no doctor or midwife was present.  AR 24. 
Bellini did not have a copy of his son’s birth certificate “for
religious reasons” and he was not planning on getting one.  AR 19-20, 25-26.  Bellini had not filled out any documents to
register his son’s birth with the County. 
AR 22.  At the time of the
hearing, Bellini’s son did not have a passport, although he had an appointment
to  get one.  AR 24-25.
Anadeo’s declaration stated that none of the documents Bellini
submitted were acceptable as proof of his relationship to the child for the
purposes of paid family leave benefits. 
AR 35.  Anadeo noted that
Bellini’s documents did not qualify as a birth certificate or other record
listed in section 2708(c)-1(b)(1)(A).  Ibid.  EDD declined to exercise its discretion to
accept petitioner’s supporting documents pursuant to section 2708(c)-1(a).  Ibid. 
Without supporting documentation, EDD was unable to verify the
qualifying relationship with the child with whom Bellini was attempting to
bond.  Ibid.
On February 17, 2023, the ALJ issued a decision affirming EDD’s
denial of benefits.  AR 77-79.  The ALJ agreed with EDD that Bellini’s
supporting documents were insufficient to establish a qualifying relationship
with the child under section 2708(c)-1. 
AR 79.  
 
3. The CUAIB Appeal
On February 24, 2023, Bellini submitted an appeal to CUIAB
from the ALJ’s decision.  AR 81.  With his appeal, Bellini submitted a letter
from Growing Healthy Together Pediatric Clinic stating that Bellini had brought
his son in for an examination on August 16, 2022, and that the child had been
born on August 13, 2022 to parents Marlon and Gabriela Bellini.  AR 82. 

On June 7, 2023, CUIAB affirmed the ALJ’s denial decision, also
determining that the letter Bellini had submitted could not be authenticated
and did not satisfy the requirements of section 2708(c)-1 anyway.  AR 88. 
CUIAB advised Bellini to contact EDD’s Paid Family Leave Unit to  inquire about what documents will be
sufficient to establish eligibility.  AR
88.
 
E. Analysis
Petitioner Bellini seeks a writ of administrative mandamus
directing CUIAB to set aside its decision that he is ineligible for family
leave unemployment compensation benefits. 
 
1. Procedural Defects
CUAIB points out
that Bellini did not adhere to the court-ordered briefing schedule.  At the June 4, 2024 trial setting conference,
the court ordered Bellini’s opening brief to be filed and served no
later than July 2, 2024, CUIAB’s opposition to be filed and served no later
than August 8, 2024, and any reply brief to be filed and served no later than
September 3, 2024. 
Bellini did not file his opening brief until July 9, 2024, and only after CUAIB filed and
served a Notice of Non-Filing of Petitioner’s Opening Brief.   CUIAB 
notes that Bellini’s opening brief does not explain why he failed to
adhere to the July 2 filing deadline. 
The court can therefore refuse to consider the late-filed opening brief
and deny the Petition in its entirety. 
Opp. at 9.
“[A] trial court
has broad discretion to accept or reject late-filed papers,” particularly when
a party “made no attempt to seek leave to file their [papers] late, and made no
attempt to demonstrate good cause for having failed to adhere to the applicable
deadline.”  Rancho Mirage Country Club Homeowners Assn. v.
Hazelbaker, (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 252, 262. 
The fact that the party is proceeding in propria persona is not
sufficient to establish good cause for failing to adhere to the court’s
deadlines.  Ibid.
While CUIAB is
correct, it has suffered no prejudice from Bellini’s untimely opening
brief.  Therefore, the court declines to deny
the Petition on this ground.
However,
Bellini’s opening brief suffers from another defect.  As required by LASC 3.231(i)(2), and as Bellini
was informed by the court at the trial setting, his opening brief was required
to present a full and fair statement of facts supported by citations to the
Administrative Record.  See also CRC
3.1113(k).  Absent such support, the
court must disregard the facts as unsupported. 
Smith, Smith & Kring v. Superior Court, (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th
573, 578.  Additionally, a petitioner is obligated
to lay out the evidence favorable to the other side and show why it is lacking.
The "[f]ailure to do so is fatal" to any substantial evidence
challenge and "is deemed a concession that the evidence supports the
findings."  Defend the Bay v.
City of Irvine, (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1266.  The reviewing court should "not
independently review the record to make up for appellant's failure to carry his
burden."  Ibid.  
Bellini
has presented no statement of facts supported by citations and merely states
that he has submitted all valid legal documents.  Pet. Op. Br. at 3.   This is inadequate and the Petition shall be
denied for this procedural defect. 
 
2. Merits
Bellini repeatedly
argues that there are “triable issues of fact”, summary [judgment] can only be
granted when there are no triable issues of fact, and therefore CUIAB has not
met its burden.  Pet. Op. Br. at 3-5.
Bellini
misunderstands the law.  He cites the
test for summary judgment under CCP section 437c.  This mandamus case is before the court for
trial, not summary judgment.  Bellini,
not CUIAB, has the burden of proof to show that CUAIB abused its discretion in
upholding the denial of bonding disability insurance benefits.  Alford
v. Pierno, supra, 27 Cal.App.3d
at 691.[1] 
Bellini has not met his burden.  To verify the birth of a child for a bonding
claim, supporting documents shall be provided as follows: (1) a certified birth
certificate, (2) documents from the hospital or birthing center attesting to
the birth of the child listing the claimant as parent, or (3) a letter from the
birthing center or hospital’s Director of Medical Records containing the
child’s name, date of birth, gender assigned at birth, social security number
if available, the names of the parents, and “a dated signature of the social
worker, director, or authorized designate.” 
§2708(c)-1(b)(1)(A)-(C).
The documents
Bellini submitted do not satisfy the requirements of section 2708(c)-1.  His son was born at home without the
assistance of a midwife or a doctor.  AR 24. 
Although he could record his son’s birth with Los Angeles County,
Bellini made no effort to do so.  AR 19-20, 25-26.  He therefore has not received a certified
birth certificate for his son, and he stated that he has no plan to obtain one
in the future.  Ibid.
As the ALJ pointed
out to Bellini at his hearing, no document he submitted contains all the
necessary information that would allow EDD to accept it as proof of his son’s
birth and of Bellini’s paternity.  AR 27-29. 
Even if the documents did contain the necessary information, EDD had
discretion to reject them as not enabling it to readily obtain the
information through reasonable means or ascertain that there is no intent to
defraud.  §2708(c)-1(a).  
Other than
asserting that the documents he presented to CUIAB were legitimate and
acceptable, Bellini does not explain how
CUIAB’s denial was an abuse of discretion. 
Bellini’s opening brief attaches as Exhibit A an image of a U.S.
passport that was not included in the Administrative Record.  As CUIAB argues (Opp. at 10), he cannot rely
on this image because it is not part of the Record.   
Bellini presents additional
documents in reply: (1) a Birth Affidavit on a U.S. Department of State form (Ex.
4); (2) an invoice from Growing Heathy Together pediatric clinic (Ex. 7); (3) a
Blue Cross Blue Shield benefits form (Ex. 8), (4) an Explanation of Benefits
form (Ex. 9); and (10) a paternity test for the minor child (Ex. 11).  Again, these documents are not in the Administrative
Record.  They also may not be presented
for the first time in reply.  Regency Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina Lances, Inc.,
(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333 (new evidence/issues raised for the first time
in a reply brief are not properly presented to a trial court and may be
disregarded).[2]
 
F. Conclusion
The Petition is
denied.  CUIAB’s counsel is ordered to
prepare a proposed judgment, serve it on Bellini for approval as to form, wait
ten days after service for any objections, meet and confer if there are
objections, and then submit the proposed judgment along with a declaration
stating the existence/non-existence of any unresolved objections.  An OSC re: judgment is set for October 24, 2024
at 9:30 a.m.
