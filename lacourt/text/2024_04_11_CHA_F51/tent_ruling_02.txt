(Compl. p.  4.)   On 2/10/23, Plaintiff filed his  complaint, alleging against defendants Costco Wholesale Corporation; Costco  Membership, Inc.; and Property Owners of 13550 Paxton St., Pacoima CA 91331 the  following causes of action: (1) Premises Liability; (2) General Negligence; and  (3) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.   On 7/14/23, Moving Defendant served the subject discovery  requests on Plaintiff. On 1/18/24, Moving Defendant filed the instant motions  to compel Plaintiff’s responses thereto. No oppositions have been filed to  date.[1] ANALYSIS   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to a request for production of documents if the  responding party fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ.  Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding  party who fails to serve a timely response “waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to interrogatories if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.  (b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings  under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order deeming the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters  specified in the requests be deemed admitted if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd.  (b); 2033.250, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on  privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it  relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall  make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for  admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a  proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial  compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).)   Here, as Moving Defendant electronically  served the subject discovery requests on Plaintiff on 7/14/23, the last day for  Plaintiff to respond was 8/16/23. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) To date, Plaintiff has  not provided responses to Moving Defendant’s discovery requests. (Decl. of  Brian Skalsky ¶ 9.)  The Court notes that Plaintiff  has failed to oppose the instant motions. Accordingly, the Court grants the  instant unopposed motions to compel Plaintiff to provide responses to the  subject discovery requests.   Sanctions    “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).)   “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.  Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).)   “It is mandatory that the court  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests  for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd.  (c).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that  conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred  by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd.  (a).)   Here, Moving Defendant requests $1,435.00  in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel for each of the four  motions, in a total sum of $5,740.00. This amount includes (1) 3.5 hours of Moving  Defendant’s attorney’s time spent preparing each motion; and (2) an anticipated  2 hours drafting each reply and appearing at each of the hearings, at counsel’s  hourly rate of $250.00 per hour. (Skalsky Decl. ¶ 10.) Moving Defendant also seeks to recover $60.00  in filing fees per motion. (Ibid.)   In granting the instant motions, the  Court finds it reasonable to award Moving Defendant sanctions against Plaintiff  and his counsel in the total amount of $810.00.    CONCLUSION    The unopposed motions are granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Moving Defendant’s  first set of discovery requests within 10 days. Moving Defendant’s Requests for  Admission, Set One, are deemed admitted. The Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff  in the amount of $810.00.
