   [1]  The Court notes that on 4/5/24, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration stating  that he electronically served Moving Defendant with Plaintiff’s discovery  responses on the same date. To the extent that this declaration serves as  Plaintiff’s opposition to the instant motions, the Court declines to consider  them as untimely. (Code Civ. Proc. §  1005, subd. (b).)
