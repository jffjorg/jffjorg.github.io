Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer is overruled as to Plaintiffs' third cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress) and sustained as to the fourth, fifth, seventh, and eighth causes of action (breach of implied warranty of habitability, breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, private nuisance, and public nuisance) without leave to amend. The judge notes that the demurrer is overruled as to the third cause of action because the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action. The demurrer is sustained as to the other causes of action because they fail to state a cause of action or because they are duplicative of other causes of action. The judge orders Moving Defendant to file an answer to Plaintiff's second amended complaint, as modified, within 30 days.
