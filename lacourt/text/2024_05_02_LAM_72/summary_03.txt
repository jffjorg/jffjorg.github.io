Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's claims do not state a cause of action. The court denied the motion as to the first and fourth claims, granted the motion as to the second and third claims with leave to amend, and granted the motion as to the fifth claim with leave to amend. The court also denied the defendants' arguments that the court lacks personal jurisdiction and that the forum is inconvenient. The court found that the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing state a cause of action, but found that the plaintiff's claim for breach of fiduciary duty may be duplicative of the breach of contract claim.
