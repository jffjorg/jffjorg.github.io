English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the Judge grants the defendant's motion to quash service of process. The Judge concludes that the proof of service is defective on its face, as it fails to check box number 5, which requires a declaration of diligence. Additionally, the process server's statement that she "personally served" the defendant is contradicted by the earlier proof of service, which stated that substituted service was made. The Judge also finds that the process server's belief that she served the defendant is not sufficient to establish personal service. Furthermore, the Judge rejects the plaintiff's contention that the defendant was served at his residence, as the evidence shows that the defendant did not live at that address in 2021.
