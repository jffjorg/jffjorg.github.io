Significant Statements:
  - The Court tentatively concludes that the non-economic damages must be reduced to $390,000 under MICRA.
  - The Court asks Plaintiff to address the following questions:
    1. Is there any California authority holding that a judgment of elder abuse/neglect against a health care institution based solely on neglect (not recklessness) is exempt from MICRA?
    2. What basis would there be for the Court to hold that the terms of MICRA do not apply here?
    3. What is Plaintiff's view of the effect of the Elder Abuse statute?
    4. Why does Plaintiff contend that the language in Delaney v. Baker (1999) 20 Cal.4th 23 does not require a reduction of damages?
    5. Does Plaintiff agree that the Carter court believed that a finding of oppression, fraud, malice, or recklessness was an element of an elder abuse claim?
    6. Does Plaintiff believe that Worsham v. O'Connor Hospital (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 331 was wrongly decided?
