 Case Number:  23STCV11090    Hearing Date:   May 2, 2024    Dept:  72  SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIACOUNTY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT 72 TENTATIVE RULING ANTONIO GALLEGOS, AN ELDER, BY AND THROUGH HIS GUARDIAN AD LITEM, ANABEL SIMPEH,                                   Plaintiff,          v.  EMANATE HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER, et al.,                                   Defendants.  Case No:  23STCV11090      Hearing Date:  May 2, 2024 Calendar Number:  4   Defendant Emanate Health Queen of the Valley Hospital (“Defendant”) opposes the proposed judgment filed by Plaintiff Antonio Gallegos (“Plaintiff”) and moves for an order reducing the jury’s verdict for noneconomic damages in favor of Plaintiff. The Court has considered all the parties’ filings on this issue, including the unauthorized sur-opposition by Plaintiff and the unauthorized response to the sur-opposition by Defendant. It appears based on the authorities cited by the parties that Defendant is correct.   Based on these authorities, the Court tentatively concludes that the non-economic damages must be reduced to $390,000.00 under MICRA, Civil Code, section 3333.2.   Because Plaintiff has not addressed the arguments that seem most pertinent to the Court, the Court asks Plaintiff to address the following questions at the hearing before the Court makes its decision: 1.    Is there any California authority holding that a judgment of elder abuse/neglect against a health care institution based solely on neglect (not recklessness) is exempt from MICRA? 2.    MICRA and its $390,000 limit applies to “any action for injury against . . . a health care institution based on professional negligence.”  (Civil Code § 3333.2, subd. (a).)  Those terms appear to apply to a judgment based on the current verdict.  What basis would there be for the Court to hold that those terms do not apply here? 3.    What is Plaintiff’s view of the effect of the following provision of the Elder Abuse statute: “Notwithstanding this article, a cause of action for injury or damage against a health care provider, as defined in Section 340.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, based on the health care provider’s professional negligence, shall be governed by those laws which specifically apply to those professional negligence causes of action.”  (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15657.2.) 4.    The following language from page 35 of Delaney v. Baker (1999) 20 Cal.4th 23, with emphases added, appears to require a ruling in favor of Defendant on reduction of the damages.  Why does Plaintiff contend that this language does not require that result?  “[N]eglect within the meaning of former section 15610.57 appears to cover an area of misconduct distinct from ‘professional negligence’ in section 15657.2: ‘neglect’ as defined in former section 15610.57 and used in section 15657 does not refer to the performance of medical services in a manner inferior to ‘the knowledge, skill and care ordinarily possessed and employed by members of the profession in good standing’, but rather to the failure of those responsible for attending to the basic needs and comforts of elderly or dependent adults, regardless of their professional standing, to carry out their custodial obligations. It is instructive that the statutory definition […] gives as an example of ‘neglect’ not negligence in the undertaking of medical services but the more fundamental ‘[f]ailure to provide medical care for physical and mental health needs.’” (Delaney v. Baker (1999) 20 Cal.4th 23, 34 [internal citations and quotation marks omitted].) “Section 15657 provides the way out of this ambiguity: if the neglect is reckless, or done with oppression, fraud or malice, then the action falls within the scope of section 15657 and as such cannot be considered simply based on professional negligence within the meaning of section 15657.2. The use of such language in section 15657, and the explicit exclusion of ‘professional negligence’ in section 15657.2, make clear the Elder Abuse Act's goal was to provide heightened remedies for, as stated in the legislative history, ‘acts of egregious abuse’ against elder and dependent adults, while allowing acts of negligence in the rendition of medical services to elder and dependent adults to be governed by laws specifically applicable to such negligence. That only these egregious acts were intended to be sanctioned under section 15657 is further underscored by the fact that the statute requires liability to be proved by a heightened ‘clear and convincing evidence’ standard.” (Delaney, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 35 [emphasis added, internal citations and quotation marks omitted, cleaned up].) 5.    The case of Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396 affirmed a trial court order sustaining a demurrer to an elder abuse cause of action because the allegations against the hospital were not sufficiently egregious to rise to the level of oppression, fraud, malice, or recklessness.  (See id. at pp.406-407 [discussing legal elements of elder abuse claim]; and pp. 407-411 [applying legal principles to the allegations before the court].)  Does Plaintiff agree that the Carter court believed that a finding of oppression, fraud, malice or recklessness was an element of an elder abuse claim?  Was Carter wrongly decided? 6.     Another case cited by Defendant, Worsham v. O’Connor Hospital (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 331 also held that the elder abuse statute does not apply to mere negligence and affirmed a demurrer on that basis.  (See id. at p. 337 [“The Elder Abuse Act does not apply to simple or gross negligence by health care providers”].)  Does Plaintiff agree with the Court’s reading of Worsham? Does Plaintiff believe that Worsham was wrongly decided?
