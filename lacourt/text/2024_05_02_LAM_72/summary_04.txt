Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the Infinity Parties (Infinity Insurance Company and Infinity Select Insurance Company) is denied. The demurrer was filed in response to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiffs David Sanchez and Apple Markets, Inc. The FAC alleges that the Infinity Parties breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and violated Civil Code section 2860.

The judge found that the FAC sufficiently alleges a conflict of interest between the Infinity Parties and the Plaintiffs, which is a necessary element for a claim under Civil Code section 2860. The judge also found that the Infinity Parties' argument that there is no private cause of action under Civil Code section 2860 is insufficiently supported and therefore cannot be a basis to sustain the demurrer.
