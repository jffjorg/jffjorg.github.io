And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the defendants' motion to tax costs and has granted it in part and denied it in part. The court has taxed $1,667.78 from the plaintiff's claimed costs. The defendants sought to tax costs related to filing and motion fees, deposition costs, service of process, and court-ordered transcripts. The court has held that the costs associated with the peremptory challenge, lis pendens, and motion to compel appearance at trial are recoverable. The court has also held that the costs incurred for the service of process for certain individuals are necessary to the litigation. However, the court has denied the defendants' objections to the costs incurred for models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits.
