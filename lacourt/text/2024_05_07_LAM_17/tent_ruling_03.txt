In opposition, Plaintiffs withdrew their request for the recovery
of the costs they incurred with respect to the filing fees of the motion to be
relieved as counsel ($61.65), ex parte application to be relieved as counsel
($142.50), ex parte application to continue trial ($78.40), and the service of
process of the MUM Group ($130), Erik Lederman ($113.58), Marvin Mangabat
($475), and Ruth Hernandez ($505) (collectively, the “Withdrawn Costs”). The
total amount of the Withdrawn Costs is $1,506.13.
 
            Accordingly, the Court limits its
analysis to the remaining costs. 
 
            After review, the Court finds only
some of the costs claimed to be recoverable. 
 
            With the exception of the Withdrawn
Costs, the filing and motion costs at issue in Full Circle’s Motion are the
costs associated with the peremptory challenge ($100), lis pendens ($197.38),
and motion to compel appearance at trial ($61.65). 
 
            In opposition, Plaintiffs argue
that:
 
CCP § 1033.5(a)(1) expressly provides for the recovery of filing
fees and does not distinguish between the types of documents for which the
filing fees are recoverable. Thus, there is no merit to Full Circle’s
contention that the filing fees for the peremptory challenge should not be
imposed on it. Plaintiffs were within their right to file such challenge under
CCP § 170.6 and contrary to Full Circle’s assertion, there is no basis to
reduce the filing fee as Plaintiffs’ costs records confirm that Plaintiffs
incurred $100 in connection with the filing of the peremptory challenge.
(Declaration of Geoffrey M. Gold (“Gold Decl.”), ¶ 2, Exh. A at p. 1.)
 
            (Opp., 5: 19-25.) 
 
However, allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary
to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to
its preparation.” (§ 1033.5, subd. (c)(2). As such, the Code of Civil Procedure
does not provide that any and all costs are recoverable, but only that those
reasonably necessary to the litigation are recoverable. The Court agrees that a
denied preemptory challenge was not necessary to this litigation, not was the
filing fee of a motion to compel appearance which was taken off calendar and
never heard. 
 
The Court finds the costs associated with the lis
pendens to be recoverable, as Plaintiffs
initiated this action with a cause of action for quiet title and pursuant to
CCP section 761(b), were required to “file a notice of pendency of the action
in the county recorder of each county in which any real property described in
the complaint is located.”
 
As for the challenged deposition costs, the Court finds no basis to
reduce or strike these costs after review of Plaintiffs’ documentation. 
 
As for models, enlargements, and photographs, Defendants argue that
the $1,786.77 incurred by Plaintiffs for trial exhibits and demonstrative
exhibits “is excessive and not reasonable, and should be reduced.” (Motion at
8:10- 11.) However, items on a verified cost bill are prima facie evidence that
the costs were necessarily incurred and the burden is on the party seeking to
tax costs to show that they are not reasonable or necessary. (Seever v.
Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 1550, 1557.) As explained in Seever,
Full Circle may not “attack the submitted costs by arguing that [it] thinks the
costs were not necessary or reasonable. Rather, [Defendants] ha[ve] the burden
to present evidence and prove that the claimed costs are not recoverable.” (Seever,
141 Cal. App. 4th at p. 1557.) Defendants have not met that burden. 
 
As for the service of process charges, with the exception of the
Withdrawn Costs, Defendants object to the recovery of costs incurred for the
service of Metrosun ($625), Shamooil ($3,152.85), Marshall ($265), Lisnow
($265), Occ ($488.07), Haye ($487.50), Isaacson ($187.94), Thomas ($670.68),
and Bienenfeld ($244.48) because no default was entered as to Defendant
Metrosun, because Shamooil, Isaacson, Thomas, Occ, and Bienenfeld were not
called as witnesses at trial, because Marshall and Lisnow could have been
served electronically, and because Haye was designated to be a witness on
behalf of Full Circle, and Plaintiffs did not call Haye as a witness in their
case in chief. 
 
However, the express language of section 1033.5(a)(4)(B) does not
proscribe any limitation with respect to a party’s ability to recover costs for
service of process other than circumstances when the service itself is
successfully challenged. Here, the costs invoices of Plaintiffs confirm that
the costs identified in the Costs Memo for such service were actually incurred
by Plaintiffs in effecting service of these individuals. (Gold Decl., ¶ 4, Exh.
C at pp. 1, 3-4.) Moreover, “[p]ersonal service allows for irrefutable proof of
if and when service was completed and service on Full Circle’s witness was
required to have the witness appear if and when Plaintiffs needed to call that
witness.” (Opp., 8:18-20.) As such, the Court finds these costs necessary to
the litigation. 
 
Finally, as for Court-Ordered Transcripts, pursuant to CCP section 1033.5(a)(9),
“[t]ranscripts of court proceedings ordered by the court” are recoverable.
While Defendants contend that the Court did not make any orders concerning
trial transcripts, the Court did, in fact, order the parties to obtain
transcripts of trial testimony. (Gold Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to tax is granted in
part, denied in part. The Court taxes $1,667.78 from Plaintiff’s claimed costs.

 
 
It is so
ordered.
