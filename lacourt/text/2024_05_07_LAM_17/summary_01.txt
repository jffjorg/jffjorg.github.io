```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied defendant Victor Mendiola's motion to set aside the entry of default without prejudice. The motion was unopposed, but the court found that Mendiola failed to provide a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. The court also noted that Mendiola did not provide an explanation for when he discovered that default had been entered against him. The court cited California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, which allows a court to relieve a party from a judgment or dismissal on equitable grounds. However, the court found that Mendiola did not meet the requirements for equitable relief and therefore denied the motion.
