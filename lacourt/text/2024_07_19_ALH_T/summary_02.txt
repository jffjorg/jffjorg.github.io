And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to change the venue of the trial from Alhambra to either Chatsworth or Van Nuys. The defendant, Dennis Mortensen, is permanently on oxygen and can only stand for brief periods, and is otherwise bedridden or in a wheelchair. He wants to personally appear at trial and feels that appearing remotely would limit his ability to properly defend himself. The Judge agrees that changing the venue would promote the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice, and would be more convenient for the defendant. The case will be transferred to Department 1 at the Chatsworth or Van Nuys Courthouse, and all future dates are advanced and vacated.
