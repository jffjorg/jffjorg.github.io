[TENTATIVE] RULING
 
The hearing on Defendant’s motion is
continued to March 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
Plaintiff Aria Fallah filed this lemon
law action against defendants Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (“VWGA”), Scott
Robinson Pontiac, Inc. dba Scott Robinson Honda, and Sherman-Oaks-A, Inc. dba
Audi Van Nuys on October 3, 2023. (The latter two defendant were named
erroneously in Plaintiff’s initial complaint.)
 
On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed
her claims against Scott Robinson Honda.
 
On November 12, 2024, VWGA moved for
summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of three of
Plaintiff’s four causes of action. (See Not. of Mot., 2:14-26 [issues for
summary adjudication].) VWGA served Plaintiff with its motion via electronic
mail on November 11, 2024.
 
VWGA did not provide sufficient notice
of its motion.  “Notice of [a] motion [for
summary judgment or adjudication] and supporting papers shall be served on all
other parties to the action at least 75 days before the time appointed for
hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437(c)(a)(2).) VWGA served its motion only
forty-five (45) days prior.
 
The hearing on VWGA’s motion is
continued to Wednesday, March 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., with opposition and reply
briefing to proceed according to that hearing date. 
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
