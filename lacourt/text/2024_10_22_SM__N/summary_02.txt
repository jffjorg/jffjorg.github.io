And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Aaron Setareh and BD&J, PC to withdraw as counsel for plaintiff Johnny Wesley Mackey. The motion is granted conditionally, pending the provision of a proposed order and proof of service within five days. The court finds that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, which is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, the court notes that the motion was not accompanied by a proposed order, as required by California Rules of Court. Despite this, the court grants the motion because it finds good cause to do so. The ruling will become effective once proof of service is filed.
