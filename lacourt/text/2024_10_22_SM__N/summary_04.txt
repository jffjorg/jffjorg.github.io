And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the defendants' special motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for malicious prosecution. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's claim lacks probable cause and is based on protected activity, specifically the defendants' exercise of their right to petition and free speech. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants knew or should have known that the claims against him lacked probable cause, but the defendants presented evidence that they had a reasonable and legally tenable basis for filing the action. The Judge found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on its claim for malicious prosecution against the defendants.

The Judge also ordered the defendants to prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute. Additionally, the Judge ruled that the defendants are entitled to their reasonable attorney fees and costs, which will be determined upon filing a noticed motion for attorney fees and memorandum of costs.
