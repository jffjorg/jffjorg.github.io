 Case Number:  23SMCV05455    Hearing Date:   October 22, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGCurrently pending before the Court is Aaron Setareh and BD&J, PC’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Johnny Wesley Mackey.Counsel has asserted a valid reason for withdrawal, i.e., the attorney-client relationship has broken down. (Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(b)(4).) While counsel has provided a notice of motion and supporting declaration, counsel failed to provide a proposed order with the motion. Rule 3.1362(d) of the California Rules of Court requires that opposing parties and the client be served with the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and the proposed order. There being good cause to grant counsel’s request to withdraw, Aaron Setareh and BD&J, PC’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Johnny Wesley Mackey is conditionally GRANTED. Counsel shall provide a copy of the proposed order and proof of service of the same within five (5) days of entry of this order. The Court will then enter the order accordingly, and this ruling granting counsel’s motion to withdraw shall become effective upon filing of proof service of this ruling, with the order as entered, upon Plaintiff Johnny Wesley Mackey.
