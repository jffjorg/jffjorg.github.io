```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of defendant Michael Shair Kamrany and his wife Fahin Kamrany, as well as the request to extend the discovery cutoff deadline. The judge found that the plaintiff did not provide adequate notice of the motion, and that the plaintiff did not engage in sufficient meet and confer efforts with the defense before filing the motion. The judge also noted that the defense counsel refused to stipulate to extend the discovery cutoff, and that the defendant's wife refused to appear for deposition due to a dental procedure. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can re-file the motion if they can address the judge's concerns and provide adequate notice and meet and confer efforts.
