And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies without prejudice the motion contesting the application for good faith settlement of Cross-Defendant Juan Alejandro Gonzalez. The Court finds that the settlement is premature and that the amount of settlement does not appear to represent Gonzalez's proportionate share of liability. The evidence suggests that Gonzalez may be primarily responsible for the accident at issue, and the Court cannot determine as a matter of fact that Gonzalez is unable to pay more than the settlement amount.
