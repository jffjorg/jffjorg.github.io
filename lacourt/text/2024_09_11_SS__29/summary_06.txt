And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court will call the matter to inquire about the status of the attorney-client relationship between Plaintiff Dehnys Valenzuela and Counsel Ilia Borisov of Martinian Lawyers, Inc. The motion to be relieved as counsel was filed by Counsel due to alleged conflicts and difficulties in representing the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has objected to the motion, stating that Counsel has refused to litigate the case reasonably and has not communicated with the Plaintiff about critical dates. The Court will consider the required documents and inquiring about whether Counsel was served with the Objection, whether the attorney-client relationship is damaged beyond repair, and whether there are conflicts between the attorney and client that make it unreasonable for the attorney to continue the representation.
