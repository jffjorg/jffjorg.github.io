And here is a summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the depositions of the two plaintiffs, Davis Tivas and Santos Tivas. The defendant served the plaintiffs with deposition notices, but they failed to appear for the scheduled depositions. The defendant then moved to compel the depositions and requested sanctions. The judge finds that the defendant properly noticed the depositions and that the plaintiffs failed to act in good faith. Therefore, the judge grants the motions to compel and orders the plaintiffs to appear for deposition. The judge also grants the defendant's requests for sanctions in part, ordering the plaintiffs and their attorneys to pay $440 in sanctions.
