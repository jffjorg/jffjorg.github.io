And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial. The defendant requested the continuance so that its motion for summary judgment could be heard before the trial. However, the defendant's motion for summary judgment was not timely served, and therefore, the court cannot hear it before the trial. The judge considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) and found that there was no good cause for the requested continuance. The trial is currently set for October 23, 2024, and the hearing on the motion for summary judgment is set for December 10, 2024.
