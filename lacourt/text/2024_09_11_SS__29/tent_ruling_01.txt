Defendant’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff Santos Tivas
Tentative
The
motions to compel are GRANTED.
The
requests for sanctions are GRANTED in part.
Background
On
February 16, 2021, Davis Tivas and Santos Tivas (collectively “Plaintiffs”)
filed a complaint against Frank Rodriguez Garcia (“Defendant”) and Does 1
through 50 for negligence arising out of an automobile accident occurring on
February 15, 2019.
On March
29, 2023, Defendant filed his answer.
On August 9, Defendant filed four discovery
motions.  Two are set for hearing on September
11: to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Davis Tivas and to compel the
deposition of Plaintiff Santos Tivas. 
The other two motions are set for hearing on September 13.
As to the motions set for hearing on
September 11, no opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
“Any party may obtain
discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any person,
including any party to the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280
provide the requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a
deposition notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when
the notice must be served. 
“The service of a
deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a party to the
action … to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)
Section 2025.410,
subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at least three
days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition notice does
not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through 2025.280.
Section 2025.450,
subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated
by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having
served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an
order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” 
Any such motion to compel
must show good cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has
failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that
the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).) 
When a motion to compel is
granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd.
(g)(1).) 
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiffs with notices of their depositions, with both
scheduled for June 18, 2024. (Holly Decls., ¶ 3.)  Defendant reached out prior to the deposition to
confirm, but Plaintiff did not serve any objection and did not
appear.  (Id., ¶¶ 4-6.) 
On May
28, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiffs with notice of depositions on June 18,
2024. (Holly Decls., ¶ 3.) Plaintiffs did not appear on June 18. (Id., ¶
6.) Defense counsel reached out to Plaintiffs’ counsel regarding the
nonappearance and attempted to reschedule the depositions, but no agreement was
reached.  (Id., ¶¶ 9-11 & Exhs.
B-C.) 
Defendant
properly noticed Plaintiffs’ depositions and Plaintiffs have failed to appear.  Accordingly, the motions to compel are
granted.
The Court
grants in part Defendant’s requests for sanctions.  The Court is granting the motions to compel, and
the Court does not find that Plaintiffs have acted with substantial
justification or that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (g)(1).)  In light
of the economies of scale associated with preparing multiple discovery motions,
and the reasonably straightforward nature of a motion for a deemed-admitted
order, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $400 per motion, based on two hours
of attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable rate of $190 per hour, plus
$60 filing fee. (Holly Decls., ¶ 13.)

The Court GRANTS Defendant’s
motions to compel the depositions of Plaintiffs. 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff
Davis Tivas to appear for deposition and to answer questions under oath on
September/October __, 2024, at ______ a.m./p.m., by remote means.  Defendant is to provide the link for the deposition
