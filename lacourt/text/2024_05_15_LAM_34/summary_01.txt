And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has taken off the calendar the Plaintiff's Third Motion for Change of Venue. The Plaintiff, Glenn M. Heinl, has repeatedly filed motions to change the venue, but has failed to provide sufficient grounds for the court to make a determination. The court has previously dismissed Plaintiff's claims against some defendants, and Plaintiff has failed to serve the remaining defendants. The court has scheduled a Case Management Conference and Order to Show Cause re Dismissal of Remaining Defendants for May 15, 2024, at which time the court will consider dismissing the unserved defendants.
