  Case Number:  22STCV32282    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  34 SUBJECT:        Motion for Change of Venue 
 
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Glenn M. Heinl, in propria persona
Resp. Party:    None
 
        
        Plaintiff’s Third Motion for Change of
Venue is TAKEN OFF CALENDAR.
 
BACKGROUND:
 
On October 3, 2022,
Plaintiff Glenn M. Heinl, in propria persona, filed a Complaint against
Defendants Thrifty Drug Store; James Tony; the Superior Court of California,
County of Los Angeles (erroneously sued as “L.A. County Court”); Ana Maria
Luna; Frank Gafgowski; Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office (erroneously
sued as “L.A. County Public Defenders Office”); and Andrew Stein. 
 
On October 6, 2022,
Plaintiff filed his Amended Complaint.
 
On November 7, 2022,
the Court granted Plaintiff limited leave until December 2, 2022 to file a
second amended complaint. Plaintiff did not file a second amended complaint by
the deadline. Instead, it appears Plaintiff attempted to file a second amended
complaint on December 9, 2022, which was rejected by the Clerk’s Office on
December 20, 2022. 
 
On May 31, 2023, the
judicial officer sitting in Department 19 recused herself from this matter. 
 
On November 8, 2023,
the judicial officer sitting in Department 55 recused herself from this matter.

 
On January 9, 2024,
the Court: (1) denied without prejudice Plaintiff’s Motion for Change of Venue;
(2) sustained the Demurrer of Defendant Los Angeles County Public Defender’s
Office; and (3) sustained the Demurrer of Defendants Ana Maria Luna and
Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. 
 
On January 18, 2024,
Plaintiff filed Motion for Change of Venue (“Second Motion for Change of
Venue”). 
 
        On
March 6, 2024, the Court took off calendar the Second Motion for Change of
Venue. 
 
        On
March 20, 2024, the Court entered Judgment in this matter in favor of
Defendants Ana Maria Luna, the Superior Court of California, County of Los
Angeles, and Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office, and against Plaintiff
Glenn M. Heinl. 
 
On April 19, 2024,
Plaintiff filed Motion for Change of Venue (“Third Motion for Change of
Venue”). 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
        The Court took off calendar the Second
Motion for Change of Venue because the Court lacked jurisdiction to rule on that
motion. (Minute Order dated March 6, 2024, pp. 3–4.) The Court lacked
jurisdiction to rule on that motion because Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint had
been dismissed. (Minute Order dated January 9, 2024, pp. 6–7.)
 
        Plaintiff has not filed an amended pleading.
Thus, the Court still lacks jurisdiction to rule on a motion for change of
venue. The only thing the Court can do is take the motion off calendar. (Guardianship
of Lyle (1946) 77 Cal.App.2d 153, 155–156.)
 
CONCLUSION:
 
        Plaintiff’s Third Motion for Change of
Venue is TAKEN OFF CALENDAR.
 
 
 

 
        
 
        In his papers
submitted to the Court for the March 6, 2024 hearing, Plaintiff Heinl stated,
among other things:
 
·      
That he had pictures of President Clinton with Elizabeth
Holmes
·       That the “National Democratic Party is
CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE”
·      
That “Jacqueline Kennedy Onassais was at the Courthouse
before her illegal arrest”; and that 
·      
“I created Amazon and Tesla”
 
Plaintiff affirmed these statements in Court on March 6,
2024.
 
At that hearing, the Court
explained to Plaintiff that he must serve the remaining defendants prior to the
next hearing or that they would be dismissed. 
The Court stated:

“Case Management Conference and/or Order to Show Cause re Dismissal of
Remaining Defendants is scheduled for 05/15/2024 at 08:30 AM in Department 34
at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. [¶] If Defendants are served, then the case will
continue with a Case Management Conference. [¶] If Plaintiff fails to serve
Defendant(s) by the above-mentioned hearing date, the Court will dismiss any
unserved Defendant(s).”  (Minute Order,
March 6, 2024.)
 
Plaintiff stated that he understood.
 
        No other
plaintiffs have been served.
 
        The case is
Dismissed with prejudice.
