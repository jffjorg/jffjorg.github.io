And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint filed by defendants Gerald Aschoff and Todd Hughes. The defendants seek to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, Nicole Management, LLC, and new parties Masoud and Ramin Omrany, alleging fraudulent inducement, breach of contract, and related claims arising from the same rental agreement that is the basis of the original complaint in this action. The judge finds that the proposed cross-complaint is compulsory on its face and that the defendants have acted in good faith. The judge orders the defendants to file a clean, standalone copy of the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days of the order.
