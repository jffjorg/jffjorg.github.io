RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Brian A.

RULING: The motion is placed off calendar.
 
On 12/14/23, attorney Brian A. Wright filed the instant
motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Sam Dabbas and Maksim Zasypkin
in this action.  
 
The proof of service indicates that only the “Order
Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved As Counsel – Civil (Proposed)” was
served by mail on 12/18/23.  (See
Proof of Service, No.4, filed on 12/18/23). 
As such, there is no evidence before the Court that the notice of motion
and motion and supporting declarations were served on the clients and opposing
counsel.  There are no oppositions or
other responses to the motion to cure the defect in notice.
