Summary:

The judge rules in favor of the defendants' motion to compel arbitration, finding that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable. The agreement was entered into on April 28, 2022, and covers individual PAGA claims. The judge rejects the plaintiff's arguments that the agreement is unconscionable, finding that the waiver provision for PAGA claims is not enforceable under current California law. The judge also finds that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies to the transaction, as the defendants have established a transaction involving commerce. The plaintiff's representative claims are stayed pending the results of the arbitration. A status review/OSC re: dismissal is set for April 2, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.
