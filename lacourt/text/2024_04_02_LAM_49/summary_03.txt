And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion by counsel, Stephen M. Garcia and Garcia & Artigliere, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Jannie Watson. The Plaintiff alleges that Defendants committed Elder Abuse and Negligence while providing care at a senior care facility. The counsel filed necessary forms and served papers on parties, including the client and opposing counsel. The Judge granted the motion, citing "irreconcilable differences" that prohibit the continuation of the attorney-client relationship. An OSC (Order to Show Cause) is set for May 3, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. to address the striking and dismissal of the complaint. The Plaintiff's new attorney must be of record by that date.
