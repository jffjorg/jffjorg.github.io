```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court denies the defendants' motion to dismiss the case for lack of standing without prejudice. The court finds that the plaintiff, Jesus Asael Herrera Lopez, has standing to bring the case, but notes that the probate proceedings are still pending and the court cannot determine whether the plaintiff has standing until the probate proceedings conclude. The court also rejects the defendants' argument that the plaintiff's declaration under Code of Civil Procedure Section 377.32 is defective and finds that the failure to file a proper declaration does not undercut the plaintiff's standing. The court sets another OSC (Order to Show Cause) to discuss the status of the Los Angeles probate case.
