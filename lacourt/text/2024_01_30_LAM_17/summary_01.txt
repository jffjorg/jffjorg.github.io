And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling was issued by Judge Hon. Jon R. Takasugi in the case of Alfredo Lopez vs. Martin L. Berman, Esq. and Law Offices of Pflaster (Case No. 22STCV20693). The defendants had filed motions to compel discovery from the plaintiff and to have the plaintiff's Requests for Admission deemed admitted. However, the court found that the plaintiff had already provided all outstanding discovery on January 14, 2023, making the motions moot. Despite this, the court still sanctioned the plaintiff and his counsel $1,000.00 per motion, for a total of $4,000.00, because the plaintiff did not provide a justification for the delay in providing the discovery. The court ordered that the defendants' motions be denied and that the plaintiff be sanctioned.
