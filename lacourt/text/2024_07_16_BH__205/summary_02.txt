And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Next Health Inc. to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff David Gomez. The court has sustained the demurrer as to the strict products liability claim without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot re-file the claim with additional information. The court has overruled the demurrer as to the negligence claim, meaning that the plaintiff's claim for negligence can proceed.

The court has also denied the motion to strike certain paragraphs from the FAC as moot, since the strict products liability claim has been sustained without leave to amend.

The case involves a claim for negligence and strict products liability arising from an Infrared LED Light Bed Therapy session that resulted in a third-degree burn to David Gomez. The court has found that the plaintiff has stated a cause of action for negligence, but that the strict products liability claim fails because Next Health Inc. is a service provider, not a manufacturer.
