Case Name: The
Real A-Team Corporation v. Independence HCM Inc., et al


Case #: 23SMCV03909
 
Hearing Date (if any): July 16, 2024
 
Defaulting Party:
Defendants Independence HCM Inc. and Dov Jacobs.


Total Amount: $211,745.35
 
BACKGROUND:  
 
On August 21, 2023, Plaintiff The Real A-Team Corporation
filed a complaint against Defendants Independence HCM Inc. and Dov Jacobs. 
 
Plaintiff, a consulting firm, helps home health companies
with placement, compliance, billing, and recertification for Medicare and
Medi-Cal. (Compl. ¶ 7.) Defendants provide in-home care billed to Medicare or
other insurance. (Compl. ¶ 8.) From May 2017 to August 2018, Plaintiff entered
into four service agreements with Legacy and Defendants, who claimed to be the
same organization. Plaintiff performed its obligations, but Defendants did not
pay in full. (Compl. ¶ 9-10.)
 
Defendants assured Plaintiff they would pay for all services
and managed Legacy’s accounts, making some payments to Plaintiff. (Compl. ¶
11.) However, several checks from Defendants bounced due to insufficient funds.
(Compl. ¶ 12.) On September 5, 2019, a $30,000 check from Defendants was
returned, causing Plaintiff to incur a bank fee. (Compl. ¶ 13.) Plaintiff
continued to provide services and follow up on payments but suspended services
on September 12, 2019, due to non-payment. (Compl. ¶ 14-15.)
 
Plaintiff filed for arbitration with JAMS against Legacy and
Defendants Jacobs and Independence. The arbitration, held in Los Angeles with
Hon. Linda L. Miller, Ret. as arbitrator, resulted in an award of $192,424.21
in favor of Plaintiff on December 21, 2020. (Compl. ¶ 16-19.) Plaintiff filed a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award in the Superior Court of California on
June 30, 2021. (Compl. ¶ 20.) On October 13, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Motion to
Confirm Arbitration Award, which the Court granted on June 8, 2023, confirming
the award against Legacy. (Compl. ¶ 21.).
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Jacobs, owner of both
Legacy and Independence, disregarded corporate formalities, representing the
entities as one and liable for Legacy’s debts. (Compl. ¶ 2.2) Independence’s
employees worked for Legacy, and Defendants managed Legacy’s accounts,
commingling funds and using business funds for personal expenses. (Compl. ¶
23-24.) Defendants engaged in fraudulent activities to avoid their obligations,
misrepresenting their authority and responsibilities, leading Plaintiff to believe
they were liable for services rendered. (Compl. ¶ 25.) Defendants benefited
from Plaintiff’s services and actively participated in related actions. (Compl.
¶ 26.)

Civil Code § 1719(a)(2) states:
 
Notwithstanding any penal sanctions that may apply,
any person who passes a check on insufficient funds shall be liable to the
payee for damages equal to treble the amount of the check if a written demand
for payment is mailed by certified mail to the person who had passed a check on
insufficient funds and the written demand informs this person of (A) the
provisions of this section, (B) the amount of the check, and (C) the amount of
the service charge payable to the payee. The person who had passed a check on
insufficient funds shall have 30 days from the date the written demand was
mailed to pay the amount of the check, the amount of the service charge payable
to the payee, and the costs to mail the written demand for payment. If this
person fails to pay in full the amount of the check, the service charge payable
to the payee, and the costs to mail the written demand within this period, this
person shall then be liable instead for the amount of the check, minus any
partial payments made toward the amount of the check or the service charge
within 30 days of the written demand, and damages equal to treble that amount,
which shall not be less than one hundred dollars ($100) nor more than one
thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500). When a person becomes liable for treble
damages for a check that is the subject of a written demand, that person shall
no longer be liable for any service charge for that check and any costs to mail
the written demand.
