Summary:
The Judge denies Antelope's motion for a preliminary injunction, which sought to eject Plaintiffs from Antelope's premises. The Judge finds that the balance of harms weighs against the injunction, as the potential harm to Plaintiffs from an injunction is far greater than the potential harm to Antelope. The Judge also notes that the parties' contentions on the validity of the notice of nonrenewal and estoppel are fundamental disputes that require clearer argumentation before a mandatory injunction can be issued.
