Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike portions of the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The Plaintiff, Jane Doe, has alleged that the California State University (CSU) failed to accommodate her disability and retaliated against her for disability-related complaints. The Defendant, CSU, has moved to strike certain allegations in the SAC, including allegations related to the OCR, CSUCI conduct, DHR investigations, and prior suicide attempt.

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to strike the allegations related to the OCR and CSUCI conduct, finding that these allegations are relevant to the Plaintiff's claims. However, the Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to strike the allegations related to the prior suicide attempt, finding that this information is not relevant to any cause of action pled in the SAC.

The Judge has also granted the Defendant's motion to strike the prayer for attorneys' fees without leave to amend. Finally, the Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to file a Third Amended Complaint (TAC) within ten days, and has set a conference to discuss the case management.
