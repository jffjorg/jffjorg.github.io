And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This case involves a dispute between American Family Connect Property and Casualty Insurance Company (Plaintiff) and Michael Gonzalez, Rosario Gonzalez, Miguel Angel Gonzalez, Mission Fleet Services, LLC, and Robert Joshua Rodrigo (Defendants). The Plaintiff seeks a declaration that there is no coverage under the policy. The dispute revolves around whether the Defendants disclosed the subject accident when they added the vehicle to the policy. The Plaintiff contends that the vehicle was removed from the insurance policy prior to the accident and that the addition was due to the material nondisclosure of the accident. The Court has granted the Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, finding that the Defendants failed to raise a triable issue of material fact.

The Court's ruling is based on the evidence presented, including the Plaintiff's website records and the Defendants' joint declaration. The Court has overruled the Defendants' objections and has found that the Plaintiff met its burden of showing that the subject vehicle was removed from the insurance policy prior to the accident and that the addition was due to the material nondisclosure of the accident.
