And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of counsel Krista M. Enns and Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan & Aronoff LLP to be relieved as counsel of record for Defendant SmileDirectClub LLC. The court finds that an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship has occurred due to the client's bankruptcy and insufficient assets to pay counsel. Counsel has not been paid for work since August 2023 and has submitted all mandatory forms. The court determines that the client will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal since there is no trial date and the action is stayed. The order is effective upon the filing of proof of service of the order on the client, and the court sets an OSC re: representation to be heard at the next status conference.
