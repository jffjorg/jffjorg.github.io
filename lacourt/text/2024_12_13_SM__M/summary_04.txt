And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by defendant Juanta Clark to quash service of summons. Clark is challenging the service of summons that took place prior to October 31, 2024. However, Clark does not contest the validity of the facially valid service that was recorded on November 8, 2024, following an order permitting posting of service. Therefore, the judge has denied the motion to quash service of summons. The judge's decision is based on the burden of proof being placed on the plaintiff to establish the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, and the filing of a proof of service creating a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper.
