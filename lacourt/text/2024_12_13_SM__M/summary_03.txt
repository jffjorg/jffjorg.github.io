And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel initial discovery responses from the Defendant. The Plaintiff served the Defendant with discovery requests, including requests for production of documents, requests for admissions, and form interrogatories, on September 27 and 30, 2024. The Defendant failed to respond to these requests. The Court will order the Defendant to respond to the special interrogatories and form interrogatories within 10 days. The requests for admissions will be deemed admitted against the Defendant unless the Defendant provides a proposed response in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220 at the hearing. The Court denies the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses as to the requests for production of documents, as the Plaintiff did not comply with the additional requirements for such motions. The Court also denies sanctions.
