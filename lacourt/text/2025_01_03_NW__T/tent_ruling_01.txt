  Case Number:  23VECV01030    Hearing Date:   January 3, 2025    Dept:  T 23VECV01030 HART V LASALLEMotion to compel deposition of Alphonsus Lamar Palmer: Granted. Plaintiff moves to compel deposition of Alphonsus Lamar Palmer, a former employee at Legacy (according to the motion.) The motion is based on the grounds that Mr. Palmer was noticed to appear for a deposition on May 29, 2024 when he was an employee at Legacy but the discovery stay of May 24, 2024 prevented the deposition from going forward.  Mr. Palmer was personally served with a subpoena for his deposition on 4/23/2024 at 10:20 a.m. by a registered process server.  Accordingly, regardless of whether he is currently an employee of a defendant, Mr. Palmer is required to appear for his deposition.  Therefore, Mr. Palmer is ordered to appear for his deposition by Zoom on _________, 2025 at _____ a.m. and is ordered to produce the following documents direct to Ms. Hart no later than _______. 1. Communications about plaintiff, 2. Communications about LEGACY, and 3. Palmer resignation letter. Ms. Hart also has requested an order that all objections are reserved except as to privilege, to avoid numerous interruptions with the deposition.  The court grants that request.  All objections except those related to privilege are reserved for all defendants.  Objections based on vague, ambiguous, relevance, etc. etc. shall not be stated on the record.  Motion to compel start of depositions at 8:30 a.m. or 9:00 a.m.: Granted.  Depositions shall start no later than 9 a.m.  While not a motion to compel the depositions of Ms. O’Brien or Mr. Sapp, the court can see that there were dates and times when the depositions could be taken with 1 week in between.  For instance, she could have taken the deposition of Ms. O’Brien on 12/3 and Mr. Sapp on 12/10 or 11.  The court sees nothing wrong with the defense offering multiple dates and times for deposition.  There is no basis for attorney fees because the statute under which sanctions were requested was CCP section 2023.030.  The court is unaware of what the discovery abuse is.  This is not a motion to compel a deposition.  The court orders that the parties depose Ms. O’Brien and Ms. Sapp to start no later than 9 a.m. and at least 7 days apart.  Ms. Hart has been provided, according to Legacy, 49 different options for depositions.  If it is correct that Ms. Hart has not made any dates available for her own deposition, she should do so forthwith. Mr. Kellener has appeared limited scope for the deposition of plaintiff and the deposition of Legacy PMQ.   He is directed to provide dates for plaintiff's deposition. Ms. McKinnon’s email of Dec. 2nd states availability: Defendant Steven Sapp o January 21st at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o January 23rd at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o January 27th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o January 28th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 4th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 5th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 7th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 10th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 11th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 12th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 13th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom   Non-Party Witness, Amelia Johnson o January 29th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o January 30th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 5th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 7th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 10th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 11th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 12th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom o February 13th at 9:00 a.m. via Zoom Also, January 13th at 9:00 a.m. for Ms. O’Brien; January 21st at 9:00 a.m. for Mr. Sapp; and January 29th, 30th, or 31st at 9:00 a.m. for the PMK for Legacy. LaSalle Defendants' Ex parte application to enforce settlement agreement: Deny. The court will find that there has been
timely notice as there is a declaration under oath that the ex parte papers
were emailed to plaintiff on 12/31/3034, which is two court days before the
hearing, showing the date, time, location, and basis for the application.  The court denies the application because an applicant must make an
affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony
based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other
statutory basis for granting relief ex parte and there is no such evidence provided
to the court. In the absence of competent testimony showing irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory
basis for granting relief, the motion cannot be heard on ex parte application and must be filed on regular notice after
properly reserving a court hearing date.
