  - "A risk arises out of the employment when 'in the context of the particular enterprise an employee's conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer's business.'"
  - "The nexus required for respondeat superior liability—that the tort be engendered by or arise from the work—is to be distinguished from 'but for' causation… the incident leading to injury must be an ‘outgrowth’ of the employment; the risk of tortious injury must be ‘inherent in the working environment’ or “typical of or broadly incidental to the enterprise [the employer] has undertaken.’"
  - "If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court."
