Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge grants, in part, the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the Demand for Production. The Plaintiff seeks production of all photographs and videos, including sub rosa footage, in the possession, custody, and control of the Defendant. The Defendant objects to the production of the sub rosa evidence citing the attorney work product doctrine.

The Judge finds that the sub rosa evidence is the work product of defense counsel and is entitled to qualified protection. However, the Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has a legitimate interest in preventing unfair surprise and that the production of the sub rosa evidence will prevent such surprise.

The Judge orders the production of the sub rosa evidence after the Plaintiff's deposition, provided that the Defendant intends to use such evidence, pre-trial or at trial. The Defendant must notify the Plaintiff in writing if it intends to use the sub rosa evidence and produce the evidence within 5 days of that notice.

The Judge finds that the imposition of monetary sanctions is unwarranted and that the parties had a legitimate dispute as to whether the sub rosa evidence should be produced.
