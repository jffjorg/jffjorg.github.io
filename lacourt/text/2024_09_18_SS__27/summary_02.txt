And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion from Arctic, the plaintiff, regarding the failure to comply with the designation deadline. Arctic claims that the failure was due to inadvertence and excusable neglect, arguing that she had agreed to a different deadline with defendant Costco. However, the judge notes that upon reviewing the meet and confer emails between the parties, it appears that Arctic was firm in its stance that the deadline would not be extended. The judge questions how Arctic could have overlooked Costco's objection and thought that her disclosure was timely, given the lack of an agreement between Arctic and Costco. The judge is not ruling on the issue of excusable neglect at this time.
