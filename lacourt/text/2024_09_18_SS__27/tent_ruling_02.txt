Within
that motion, Plaintiff contends that the failure to comply with the designation
deadline was due to inadvertence and excusable neglect because she had agreed
to a different designation date with Defendant Costco.  The Court is not asked to rule on that issue
by Plaintiff at this time but notes that upon reviewing the meet and confer
emails between the parties on extending the expert discovery date, it appears
clear that Arctic was firm in its stance that it would not extend the expert
disclosure deadline. It is unclear how Plaintiff could have overlooked Arctic’s
objection and think that her disclosure was timely pursuant to an agreement
only between Costco and Plaintiff.
