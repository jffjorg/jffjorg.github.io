define or describe work product. Courts have resolved whether particular
materials constitute work product on a case-by-case basis, although they have
sometimes taken different approaches.  Some
courts have attempted to answer the question by distinguishing between
derivative or  nonderivative material, or
between interpretative and evidentiary material.  These cases have concluded that only
derivative or interpretive material—material created by or derived from an
attorney's work reflecting the attorney's evaluation of the law or
facts—constitutes work product.  Examples
of such material include diagrams prepared for trial, audit reports,
appraisals, and other expert opinions, developed as a result of the initiative
of counsel in preparing for trial.  Nonderivative
material—material that is only evidentiary in nature—does not constitute work
product. Examples of such material include the identity and location of
physical evidence or witnesses.”  (Coito,

Superior Court (Jones) (2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 75, 81, aff'd and
remanded  (2021) 12 Cal.5th 348 [Work
product includes “materials compiled by investigators and other agents in
preparation for trial”].)
