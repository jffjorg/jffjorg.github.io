[2] The FAC contained
the same COAs against the same Defendants but changed the date of the incident
from July 1, 2020 (original complaint p. 4 of 5 of PDF) to August 22,
2019. 


[3] For emphasis, nearly
three years after filing the original complaint, Plaintiff filed a SAC. 
 


[4] In the court docket,
it is labeled as ‘Stipulation and Order Stipulation and Order RE
Second Amended Complaint.’ The SAC is found as Exhibit A starting on p. 6 of 16
of PDF. 
 


[5] The opposition
heavily references the ADA, but the ADA is not an asserted COA. Additionally, the
SAC states that the new COAs are “being alleged and added to the already
existing causes of action for negligence and premises liability, both of which
are plead within Plaintiff’s initial complaint” when the SAC does not list
negligence and premises liability. (SAC p. 2.) In its opposition to the MTS, Plaintiff states that such
omission was an inadvertent error and that “all parties [were] aware that
Plaintiff never intended to dismiss” the negligence and premises liability
COAs. (Opp. p. 4.) Regardless of intent, the COAs must be found within the four
corners of the operative pleading. 
 


[6] The complaint and
SAC were both filed by Steven Ibarra, though the Pollard Firm, APC also became
associated with the case as of the filing of the SAC. 
 


[7] As both demurring
Defendants make the same arguments, the court will provide a consolidated
analysis. 
 


[8] In Gatto v.
County of Sanoma (cited by both Defendants), the court determined
that Code of Civil Procedure §335.1’s two-year statute of limitations applies
to Unruh causes of action because Unruh Act claims based on personal injury on
negligence and denial of equal access derive from common law principles. (Gatto
v. County of Sanoma (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 744, 760.)
 


[9] The original
complaint and FAC were filed on judicial council forms whereas the SAC provided
43 paragraphs/allegations. 
 


[10] Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 citing Speegle v. Board of Fire Underwriters
(1946) 29 Cal.2d 34, 42),


[11] Though Plaintiff conclusively
argues that the facts are similar without offering an analysis. 


[12] According to Vons,
it is unaware of any settlement attempts by Plaintiff prior to September 2022.
(Vons p. 5:2-3.)

to [him] to inspect the slope of the area where Mr. Macias fell.”])
