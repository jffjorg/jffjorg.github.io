And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the demurrer by defendants Vons and SLX. The Plaintiff, represented by Steven Ibarra, filed an original complaint, which was later amended to include new causes of action (COAs). The Judge notes that the COAs must be found within the four corners of the operative pleading and that the Plaintiff's intention to add new COAs is unclear. The Judge also questions the Plaintiff's failure to list existing COAs, such as negligence and premises liability, in the Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The Judge will provide a consolidated analysis of the demurrer arguments made by both defendants.
