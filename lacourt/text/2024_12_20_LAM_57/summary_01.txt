The court also appoints a deposition referee, Retired Judge Mark Mooney. The court rules on the plaintiff's requests for production of documents, granting some and denying others due to overbreadth or irrelevance. The court denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The parties are to use these rulings to guide them in resolving the parallel requests in the motion to compel Defendant K&K to provide further responses to requests for production of documents.
