And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in an employment action where the defendants seek to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, Jose Guerrero, argues that the defendants waived arbitration when they failed to timely pay arbitration fees. The defendants argue that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies and that the FAA preempts California Arbitration Act (CAA) Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.97(a)(1). The Court concludes that the FAA applies and that the procedures of the CAA, including section 1281.97, do not apply. The Court also rejects the plaintiff's argument that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable because it allows for judicial review of the arbitrator's award. The Court grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the action.
