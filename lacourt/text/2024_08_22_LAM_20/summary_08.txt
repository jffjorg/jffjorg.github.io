And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this employment action, where the defendants (Reyes Coca-Cola Bottling, LLC and Reyes Holdings, LLC) seek to compel arbitration of the matter based on an arbitration agreement executed by the plaintiff (April Berryhill) as part of her employment. The plaintiff argues that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not apply, that there is not sufficient evidence of a valid agreement to arbitrate, and that the agreement is unconscionable.

The court finds that there is sufficient evidence that Berryhill signed the arbitration agreement electronically, and that she cannot avoid the terms of the agreement by claiming she does not recall signing it. The court also finds that the agreement applies to successors and heirs of the parties, and that any claims that are not explicitly permitted by the agreement are not precluded.

The plaintiff argues that the agreement is unconscionable because it requires her to bear her own fees and costs, and because it precludes certain types of claims, including wrongful death actions. The court finds that these arguments lack merit, as the agreement specifically provides for the arbitrator to award fees and costs to the prevailing party, and that the agreement does not preclude wrongful death actions.

The court also rejects the plaintiff's argument that the agreement is unconscionable because it requires her to arbitrate sexual harassment claims, as the End Forced Arbitration Act (EFAA) does not apply to this case.

Finally, the court finds that the agreement's confidentiality provision is a low degree of substantive unconscionability, and that even if there were a high degree of procedural unconscionability, the court cannot determine that the agreement is unconscionable.

Based on these findings, the court grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending arbitration.
