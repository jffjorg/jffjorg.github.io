This is a habitability matter. On July 2, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ notice of related case as to case no. 23STCV23900.  The Court stated that it “has already consolidated this matter with Evans, et al. v. Rosecrans Avenue Property LLC, et al., Case No. 22STCV11702 and Barboza, et al. v. Rosecrans Avenue Property LLC, et al., Case No. 23STCV06376.  The Court is not under any obligation to relate and consolidate a continuum of cases.  The Court will not be forced into an unmanageable position.”  The Court’s conclusion is reinforced by the state of the docket at this time.  Plaintiffs now seek to consolidate the instant matter with 23STCV23900.The request is improper because the Court declined to relate these cases.  (Local Rule 3.3(g)(1) [“Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that department.”].)Therefore, the Motion to Consolidate is denied.  Plaintiffs to give notice.
