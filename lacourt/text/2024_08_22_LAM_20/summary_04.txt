And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a habitability matter. On July 2, 2024, the court denied the plaintiffs' notice of related case, stating that it has already consolidated the matter with two other cases. The court will not consolidate a "continuum of cases" and will not be forced into an unmanageable position. The plaintiffs have now sought to consolidate the instant matter with 23STCV23900, but this request is improper because the court declined to relate the cases. The court's decision is reinforced by the state of the docket at this time. The motion to consolidate is denied, and the plaintiffs are ordered to give notice.
