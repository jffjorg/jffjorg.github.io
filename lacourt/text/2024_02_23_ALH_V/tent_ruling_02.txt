BACKGROUND 
 
On May 5, 2023, Plaintiffs Eloise Ferrer and Patrick Ferrer
filed the operative first amended complaint against Defendant Glendale
Adventist Medical Center dba Adventist Medical Glendale and Does 1-10 for
wrongful death (negligence) arising out of the death of Plaintiffs’ mother on
March 9, 2022 following medical care she received in Defendant’s
hospital.  
 
On November 13, 2023, Defendant moved for an order deeming
the truth of all matters specified in Requests for Admissions, Set One, served
on Patrick Ferrer on August 7, 2023 and issuing sanctions against Plaintiff in
the amount of $1,160.00.  
That same day, Defendant moved for an order deeming the
truth of all matters specified in Requests for Admissions, Set One, served on
Eloise Ferrer on August 7, 2023 and issuing sanctions against Plaintiff in the
amount of $1,160.00.  
 
            To date,
Plaintiffs have not filed an opposition to either motion.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
“If a
party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply:¿ 
 
o         
The party to whom the requests for admission are directed
waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on
the protection for work product . . . . The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied:¿ 
o         
 
§  The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.¿ 
 
§  The
party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.¿ 
 
§  The
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)¿ 
 
§  The
court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests
for admission admitted, “unless
it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the
requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)¿ 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Defendant moves for two orders, each deeming the truth of
all matters specified in the requests for admission served on Plaintiffs Eloise
and Patrick Ferrer, and sanctions in connection with the motions. The Court
will analyze the requests pertaining to Eloise and Patrick together.  
 
A.   
 Requests for
Admissions
 
The Court finds Defendant’s requests regarding its requests
for admission are merited.  
On August 7, 2023, Defendant propounded and electronically
served written discovery on Plaintiffs, including Requests for Admissions, Set
One. (Schofield Decl. ¶ 3.) The responses were due on or before September 8,
2023, but neither Plaintiff served responses to the at-issue discovery by
September 8, 2023 or requested an extension to respond. (Ibid.)
Defendant granted multiple extensions to Plaintiff to provide responses up
until November 3, 2023, but as of the date of filing the instant motions,
Plaintiff did not provide any. (Schofield
Decl. ¶¶ 4-7.) 
 
As Plaintiffs have failed to timely provide responses to
Defendant’s Requests for Admissions, Set One, and do not oppose these motions,
the truth of the matters contained within the requests are deemed
admitted.  
 
B.    
Sanctions 
 
“It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)¿ 
 
Defendant seeks $1,160.00 against each Patrick Ferrer and
Eloise Ferrer in connection with filing the instant motions. Defense counsel,
Kylie Schofield, spent three hours drafting each motion and anticipated
spending one hour reviewing the opposition and one hour appearing at the
hearing on this motion. (Schofield
Decl. ¶ 8.) Schofield has an hourly rate of $220. (Ibid.) 
 
Given that the motions before the Court are nearly
identical, the Court finds that three hours total is a reasonable amount of
time to allot for drafting both motions. Furthermore, no opposition was filed.
Therefore, the Court finds that Schofield is entitled to reasonable fees of
$1,220.00 (five hours plus two $60.00 filing fees).  
 
Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS Defendant’s motion
for an order deeming the RFAs served on Plaintiffs admitted. Furthermore, the
Court GRANTS sanctions against Plaintiffs Eloise Ferrer and Patrick Ferrer each
in the amount of $1,220.00.   
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED. 
 
DATED:  February 23, 2024
