`Significant Statements`:
  - "To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff's proof need not be alleged."
  - "A demurrer 'does not admit contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.'"
  - "Under the statutory plea in abatement, '[t]he pendency of another earlier action growing out of the same transaction and between the same parties is a ground for abatement of the second action.'"
  - "Plaintiff's declaratory relief claim seeks a determination as to 'the rights and obligations of the parties under the settlement contract.'"
  - "Entitlement to specific performance requires a party to show peculiar facts justifying this form of relief."
