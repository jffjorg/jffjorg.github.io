[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
 
 
DEFENDANT ELVA SALDANA’S DEMURRER TO
  COMPLAINT 
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:             Defendant Elva Saldana 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Progressive Select Insurance
Company 
 
Demurrer 
 
The court considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply papers
filed in connection with this motion.  
 
BACKGROUND 
 
Plaintiff Progressive Select Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) initiated
this action against Defendant Elva Saldana (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50,
asserting the following causes of action: (1) declaratory relief; and (2)
specific performance.  
 
The operative complaint alleges that Plaintiff’s insured, Nan Ying Li,
was involved in a motor vehicle accident with Defendant on February 8, 2022.
(Compl. ¶ 8.) On November 4, 2022, Defendant made a written statement demand to
Plaintiff for her bodily injury claims in exchange for the policy limits for
Plaintiff’s insured as well as a release for the insured. (Compl. ¶ 9.) The
demand letter is alleged to have referenced Plaintiff’s insured at least five
time, and based on this letter, Defendant demanded acceptance in writing by
November 14, 2022. (Ibid.) Based on this demand letter, Defendant
claimed to have medical bills in the amount of $18,475. (Ibid.) On or
about November 11, 2022, Plaintiff sent a letter to Defendant’s attorney
accepting the demand issued in the November 4, 2022 letter. (Id. at ¶
10.) Based on this acceptance, Plaintiff claims that a valid and enforceable
settlement agreement existed regarding Defendant’s personal injury claims
against Plaintiff’s insured. (Id. at ¶ 11.) On November 14, 2022,
Plaintiff emailed Defendant’s attorney with the documents that had been
previously sent on November 11, 2022, along with a requested return of the
executed release. (Id. at ¶ 12.) Defendant is alleged to have refused to
acknowledge the existence of a settlement agreement between the parties and
then made a second demand on December 30, 2022 in the amount of $3,250,000
based on medical bills that by then amounted to $233,040. (Id. at ¶ 13.)
In response, Plaintiff reminded counsel that the prior November 4, 2022 demand
letter had been accepted. (Ibid.) 
 
On October 13, 2023, Defendant filed the instant demurrer. On February 8,
2024, Plaintiff filed its opposition. Thereafter, on February 15, 2024,
Defendant filed its reply.  
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
 
Plaintiff requests the court to take judicial notice of the following:
(1) The filing date of the operative Complaint on August 3, 2023, in the
instant matter of Progressive Select Insurance Company v. Elva Saldana, Los
Angeles County Superior Court, Glendale Division, Case No. 23GDCV01641; and (2)
The operative Complaint filed on August 15, 2023, in the matter of Elva
Saldana, Melorie Kireev v. Nanying Li aka Vicky Li aka Nian Li, Huang JinHung
aka Jinhuang Huang, Los Angeles County Superior Court, Case No.
23AHCV01843.  
 
Pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(d), the court grants this request and
takes judicial notice of the requested documents.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face
of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are
judicially noticeable. (¿¿Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318¿¿.)
“¿To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to
state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part
of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.¿” (¿¿C.A. v. William S. Hart
Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872¿¿.) For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded. (¿Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967¿.) A demurrer “¿does not admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿” (¿¿Daar v. Yellow Cab Co.
(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713¿¿.) 
 
“A plea in abatement pursuant to section 430.10, subdivision (c), may be
made by demurrer or answer when there is another action pending between the
same parties on the same cause of action. In determining whether the causes of
action are the same for purposes of pleas in abatement, the rule is that such a
plea may be maintained only¿where a judgment in the first action would be a
complete bar to the second action.¿Where a demurrer is sustained on the ground
of another action pending, the proper order is not a dismissal, but abatement
of further proceedings pending termination of the first action.”  (Plant
Insulation Co. v. Fibreboard Corp. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 787–788
(internal citations omitted).) 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
As a preliminary matter, it is noted that the meet and confer requirement
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41 has not been satisfied.
Defendant’s counsel fails to attest that the parties telephonically engaged in
discussions over the merits of the instant demurrer. (See generally
Kashani Decl.) The court will
nevertheless proceed to address the merits of the demurrer despite this
deficiency. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(4).) 
A.               
Special Demurrer for Abatement Pursuant to Code of
Civil  
            Procedure § 430.10(c). 
 
“Under the statutory plea in abatement, ‘[t]he pendency of another
earlier action growing out of the same transaction and between the same parties
is a ground for abatement of the second action.’ A statutory plea in
abatement requires that the prior pending action be ‘between the same
parties on the same cause of action.’” (People ex rel. Garamendi v. American
Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 770 (internal
citation and italicization omitted).) 
 
Defendant’s request for abatement is inapplicable because the instant
action is the earlier of the two actions and the two cases do not involve the
same parties.  (See RJN.)  “Under the statutory plea in abatement,
‘[t]he pendency of another earlier action growing out of the same transaction
and between the same parties is a ground for abatement of the second action.” (People
ex rel. Garamendi v. Am. Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20 Cal. App. 4th 760,
770).  Accordingly, the court overrules Defendant’s special demurrer
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10(c). 
 
B.                
First Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief. 
 
Defendant demurs to the first cause of action for declaratory relief on
the ground that it has not been sufficiently pleaded.  
 
In a cause of action for declaratory relief, the pleadings must establish
the following elements: (1) a proper subject of declaratory relief, and (2) an
actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the rights or
obligations of a party. (Lee v. Silva (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 527, 546.) Code of Civil Procedure § 1061
states that a court may refuse to grant declaratory relief when such relief is
“not necessary or proper under all the circumstances.” (Moss v. Moss
(1942) 20 Cal.2d 640, 642; see also DeLaura v. Beckett (2006) 137
Cal.App.4th 542, 545.)  The purpose of a declaratory relief action is “to
set controversies at rest before they lead to repudiation of obligations,
invasions of rights, or commissions of wrongs . . . [Citations.]” (Travers
v. Louden (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 926, 931.)¿ 
 
Defendant first argues that Plaintiff’s claim for declaratory relief is
not necessary because Plaintiff can raise the issue of the whether there is an
enforceable contract in the action Defendant filed against Plaintiff’s insured.
(Demurrer at pp. 5-6, relying on Hagan v. Fairfield (1965) 238 Cal. App.
2d 197, 202.) Defendant also argues that the claim is subject to demurrer
because it improperly seeks adjudication over a past wrong, which is not the
proper use for declaratory relief. (Demurrer at pg. 6, relying on Travers,
supra, 254 Cal.App. 2d at 930.)  
 
 Defendant’s arguments are not persuasive.  As noted, Plaintiff
is not a party to the action that Defendant brought against the inured. 
Nor is the court persuaded that Plaintiff’s declaratory relief claim seeks to
remedy a past wrong. Plaintiff alleges that there is a valid and enforceable
contract between the parties, stemming from Plaintiff’s acceptance of
Defendant’s November 4, 2022 demand letter. (Compl. ¶¶ 10, 16.)  Plaintiff
seeks a determination as to “the rights and obligations of the parties under
the settlement contract.” (Compl. ¶ 18.)  
 
Defendant’s demurrer to the first cause of action is overruled.  
 
C.                
Second Cause of Action for Specific Performance. 
 
As Defendant correctly notes, specific performance is a
remedy, and not a separate cause of action.  (Green Valley Landowners
Assn. v. City of Vallejo (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 425, 433
fn.8.)¿¿Entitlement to specific performance requires a party to show peculiar
facts justifying this form of relief. (See Real Estate Analytics, LLC v.
Vallas (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 463, 472.) The elements for specific
performance are: 1) breach of contract; 2) inadequacy of a legal remedy; 3)
underlying contract reasonable and supported by adequate consideration; 4)
existence of mutuality of remedies; 5) contract terms sufficient and definite
to know what to enforce; and 6) substantial similarity between requested
performance and promised performance. (Ibid.) Further, specific
performance will not be compelled where an adequate remedy exists at law, such
as damages. (See Wilkinson v. Wiederkehr (2002) 101 Cal. App. 4th 822,
830; Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp. (1967) 255
Cal. App. 2d 300, 306.) 
 
Defendant argues that the terms of the agreement are
insufficiently alleged.  The court disagrees.  Plaintiff alleges that
the parties had an enforceable agreement whereby Defendant would settle her
bodily injury claim against the inured in exchange for the Plaintiff’s payments
of the insured’s policy limits.  (Complaint ¶¶ 9-13, 20.)  The
complaint sets for the elements for a breach of contract.  (Levy v.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co.¿(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1, 5.
[“[A]ll¿essential elements of a breach of contract cause of¿action[] must be
pleaded with specificity.”]; Miles v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 394, 402 [“The correct rule is that ‘a plaintiff may plead the
legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.’”].)  
Plaintiff seeks the same performance as that alleged in the in the complaint
and has also alleged that there no adequate remedy other than the one sought,
specifically a release of Defendant’s personal injury claims.  
 
The demurrer to the second cause of action is overruled. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the court overrules demurrer. 
Defendant Elva Saldana is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
