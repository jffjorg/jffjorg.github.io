And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by ARRI Americas, Inc. to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint and the motion to strike punitive damages. The demurrer argues that the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action are uncertain and have not been sufficiently alleged. The motion to strike argues that the portions of the complaint supporting punitive damages should be stricken.

The judge has ordered the parties to file a joint statement regarding the meet and confer and the status of the amended complaint. The hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike has been continued to April 16, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.

The judge has also ordered ARRI Americas, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
