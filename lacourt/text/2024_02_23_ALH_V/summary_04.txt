Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer with a motion to strike filed by U.S. Bank against Pobeda Services Inc. The demurrer argues that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for negligence, fraud and intentional misrepresentation, conversion, trespass to chattels, and bad faith.

The Court sustains the demurrer for the following causes of action:

* General Negligence: The Court holds that the California Commercial Code displaces the cause of action for negligence and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
* Fraud and Intentional Misrepresentation: The Court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, finding that the complaint fails to specifically plead facts that show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.
* Conversion: The Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the relationship between a bank and its depositor is that of debtor and creditor, and that the bank does not act as a trustee and cannot be charged with converting the deposit to its own use.
* Trespass to Chattels: The Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the complaint fails to plead facts that show an intentional interference with the possession of personal property.
* Bad Faith: The Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the insurance code does not apply to banks and that the complaint fails to plead facts that show bad faith.

The Court grants the motion to strike paragraph 4 of the prayer for relief with leave to amend.
