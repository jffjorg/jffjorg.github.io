And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendants, Ani Papazyan and Last Stop 4 Pain. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's claim for general negligence is barred by the statute of limitations, but the judge found that there is no evidence in the pleading to support this argument. The judge also denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which sought to add two new defendants and allegations of general negligence. The judge found that the proposed amendments were not proper, as they anticipated an adverse ruling by the court on the statute of limitations issue.
