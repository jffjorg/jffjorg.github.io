And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion contesting the good faith of the settlement agreement between Alexander de Leon Giron and the Plaintiffs, Nisha Norberg and Gaige Woolfield, is granted. The settlement agreement was reached for $30,000, which is deemed unreasonably low compared to the potential liability of the settling defendants. The Judge finds that the settlement amount is disproportionately low and does not take into account the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants. Additionally, there is no evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants. The Judge notes that neither Giron nor the Plaintiffs filed an Opposition to the motion, which may be construed as a concession on the merits.
