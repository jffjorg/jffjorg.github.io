The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion contesting the good faith of the settlement agreement between Alexander de Leon Giron and the Plaintiffs, Nisha Norberg and Gaige Woolfield, is granted. The settlement agreement was reached for $30,000, which is deemed unreasonably low compared to the potential liability of the settling defendants. The Judge finds that the settlement amount is disproportionately low and does not take into account the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants. Additionally, there is no evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants. The Judge notes that neither Giron nor the Plaintiffs filed an Opposition to the motion, which may be construed as a concession on the merits.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court is considering a motion to contest the good faith of a settlement between plaintiffs Nisha Norberg and Gaige Woolfield and defendant Alexander de Leon Giron. The settlement was for $30,000 and was reached on behalf of both plaintiffs. The County of Los Angeles (COLA), which is a cross-complainant in the case, is arguing that the settlement is not in good faith because it is disproportionately low.

The Court is applying the Tech-Bilt factors to determine whether the settlement is in good faith. The factors include a rough approximation of the plaintiffs' total recovery and the settling defendant's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, a recognition that a settlor should pay less than if found liable at trial, the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants.

The Court finds that the settlement does not meet the Tech-Bilt factors because it is disproportionately low. The Court notes that the settlement amount is only a fraction of the actual damages claimed by the plaintiffs and that it would result in a significant unfair share of liability for COLA if the settlement is not approved. The Court also finds that there is no evidence of Giron's financial information or insurance policy limits, which weighs against a good faith determination.

Based on these findings, the Court grants COLA's motion to contest the good faith of the settlement and denies Giron's application for determination of good faith settlement.

**Significant Statements:**

* "A determination by the court that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault." (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6(c))
* "The party asserting the lack of good faith shall have the burden of proof on that issue." (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6(d))
* "A court not only looks at the alleged tortfeasor's liability to the plaintiff, but it must also consider the culpability of the tortfeasor vis-à-vis other parties alleged to be responsible for the same injury." (TSI Seismic Tenant Space, Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 159, 166)
* "A settlement of a personal injury lawsuit is in 'good faith' where a defendant pays the plaintiff the limit of the defendant's insurance policy and has no assets, even though the amount paid in settlement is far less than the likely amount of a judgment against the defendant were the case to go to trial." (Schmid v. Superior Court (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1244, 1245-6)
* "Prevention of collusion is but a means to the end of preventing unreasonably low settlements which prejudice a nonparticipating tortfeasor. The price of a settlement is the prime badge of its good or bad faith." (River Garden Farms, Inc. v. Superior Court (1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 986, 996)
