## Tentative Ruling Summary:

**Case Number:** 23AVCV00370
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Dept:** A14

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiffs:** Susan Ekdahl (individually and as Administrator of the Estate of Edward A. Ekdahl), and Edward A. Ekdahl (Estate)
* **Defendant:** Lancaster Hospital Corporation dba Palmdale Regional Medical Center ("PRMC") and Dr. Sonia P. Sethi ("Dr. Sethi")

**Subject:** Wrongful Death Action

**Facts:**

* Edward A. Ekdahl ("Decedent") was admitted to PRMC on January 03, 2022, with Dr. Sethi as his attending physician.
* Decedent was connected to IV, oxygen, and monitoring equipment.
* Around 6:00 pm on January 03, 2022, Decedent removed his equipment and went to the bathroom unattended.
* Decedent collapsed and went into cardiac arrest in the bathroom.
* Medical staff were unable to retrieve him due to a locked bathroom door.
* Decedent was later transferred to the ICU and died on January 13, 2022.

**Causes of Action:**

* Wrongful Death against PRMC and Dr. Sethi
* Survivor Cause of Action – Medical Negligence against PRMC and Dr. Sethi
* Survivor Cause of Action – Negligence: Premises Liability against PRMC

**Legal Issues:**

* PRMC's demurrer to the third cause of action (Premises Liability)

**Arguments:**

* **PRMC:**

    * The premises liability claim is duplicative of the medical negligence claim.
    * The FAC lacks sufficient facts to support a dangerous condition on the premises.
    * The FAC relies on the alleged failure to supervise Decedent, which falls under professional negligence, not premises liability.
* **Plaintiffs:**

    * The premises liability claim asserts negligence for PRMC's failure to provide a safe premises for all persons, not just patients.
    * They argue this is distinct from professional negligence and analogous to Johnson v. Open Door Community Health Centers.

**Ruling:**

The Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.

**Reasoning:**

* The Court found that the arguments presented by both parties support the conclusion that the claim is one of professional negligence, not ordinary negligence.
* The Court determined that amendment would not rectify the deficiencies in the premises liability claim.

**Key Statutes and Cases:**

* Code of Civil Procedure Section 430.10(e)
* Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5
* Bellamy v. Central Valley General Hospital (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 797

```

And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has decided to sustain the Demurrer filed by the defendant, Lancaster Hospital Corporation dba Palmdale Regional Medical Center (PRMC), without leave to amend. The Demurrer challenged the Third Cause of Action (Survivor Cause of Action – Negligence: Premises Liability) of the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (FAC).

The Judge found that the Third Cause of Action is duplicative of the Second Cause of Action (Survivor Cause of Action – Medical Negligence) and fails to add any additional facts or theories of recovery. The Judge also noted that the pleadings, in conjunction with the case law presented by both parties, show that an amendment would not rectify the deficiencies within this cause of action.

The Judge cited several cases, including Bellamy v. Central Valley General Hospital, which held that a plaintiff cannot state causes of action for ordinary negligence as well as professional negligence on the same facts. The Judge also noted that the cases cited by both parties support an interpretation that the claim Plaintiffs seek to recover on is one of professional negligence, not ordinary negligence.

The Judge granted the Demurrer and dismissed the Third Cause of Action without leave to amend.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:
The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Susan Ekdahl, individually and as Administrator of the Estate of Edward A. Ekdahl, against Lancaster Hospital Corporation dba Palmdale Regional Medical Center. The case involves a wrongful death action, and the defendant has filed a demurrer to the Third Cause of Action (Survivor Cause of Action – Negligence: Premises Liability). The plaintiff argues that this cause of action is a separately pled claim that allows for an alternative claim for relief, while the defendant argues that it is duplicative of the Second Cause of Action (Survivor Cause of Action – Medical Negligence). The judge has found that the Third Cause of Action does not state a cause of action and is duplicative of the Second Cause of Action. The judge has also found that the defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, as it is probable that amendment would be futile. The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.

Summary:

This is a summary of a tentative ruling in a wrongful death action. Plaintiffs
allege that the decedent was neglected while in the care of Lancaster Hospital
Corporation dba Palmdale Regional Medical Center, resulting in his death. The
hospital and Dr. Sethi demurred to the premises liability claim in the plaintiffs'
first amended complaint, arguing it is duplicative and lacks sufficient facts. The
court has determined that the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, as
amendment would not rectify the deficiencies within this cause of action. The
defendant's demurrer is therefore sustained.

* **Professional Negligence:** Plaintiffs' Second Cause of Action alleges Dr. Sethi's negligence in her care of Decedent.

* The Court distinguished the case from *Johnson v. Open Door Community Health Centers*, which involved a different factual scenario and a different application of the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA) statute of limitations.

**Key Points:**

* The Court found that the case was more appropriately addressed under the Second Cause of Action, alleging professional negligence.

**Tentative Ruling Summary**

**Case Number:** 23AVCV00370
**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023
**Department:** A14

**Background:** This is a wrongful death action brought by Susan Ekdahl, individually, and as Administrator of the Estate of Edward A. Ekdahl, against Lancaster Hospital Corporation dba Palmdale Regional Medical Center (PRMC) and its attending physician, Dr. Sonia P. Sethi. The decedent, Edward A. Ekdahl, was transported to PRMC's Emergency Department on January 2, 2022, and died on January 13, 2022, due to alleged medical and non-medical negligence.

**Facts:** The decedent was transported to PRMC's Emergency Department and admitted shortly after midnight on January 3, 2022. He was connected to an intravenous line, heated high-flow oxygen, and vital sign monitoring cables. While in the patient room, the decedent removed various lines and cables from his body and proceeded to the bathroom unattended without supervision. A bathroom door that did not have a keypad or key allowed the decedent to lock himself in the bathroom. Medical staff discovered the decedent in cardiac arrest and were unable to retrieve him because the bathroom door was locked.

**Dispute:** PRMC demurs to the Third Cause of Action (Survivor Cause of Action – Negligence: Premises Liability) of the First Amended Complaint, arguing that it is duplicative of the Second Cause of Action (Survivor Cause of Action – Medical Negligence) and fails to add any additional facts or theories of recovery.

**Ruling:** The Court sustains PRMC's demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the pleadings do not state a cause of action for premises liability. The Court finds that the claim is one of professional negligence, not ordinary negligence, and that the alleged breach of duty is related to the medical care provided to the decedent, rather than a general duty to provide a safe premises.

**Intentions:** The Court intends to issue a final ruling after reviewing the opposition and reply filed by the parties.

**Significant Statements:**

* The Court notes that the elements of a negligence claim and a premises liability claim are the same, and that the duty arising from possession and control of property is adherence to the same standard of care that applies in negligence cases.
* The Court distinguishes the case from Johnson v. Open Door Community Health Centers, finding that the case involves professional negligence, not ordinary negligence.
* The Court sustains PRMC's demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the pleadings do not state a cause of action for premises liability.
