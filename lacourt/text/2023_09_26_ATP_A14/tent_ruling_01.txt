Analysis
 
Standard for Approving Minor’s
Compromises – Court approval is required for all settlements of a
minor’s claim or that of a person lacking the capacity to make decisions.  (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.)
 
“[T]he protective role the court
generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a role to assure that
whatever is done is in the minor’s best interests . . . .  [I]ts primary concern is whether the
compromise is sufficient to provide for the minor’s injuries, care and
treatment.”  (Goldberg v. Superior Court (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.)  
 
A petition for court approval of
a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 372
must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952.  The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the
reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  The person compromising the claim on behalf
of the minor or person who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must
attend the hearing on compromise of the claim unless the court for good cause
dispenses with their personal appearance. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).)
 
An order for deposit of funds of
a minor or person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition for the
withdrawal of such funds must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.953
and 7.954.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)
 
-----
 
The petition shows that Varner settled with Defendants Bailey, Jr. and
MSC, together, for a total amount of $3,000.00. $0.00 will be used to pay
medical expenses, $750.00 will be used to pay attorney’s fees, and $0.00 will
be used to pay non-medical expenses, leaving a balance of $2,250.00 for Varner.
Petitioner proposes the net proceeds be deposited into a blocked account on
behalf of Varner.
 
The Court finds the settlements are fair and reasonable. The Court also
finds the requested attorney’s fees, which constitute 25% of the gross
settlement amount, to be reasonable.
 
Conclusion
 
The Petition to Approve the Compromise of Pending
Action on Behalf of Minor Claimant Devin Varner is GRANTED.
