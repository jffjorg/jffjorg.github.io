And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Del Taco, LLC's motion to compel arbitration in the case of Gonzalez v. Del Taco, LLC. The motion was filed on October 4, 2024, and sought to compel arbitration of all claims brought by Guadalupe Gonzalez, the plaintiff, including claims of discrimination, retaliation, and wrongful termination.

The court found that Del Taco and Gonzalez have a valid arbitration agreement in place, and that all of Gonzalez's claims are covered by the agreement. The court also noted that Gonzalez did not file an opposition to the motion, and that Del Taco's counsel indicated that Gonzalez's counsel did not intend to oppose the motion.

As a result, the court granted Del Taco's motion to compel arbitration and stayed all proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration. The court's ruling means that the dispute will be resolved through arbitration, rather than through a trial in court.
