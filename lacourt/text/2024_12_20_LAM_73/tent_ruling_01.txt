The SAC

were residents of a rented dwelling located at 12615 Oxford Avenue #C,
Hawthorne California 90250 (the “Premises”) owned, managed, and operated by Defendants, from
approximately December 2019 through December 2022. (SAC, ¶ 1.) Plaintiffs allege
multiple habitability violations and substandard conditions including: Recurring
water leaks and water intrusion; flooding of the premises, including ceilings,
walls and floors; constructions debris; toilet leakages, overflow and flooding;
sewage from toilet inundating Plaintiffs’ bedroom and soaking the carpet and
mattress. (SAC, ¶ 2.)
 
On October 4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of
Settlement of the Entire Case. 
 
On November
25, 2024, Parent and Guardian Ad Litem Peace Otuonye
(“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise on behalf of Claimant Godspower Otuonye (Claimant”).
No opposition was filed. 
 
II.
DISCUSSION
 
Pursuant
to California Code of Civil Procedure section 372, any settlement of a claim
made by a minor or adult with a disability must be approved by the court.¿If
the court is satisfied that the settlement is in the best interest of the
claimant, then the court shall approve the settlement.¿(See Pearson v.
Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
A
petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code
of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court,
Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the
reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant.¿(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
7.950.)¿ The person compromising the claim on behalf of the minor or person who
lacks capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on
compromise of the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their
personal appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.952.)¿¿¿ 
 
Defendants
have offered to settle this matter in the total amount of $250,000. Of
the total settlement payment of $250,000,
the total
settlement amount for Claimant/Godspower Otuonye is $3,000. The petition
indicates that the adult Plaintiff, Peace Otuonye, is receiving a
higher settlement because the majority of quantifiable damages
were directly incurred by the adult Plaintiff, including: 1. All rental
payments made for the defective premises; 2. Personal property damage to items
purchased solely by Petitioner; 3. Lost wages and economic damages; 4.
Out-of-pocket expenses related to the habitability issues. (Petition, p. 11.)
Therefore, Petitioner represents that the settlement allocation reflects this,
with the minor Claimant’s portion primarily representing compensation for
discomfort and annoyance during their occupancy. (Ibid.) The declaration
submitted by Claimant’s counsel states that counsel waives all attorney fees
for services rendered to the minor and counsel does not request any attorney
fees, costs or expenses from minor Claimant. Thus, the total settlement
balance for Claimant is $3,000.00. The Court finds that the
settlement is in Claimant’s best interests and approves the settlement. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS the Petition to Confirm Minor’s Compromise.
 
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
The Petition to Confirm
Minor’s Compromise for
Claimant Godspower Otuonye is GRANTED.
