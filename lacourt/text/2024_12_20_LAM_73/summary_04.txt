And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to file a First Amended Complaint, which adds three new plaintiffs, one additional defendant, and four new causes of action. The Plaintiff filed the original complaint on December 4, 2023, against the White Oak Encino Homeowners Association, Ryan Moorman, Joseph Barker, Sam Bronshteyn, Jordan Ceglia, Sonia Garibay, and SF Valley Management, Inc. The original complaint alleged breach of CC&Rs, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of statutory duty to maintain common area, negligence, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief.

The Plaintiff's motion is based on the fact that the new plaintiffs, who are members of the original Plaintiff's family living in the property, were not previously named in the complaint. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's motion complies with the California Rules of Court and that the proposed amendments are necessary and proper. The Court also finds that the proposed amendments will not prejudice the Defendants, as the case is still in its early stages and discovery is still open.

The Judge notes that the judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit, and that the proposed amendments will enable the Plaintiff to seek complete relief and have a trial on the merits based on all known facts and legal theories. The Judge also finds that the Statute of Limitations has not yet run on the Defendants' transgressions, and that bringing a new lawsuit for the proposed additional causes of action would result in a waste of Court resources and attorney time.

The Judge orders the Plaintiff's Motion For Leave to File First Amended Complaint to be granted, and the Plaintiff is permitted to file the First Amended Complaint.
