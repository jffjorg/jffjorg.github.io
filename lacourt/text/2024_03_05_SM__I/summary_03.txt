And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is issued by the judge on the motion for reconsideration. The court had previously issued a tentative ruling and order, but the plaintiff did not appear at the hearing and the tentative became the order of the court. The plaintiff later sought to restore the hearing to the calendar, but technical problems prevented their voice from being heard. The court vacated the prior order and restored the matter to the calendar. The plaintiff also filed a second, untimely, motion for reconsideration, which was stricken as untimely. The court concludes that the plaintiff has not submitted new evidence or law that calls into question its prior thoughts, and is tentatively inclined to deny the motion for reconsideration and sign the proposed judgment.
