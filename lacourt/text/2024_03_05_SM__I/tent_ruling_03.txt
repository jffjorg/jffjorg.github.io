 Case Number:  22SMCV01491    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  I The court had
previously issued a tentative on this motion for reconsideration.  At the prior hearing, the court believed
plaintiff did not appear and the tentative became the order of the court.  Plaintiff later sought to restore the hearing
to the calendar.  Plaintiff was on the
line, but could not be heard.  The court
was convinced that plaintiff in fact was on the phone but due to technical
problems could not be heard.  That led
the court to vacate the prior order and restore the matter to the calendar today.  Plaintiff also filed a second, and untimely,
motion for reconsideration.  That motion
was stricken as untimely, and that part of the order remains in effect.
At present,
the court believes that plaintiff has not submitted new evidence or law that
calls the court’s prior thoughts into question. 
As such, the court is still tentatively inclined to DENY the motion for
reconsideration and to sign the proposed judgment.
