And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a request to continue the trial date due to plaintiffs' counsel's personal situation, which has made depositions more difficult and has prevented them from being completed in time. The defendant is also seeking a 4-month continuance of the trial and related cut-off dates. The judge notes that the trial date was set on May 18, 2023, and that the parties were warned at that time that a lot needed to be done. The judge is puzzled as to why discovery is not complete or nearly so, given that it has been almost a year. The judge is aware that plaintiffs' counsel's situation has changed unexpectedly, but does not assign fault or blame. The judge will discuss available trial dates with counsel, but notes that a trial in October is unlikely and that the court will not bump a trial in favor of this one. The judge also expresses reluctance to extend dates if it serves as an excuse for more motions.
