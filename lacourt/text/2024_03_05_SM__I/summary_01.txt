And here is the summary in English text:

The defendant's motion to re-open discovery is denied. The defendant served discovery on the plaintiff, but the plaintiff's responses were in bad faith. The defendant is unhappy with the responses and seeks to re-open discovery to bring motions that were not heard before the discovery cut-off. The court has reviewed the discovery and responses and finds that the discovery is not important enough to re-open the motion cut-off. The court also notes that the plaintiff's responses were in bad faith and that the defendant may have been prejudiced by the delays. The court denies the motion and also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
