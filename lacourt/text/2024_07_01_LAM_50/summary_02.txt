And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Judge Beaudet, discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price without litigation. Judge Beaudet does not believe that her experience will bias her in the case, but she is disclosing it as a precautionary measure. If any party believes that Judge Beaudet's experience could impact her impartiality, they may file and serve a verified statement of disqualification by July 16, 2024. The hearing on the status conference re completion of mediation or ADR will be continued to August 27, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file a verified statement of disqualification.
