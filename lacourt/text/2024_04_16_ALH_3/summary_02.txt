And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's response to the discovery requests. The defendant had failed to serve timely responses to the requests, despite the parties' stipulation setting a deadline for his responses. The court finds that the defendant's failure to respond does not moot the motion, and has ordered the defendant to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 15 days of the date of the order.
