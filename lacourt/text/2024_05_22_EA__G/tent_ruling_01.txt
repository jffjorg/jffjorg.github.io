for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Geico General Insurance Company’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a personal injury action arising from an automobile collision. In December
2022, Defendant Stacey Maryan Olea was operating a motor vehicle on Arrow
Highway in Azusa when Olea collided with Nataly Alferez’s vehicle. As a result,
Alferez’s insurer, Plaintiff Geico General Insurance Company (Geico), paid
Alferez $36,448.52 for personal injury and property damages.
On June
29, 2023, Geico filed a complaint against Olea and Does 1-10, alleging a single
cause of action for subrogation. On July 18, 2023, Geico’s process server served
Olea with substitute service in Covina.
On
October 23, 2023, the Court entered default against Olea after Olea failed to
timely file an answer. On May 15, 2024, Geico submitted the present application
for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for May 22, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Geico
seeks default judgment against Olea in the total amount of $39,314.36,
including $36,448.52 in damages, $2,351.84 in interest, and $514.00 in costs. Because
the Court finds Geico has submitted sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS Geico’s
application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Geico’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
