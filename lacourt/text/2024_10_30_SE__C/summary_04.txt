And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default. The Defendant, Rudy Espinoza, had filed the motion on April 19, 2024, within the six months allowed by law, claiming that he had been hospitalized and entered treatment facilities during his response time and therefore had not acted inexcusably. However, the Court found that the Defendant had failed to attach a responsive pleading to the motion, as required by law. As a result, the Court denied the motion and ordered the Defendant to file a responsive pleading by October 23, 2024. When the Defendant failed to do so, the Court denied the motion to set aside default.
