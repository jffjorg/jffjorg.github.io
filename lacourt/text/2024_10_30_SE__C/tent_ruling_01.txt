  Case Number:  21NWCV00009    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2024    Dept:  C HERNANDEZ V.
SOUTHLAND BOX COMPANY 
CASE NO.:  21NWCV00009 
HEARING:  10/30/2024
 
#2
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
The hearing on the Petition is CONTINUED to March 13,
2025 at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C.
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
On January 8, 2021, Plaintiff Jose Hernandez (“Plaintiff” or
“Respondent”) filed this action against Southland Box Company (“Defendant” or
“Petitioner”). The Complaint alleges multiple Labor Code violations and seeks
penalties pursuant to the Private Attorney General Act (PAGA).
 
On October 4, 2022, this Court granted Defendant’s motion to
compel arbitration as to Plaintiff’s individual claims and stayed Plaintiff’s
representative claims.
          
On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff submitted the arbitration demand
to the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration took place on March
19, 2024. On May 22, 2023, the arbitrator issued a final award in favor of
Defendant on all causes of action. Defendant, as the prevailing party, was
awarded costs in the amount of $7,011.30.
 
On September 10, 2024, Defendant filed this Petition to
Confirm the Arbitration Award. On September 30, 2024, Defendant filed a notice
of non-opposition. 
 
Service of the Arbitration Award  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he
neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party to the
arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided in the
agreement.” 
 
The Court finds the Petition contains no indication that the
arbitrator served a copy of the final award personally or by registered or
certified mail to the parties. Attachment 9(a) of the Petition merely indicates
that the signed copy of the award was transmitted by an AAA representative via
email on March 22, 2024. The Court thus finds the service requirement for the
arbitration award has not been met.
 
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4, subdivisions (a) and
(b) require the “copy of the petition and a written notice of the time and
place of the hearing thereof” to be served on Respondent “in the manner
provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and
notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which
such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice within this State shall be made
in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.” 
 
The Court notes that the arbitration agreement does not
provide the manner in which service of a petition or notice of hearing shall be
made. Thus, service shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons. The Court finds Petitioner filed the Petition with proof of
service. Service of the petition was via electronic service. Electronic service
does not comport with requirements for service of summons, and thus, the
service requirement has not been met. Further, no written notice of the hearing
was attached to the Petition or filed with the Court. The Court thus finds the
notice of hearing and service requirements for the Petition has not been met.
 
Timeliness
 
A party may seek a court judgment confirming an arbitration
award by filing and serving a petition at least 10 days, but no more than four
years, after the award is served.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1288,
1288.4.)   
 
The Petition was filed and served on September 10, 2024,
which was more than 10 days but less than four years after the final
arbitration decision on March 22, 2024. The Petition is thus timely. 
 
Merits
 
An arbitration award is not directly enforceable until it is
confirmed by a court and judgment is entered. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) On the merits, the
court must confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award,
or dismisses the proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1286; Valsan Partners
Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states that a
petition under this chapter shall: 
(a) Set forth the
substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the
petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement;
(b) Set forth the
names of the arbitrators; and
(c) Set forth or
have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators,
if any.  
(CCP §
1285.4.)¿¿ 
 
The Court finds all requirements for the Petition have been
met. The agreement to arbitrate, signed by Respondent, is attached to the
Petition. (Petition, Attachment 4(b).) The Petition states the name of the
arbitrator as David G. Freedman, Esq. (Petition, ¶ 6.) The copy of the final
award and the arbitrator’s written opinion is attached to the Petition.
(Petition, Attachment 8(c).) 
 
While the requirements for the Petition have been met, the
Court finds neither the Petition nor the final arbitration award were served in
the proper manner. The Court also finds Petitioner failed to provide adequate
notice of this hearing. For the forgoing reasons, the hearing on the Petition
is CONTINUED to March 13, 2025 at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. Petitioner
is ordered to file a notice of hearing and proof of service of the Petition
within 30 days.
