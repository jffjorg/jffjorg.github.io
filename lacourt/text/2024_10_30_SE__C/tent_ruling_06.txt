Legal Standard
 
          Compel
Deposition
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450 subd. (a) provides: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party
giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . .
described in the deposition notice.”
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450 subd. (b) provides: “A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following:
 
1. The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.
 
2. The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent
fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.”
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450
subd. (c) provides, “(1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the
court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 subd. (a), “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that
one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising
that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is
authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery
is a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010 subd. (d).)
 
Meet and Confer 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450
requires the motion to be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Code of Civil Procedure § 2016.040. Code of Civil Procedure section
2016.040 provides that “[a] meet and confer declaration in support of a motion
shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” Additionally, “when the
deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450 subd. (b)(2).) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ counsel has sent one
meet and confer letter on September 1, 2023, regarding the notice of deposition.
(Derderian Decl., ¶ 25.) In the letter, Plaintiffs asked
Defendant if there were alternative dates in the event the PMK deposition did
not occur as noticed. (Derderian Decl., ¶ 25.)
Defendant did not respond with alternative dates. (Derderian Decl., ¶ 25.) Plaintiffs have not shown “a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution” through meet and confer efforts. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
2025.450
subd. (b)(2).) Plaintiffs have only demonstrated one letter with no
response. 
 
Conclusion 
 
          Counsel are
ORDERED to make further meet and confer efforts to resolve the deposition
issues. If, after exhausting those efforts, court intervention is needed,
counsel may appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date. If
counsel are unable to informally resolve their discovery disputes, then counsel
are instructed to submit a JOINT STATEMENT no later than January 17, 2025,
with a detailed outline of the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is
required.
