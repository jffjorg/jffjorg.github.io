TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant FCA US LLC’s Motion to Tax Costs is DENIED.
 
Opposing party to give notice. 
 
This action arises from the sale and purchase of an
allegedly defective 2021 Dodge Ram 1500 (the “Subject Vehicle”). On January 28,
2022, Plaintiff Cristian Reynoso (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants FCA US LLC (“FCA”), Premier Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Buena Park
(“Premier”), and DOES 1 to 50 (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging causes of
action for: (1) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; (2) breach
of the implied warranty of fitness; (3) breach of express warranty; (4) failure
to promptly repurchase product; (5) failure to commence repairs within a
reasonable time; (6) failure to complete repairs within 30 days; (7) failure to
maintain sufficient service and repair facilities; (8) failure to make service
literature and parts available; (9) advertising defective merchandise without
disclosing defects; (10) conversion; (11) negligence; and (12) violation of
Civ. Code § 1796.5.   
 
On April 21, 2022, Defendant FCA filed its answer to the
complaint. 
 
On July 11, 2022, Defendant Premier filed its answer to the
complaint.  
 
On May 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served an Offer of
Judgment Pursuant to CCP § 998. 
 
Also, on May 4, 2023, jury trial in this action was placed
off calendar due to the CCP § 998 offer and acceptance. (05/04/23 Minute
Order.) 
 
On May 19, 2023, the Court entered judgment pursuant to the
Offer of Judgment Pursuant to CCP § 998. (See 0519/23 Judgment.) Judgment was
entered “in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant FCA . . . in the amount of
$71,000, which amount constitutes reimbursement of the amount paid or payable
for the [Subject Vehicle] . . ., [and] for other damages sustained by Plaintiff
relating to the vehicle, but not including attorneys’ fees, court costs, and
litigation expenses incurred to date.” (Judgment at p. 1:26-2:2.) The judgment
provides that “[w]ithin 21 days after Plaintiff . . . accepts Defendant FCA’s .
. . tender of the amount stated above, Plaintiff shall tender the vehicle to
Defendant FCA . . . .” (Judgment at p. 2:3-4.) 
 
The judgment also indicates that Defendant FCA “may deduct
the amount necessary to satisfy any liens on the subject vehicle from the
amount stated above, and will pay that amount directly to any lienholder within
three business days after Plaintiff tenders the vehicle to FCA. FCA will also
pay to the lienholder any interest that accrues on Plaintiff’s purchase/lease
contract from [the date of judgment] until the date paid.” (Judgment at p. 2:5-8.)

 
Further, the judgment provides that “[w]ithin 14 days after
FCA pays the amount due to the lienholder, Plaintiff will tender the documents
that are legally required in order to transfer ownership of the vehicle to
FCA.” (Judgment at p. 2:9-10.) The judgment provides that Plaintiff “shall
recover reasonable attorney fees, litigation expenses, and court costs from
Defendant FCA . . . in an amount to be determined by the Court upon noticed
motion.” (Judgment at p. 2:11-13.) 
 
On September 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed and served a
Memorandum of Costs After Judgment, Acknowledgement of Credit, and Declaration
of Accrued Interest, which indicated that $32,405.74 of judgment principal was
still remaining due and that interest of $532.70 was still remaining due. 
 
On September 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Writ of Execution
setting forth the amount of principal and interest remaining due as to the
judgment. 
 
On November 2, 2023, pursuant to a stipulation entered into
between the parties, the Court entered an order providing that Plaintiff “shall
recover reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and expenses from Defendant FCA
. . . in the amount of $28,000.” (11/02/23 Order.) 
 
On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Memorandum of Costs
After Judgment, Acknowlegment of Credit, and Declaration of Accrued Interest,
in which Plaintiff seeks postjudgment costs in the sum of $7,500.00, which
represents: (1) $40.00 for issuing a writ of execution on September 19, 2023;
(2) $60.00 for an approved fee on application for appearance of judgment
debtor; and (3) $7,400.00 for attorneys’ fees incurred from May 20, 2023
through December 3, 2023. 
 
On December 5, 2023, the Court issued an order denying
Defendant FCA’s ex parte application for an order staying enforcement of
judgment and directing the Sheriff to release levied funds quashing the levy,
and enforcing the terms of the CCP § 998 offer. (12/05/23 Minute Order.) 
 
On December 22, 2023, Defendant FCA filed and served the
instant Motion to Tax Costs. Defendant FCA seeks to tax Plaintiff’s attorneys’
fees, which are in the sum of $7,400.00, from the December 4, 2023 memorandum
of costs. Defendant FCA contends that Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees
is neither reasonable nor necessary and therefore said fees should be taxed. 
 
On January 26, 2024, Defendant Premier was dismissed from
this action without prejudice pursuant to a request for dismissal filed by
Plaintiff. 
 
On July 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the
motion, in which Plaintiff asserts that Defendant FCA has not met its burden to
properly challenge costs. 
 
On July 31, 2024, the Court, on its own motion, continued
the hearing on the motion to tax costs to October 30, 2024. (07/31/24 Minute
Order.) 
 
As of October 24, 2024, no reply brief has been filed. Any
reply brief was required to have been filed and served at least five court days
prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Legal Standard
 
“[A] prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1035, subd. (b).)
A prevailing party “includes the party with a net monetary recovery . . . .”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) Attorneys’ fees are allowable as costs
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10)(A)-(C).) Code Civ. Proc. § 685.040 “authorizes an award for enforcement
of judgments not only where provided for in a contract, but also in cases where
such fees are otherwise provided by law.” (York v. Strong (2015) 234
Cal.App.4th 1471, 1473.) However, Code Civ. Proc. § 685.040 “imposes two
requirements before a motion for an award of postjudgment attorney fees may be
awarded as costs: (1) the fees must have been incurred to ‘enforce’ a judgment;
and (2) the underlying judgment had to include an award for attorney fees
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10)(A) . .
. .” (Cardinale v. Miller (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1025.) 
 
“The judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and
necessary costs of enforcing a judgment. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing
a judgment are not included in costs collectible under this title unless
provided by law. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included
as costs collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an
award of attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A)
of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
685.040.) 
 
“[I]tems on a verified cost bill are prima facie evidence
the costs, expenses and services listed were necessarily incurred, and when
they are properly challenged the burden of proof shifts to the party claiming
them as costs.” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.)
“[T]he burden is upon the moving party to establish the illegality of the
challenged items; otherwise the amount demanded in the verified cost bill is
controlling.” (Wilson v. Nichols (1942) 55 Cal.App.2d 678, 682-83.) “If the items appearing
on a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking
to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v.
California State Auto Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) “On the other
hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the
burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ibid.) “[T]he
mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be a proper objection to an item, the
necessity of which appears doubtful, or which does not appear to be proper on
its face.” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, internal
quotations omitted.)
 
Analysis
 
A.  
Declaration of Defendant FCA’s Counsel 
 
In support of the motion, counsel for Defendant FCA,
Catherine Y. Song (“Song”), provides a declaration. Ms. Song states the
following: Plaintiff and Defendant FCA settled this matter via a 998 Offer to
Compromise in the amount of $71,000.00. (Song Decl., ¶ 5.) On or around May 4,
2023, Plaintiff filed an Offer of Judgment Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 998 with the Court. (Song Decl., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Acceptance of Offer of Judgment and, on or around May 19, 2023, the Court entered
judgment. (Song Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
On July 11, 2023, Defendant FCA tendered a check for $42,246.92
to Plaintiff’s lender, Firefighter Credit Union, to pay off the balance of
Plaintiff’s loan. (Song Decl., ¶ 7.) On the same day, a check was sent to
Plaintiff for $28,753.08, which is the balance of the monies owed and said
check was payable to Plaintiff. (Song Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff executed a levy on
Defendant FCA for $32,978.44 by filing a Writ of Execution to the Sheriff or
Marshall of the County of Los Angeles. (Song Decl., ¶ 8.) On December 5, 2023,
Defendant FCA moved ex parte for a court order to quash the levy, a
return of any monies owed, and deem Defendant FCA having satisfied its
obligations under CCP § 998. (Song Decl., ¶ 8.) On December 3, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a Memorandum of Costs After Judgment. (Song Decl., ¶ 9.) 
 
 
 
B.  
Defendant FCA Has Not Met its Burden to
Challenge Plaintiff’s Costs 
 
Plaintiff is seeking post judgment attorneys’ fees under CCP
§ 685.040 in the sum of $7,400.00 for the time period of May 20, 2023, through
December 3, 2023.
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s demand for post judgment
attorneys’ fees is improper because the fees were not incurred to enforce the
judgment; rather, they were incurred as a result of Plaintiff’s refusal to
accept the check tendered by Defendant pursuant to the terms of the settlement
agreement.  
 
In opposition to the motion, Plaintiff’s counsel
acknowledges receipt of a check from Defendant on July 26, 2023, purportedly as
payment towards the judgment. (Opposition to Defendant’s Ex Parte Application,
filed July 24, 2024, Hutchens Decl., ¶
10.) However, Plaintiff’s counsel did not cash the check because it was made
out to Plaintiff instead of “Anderson Law, APC, attorney-client trust account”.
(Id.) Plaintiff’s counsel explains that it had asked Defendant to make
the check payable to the trust account, not to Plaintiff, because a check in
Plaintiff’s name could have significant tax consequences. (Hutchens Decl., ¶ 7.) After requesting that Defendant
reissue the check and not receiving a response, Plaintiff obtained a writ of
execution and directed the Sheriff to levy on Defendant’s bank account to
collect the funds still due. (Hutchens Decl. ¶ 13.) Plaintiff’s counsel was also required to oppose
Defendant’s ex parte application for an order to stay judgment (which was
denied by the Court). (Anderson Decl., ¶
15.) Based on this, the Court finds that the $7,400.00 in attorneys’ fees
claimed by Plaintiff were in furtherance of enforcing the judgment. Also, the
underlying judgment in this action awards Plaintiff attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff
therefore is entitled to post judgment attorneys’ fees under CCP § 685.040.
Defendant FCA has not met its burden in challenging the reasonableness and
necessity of such costs. 
 
The Motion to Tax Costs is DENIED.
