And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Plaintiff Frank Contreras to set aside and vacate the dismissal of his personal injury action against Defendants Irene Ortega, Victor Ortega, Martha Vasquez, and Does 1-50. The plaintiff alleges that his counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect caused the dismissal, and that his counsel failed to appear for scheduled case management conferences on September 6, 2023 and November 15, 2023, due to calendaring errors. The judge is inclined to grant relief based on the plaintiff's counsel's sworn affidavit attesting to the mistake. However, the plaintiff has not yet served the other parties with copies of his motion, and the judge orders that he must do so and file proof of service by November 27, 2024. The motion is continued to January 9, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.
