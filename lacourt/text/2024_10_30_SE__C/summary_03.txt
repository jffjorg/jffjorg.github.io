And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to strike the Second Amended Cross-Complaint (SAXC) filed by Cross-Complainant Mark Markarian. The motion was filed by Cross-Defendants, who argue that the SAXC was not timely filed after the Court sustained their demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint. However, the Court finds that the filing of the SAXC is not untimely because Cross-Defendants failed to provide Cross-Complainant with notice of the Court's December 7, 2023 order, as required by the Court. The Court therefore denies the motion to strike the SAXC.
