And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's ex parte application to shorten the time to hear the defendant's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint. The demurrer was originally scheduled for April 9, 2025, but the judge has advanced it to December 4, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. The plaintiff has filed an opposition to the demurrer, which was filed by the defendant on July 3, 2024. The judge has also ordered the defendant to file a reply by November 25, 2024. The reason for the shortening of time is that the property is in immediate danger of foreclosure.
