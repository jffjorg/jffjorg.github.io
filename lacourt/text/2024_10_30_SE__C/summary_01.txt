And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the hearing on the petition to confirm the arbitration award is continued to March 13, 2025, due to the failure of the defendant to properly serve the petition and provide adequate notice of the hearing. The arbitrator's final award was not served personally or by registered/certified mail, and the petition was served electronically, which is not compliant with the service requirements. Additionally, no written notice of hearing was attached to the petition. The judge has ordered the defendant to file a notice of hearing and proof of service of the petition within 30 days.
