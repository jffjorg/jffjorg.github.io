#8
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
The Defendant Rudy Espinoza’s Motion to Set Aside Default
is DENIED.  
 
Clerk to give notice. 
 
On November 21, 2022, Plaintiff U.S. Bank National
Association (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Rudy Espinoza
(“Defendant”). The Complaint alleges causes of action for Breach of Contract
and Common Counts.
 
On March 14, 2024, default was entered against Defendant.
The default prove-up hearing to enter judgment is scheduled for November 14,
2024. 
 
On April 19, 2024, Defendant filed this Motion to Set Aside
Default. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) states:

The court may, upon
any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative
from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other
pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be
granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding
six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. 
(CCP § 473,
subd. (b), underline added.) 
 
The purpose of mandatory relief is to alleviate the hardship
on parties who lose their day in court due to an inexcusable failure to act by
their attorneys. (Rodriguez v. Brill (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 715, 723.)
“Section 473 is often applied liberally where the party in default moves
promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the motion will not suffer
prejudice if relief is granted. [Citations.] In such situations ‘very slight
evidence will be required to justify a court in setting aside the default.’
[Citations.] [¶] Moreover, because the law strongly favors trial and
disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved
in favor of the party seeking relief from default.” (Fasuyi v. Permatex,
Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 695.)
 
The Court heard this Motion on October 9, 2024. 
 
The Court found that Defendant timely filed the instant Motion
on April 16, 2024, within the six months after default was entered on March 19,
2024, as required by CCP § 473, subd. (b). 
 
The Court further found that Defendant failed to respond due
to inadvertence and excusable neglect. Defendant stated he was hospitalized and
entered into several treatment facilities during his response time. (Espinoza
Decl., ¶ 3.) However, the Court found Defendant failed to attach a responsive
pleading to the Motion in accordance with CCP § 473, subd. (b). The Court
continued the Motion, ordering Defendant to file a responsive pleading by
October 23, 2024. 
 
As of October 29, 2024, Defendant has failed to file a
responsive pleading.
 
Thus, the Motion to Set Aside Default is DENIED.
