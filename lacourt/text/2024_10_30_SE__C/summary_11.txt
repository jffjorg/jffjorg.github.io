And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling in this case is that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. The defendant's motion to strike punitive damages is also granted with 30 days leave to amend.

The plaintiff, Renza McGee, filed a complaint against Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. alleging personal injury, property damage, and wrongful death due to medical malpractice. The complaint alleges that Dr. Saroyan stated he was not comfortable performing the surgery and that the plaintiff suffered damages including wage loss, hospital and medical expenses, general damages, loss of earning capacity, and non-economic damages.

The defendant demurred to the complaint on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, does not name a health care provider as a defendant, and is time-barred. The Judge found that the plaintiff has not pled facts sufficient to constitute a negligence cause of action and that the defendant cannot be held liable as a health care provider.

The Judge also granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff's allegations were conclusory and lacked factual support. The Judge ordered the plaintiff to have 30 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects.
