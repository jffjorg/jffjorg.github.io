et al.
CASE NO.: 23NWCV01384 

HEARING: 10/30/2024
 
#11
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Plaintiff Frank Contreras’s Motion/Application to Set
Aside/Vacate Dismissal is CONTINUED to January 9, 2024
at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  

 
Moving party to give NOTICE.
 
Background
 
This personal injury action was filed on May 4, 2023, by
Plaintiff Frank Contreras (Plaintiff) against Defendants
Irene Ortega, Victor Ortega, Martha Vasquez, and Does 1-50 (collectively
Defendants). Plaintiff alleges Defendants are responsible for a motor vehicle
collision that injured Plaintiff and asserts causes of action for (1) motor
vehicle negligence and (2) general negligence.
 
On September 6, 2023, Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel failed
to appear for a scheduled case management conference.
 
On November 15, 2023, the Court dismissed Plaintiff’s action
after Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel failed to appear.
 
On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the present motion to
set aside and vacate the Court’s dismissal and a hearing was scheduled for July
31, 2024.
 
On July 31, 2024, the Court continued the hearing to today’s
date because Plaintiff had not “filed proof of service showing that he served
the other parties.” (7/31/24 Minute Order.) 
The Court ordered Plaintiff to file proof of service by October 23,
2024.  
 
Legal Standard
 
Whenever an application for relief from dismissal is made no
more than six months after entry of the judgment of dismissal, is in proper
form, and is accompanied by the moving party’s sworn affidavit attesting to his
or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, the court may
vacate any dismissal entered against the moving party unless the court finds
that the dismissal was not in fact caused by the moving party’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., §473, subd.
(b).) The court shall grant relief if the moving party’s counsel provides a
“sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) “The court shall, whenever
relief is granted based on an attorney's affidavit of fault, direct the
attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing
counsel or parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) “The six-month time
limit for granting statutory relief is jurisdictional and the court may not
consider a motion for relief made after that period has elapsed.” (Manson,
Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) 
 
Analysis
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to set aside the Court’s dismissal of
the present action on the grounds of counsel’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
or neglect. In support of Plaintiff’s motion, Plaintiff has provided a
declaration by Plaintiff’s counsel, Igor Fradkin, Esq. According to Plaintiff’s
counsel, counsel failed to appear for the case management conference on
September 6, 2023, as a result of calendaring errors. (Fradkin Decl., ¶ 8.)
Plaintiff’s counsel also failed to appear at the November 15 case management
conference and OSC Re: Dismissal for the same reasons. (Fradkin Decl., ¶ 6.)  Because Plaintiff’s counsel has demonstrated the
entry of dismissal was a result of counsel’s neglect, the Court is inclined to
grant relief.  
 
However, it is still not apparent to the Court that the
other parties were served with copies of Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside
Dismissal.  On July 31, 2024, the Court
ordered Plaintiff to “serve the other parties and file proof of service by
October 23, 2024.”  It was the Court’s
intention to require Plaintiff to serve copies of the motion upon
Defendants.  However, on October 222,
2024, Plaintiff filed Proof of Service of the Summons and Complaint upon
Defendants.  It appears Plaintiff
misunderstood the Court’s order, which in hindsight was not specific enough.  
 
The Motion is CONTINUED to January 9, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in
Dept. SE-C.  Plaintiff must serve
the other parties with copies of Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and
file proof of service by November 27, 2024.
