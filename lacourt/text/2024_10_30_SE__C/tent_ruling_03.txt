XXVI, LLC v. ALONDRA’S PICO, LLC, et al.
CASE NO.:  22NWCV00857
HEARING:  10/30/24
 
#6
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
DENY THE MOTION TO STRIKE.
 
Moving parties to give notice. 
 
This action arises from the alleged breach of a lease
concerning property located at 8746 Washington Blvd., Pico Rivera, CA 90660
(the “Premises”). On September 20, 2022, Plaintiff Vestar California XXVI, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Alondra’s Pico, LLC (“APL”),
Mark Markarian, and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive (collectively, “Defendants”),
alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of lease; and (2) breach of guaranty.

 
On December 27, 2022, Defendant and Cross-Complainant Mark Markarian
(“Cross-Complainant”) filed a cross-complaint against Defendant and Cross-Defendants
APL and ROES 1 to 20, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of
contract; and (2) express indemnity. 
 
On December 28, 2022, default was entered against Defendant
and Cross-Defendant APL. 
 
On April 19, 2023, Cross-Complainant filed a First Amended
Cross-Complaint (“FAXC”) alleging the same causes of action, but added
additional cross-defendants, including Cross-Defendants Randall S. Teffeteller
and West Coast Resources & Consulting, Inc. (“Cross-Defendants”). 
 
On July 20, 2023, Cross-Defendants filed a demurrer to the
cross-complaint, which was opposed by Cross-Complainant. 
 
On December 7, 2023, the Court sustained the demurrer with
20 days leave to amend. (12/07/23 Minute Order.) Both sides submitted on the
Court’s tentative. (12/07/23 Minute Order at p. 1.) Cross-Defendants were
ordered to give notice. (12/07/23 Minute Order at p. 1.) 
 
On January 3, 2024, Cross-Complainant filed the operative
Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SAXC”). 
 
On February 6, 2024, Cross-Defendants filed and served the
instant motion to strike the SAXC, which is made on the grounds that the SAXC
was not timely filed after the Court sustained the demurrer of Cross-Defendants
to the FAXC. Cross-Defendants seek an order dismissing the SAXC. 
 
On October 17, 2024, Cross-Complainant filed and served an
opposition to the motion to strike. 
 
As of October 24, 2024, no reply brief has been filed. Any
reply brief was required to have been filed and served at least five court days
prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Legal Standard
 
“If an amended pleading is filed after the time allowed, an
order striking the amended pleading must be obtained by noticed motion under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(i).) 
 
Analysis
 
A.  
Striking the SAXC is Not Appropriate 
 
Counsel for Cross-Defendants, John C. Russell (“Russell”),
relevantly declares that he and counsel for Cross-Complainant appeared at the
December 7, 2023 hearing on the demurrer via Court Connect. (Russell Decl., ¶
6.) Mr. Russell states that Cross-Complainant’s counsel e-mailed him a copy of
the Court’s tentative ruling on the demurrer and the parties agreed to submit
on the tentative ruling. (Russell Decl., ¶¶ 7-8; Ex. A.) 
 
Peter Sunukjian (“Sunukjian”), who is counsel for
Cross-Complainant, declares that Cross-Defendants never served notice of the
Court’s December 7, 2023 order on Cross-Complainant. (Sunukjian Decl., ¶ 1.) 
 
Here, the Court’s December 7, 2023 order required
Cross-Defendants to give notice to Cross-Complainant. Cross-Defendants did not
file a notice of ruling and counsel for Cross-Complainant has attested to not
receiving notice of the Court’s December 7, 2023 order. Thus, while the SAXC
was filed on January 3, 2024, such filing is not untimely. Cross-Defendants
failed to follow this Court’s order to provide Cross-Complainant with a notice
of ruling concerning the demurrer. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the
Court DENIES the Motion to Strike the SAXC.
