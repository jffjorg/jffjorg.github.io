And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a motion to continue the trial date and, in the alternative, advance the hearing on a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Target Corporation. The plaintiff, Joann Gomez, filed a complaint against Target Corporation and others on April 7, 2021, alleging negligence and premise liability causes of action arising from a slip and fall on April 23, 2019. The defendant filed its motion for summary judgment on January 4, 2024, and its motion to continue the trial date on January 10, 2024. The court finds that the defendant has shown good cause for a continuance due to the right to have its motion for summary judgment heard. Therefore, the motion to continue the trial date is granted, and the trial is advanced and continued to late April 2025. The final status conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
