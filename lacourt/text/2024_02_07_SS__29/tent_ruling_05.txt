Requests for Admission (Set One) filed by Defendant Mina George Baskharon.

Background
This case arises
from an motor vehicle accident that allegedly occurred on August 19, 2020.  Plaintiff Naser Baharloo (“Plaintiff”) filed the
Complaint in this action on September 13, 2021, asserting causes of action for motor
vehicle negligence and general negligence against Defendant Mina George Baskharon (“Defendant”), and Does 1
through 10.  Defendant filed an Answer on
March 22, 2023.
 
On November
30, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for Admissions (Set One).
(Mittskus Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh A.) 
Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id.,
¶ 3.)
 
On
January 11, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for an order deeming admitted as true
the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One).
 Defendant also seeks sanctons.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery  Act, Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to
include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the trial court of
its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) 
Even if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and]
substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses …
the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id.
at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id.
at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not]
take the motion off calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,” the trial court may “deny the motion to compel
responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose
sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court
may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a
motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed,
or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)  
"Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery
proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery
heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of
the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 
Discussion
Defendant
served Plaintiff with Requests for Admissions (Set One) on November 30, 2023.
(Mittskus Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh A.) 
Plaintiff has not served responses. 
(Id., ¶ 3.)
 
Defendant
need not show anything more.  The motion
for a deemed-admitted order is GRANTED.
 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED in part.  Given the relatively straightforward nature
of a motion for a deemed-admitted order, the Court sets sanctions on the motion
in the amount of $439.65 calculated based on 2 hours of attorney work,
multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $189.00 per hour, plus the
$61.65 filing fee.  (Id., ¶ 4.)
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS
Defendant’s motion for deemed-admitted order.
 
The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff is deemed to have
admitted the truth of all matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for
Admission (Set One).
 
The Court GRANTS in
part Defendant’s motion for sanctions.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff
and counsel of record Steven Slavitt, jointly and severally, to pay monetary
sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to Defendant in the amount of $439.65
within 30 days of notice.
