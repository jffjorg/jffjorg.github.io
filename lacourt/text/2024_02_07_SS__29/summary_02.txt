And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a petition to approve a minor's compromise. The petition was filed on December 21, 2023, and the court issued an order on January 5, 2024, identifying several issues that needed to be addressed. Despite a new petition being filed on January 10, 2024, the issues remain unresolved. The judge has identified two main areas of concern: medical expenses and the filed order. Specifically, the judge notes that the information in Item 12 of the petition is incorrect and unclear, and that the proposed order (MC-351) is incomplete and contains math errors. As a result, the judge has continued the order to show cause re status of minor's compromise, requiring the petitioner to remedy these deficiencies before the petition can be approved.
