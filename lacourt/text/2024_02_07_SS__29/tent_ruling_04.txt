 Case Number:  21STCV23323    Hearing Date:   February 7, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matters Asserted in
Request for Admissions (Set 1) filed by Defendant Byung Woo Kang, aka David Woo
Kang, dba Sunset Plaza Liquors.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
This case arises
from an alleged battery that occurred on July 1, 2019.  Plaintiff Kali Jamal Townsend (“Plaintiff”)
filed the Complaint this action on June 23, 2021, asserting a battery cause of
action against Defendant Byung Woo Kang, individually and dba Sunset Plaza
Liquors (“Defendant”), and Does 1 through 10. 
Defendant filed an Answer on May 1, 2023.
 
On May 4, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney form.  Plaintiff’s former counsel substituted out of
the case, and Plaintiff is now self-represented.
 
On July 25,
2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Cohen Decl., ¶ 9 & Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff was served by mail at the address
stated on the substitution of attorney form. 
(Id., Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff
did not respond to the discovery.  (Id.,
¶ 11.)
 
On September
11, 2023, Defendant filed the Motion
to Deem
the Truth of the Matters Asserted in Requests for Admission (Set One).  Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions.
 
The
proof of service attached to the motion indicates that the motion was served by
email (to an address not associated on any court filing with Plaintiff).
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a motion, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Id.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the matters contained in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the
trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.) 
Even if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and]
substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses …
the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to
respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,”
the trial court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially
unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions
under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel
discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to
the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)
 
Discussion
On July
25, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Cohen Decl., ¶ 9.)  Plaintiff
has not responded. (Id., ¶ 11.) 

 
No
opposition has been filed.
 
According
to the proof of service attached to Defendant’s motion, the motion was served
by email to an address that does not appear to be associated with
Plaintiff.  Accordingly, the motion is
denied without prejudice for failure to file a proper proof of service.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES without prejudice Defendant’s Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matters
Asserted in Requests for Admission (Set One).
 
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice to Plaintiff by mail.
