The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to deem the truth of the matters asserted in the requests for admission as true.

The court grants the request for sanctions in part, ordering the plaintiff and their counsel to pay $439.65 in sanctions. The court sets the sanctions based on 2 hours of attorney work and the reasonable billing rate of $189.00 per hour, plus the $61.65 filing fee. The court orders the plaintiff to be deemed to have admitted the truth of all matters specified in the defendant's requests for admission.
