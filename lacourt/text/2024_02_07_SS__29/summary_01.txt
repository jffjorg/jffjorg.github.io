Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for March 25, 2024. The defendant argued that there was good cause for the continuance because it has filed a motion for summary judgment, which is scheduled for hearing on February 18, 2025. The judge found that the defendant has shown good cause for the continuance, as it needs time to have its motion for summary judgment heard. The trial date is advanced and continued to a date on or after March 25, 2025.
