BACKGROUND
 
In
this case, Plaintiff Cosmo Lombino (“Plaintiff”) filed against Defendant FCA US
LLC (“Defendant”) on May 11, 2023. On July 6, 2023 the Answer to the Complaint
was filed by the Defendant. On August 18, 2023 Defendant was served with
Request for Admissions Set One. The responses to the Request for Admissions
were due on or about September 22, 2023.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The Court GRANTS the Motion to Deem
Requests for Admissions, Set One. Requests for Admissions, Set One are deemed
admitted. The Court also GRANTS monetary sanctions in a reduced amount in favor
of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $616.65. 
 
Defendant
and Defendant’s attorney of record, Clark Hill LLP, jointly or severally, are
ordered to pay Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $616.65 within 30
days of this order.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A party that fails to timely respond to a request for
admission waived any objection to the requests, including those based on
privilege and work-product. (Code Civ Pro. Section 2033.280(a). The requesting
party may also move for an order that the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted. (Id. at Section 2033.280(b).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Merits
 
On August 18, 2023, Defendant was
served with Request for Admissions Set One. (Yashar Decl., ¶ 2; Ex.2.) The
responses to the Request for Admissions were due on or about September 22,
2023. (Id. at ¶ 3.) The Defendant did not provide the
responses on September 22, 2023, and has not provided any responses to date. (Id. at ¶¶ 4-5.) Notably, Defendant did not file an opposition. Thus, the
Court GRANTS the motion and Request for Admissions Set One is deemed admitted. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $1,681.65 against Defendant. Plaintiff’s counsel
justifies the amount requested as follows: for a total of 4.5 hours at an
hourly rate is $350.00 per hour (consisting of 1 hour drafting the instant
motion, 2 hours reviewing and drafting a reply, and 1.5 hours preparing for and
attending the hearing). Plaintiff also requests $61.65 for the filing fees, $30
for e-filing (for motion and reply), and $15 for LA Court Connect fee.  
 
Although the Court finds that
monetary sanctions are warranted, the Court finds the amount sought is
excessive because the motion is unopposed and simple. Therefore, the Court
reduces the amount to $616.65 (1.5 hours drafting the instant motion, 0.5 hours
attending the hearing, $61.65 in filing fees, and $15 for e-filing fees, and
$15 for LA Court Connect fee.)
 
Thus, the Court GRANTS IN PART
the monetary sanctions in a REDUCED amount of $616.65. Defendant and
Defendant’s attorney of record, Clark Hill LLP, jointly or severally, are
ordered to pay Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $616.65 within 30
days of this order. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court GRANTS the motion and Request
for Admissions, Set One is deemed admitted. 
 
The Court GRANTS IN PART the
monetary sanctions in a REDUCED amount of $616.65. Defendant and Defendant’s
attorney of record, Clark Hill LLP, jointly or severally, are ordered to pay
Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $616.65 within 30 days of this
order.
