And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Maria De La Cruz, Luis Enrique Hernandez Correa, and Ramiro Hernandez v. Salomon Melchor. The case arises from an automotive collision on August 22, 2021, and the plaintiffs have filed a complaint against the defendant and Does 1-50 for negligence and negligence per se.

The defendant filed a motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents, set one, and requested sanctions against the plaintiff Luis Enrique Hernandez Correa and his counsel in the amount of $1,800.00. The motion was unopposed, and the judge granted the motion to compel responses.

The judge found that the plaintiff Correa failed to serve timely responses to the defendant's requests for production of documents and waived any objections to the requests. The judge also found that the plaintiff Correa did not file an opposition to the motion or move separately for relief from the waiver, and therefore, the court did not find that the party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.

The judge granted the request for sanctions in part, awarding $510.00 to the defendant's counsel, calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $300.00 for 1.5 hours reasonably spent, plus a $60.00 filing fee.

The judge ordered the plaintiff Correa to serve verified responses, without objection, to the requests for production of documents, set one, within 20 days, and ordered the plaintiff Correa and his counsel to jointly and severally pay $510.00 to the defendant's counsel within 20 days.
