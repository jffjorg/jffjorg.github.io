Case Name:                 Markland
v. Miller  
Case No.:                    23STCV09687
Motion:                       Demurrer

Moving Party:             Defendant Delroy Miller, individually and as trustee of the Delroy
F. Miller and Crystal E Wright Family Trust

Opposing Party:          Plaintiffs
Norman Markland and Maise Markland

Tentative Ruling:      The
Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is sustained in its entirety.  Plaintiff shall have leave to amend with
respect to the first, second, and sixth causes of action; Plaintiff shall have
leave to amend the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action as remedies.

             
            This is an action for quiet title.
Plaintiffs Norman and Maisie Markland (Plaintiffs) allege that they entered
into an agreement wherein Eunice Miller (Eunice) (Defendant Delory Miller’s
mother) and Defendant Delroy Miller agreed that the Plaintiffs would give
Eunice the money for the down payment to purchase real property (a residential
home) located at 1502 West 85th Street, Los Angeles, California (Property) and
money for all expenses related to the property; in exchange, Defendant Delroy
would take legal title on the Property until Plaintiffs became legal residents
of the United States. At that time, Defendant Delroy would transfer legal title
of the Property to the Plaintiffs. 
 
On May 1, 2023,
Plaintiffs filed a Complaint. On August 10, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First
Amended Complaint alleging causes of action for (1.)
quiet title, (2.) unjust enrichment, (3.) resulting trust, (4.) constructive
trust, (5.) injunctive relief, and (6.) declaratory relief. 

 
Defendant Delroy
Miller now demurs to each of the six causes of action in the First Amended Complaint.
Plaintiff opposes the demurrer. 
 
            The Court sustains the demurrer in
its entirety with leave to amend. 
 
Demurrer
 
            A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency
of a pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose
of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . ..” ’
” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  
 
Analysis 
            
Defendant
demurs to the FAC on the grounds that the FAC is barred by the statute of limitations,
laches, the statute of frauds, and Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim.
 
Fifth Cause
of Action for Injunctive Relief
 
Defendant
first argues that Plaintiffs have failed to allege any causes of action and
rely solely on non-cognizable remedies. This Court will address the arguments
to each cause of action. 
 
            With respect to the injunctive
relief cause of action, this argument is correct.  
 
            It is well settled that injunctive
relief is an equitable remedy, not a cause of action. (Shell Oil Co. v.
Richter (1942) 52 Cal.App.2d 164, 168 [“Injunctive relief is a remedy and
not, in itself, a cause of action, and a cause of action must exist before
injunctive relief may be granted.”]; Venice Coalition to Preserve Unique
Community Character v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 42, 54
[“An injunction is a remedy, not a cause of action.”]; Wong v. Jing
(2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1354, 1360, fn. 2 [same; anti-SLAPP appeal].) 
 
Thus,
the demurrer to this cause of action is well taken. The law is less clear as to
the remaining causes of actions. 
 
Fourth
Cause of Action for Constructive Truste:
 
            Defendant argues this claim is a
remedy, not a cause of action, fails to state a claim and is barred by the
statute of limitations. 
 
            The case law is not entirely settled
on whether a constructive trust is treated as a cause of action or remedy. 
 
For
example, certain case authority suggests a constructive trust “is not an
independent cause of action but merely a type of remedy for some categories of
underlying wrong. [Citation.]” (Glue–Fold, Inc. v. Slautterback Corp.
(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023, fn. 3.) As an equitable remedy, a claim for a
constructive trust has no separate viability if the plaintiff's other causes of
action are barred. (Ibid.; see also Communist Party v. 522 Valencia,
Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 980, 990 [“A constructive trust is an
involuntary equitable trust created by operation of law as a remedy to compel
the transfer of property from the person wrongfully holding it to the rightful
owner.”].)
 
            However,
in Higgins v. Higgins (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 648, the Court of Appeal
explained “[t]o the extent Glue-Fold, Inc. v. Slautterback Corp. (2000)
82 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023, fn.3, 98 Cal.Rptr.2d 661, suggests no cause of
action for constructive trust exists, the suggestion would be inconsistent with
the weight of authority.” (Id. at 659, fn. 2 [citing see, e.g., Flores
v. Arroyo (1961) 56 Cal.2d 492, 494–495, [complaint stated a cause of
action to declare a constructive trust]; Day v. Greene (1963) 59 Cal.2d
404, 411 [statute of limitations applicable to action to impose a constructive
trust is determined by the nature of the underlying substantive right, not the
form of the action or the remedy sought]; Olson v. Toy (1996) 46
Cal.App.4th 818, 823 [claim for constructive trust is effectively an action for
possession of property].) 
 
            However, even if the Court were
to treat this claim as a cause of action, it fails under the statute of
limitations.
 
A
constructive trust is an equitable remedy to compel restoration of property by
one who is not justly entitled to it. (Day v. Greene (1963) 59 Cal.2d
404, 411; Allen v. Meyers (1936) 5 Cal.2d 311, 313-314; Meister v.
Mensinger (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 381, 396, 399.) 
 
The
general principles for the imposition of a constructive trust are set forth in
Civil Code sections 2223 and 2224. (Higgins v. Higgins (2017) 11
Cal.App.5th 648, 659-660.) Civil Code section 2223 provides: “One who
wrongfully detains a thing is an involuntary trustee thereof, for the benefit
of the owner.” Civil Code section 2224 provides, “One who gains a thing by
fraud, accident, mistake, undue influence, the violation of a trust, or other
wrongful act, is, unless he or she has some other and better right thereto, an
involuntary trustee of the thing gained, for the benefit of the person who
would otherwise have had it.” 
 
“Since
‘[a] constructive trust is not a substantive device but merely a
remedy to compel a person not justly entitled to property to transfer it to
another who is entitled thereto’ [citation], an action seeking to establish
a constructive trust is subject to the limitation period of the underlying
substantive right.’ [Citations.]” (Davies v. Krasna (1975) 14
Cal.3d 502, 515.) 
 
The
statute of limitations for a constructive trust action is three years if based
on fraud or mistake, or four years if it falls within the catchall provision of
the statute. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 338, subd. (d), 343.) Both provisions begin
the statute running when the wronged party discovers or should have discovered
the fraud, mistake or breach of fiduciary duty. (Calkins v. Calkins
(1923) 63 Cal.App. 292, 302; Truesdail v. Lewis (1941) 45 Cal.App.2d
718, 723.)
 
“In
the case of an involuntary [constructive] trust the statute of limitations
begins to run ... from the time when the wrongful or fraudulent acts are
performed by the trustee, except that the statute is tolled as to the
[equitable] owner of the property until he actually acquires knowledge of the
wrongful acts, or, by the exercise of reasonable care, until he is charged with
such notice. [Citation.]” (Truesdail v. Lewis (1941) 45 Cal.App.2d 718,
723; see also Bainbridge v. Stoner (1940) 16 Cal.2d 423, 429 [cause of
action to impose constructive trust arose when defendant wrongfully acquired
property, “and the statute commenced to run against the [plaintiffs] at least
as soon as they knew, or should have known, what he had done”].)
 
Here,
the FAC alleges: 
 
“In 2012, the Marklands received
their green cards. Sometime thereafter, they contacted Delroy Miller about
transferring the property. Delroy avoided them and claimed a series of delays,
saying that he was “waiting on the tax man” before he could transfer title to
the Home. The Marklands repeatedly followed up with Delroy, but each attempt
was met with new excuses. At no point did Delroy make an unequivocal statement
that he would not make the transfer. He continued to say he would honor the
agreement at a later date. Although the delay in transferring title weighed
heavily on the Marklands, they continued to believe in good faith that Delroy
intended to transfer the Home, and that the delays were the result of his
attempting to appease his wife, who opposed the transfer.” (FAC ¶ 27.) 
 
Notwithstanding
these allegations, the FAC alleges that it was not until 2021 when Plaintiffs
“discover[ed] that Delroy had transferred the [Property] into the MillerWright
Family Trust that the [Plaintiffs] began to suspect he would not honor their
agreement.” (FAC ¶¶ 6, 27-29.)
 
            Here,
the allegations demonstrate that Plaintiffs made a demand for the Property in
or around 2012. The Complaint was not filed until 2022. These allegations
either definitively demonstrate a breach of trust with regard to the
constructive trust or must be treated as allegations suggesting that Plaintiffs
should have been on notice of their underlying claims at some point after 2012.
Further, these allegations are insufficient to demonstrate delayed discovery of
the breach or accrual of the claim; instead, the allegations suggest that
Plaintiffs should have been on notice of their underlying claims at some point
after 2012. 
 
            Thus, the demurrer to this cause of
action is sustained on statute of limitations grounds. 
 
Third Cause
of Action for Resulting Trust:
 
            Defendant argues this claim is a
remedy, not a cause of action, fails to state a claim and is barred by the
statute of limitations.
 
            Like the constructive trust claim,
the law suggests that a resulting trust is merely an equitable remedy. (Marvin
v. Marvin (1976) 18 Cal.3d 660, 665 [resulting trust is an equitable
remedy]; Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 76 [resulting
trust is a remedy, not a cause of action].)
 
            However, even if the Court were to
treat the claim as a cognizable cause of action – as opposed to a remedy – the
claim fails for the same reasons as the constructive trust claim.
 
“Ordinarily
a resulting trust arises in favor of the payor of the purchase price of the
property where the purchase price, or a part thereof, is paid by one person and
the title is taken in the name of another.” (Martin v. Kehl (1983) 145
Cal.App.3d 228, 238 [citing Viner v. Untrecht (1945) 26 Cal.2d 261, 269
and Elliott v. Wood (1949) 95 Cal.App.2d 314, 317.) “The trust arises
because it is the natural presumption in such a case that it was their
intention that the ostensible purchaser should acquire and hold the property
for the one with whose means it was acquired.” (Lezinsky v. Mason Malt W.D.
Co. (1921) 185 Cal. 240, 251; Laing v. Laubach (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d
511, 517.) 
 
            This is a classic case of a
resulting trust. The FAC alleges that Plaintiffs furnished the downpayment and
mortgage payments for the Property, but Defendant took legal title until
Plaintiffs became legal residents, at which point the parties agreed the
Property would transfer to Plaintiffs. (FAC ¶¶ 2-3.)  
 
Moreover,
where the elements of a resulting trust are present, the fact that the
transferee and payor of the purchase price made an oral agreement that the
former was to hold the property in trust for the latter, which was
unenforceable under the statute of frauds, does not prevent a resulting trust
from arising. (Viner v. Untrecht, supra, 26 Cal.2d 261, 270.) 
 
            Nonetheless, the claim is barred on the
face of the FAC. 
 
“The
applicable statute of limitations on an action to establish a resulting trust
is the four-year statute found in Code of Civil Procedure section 343. (Estate
of Yool (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 867, 875.) The statute of
limitations does not run on a beneficiary of a resulting trust until he has
actual knowledge of repudiation or breach of trust.” (Martin, supra, 145
Cal.App.3d  at p. 240; see Berniker v.
Berniker (1947) 30 Cal.2d 439, 447-448 [“In the absence of a repudiation by
the trustee, the statute of limitations does not begin to run against a
voluntary resulting trust.”]; Estate of Yool, supra, 151 Cal.App.4th at 875
[same].)
 
Thus,
for the same reasons, as the constructive trust, the statute of limitations
appears to bar the claim here. The demurrer is sustained as to the fourth cause
of action for this reason.
 
Unjust Enrichment:    
 
Defendant
argues this claim is a remedy, not a cause of action, and is barred by the
statute of limitations.
 
Generally,
California requires a person to make restitution if he or she is unjustly
enriched at the expense of another. (First Nationwide Savings v. Perry
(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1657, 1662.) “The fact that one person benefits another
is not, by itself, sufficient to require restitution. The person receiving the
benefit is required to make restitution only if the circumstances are such
that, as between the two individuals, it is unjust for the person to
retain it.” (Id. at p. 1663.)
 
            However, the Court of Appeal, in the
Second District and elsewhere, has repeatedly stated that “[t]here is no
cause of action in California labeled ‘unjust enrichment.’” (City of Oakland
v. Oakland Raiders (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 458, 477 [Second District]; see American
Master Lease LLC v. Idanta Partners, Ltd. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1451, 1481
[Second District] [“the restitutionary remedies of unjust enrichment and
disgorgement are available for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.”];
Jogani v. Superior Court (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 901, 911 [Second
District] [“[Unjust enrichment] is a general principle underlying various
doctrines and remedies, including quasi-contract.”]; De Havilland v. FX
Networks, LLC (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 845, 870 [Second District]
[unjust enrichment is not a cause of action; it is just a restitution claim]; Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1370 [there “is
no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment”]; Castillo v. Toll
Bros., Inc. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1172, 1210 [“California does
not recognize unjust enrichment as a separate cause of action”].)
 
            Here, however, the unjust enrichment remedy sought is not
adequately encompassed as a remedy sought in Plaintiff’s other causes of action.
That is, a constructive trust acts as the remedy to the unjust enrichment claim;
a constructive trust is an equitable remedy for unjust enrichment (Communist
Party v. 522 Valencia, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 980, 990), not
a theory of recovery for breach of contract. “The concept of constructive trust
is, however, . . . [citation] to prevent unjust enrichment and enforce
restitution [Citation.]” (Haskel Engineering & Supply Co. v. Hartford
Acc. & Indem. Co. (1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 371, 375 [describing a
constructive trust as a “remedy designed solely to prevent unjust enrichment”])

 
As
a result of Court’s determination that the constructive trust and resulting
trust claims are remedies and not causes of action, the unjust enrichment adds a substantive claim to
Plaintiffs’ FAC. (FAC ¶¶ 37-60; see Jogani v. Superior Court, supra, 165
Cal.App.4th at 911 [unjust enrichment claim based on same allegations as common
count claim was duplicative and subsumed by common count claim].) Further, a
claim for unjust enrichment lies where, even in the absence of an oral
contract, the plaintiff has “nonetheless ... conferred a benefit on the
defendant which the defendant has knowingly accepted under circumstances that
make it inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying for
its value. [Citation.]” (Hernandez v. Lopez (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 932,
938.) Unjust enrichment is not subject to strict pleading requirements, but
instead describes “ ‘ “a failure to make restitution under circumstances where
it is equitable to do so.” ’ ” (Id. at p. 939.) The spirit behind the
law of unjust enrichment “ ‘is to apply the law “outside of the box” and fill
in the cracks where common civil law and statutes fail to achieve “justice.” ’
[Citation.]” (Ibid.) 
 
Under
the particular circumstances here, the Court will treat the unjust enrichment
claim as a cognizable cause of action. 
 
The
FAC adequately states a claim for unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs paid for the
Property and its expenses, but Defendants received the benefit of title to this
Property. (FAC ¶¶ 15-32.)  
 
Nonetheless,
the unjust enrichment claim suffers from the same statute of limitations
problems as the prior claims. 
The statute
of limitations for a claim for unjust enrichment depends on the underlying
theory on which recovery is sought. (Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Dintino
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 333, 348.) Here, the claim arises from an oral
agreement, which is a two year period. (Code Civ. Proc., § 339.) Further, the
statute of limitations for claim for unjust enrichment is subject to the
delayed discovery rule. (Id., 350 [“We must determine when Bank
actually, or reasonably should have, discovered its mistake that resulted in
the unjust enrichment of Dintino”].) Under this rule, “[a] limitations period
... accrues no later than the time the plaintiff learns the facts essential to
a particular cause of action. [Citations.]” (Bernson v. Browning–Ferris
Industries (1994) 7 Cal.4th 926, 941.) 
For
the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs’ FAC fails to allege facts showing
delayed discovery until 2021. (FAC ¶¶ 6, 27-29.) The demurrer to this cause of action
is sustained. 
 
First Cause
of Action for Quiet Title:
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiffs
have failed to state a claim. 
 
            A quiet title cause of action
generally has two elements: (1) “the plaintiff is the owner and in possession
of the land,” and (2) “the defendant claims an interest therein adverse to [the
plaintiff].” (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d
725, 740; see West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th
780, 802–803; Code Civ. Proc., § 761.020.)
 
            Defendant demurs on the grounds that
Plaintiffs are not the legal owners and therefore cannot assert a claim against
him as the legal owner. (See G.R. Holcomb Estate Co. v. Burke (1935) 4
Cal.2d 289, 297–299.) However, the FAC alleges that Defendant Miller “acquired
only bare legal title which [he] held as constructive trustee for [Plaintiffs],
who, based on the equities, held superior title. (Warren v. Merrill
(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 96, 114.) Thus, this argument fails. 
 
            The statute of limitations argument
also fails. 
            “[Q]uiet title actions have special rules for when
the limitations period begins to run.” (Salazar v. Thomas (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 467, 477, 186 Cal.Rptr.3d 689 (Salazar).) “ ‘ “[A]s a
general rule, the statute of limitations [for a quiet title action] does not
run against one in possession of land.” ’ [Citation.] Part of the rationale for
this special rule for quiet title actions is an unwillingness to convert a
statute of limitations into a statute that works a forfeiture of property
rights on the person holding the most obvious and important property
right–namely, possession.” (Ibid.) 
            Further, under well-established law, “A vendee who has
fully performed his part of a contract of sale is the beneficiary of a trust in
the legal title, which is held for him by the vendor; and the statute of
limitations does not run against a cause of action specifically to enforce the
contract until such trust is clearly and unequivocally repudiated by the
vendor.” (Kidd v. Kidd (1964) 61 Cal.2d 479, 481.) A repudiation
requires more than the vendor's refusal to convey title to the property; where
the vendee is in actual possession of the property, no repudiation by the
vendor is effective unless it includes the vendor's actual taking possession of
the property. (Kidd, supra, at p. 481; Peixouto v. Peixouto
(1919) 40 Cal.App. 782, 788 [statute of limitations will not commence to run
“so long as the purchaser is in possession”]; see also Muktarian v. Barmby
(1965) 63 Cal.2d 558, 560 [“no statute of limitations runs against a
plaintiff seeking to quiet title while he is in possession of the property”
(fn. omitted, emphasis added) ]; Smith v. Matthews (1889) 81 Cal. 120,
121 [right of purchasers and their successors to have quiet title was not and
could not be barred while they “remained in the actual possession of the land,
claiming to be the owners thereof, and the actual owners, as against the defendant,
of all interest therein except the mere naked title”]; see Ankoanda v.
Walker–Smith (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 610, 616–617 [dictum acknowledging
rule].)
            Thus, the statute of limitations has not run on this
claim. 
Nonetheless,
Plaintiffs are required to plead certain statutory elements pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 761.02.0; the FAC fails to identify the date as of
which the determination is sought and the FAC is unverified. Thus, the demurrer
is sustained on this basis. 
 
Sixth Cause
of Action for Declaratory Relief:
 
To
state a claim for declaratory relief, the plaintiff must allege facts showing
there is a dispute between the parties concerning their legal rights,
constituting an “actual controversy” within the meaning of the declaratory
relief statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1060; Artus v Gramercy Towers
Condominium Assn. (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 923, 930.)


A claim for declaratory relief fails when it is “ ‘
“wholly derivative” of other failed claims.’ ” (Smyth v. Berman (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 183, 191-192
quoting Ball v. FleetBoston Financial Corp. (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 794, 800.) Here, Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory relief fails as
dependent on and derivative of their insufficient quiet title
cause of action. (FAC ¶¶ 65-69.) 
 
            As result of the Court’s sustaining
the demurrer to all the other causes of action, this derivative claim also
fails. (FAC ¶¶65-69.) 
            
Laches:
 
            Finally,
Defendant argues the claims are all barred by the doctrine of laches. 
 
To prevail, the defendant must show (1)
unreasonable delay; and (2) “ ‘ “either acquiescence in the act about which
plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.”
[Citation.]’ ” (Highland Springs Conference & Training Center v. City of
Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 267, 282.) “[T]he affirmative defense of
laches requires unreasonable delay in bringing suit ‘plus either acquiescence
in the act about which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant
resulting from the delay.’ ” (Miller v. Eisenhower Medical
Center (1980) 27 Cal.3d 614, 624.) 
 
            It is true that “[o]n
undisputed facts, the applicability of laches may be decided as a matter of
law.” (Committee to Save the Beverly Highlands Homes Assn. v. Beverly
Highlands Homes Assn. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1247, 1266; see Isakoolian
v. Issacoulian (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 225, 229, [laches “may be raised and
determined by a general demurrer”]; Arnold, supra, 45 Cal.App.2d at pp.
530-534 [upholding demurrer under laches doctrine based on judicially noticed
materials].) However, the application of this doctrine is generally a factual
question.


            Here, the facts as
pleaded do not obviate the possibility of discovery shedding material light on
the applicable circumstances contributing to the delay in Plaintiffs bringing
this action. Based on the totality of Plaintiffs’ allegations (which are
assumed to be true), the application of the doctrine of laches and whether such
delay was reasonable is far too factual a question to resolve at the demurrer
stage. (See City of Oakland v. Public Employees' Retirement System
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 29, 52 [“Laches in almost all cases raises factual issues
regarding the cause of an asserted delay and the prejudice, vel non,
therefrom”].)
 
Moreover, prejudice is never presumed; rather it
must be affirmatively demonstrated by the defendant in order to sustain her
burden of proof and the production of evidence on the issue. (Miller v. Eisenhower Medical Center, supra, at p. 624.) Here, there is no allegation in the FAC
demonstrating prejudice to Defendant from the delay. 
 
Statute of Frauds:
 
Finally, Defendant also raises a statute
of fraud argument. The entirety of Defendant’s argument is:
 
“The so called transaction alleged in the
pleadings would clearly come under the Statue of Frauds. (Civil Code S 1624).
Due the fact there is no writing and the requirements of Civil Code S 1624 are
not met, the alleged transaction is not enforceable and the entire complaint
must be dismissed with prejudice. Further we cannot rely on the alleged words
of a third party (Mother) from 25 years ago.” (Dem., 6:13-16.)
 
            This
argument is entirely undeveloped with respect to both the facts and the law.
Thus, this argument has been waived for the purposes of this demurrer. 
 
Conclusion
 
            The demurrer is sustained in its
entirety. Plaintiff shall have leave to amend with
respect to the first, second, and sixth causes of action; Plaintiff shall have
leave to amend the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action as remedies. An
amended complaint shall be filed and served by December 2, 2023.
