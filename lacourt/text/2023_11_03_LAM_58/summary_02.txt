And here is a summary of the ruling in English:

The court has sustained the demurrer in its entirety. The demurrer was filed by the defendant, Delroy Miller, and argued that the first amended complaint failed to state a claim for each of the six causes of action. The court agreed and sustained the demurrer.

The court gave the plaintiffs, Norman and Maisie Markland, leave to amend with respect to the first, second, and sixth causes of action, and leave to amend the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action as remedies.

The court also noted that the plaintiffs' claims for unjust enrichment, constructive trust, and resulting trust were barred by the statute of limitations, and that the claim for declaratory relief was derivative and failed.

The court did not address the defendant's arguments about laches and the statute of frauds, as these were not sufficiently developed.
