Legal
Standard
If
a party fails to comply with a court order compelling a further response to a
request for production, the court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or
terminating sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310,
subd. (i).) CCP section 2023.030 provides that,
"[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method..., the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or
attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose... [monetary, evidence,
and terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse
of the discovery process...." CCP section 2023.010 provides that
"[m]issues of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the
following:... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery...." 
 
"The trial
court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering
the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if
the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the
number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'" (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang
v. Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) "Generally, '[a]
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation omitted).) 
 
"Under this
standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties
have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders." (Id. (citing Lang,
supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244- 1246); see, e.g., Collisson X Kaplan v.
Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions
imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce
discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal App
3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCucchen (1997)
16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for
failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery
statutes).)

Discussion 
 
Plaintiffs moves
for terminating sanctions or in the alternative, issue sanctions, against
Defendants on the ground that Defendants failed to comply with six Court orders
to respond to discovery and pay monetary sanctions.
On February 21, 2023, this Court granted
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel London Towne Center to provide further responses
to requests for production (set one) and request for sanctions in the amount of
$1,840.65 against London Towne. The requests for production were for accounting
of Defendants’ finances. (2/21/2023 Minute Order.) Defendant Norris was present
at the hearing. (Id.) Plaintiffs gave notice of the Court ruling the next day.
(2/22/23 Notice of Ruling.) 
On March 3, 2023, this Court granted
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant Norris to provide further responses to
request for production of documents (set one), and request for sanctions in the
amount of $1,840.65 against Norris. The Court stated responses were due within
30 days. (3/3/23 Minute Order.) Plaintiff gave notice of the Court ruling on
March 6, 2023. (3/6/23 Notice of Ruling.)
On April 25, 2023, this Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motions to compel Defendant Norris’ responses to
supplemental request for interrogatories (set one), and supplemental request
for production of documents (set one), and request for sanctions in the amount
of $1,141.85 against Norris. The Court stated that responses were due within 15
days. (4/25/23 Minute Order.) Plaintiffs gave notice of the ruling the same
day. (4/25/23 Notice of Ruling.)
On June 9, 2023, this Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant London Towne to respond to
supplemental interrogatories (set one), and request for sanctions against
London Towne in the amount of $1,158.15. The Court ordered responses to be provided
by June 22, 2023. (6/9/23 Minute Order.) Plaintiffs gave notice of the ruling
on June 12, 2023. (6/12/23 Notice of Ruling.)
On June 20, 2023, this Court
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Defendant London Towne Center, LLC to respond to
supplemental requests for production of documents (set one), and request for
sanctions in the amount of $1,155.15. Responses were due in 10 days. (6/20/23
Minute Order.) Plaintiffs gave notice on June 21, 2023. (6/21/23 Notice of
Ruling.
On July 3, 2023, this Court
ordered Defendant Norris to comply with the discovery orders from February 21,
2023, March 3, 2023, April 25, 2023, June 9, 2023, and June 20, 2023 by July
10, 2023. The Court also ordered Defendant Norris to appear for deposition
on July 21, 2023. (7/3/23 Minute Order.) 
It is noteworthy that Norris is self-represented and personally appeared
without an attorney on the case for the first time on the date of trial, July
3, 2023.  On that date, he indicated that
he would have trouble responding to discovery by himself, but that he would do
the best he could.  He nonetheless agreed
to provide discovery by the next week, July 10, 2023 at 5:00 p.m.  He also stated that he was unable to get an
attorney.  He advised the court that he
would appear at the deposition.  
On July 21, 2023, Norris did
appear for deposition but failed to produce any of the documents. At this
deposition Norris readily confessed that he failed to comply with the Court’s
July 3, 2023 orders even by the time of the deposition – which meant that he
failed to comply with the five orders that were the subject of the July 3, 2023
Order – and that he had no excuse for his failure and refusal to comply. (Cohon
Decl., ¶ 23.)
Despite this
Court’s orders from February 21, 2023, March 3, 2023, April 25, 2023, June
3, 2023 and June 20, 2023 ordering Defendant to comply with the discovery, and
the July 3, 2023 order directing Defendant to comply with the
Court’s orders, Defendants have failed to respond to the discovery at issue.
(Cohon Decl., ¶ 24.)
 
The Court notes that whether Defendant complied with the Court’s
order to pay monetary sanctions is not relevant to the determination of whether
terminating sanctions¿should be imposed.  A court may not issue a
terminating sanction for failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction. ¿(Newland
v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 610, 615.)¿ A monetary
sanction order is enforceable as a money judgment under the Enforcement of
Judgments Law, CCP §§680.010, et seq.  (Id. at
615.)    
 
The Court notes that Defendant London Towne’s answer was stricken
and default was entered against it on June 22, 2023. Thus, the motion is moot as to London Towne.
 
However, Defendant Norris
has been engaging in conduct that is an abuse of the discovery process by
violating the discovery statutes, and failing to comply with multiple Court
orders compelling Defendant’s responses. Moreover, Defendant has not
filed an opposition to indicate he will comply with these discovery
obligations, or explain his failure to comply with the Court’s discovery orders
to show he did not willfully disobey the orders. Nevertheless, Defendant did
appear for deposition on July 21, 2023, when the Court warned that sanctions
may be imposed if he failed to appear. (7/3/23 Minute Order.) As a result, the
Court will allow Defendant one final opportunity to respond to ALL
of the discovery orders at issue, e.g., the orders from February 21, 2023,
March 3, 2023, April 25, 2023, June 3, 2023 and June 20, 2023. The Court will
continue this hearing. Defendant is ORDERED to comply with all of the discovery
orders 7 days before the continued hearing date on this motion. If Defendant
complies with all of the discovery at issue 7 days before the continued hearing
date on this motion, then the Court will deny this motion. If, however,
Defendant does not comply with the discovery 7 days before the continued
hearing date of this motion, then the Court is very inclined to grant this
motion for terminating sanctions, rendering Defendant in default.
Plaintiffs are
ordered to file a declaration 5 days before the continued hearing date
informing the Court as to whether Defendant complied.
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion for terminating or issue sanctions is
CONTINUED to October 24, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. to allow Defendant one final opportunity
to respond to ALL of the discovery orders at issue, e.g., the orders
from February 21, 2023, March 3, 2023, April 25, 2023, June 3, 2023 and June
20, 2023.
