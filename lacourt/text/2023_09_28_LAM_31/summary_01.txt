## English Summary

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff to answer their special interrogatories is **granted**. The Plaintiff must provide these answers within 30 days, without objection. 

The Judge denied the Defendant's request for sanctions because the Defendant did not specify who they wanted sanctioned in their motion. 



The Judge's reasoning is based on the fact that the Defendant properly served the interrogatories, and the Plaintiff failed to respond by the deadline despite several reminders.
