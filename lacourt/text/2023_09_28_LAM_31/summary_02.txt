## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion by Plaintiffs for terminating sanctions against Defendants Norris and London Towne Center, LLC. The motion stems from the Defendants' repeated failure to comply with multiple court orders compelling them to provide discovery responses.

The judge notes Norris's persistent failure to comply with discovery orders, including his failure to appear for a deposition with requested documents.  

Although a default has been entered against London Towne Center, the motion is still pending against Norris.

The judge is strongly considering terminating Norris's case due to his continued non-compliance.  

However, the judge is giving Norris one final chance to comply with all outstanding discovery orders by October 17, 2023. 
The hearing is continued to October 24, 2023, and the Plaintiffs must file a declaration 5 days prior to the hearing stating whether Norris has complied. If Norris fails to comply by the deadline, the judge will likely grant the motion for terminating sanctions, resulting in a default judgment against him.

In this tentative ruling, the Judge continues Plaintiffs' motion for terminating or issue sanctions against Defendant Norris to October 24, 2023, to allow Defendant one final opportunity to respond to all discovery orders at issue. Defendant Norris is ordered to comply with all discovery orders 7 days before the continued hearing date. Plaintiffs are ordered to file a declaration 5 days before the continued hearing date informing the Court as to whether Defendant complied. The ruling is based on Defendant's failure to comply with multiple Court orders compelling Defendant's responses and not filing an opposition to indicate compliance with discovery obligations. The Court notes that Defendant London Towne's answer was stricken and default was entered against it on June 22, 2023, making the motion moot as to London Towne.
