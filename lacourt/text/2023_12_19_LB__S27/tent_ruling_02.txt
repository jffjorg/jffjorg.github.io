 Case Number:  23LBCV00221    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2023    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, Christina Alexandra
Arnao filed this action against
Defendant, Mercedes-Benz, USA for Violation of the Song-Beverly Act.  Plaintiff filed her complaint on 2/06/23.  
 
On 8/09/23, the parties appeared at a Case Management Conference.  At the hearing, the Court specially set a
hearing on a motion to compel arbitration for 12/19/23.  Moving papers, per CCP §1005, were due on or
before 11/27/23.  
 
For reasons that are not clear, Defendant reserved a new hearing date
on a motion to compel arbitration for 7/09/24 and filed moving papers on
12/05/23, after moving papers were due in order for the motion to be timely
heard on 11/27/23.  The Court presumes
this was done, at least in part, because the California Supreme Court has
granted review of the Court of Appeals’ ruling in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company (2023)
89 Cal.App.5th 1324.  
 
The Court will not rule on the motion to compel arbitration at this
time, as it does not appear the parties intend for the specially scheduled
hearing to go forward.  There is a Case Management
Conference also on calendar today.  At the
CMC, the Court will discuss a new hearing date for the motion to compel
arbitration with the parties. The Court will not permit Defendant to delay this
action for another seven months.  
 
The parties are reminded that there
is a CMC on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration.  The Court asks the parties to make arrangements
to appear remotely at the conference.
