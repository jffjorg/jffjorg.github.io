```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant on FROGs 15.1 and 17.1. The defendant has already responded to the FROGs and has indicated that she will supplement her responses as additional information becomes available. The court notes that the situation is distinct from Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrators, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093, where the defendant failed to provide further responses despite repeated court orders. The court finds that the defendant has provided all information she currently has in her possession and that the plaintiff is free to use this discovery in any legally permissible manner. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
