And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Dean C. Logan, in response to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Marco-Joseph Valdez. The demurrer was sustained on several grounds, including the failure to allege compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act, the lack of a statutory basis for the claims, and the failure to state a cause of action.

The plaintiff's causes of action for knowingly concealing verified evidence and practicing fraud and deceit against a witness were subject to demurrer, and the defendant was acting within his discretion when he refused to record the document. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to allege compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act, and therefore, the complaint was subject to demurrer.

The judge also found that the defendant was immune from liability for the acts complained of, as they were acts of discretion. The judge did not find that the determination under Government Code §27201(a) was a discretionary one, and therefore, the demurrer on this ground was overruled.

The judge denied leave to amend the complaint, as the plaintiff failed to show in what manner the complaint could be amended to state a cause of action. The parties are reminded of the Case Management Conference and OSC re: failure to prosecute, which is scheduled to be held concurrently with the hearing on the demurrer.
