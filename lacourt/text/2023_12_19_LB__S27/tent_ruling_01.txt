  Case Number:  22LBUD00619    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2023    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff filed this unlawful detainer action on 5/05/22.  After much litigation, Defendant vacated the
premises on 9/24/23.  Because Defendant
vacated the premises, the Court took the trial re: possession off calendar on
9/25/23.  
 
At this time,
Plaintiff moves to amend the complaint to state a claim for monetary damages as
an unlimited civil, rather than unlawful detainer, action.  The motion is premised on CCP §§1952.3, 472,
473, and 464, which collectively permit the relief sought.  
 
Any opposition to
the motion was due on or before 12/06/23. 
The Court has not received timely opposition to the motion, and will not
consider untimely opposition papers.  The
motion is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered
to file a separate copy of the amended complaint within ten days.  Defendant is ordered to file a responsive
pleading within thirty days thereafter.
 
The parties are
reminded that there is a Case Management Conference on calendar concurrently with
the hearing on the above motion.  The Court
asks the parties to make arrangements to appear remotely at the CMC and hearing
on the motion.
