And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in case number 22LBUD00619. The case involves an unlawful detainer action filed by the plaintiff on May 5, 2022. After much litigation, the defendant vacated the premises on September 24, 2023, and the court took the trial re: possession off calendar on September 25, 2023. The plaintiff has now moved to amend the complaint to state a claim for monetary damages as an unlimited civil action, citing California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1952.3, 472, 473, and 464. Since no opposition was filed within the required timeframe, the court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to file a separate copy of the amended complaint within ten days. The defendant must file a responsive pleading within thirty days thereafter. The parties are also reminded of an upcoming Case Management Conference on December 19, 2023, and are instructed to make arrangements to appear remotely at the conference and hearing on the motion.
