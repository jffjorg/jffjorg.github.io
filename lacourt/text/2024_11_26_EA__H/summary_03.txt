And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers and motions to strike filed by the defendants in the case of Sean Jayewardene v. Mercury Insurance Company LLC, et al. The defendants, Mercury Insurance Company LLC, Mercury Insurance Services, Abraham Chorbajian, Eli Chorbajian, and Maral Chorbajian, had demurred to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, arguing that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The judge has overruled the demurrer of Maral Chorbajian, finding that the plaintiff's complaint does state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against her. The judge has granted the motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint, finding that the complaint lacks factual allegations to support a claim for punitive damages.

The judge has sustained the demurrer of Mercury Insurance Company LLC, finding that the plaintiff's complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against it. The judge has denied as moot Mercury's motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint, as the demurrer has been sustained.

The judge has set a case management conference for October 1, 2024, and will hear from the plaintiff as to whether leave to amend is requested and if so, will require an offer of proof.
