  Case Number:  19PSCV00643    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  H Rizvi,
et al. v. Diligent Lending, LLC, et al., Case No. 19PSCV00643
 
The Court is inclined to set an
evidentiary hearing pursuant to Paragraph 3.3 of the Settlement Agreement, for February
7, 2025, at 10:00 a.m.
 
Background 
Plaintiffs Syed M. Hammad Rizvi (“Rizvi”), Afsah
Moinuddin (“Moinuddin”) and Eagle Ridge Property Management, LLC (“Eagle
Ridge”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:

          Rizvi
and Moinuddin are married and formed Eagle Ridge to hold title to their primary
residence located at 10068 Eagle Ridge Court, Rancho Cucamonga, CA (“Eagle
Ridge Residence”). In March 2018, Rizvi met Vincente Cuevas (“V. Cuevas”)
outside of a partially completed home located on a
1.24-acre lot at 1533 Calle Cristina, San Dimas, California (“the Cristina
Property”). V. Cuevas represented that he was the owner and builder of the
Cristina Property. After Rizvi consulted with his banker and informed V. Cuevas
that he was unable to purchase the Cristina Property, V. Cuevas advised Rizvi
that he could help Rizvi structure the purchase and arrange a loan so he could
afford to buy it. 
          V. Cuevas subsequently introduced
Rizvi to Kevin Cornell (“Cornell”) of KWC Realty Services, Inc. dba Priority
One Mortgage (“Priority One”).  In April
2018, Cornell told Rizvi that he could obtain a purchase and construction loan
to finish the construction of the home and that there would be at least one
year of reserve funds (later modified to six months) to pay for the
construction and monthly interest payments while the construction was being
completed. V. Cuevas also promised Rizvi that he would refer $1.2 million of
the purchase price for at least 5 years. 
          Rizvi decided to purchase the Cristina
Property and engaged Cornell and Priority One to assist as the mortgage broker.
Cornell advised Rizvi that he would help fill out the salient information in
the Uniform Residential Loan Application (“Loan Application”) and told Rizvi to
ignore the asset, liability, or income sections on the application. The Loan
Application Cornell initially sent to Rizvi was partial only and indicated that
the loan was for the purchase of a primary residence. Cornell also advised
Rizvi that Plaintiffs should take title to the Cristina Property under Eagle
Ridge. Plaintiffs signed the purchase agreement on April 19, 2018. 
          On May 9, 2018, Cornell provided Rizvi
with a completed Loan Application, which modified the purpose of the property
from “primary residence” to “investment.” On June 18, 2018, Plaintiffs executed
a promissory note with Diligent Lending, a hard money lender, for the principal
sum of $2,699,000.00. Per the terms of the promissory note, Plaintiffs were to
make interest only payments of $25,033.15 per month, with an interest rate of
10.99%, and a 28.99% default interest rate (“Note”). A deed of trust in the
principal amount of the Note was recorded. 
          On May 28, 2018, Cornell sent a short
form deed of trust to Rizvi and told him to sign and return it. A deed of trust
in the amount of $940,000.00 was then recorded in second position in favor of
Cuevas and Jesus Anthony Rubio
(identified therein as “Tony Rubio;” hereinafter, “Rubio”) which references
a note, even though no such note exists; although Plaintiffs executed a note
for $2,040,000.00 in favor of V. Cuevas and Rubio, Cornell and V. Cuevas told
Plaintiffs that this $2,040,000.00 reflected the amount owed to Rubio by V.
Cuevas previously secured by the Cristina Property in first position as well as
V. Cuevas’s equity in the Cristina Property that he was willing to forego for
at least five years. The $2,040,000.00 note is not reflected in the escrow
instructions or closing statement but indicates that it is secured by a deed of
trust on the Cristina Property. Cornell, Priority One, and Diligent Lending
purposefully and fraudulently characterized the Note as a business purpose
loan. 
          Shortly
after escrow closed, on August 23, 2018, Rizvi received a notice from Diligent
Lending demanding that he start making monthly interest payments of $25,033.15
on the Note. Rizvi asked Diligent Lending about the 6 months interest reserve
that was supposedly built into the loan but was told by Cornell and Diligent
Lending that there were no reserve funds. Plaintiffs had to refinance the Eagle
Ridge Residence and get equity out to save the Cristina Property. Now that
Plaintiffs had to use the equity in the Eagle Ridge Residence to maintain the
Note payments, though, Plaintiffs did not have sufficient funds for a down
payment to refinance. Plaintiffs have since defaulted on their obligations
under the Note. 
On July 18, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a
complaint, asserting causes of action against Diligent Lending, Priority One,
Cornell and Does 1-100 for:
          1.       Fraud—Intentional Misrepresentation,
          2.       Breach of Fiduciary Duty,
          3.       Negligence,
          4.       Unfair Business Practices in Violation of
Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200,
          5.       Unjust Enrichment, and
          6.       Common Count: Money Had and Received. 
On December 6, 2019, the Court granted
Diligent Lending’s petition to compel arbitration as to Plaintiffs and ordered
the matter stayed as to Plaintiffs and Diligent Lending only. 
On January 24, 2020, V. Cuevas filed a
cross-complaint, asserting causes of action against Rizvi, Diligent Lending,
Priority One and Moes 1-50 for:
          1.       Breach of Contract,
          2.       Comparative Negligence, and
          3.       Contribution. 
On January 29, 2020, Plaintiffs
dismissed Diligent Lending, without prejudice. On March 11, 2020, V. Cuevas
dismissed Rizvi, without prejudice. 
On June 8, 2020, Case Nos. 19PSCV00643
and 19PSCV00656 were deemed related; Case No. 19PSCV00656 was designated as the
lead case. 
On October 20, 2020, Priority One and
Cornell filed a First Amended Cross-complaint, asserting causes of action
against Andrew A. Dioli (“Dioli”), FMC Lending Inc. (“FMC”), Bayshore Advisors,
Inc. (“Bayshore”), Rushmyfile.Inc. (“Rushmyfile”), V. Cuevas, Vince Cuevas,
Shahid Iqbal, and Roes 1-10 for:
          1.       Indemnity,
          2.       Contribution, and
          3.       Declaratory Relief. 
On December 29, 2020, Dioli, FMC,
Bayshore, and Rushmyfile filed a cross-complaint, asserting causes of action
against Priority One, Cornell, and Moes 1-10 for:
          1.       Fraud,
          2.       Negligence,
          3.       Indemnity,
          4.       Contribution,
          5.       Declaratory Relief, and
          6.       Breach of Implied in Fact Contract.
On June 7, 2021, the Court dismissed
Priority One and Diligent Lending from V. Cuevas’ cross-complaint.
On January 16, 2024, the Court dismissed
Dioli, et al.’s cross-complaint and struck FMC, Bayshore, and Rushmyfile’s
answer.
On May 9, 2024, a “Stipulation Re
Settlement” was filed. On August 23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an unconditional
“Notice of Settlement of Entire Case.”
On August 29, 2024, a “Stipulation to
Dismiss and Request that the Court Retain Jurisdiction Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure Section 664.6 [and] Order” was entered.
Pending before the Court is Plaintiff’s
motion to enforce settlement. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court is
inclined to set an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Paragraph 3.3 of the
settlement agreement.
 
Legal
Standard
“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subd. (a).)

Discussion
Plaintiffs move
the Court for an order, per Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, entering
judgment against Priority One and Cornell in the principal amount of
$299,250.00, or in the alternative in the principal amount of $52,250.00, and
request that the Court hold an evidentiary hearing and receive evidence for the
purpose of granting an order enforcing the terms of the Settlement Agreement
and Release (“Agreement”) between the parties, and finding that Priority One
and Cornell made material misrepresentations in the Agreement pursuant to
Paragraph 3.4 of the Agreement.
 
Evidentiary
Objections
At the
outset, the Court addresses Plaintiffs’ evidentiary objections to the
Declaration of Christopher Hook. The Court sustains the objections as to Paragraph
7 and overrules the objection as to the second sentence of Paragraph 11.
 
Merits
On August
22, 2024, Plaintiffs, Priority One, and Cornell entered into the Agreement,
wherein Priority One and Cornell agreed to pay Plaintiffs $53,000.00 in
exchange for a dismissal without prejudice, with the Court reserving
jurisdiction under section 664.6 to enforce the terms of the Agreement. (Rizvi
Decl., ¶ 12, Exh. 4; Chamberlin Decl., ¶ 4.) The Agreement provides, in
relevant part, as follows:
          “2. Payment to Rizvi. In
exchange for the releases and promises set forth below, Cornell agrees to pay
the total sum of fifty-three thousand dollars ($53,000.00) to Rizvi to settle
the Action (the ‘Settlement Amount’) as follows:
          2.1 Beginning on September 1st, 2024,
the payment of the Settlement Amount shall be paid to Rizvi each month in two installments
of $750 on the 1st and 15th of each month until the Settlement
Amount is paid in full. The last payment, due on July 1st, 2027,
will be in the amount of $500.00 to complete the payment of the Settlement
Amount. . .
          2.4 Cornell will have a five (5) day
grace period. If the five (5) day grace period is exceeded, Rizi [sic] may
enter judgment in the amount of $53,000 minus amounts actually paid and Cornel
[sic] stipulates to the entry of that judgment.” (Id., ¶ 2.)
The
Agreement additionally provides, in relevant part, as follows: 
 
          “3.
Financial Documents. Cornell represents that, other than the Settlement
Amount, he is financially unable to respond to a judgment or greater settlement
payment. Rizvi is relying on this representation in deciding to enter into this
Agreement. To substantiate his representation, Cornell shall transmit to
Rizvi’s counsel the most recent personal and business tax returns, one-year of
personal and business bank statements, and documents sufficient to show the
deposition of the proceeds of the 2022 loan for $2.7 million against Cornell’s
house (the ‘Financial Documents’).
 
          3.1     Cornell
will sign a declaration, under the penalty of perjury, attesting to the
completeness and accuracy of the Financial Documents submitted to Rizvi’s
counsel.
          3.2     Cornell
will deliver the Financial Documents to Rizvi’s counsel within thirty (30) days
after the execution of the final Settlement Agreement. . .
          3.3     If
it is shown by Rizvi, through an evidentiary hearing, that Cornell has made
material misrepresentations in this Agreement, in the Financial Documents or in
his declaration, Rizvi may move the Court to enter judgment against Cornell in
the amount of $300,000 less amounts actually paid under this Agreement and Cornell
stipulates to that judgment. The amount of $300,000 represents an actual loss
sustained by Rizvi in connection with the Transaction alleged in the Action and
is not punitive.” (Id., ¶ 3).
Plaintiff’s
counsel Bekah Chamberlin (“Chamberlin”) represents as follows:
          On September 9, 2024, Chamberlin sent
an email to Priority One and Cornell’s counsel regarding the delinquent first
payment of $750.00, which was due on September 1, 2024, with the reminder that
the second payment was coming due on September 15, 2024. (Chamberlin Decl., ¶
6, Exh. 6, pp. 1-2.) On September 16, 2024, Priority One and Cornell’s counsel
responded with confirmation from Priority One and Cornell that the first
payment was sent on September 13, 2024. (Id.) On September 23, 2024,
Chamberlin sent an email to Priority One and Cornell’s counsel regarding the
delinquent second payment of $750.00 and the financial documents which were due
that day, but Priority One and Cornell’s counsel never responded. (Id.,
¶ 7, Exh. 6, p. 1.) Priority One and Cornell have failed to provide any
financial documents or a verifying declaration. (Id.)
Plaintiff
confirms that he has received only one payment of $750.00 on September 13,
2024, as of the October 11, 2024 filing date of the motion. (Rizvi Decl., ¶ 14.)
Priority One
and Cornell, in response, oppose the motion to the extent that it seeks entry
of judgment against them in the amount of $299,250.00, rather than the
$53,000.00 sum agreed to in the Agreement. Curiously, Priority One and
Cornell’s opposition is not accompanied by a declaration from Cornell himself.
Priority One
and Cornell’s counsel, Christopher Hook (“Hook”), attests that he attempted to
send Plaintiff’s counsel the agreed upon financial documents and declaration
and believed that it had been transmitted on that date, but learned for the
first time on October 11, 2024, when he received the instant motion, that his
September 23, 2024 email had not gone through. (Hook Decl., ¶ 9.) Hook
represents that he immediately re-sent these documents to Plaintiff’s counsel
by emailing them a Dropbox link to the documents. (Id., ¶ 10, Exh. B.)
Plaintiff,
in turn, points out that Priority One and Cornell did not provide all of the
documents set forth in the Agreement (including personal bank statements and
documents showing the disposition of the $251,760.94 proceeds of the 2022 loan
against Cornell’s house) and did not include a declaration under penalty of
perjury attesting to the completeness and accuracy of the documents.
Under the
circumstances presented above, the Court is inclined to set an evidentiary
hearing pursuant to Paragraph 3.3 of the Agreement.
