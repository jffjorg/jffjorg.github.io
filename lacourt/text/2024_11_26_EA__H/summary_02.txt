The Court grants the petitioner's motion for an order instructing the judgment debtors to assign their interests in any and all monies, proceeds, receivables, and payables received by them from Apple to the extent necessary to pay the petitioner's judgment. The judgment debtors are ordered to assign their rights to payments, royalties, and compensation from Apple to the petitioner. The motion is granted because the petitioner has received one payment in the amount of $1,255.42 through a previous levy conducted on or about June 4, 2024, and there is still due and owing the amount of $153,821.38 through November 26, 2024. The judgment is final and enforcement thereof is not stayed.
