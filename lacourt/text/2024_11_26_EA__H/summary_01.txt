Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to set an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Priority One and Cornell made material misrepresentations in the settlement agreement. The agreement provides for the payment of $53,000.00 to Rizvi in exchange for the releases and promises set forth below, and for the payment of the Settlement Amount to be paid to Rizvi each month in two installments of $750.00 until the Settlement Amount is paid in full. However, Priority One and Cornell have failed to provide the financial documents and declaration required by the agreement, and the Court is concerned that they may have made material misrepresentations in the agreement. The Court will therefore set an evidentiary hearing to determine the accuracy of the financial documents and to determine whether Priority One and Cornell should be held in contempt for their failure to comply with the agreement.
