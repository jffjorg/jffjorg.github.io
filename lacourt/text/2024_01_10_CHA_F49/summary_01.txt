Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the claim for surplus funds submitted by Jonathan Barnes without prejudice. The court notes that the petition for deposit of funds was filed by Western Progressive on October 5, 203, but no signed order for deposit of funds was ever issued. The court orders Western Progressive to deposit the surplus funds with the court and provide proof of receipt. Once the funds are deposited, the court will set a hearing for disbursement of the surplus funds. The court acknowledges Barnes' claim for $175,834 based on unpaid judgments, but notes that it will need to wait for any and all claims pending the hearing for disbursement. The court also notes that Barnes' "motion" fails to address the liens of other parties.
