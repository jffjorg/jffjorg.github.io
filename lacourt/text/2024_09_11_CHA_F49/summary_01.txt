Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Cyrus Jazaeri v. Michael R. Rhames, case number 23CHCV03446. The Judge has sustained the demurrer filed by Defendant Rhames, which challenges the sufficiency of the First Amended Complaint. The Judge has also granted the Motion to Strike portions of the First Amended Complaint. The Judge finds that the First Amended Complaint does not adequately plead the elements of the Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action, and that punitive damages are not supported by the pleadings. The Judge grants Plaintiff Jazaeri leave to amend the Second, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action and the related prayer for relief. The Judge orders Plaintiff to serve and file the Second Amended Complaint within 30 days of the ruling.
