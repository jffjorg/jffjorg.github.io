And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion by Plaintiffs to leave to file a Second Amended Complaint in a lawsuit against Defendants Church of Scientology International, Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International, Religious Technology Center, and Daniel Masterson. The Plaintiffs seek to add a new plaintiff, Tricia Vessey, and include new causes of action based on intervening changes in law, newly discovered facts, and facts not in existence at the time of the First Amended Complaint. The Court finds that leave to file the proposed Second Amended Complaint cannot be granted at this time due to the pending appeal of the denial of the Defendants' anti-SLAPP motions and joinder. The Court stays the proceedings pending the outcome of the appeal.
