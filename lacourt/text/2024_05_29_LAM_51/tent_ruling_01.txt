On May 12, 2022, the Court of Appeal issued a Remittitur.

LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms
as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding
or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name
of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms,
enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its
discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be
just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may
upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this
code.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).)
            
“A motion to amend a pleading before trial must: (1) Include
a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially
numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments; (2) State
what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any,
and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations are
located; and (3) State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1324, subd.
(a).)
 
“A separate declaration must accompany the motion and must
specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment is necessary
and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.” Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1324, subd. (b).)
 
In Hauser v. Pacific
Gas & Elec. Co. (1933) 133 Cal.App. 222, the court held “[a]lthough
permission to amend pleadings is a matter within the sound discretion of the
trial court, courts should be liberal in the allowance of amendments….” (Hauser v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co.
(1933) 133 Cal.App. 222, 228.)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiffs move for an order granting leave to file a Second
Amended Complaint on the grounds that (1) furtherance of justice requires
amendment and (2) the proposed SAC will not prejudice Defendants in this
action. Plaintiffs assert the proposed SAC seeks to add a plaintiff, Tricia
Vessey and to include new causes of action based on intervening changes in law,
newly discovered facts, and facts not in existence at the time of the FAC. 
 
Defendants oppose the instant motion on the grounds that (1)
the motion and supporting declaration fails to comply with California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324; (2) the Court cannot permit amendment of the FAC pending
the status of the Defendants anti-SLAPP motions and joinder; (3) Plaintiffs
fail to justify the extreme delay in seeking amendment; and (4) Plaintiff
Riales is barred from asserting claims of invasion of privacy. 
 
The Court finds that leave to file the proposed SAC in this
matter cannot be granted at this time.
 
Stay of the
Proceedings 
 
In Roberts v. Los
Angeles County Bar Assn. (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 604, the court held “[a]n
implied stay in the proceedings where the plaintiff files an amended complaint
prior to the defendant's appeal of the denial of a SLAPP motion to strike is
necessary so that a plaintiff cannot deprive a defendant of the right to the
appellate review granted by the Legislature so that the appellate court can
determine if the defendant had made a prima facie showing.” (Roberts v. Los Angeles County Bar Assn. (2003)
105 Cal.App.4th 604, 613; see also Hecimovich
v. Encinal School Parent Teacher Organization (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 450,
464.)
 
“Except as provided in Sections 917.1 to 917.9, inclusive,
and in Section 116.810, the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the
trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters
embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or
order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the
action and not affected by the judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 916,
subd. (a).)
 
Here, Defendants filed a timely appeal to the Court’s ruling
on the anti-SLAPP motions, so mandatory stay of the proceedings pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 916, subdivision (a) is required. Moreover, an
implied stay of the proceedings would be necessary pursuant to California case
law. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion for Leave to File Second Amended
Complaint cannot be rule upon at this time.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Plaintiffs’
Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint is STAYED pending appeal.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
