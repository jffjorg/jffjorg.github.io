And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the objections and refusals to answer by Mr. Work at his deposition. The court finds that the objections are without merit and that the requested information does not touch on any attorney work product or protected by attorney-client privilege. As such, the court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel Mr. Work to answer the questions he refused to answer and to produce the documents he refused to produce. The court orders Mr. Work to complete his deposition, including answering the previously refused questions and producing the requested documents, prior to the next session of his deposition on October 8, 2024. The court will also set a hearing on monetary sanctions.
