And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before the hearing. If it is true that the County Tax Assessor's office changed or corrected measurements on an assessor's Map without prior notice to the defense, the court is inclined to grant the defendant's request in its entirety. The Judge also rules that the deposition of the plaintiff's counsel will be limited to his percipient knowledge, meaning only what he said or did, and what he heard or saw. Additionally, the Judge requires the plaintiff's counsel to obtain notice and consent from his client per the State Bar rules concerning attorney testifying as a witness.
