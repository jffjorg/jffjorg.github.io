Ex parte application for order enforcing judgment: Deny on ex parte application.  Please resubmit as a motion.  Also, the court notes that objective evidence of these problems, such as photographs, recordings, and videos, would carry more weight than mere declarations. The court has more than once encouraged documentary evidence of violation of the court’s orders.  File as a noticed motion with evidence.
