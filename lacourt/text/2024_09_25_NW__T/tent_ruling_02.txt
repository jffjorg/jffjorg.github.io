 Case Number:  21VECV01101    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2024    Dept:  T 21VECV01101 Maclaughlin v Tassoji
If it is true that the County measurements on an assessor’s Map were changed or corrected based on a meeting held between the personnel of the County Tax Assessor’s office and an “attorney” and communications with Plaintiffs’ retained surveying expert without prior notice to defense, the court would be inclined to grant defendant’s request in it entirety.
Deposition of plaintiff’s counsel will be limited to things he said or did (but not why he did or said anything) and to things he heard or saw.  In other words, only as to his percipient knowledge.  Plaintiff’s counsel will be required to give notice and obtain consent from his client per the State Bar rules concerning attorney testifying as a witness.
