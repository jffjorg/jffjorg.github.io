And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for a writ of attachment against defendants My Philanthropies and Bruce Majeski. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants failed to record trust deeds, made fraudulent representations, and failed to make interest payments. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to establish the probable validity of their breach of contract claim. The judge also finds that the statute of frauds bars the claim because the alleged oral contracts for the purchase of fractional trust deeds are unenforceable. The judge denies the motion for a writ of attachment without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiffs can refile the motion with additional evidence.
