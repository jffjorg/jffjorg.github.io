And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case where the plaintiffs have failed to establish the probable validity of their claim. The judge notes that the entry of default terminates the defendant's rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation, including filing pleadings and motions, and cuts off their right to notices and service of pleadings or papers. The judge also discusses the concept of justiciability, which involves the criteria of ripeness and standing. The judge finds that the plaintiffs lack standing and that the controversy is not ripe, and therefore does not address the remaining elements. The ruling cites several California court cases, including Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Bailey v. Citibank, N.A., and City of Santa Monica v. Stewart.
