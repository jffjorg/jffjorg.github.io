And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (Defendant) against Gary Marenzi, Rebecca Prange, Gregory Prange, and Wesley Prang (Plaintiffs). The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendant caused them damages by issuing a life insurance policy to Prange and terminating it at Prange's request, resulting in Plaintiffs incurring taxes on terminating the policy.

The Defendant argued that it did not cause any damages to the Plaintiffs and that the Plaintiffs have failed to raise a triable issue of material fact to support their claims. The judge agreed with the Defendant and granted the motion for summary judgment, concluding that the Plaintiffs have failed to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether they can prevail on their causes of action against the Defendant.

The judge relied on the declaration of Paul J. Farrell, an assistant vice president for the Defendant, which stated that the Defendant issued the policy to Prange and terminated it at Prange's request, and that the Defendant returned all premiums paid by Prange. The judge also relied on the declaration of Steven Roth, an expert in selling and servicing life insurance policies, which stated that the Plaintiffs incurred taxes on terminating the policy due to tax law, not because of any act or omission by the Defendant.

The judge concluded that the Plaintiffs have not established that they have raised any triable issue of material fact as to whether the Defendant is responsible for any loss they may have sustained, and therefore granted the Defendant's motion for summary judgment.
