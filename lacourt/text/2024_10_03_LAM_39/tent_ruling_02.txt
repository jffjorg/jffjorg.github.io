MOTION
Plaintiff Shefa
LMV, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) sued Defendant Amazon.com, Inc. (“Defendant”) as a
private enforcer under Health & Safety Code section 25249.7.  Plaintiff claims a messenger bag that
Defendant sold contained unsafe levels of hazardous substances.  The parties have settled this action.  Plaintiff seeks approval of the parties’
settlement. 
ANALYSIS
The Court can approve a settlement agreement under
Health & Safety Code section 25249.7, subdivision (f)(4) only if: (1) any warning
required to be given in the settlement agreement complies with the requirements
of Proposition 65; (2) any award of attorney fees is reasonable under
California law; and (3) any penalty amount is reasonable, pursuant to Health
& Safety Code section 25249.7, subdivision (b)(2).  Plaintiff has the burden of producing
sufficient evidence in support of each required finding.  (Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.7, subd. (f)(5).)  
In the instant case, the settlement requires
Defendant to place a “clear and reasonable warning” on its products.  (See Health & Saf. Code, § 25249.6.)  It also requires Defendant to pay a civil
penalty of $2,000.  The Court finds this
penalty is reasonable under the factors set forth in Health & Safety Code
section 25249.7, subdivision (b)(2).  The
settlement also requires Defendant to pay Plaintiff’s attorney fees in the
amount of $14,500.  The Court finds these
fees to be fair and reasonable.  Through
the submission of the Declaration of Daniel N. Greenbaum, the Court concludes
Plaintiff has satisfied its burden by producing sufficient evidence in support of
the Court’s findings.  
ORDER
Accordingly, the Court approves the settlement and
will enter the consent judgment.  
Plaintiff is
ordered to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
