  Case Number:  23STCV08151    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  49 Derek Paul Deakin v. Robert Allan KahnDEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOVING PARTY: Defendant Robert Allan KahnRESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiff Derek Paul DeakinSTATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: Plaintiff Derek Deakin alleges he retained attorney Defendant Robert Kahn to represent him in a personal injury action. Plaintiff alleges Defendant breached the parties’ fee agreement be retaining a portion of the settlement owed to Plaintiff. Defendant filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff for declaratory relief. Defendant/Cross-Complainant sought a judicial declaration over the parties’ rights to $269,984.74 currently held in Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s client trust account. On December 21, 2024, this court’ granted Defendant/Cross-Complainant’s motion for summary judgment of the Cross-Complaint. Defendant/Cross-Complainant now moves for summary judgment of the Complaint. Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant opposed. TENTATIVE RULING:Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.Defendant is ordered to file a [Proposed] Judgment consistent with this ruling.Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSION:Motion for Summary JudgmentI. Judicial NoticePursuant to the moving party’s request, the court takes judicial notice of its prior Final Ruling granting Defendant/Cross-Complaint’s motion for summary judgment of the Cross-Complaint. (Exh. 1; 12/21/2023 Final Ruling.) II. Legal StandardThe function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843. In analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.  Thus, summary judgment is granted when, after the Court’s consideration of the evidence set forth in the papers and all reasonable inferences accordingly, no triable issues of fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(c); Villa v. McFarren (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 733, 741. As to each claim as framed by the Complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense. Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520. Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389. A defendant has met its burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if it demonstrates the absence of any single essential element of plaintiff’s case or a complete defense to plaintiff’s action.  Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(o)(2); Bacon v. Southern Cal. Edison Co. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 854, 858.  Once the defendant moving party has met the burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show via specific facts that a triable issue of material facts exists as to a cause of action or a defense thereto.  § 437c(o)(2). III. AnalysisA. Res JudicataIn analyzing motions for summary judgment, courts must apply a three-step analysis: “(1) identify the issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent's claims; and (3) determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)Plaintiff alleges that Defendant, his attorney in a personal injury action, breached the parties’ oral agreement whereby Defendant allegedly promised to obtain Plaintiff a certain result by settlement or judgment. (Compl. p. 4.) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant “induce[d]” him to accept the opposing counsel’s settlement offer. (Id. p. 8.) Finally, Plaintiff alleges that the written retainer agreement between him and Defendant that sits forth the fee distribution is invalid because Defendant’s former partner forged Plaintiff’s signature on it. (Id. p. 4.) Considering that this court granted Defendant’s motion for summary judgment on his Cross-Complaint, Defendant now argues that the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel require the same result here.The doctrine of res judicata precludes the re-litigation of certain matters which have been resolved in a prior proceeding under certain circumstances. (Brinton v. Bankers Pension Services, Inc. (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 550, 556.) “Res judicata, or claim preclusion, prevents re-litigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with them.” (Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 896.) “Res judicata applies if (1) the decision in the prior proceeding is final and on the merits; (2) the present proceeding is on the same cause of action as the prior proceeding; and (3) the parties in the present proceeding or parties in privity with them were parties to the prior proceeding.” (Fed'n of Hillside & Canyon Associations v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 126 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1202.)Although the authorities generally address res judicata in the context of separate proceedings, it appears it has also been applied within a single action where issues in a complaint and cross-complaint are overlapping. (See, e.g., Columbus Line, Inc. v. Gray Line Sight-Seeing Companies Associated, Inc. (1981) 120 Cal. App. 3d 622, 629 [“issues having been determined by the prior adjudication of the summary judgment on the complaint” was res judicata on the cross-complaint].) “Summary judgment is an appropriate remedy when the doctrine of res judicata in its subsidiary form of collateral estoppel refutes all triable issues of fact suggested by the pleadings and supporting documents.” (Cnty. of Alameda v. Sampson (1980) 104 Cal. App. 3d 584, 589–90.) Here, the court finds the issues addressed and decided against Plaintiff on the former ruling for summary judgment on the Cross-Complaint are res judicata and dispositive of the Complaint. First, the Ruling on the Cross-Complaint was final and on the merits. Second, the present proceeding is on the same cause of action as the prior proceeding, And third, the parties are the same. (Fed'n of Hillside & Canyon Associations v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 126 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1202.) Thus, the Complaint is barred by res judicata. This is an independent ground to grant the motion.B. Traditional Burden Shifting Analysis1. Defendant’s BurdenBut even assuming that res judicata does not apply here, summary judgment is still appropriate because Plaintiff cannot establish a triable issue of material fact.  The court again addresses the evidence in support of the motion, essentially identical to that presented in the previous motion for summary judgment. To recount, Kahn presents evidence that he and Deakin entered into a written Retainer Agreement on June 15, 2018, pursuant to which Deakin retained Kahn to represent him in a personal injury case involving injuries Deakin sustained in a motorcycle accident on June 6, 2018. (SSUMF 1.) The retainer provided that Kahn’s fee for his legal services would be thirty-three and one-third percent if the matter settled more than 120 days before the first date set for trial, or forty percent if the matter settled less than 120 days before the first date set for trial. (SSUMF 2.) The retainer also provided that Kahn could recover his costs. (SSUMF 3).On August 16, 2018 Kahn filed an action on Deakin's behalf entitled Deakin v. Tassiopulos, LASC Case No. BC717886. (SSUMF 5.) Deakin advised Kahn of his desire to net between $875,000 and $1,000,000. (SSUMF 12.) As the case progressed, Deakin continued to lower his demand. (SSUMF 13.) Kahn advised Deakin that the gross amount he was offering would net Deakin less than his desired $875,000 to $1,000,000. (Id.) On or about August 23, 2011, Deakin’s case settled for $1,675,000, after Deakin authorized Kahn to accept the Code of Civil Procedure 998 offer made by the defendant in that amount. (SSUMF 6.) Deakin accepted the settlement with knowledge of the approximate amount he would net. (SSUMF 14.) Kahn deposited the funds into his client trust account. (SSUMF 7.) Because the case settled less than 120 days before the first date set for trial (February 18, 2020), Kahn was entitled to a 40 percent fee and reimbursement of costs in the amount of $94,592.02. (SSUMF 9, 10.) Despite requests from Deakin, Kahn never agreed to reduce his fee. (SSUMF 17.) On September 20, 2022, Kahn disbursed $644,021.60 to Deakin with Deakin's approval. (SSUMF 21.) On January 3, 2023, Kahn disbursed another $162,565.44 to Deakin to cover one of Deakin’s medical liens. (SSUMF 25.) On or about January 16, 2023, Kahn paid himself out of this trust account a total of $494,592.02 ($400,000 for fees and $94,592.92 for costs). (SSUMF 24.) Following Kahn’s successful motion for summary judgment of the Cross-Complaint and the judgment entered thereafter, Kahn paid himself an additional $269,984.74 from his client trust account. (SSUMF 27.) Considering this evidence, Kahn has met his initial burden to establish there was no breach of contract and no fraud in inducing Plaintiff to accept the settlement. 2. Plaintiff’s BurdenThis switches the burden to Deakin to establish a triable issue. Again, Plaintiff has provided no competent evidence that his signature on the written agreement is a forgery. A party seeking to avoid summary judgment “must produce substantial responsive evidence sufficient to establish a triable issue of material fact on the merits…” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App. 4th 151, 163 [bare assertion that moving party “fabricated” evidence is insufficient to avoid summary judgment])(emphasis added). And the opposing party cannot controvert the moving party's declarations by evidence “based on speculation, imagination, guess work, or mere possibilities.” (Doe v. Salesian Soc. (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 474, 481.)Plaintiff also fails to demonstrate that the Agreement is ambiguous. It provides that “Client agrees to pay for the services herein described, the fee shall be thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of any and all gross amounts recovered if the matter is settled more than 120 days before the first date set for trial. If the matter settled less than 120 days before the first date set for trial, or goes to trial, the fee will be forty (40%) percent.” (SSUMF 2, Exh. 3.) Third, there is no evidence that the written agreement was superseded by an oral agreement by which Kahn promises an amount between $875,000 and $1,000,000 in the settlement. Finally, Deakin has failed to submit evidence by which a reasonable trier of fact can find wrongdoing by Kahn when he accepted a settlement on Deakin’s behalf. The undisputed evidence shows that on August 23, 2022, Deakin authorized Kahn to accept the opposing party’s section 998 offer.  Deakin wrote to Kahn by email: “I will accept the offer of $1,675,000 and arbitrate your fee.” (Kahn Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. 9, 402.) This came after Kahn had explained to Deakin that acceptance of an offer around that amount would net him less than $800,000. (Id., 316.) Kahn also explained to Deakin the “consequences of not accepting” the section 998 offer if he did not obtain a more favorable verdict at trial. (Id., 357.) This court is mindful of its duty to “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) But a responding party’s evidence still must be “substantial.” (See Sangster, supra, 68 Cal.App. 4th at 163.) Considering the evidence, Plaintiff has failed to carry his burden to establish a triable issue. In other words, there is no evidence by which a reasonable trier of fact could find in Plaintiff’s favor on the Complaint.Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   August 13, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
