Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a special motion to strike the complaint filed by the defendants, Shahriar Rad, Olivia Awadalla, Steve Awadalla, and Mazal Trinity Holdings, LLC. The defendants argue that the complaint arises from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute, and that the alleged harassment and constructive eviction of the plaintiffs are not protected by the statute.

The judge has granted the motion in part, striking the claims related to the alleged harassment and constructive eviction, but denied the motion as to the claims related to the unlawful detainer actions filed by the defendants. The judge has also ordered that the defendant's attorney's fees and costs be awarded.

The decision is based on the court's analysis of the pleadings and evidence presented by the parties, including the allegations of harassment and constructive eviction, and the defendants' claims of protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute. The court has also considered the litigation privilege, which provides that communications made in connection with a judicial proceeding are privileged, and has applied this privilege to the defendants' conduct.
