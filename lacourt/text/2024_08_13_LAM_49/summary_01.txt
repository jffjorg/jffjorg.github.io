Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Robert Allan Kahn, on his motion for summary judgment on the complaint. The plaintiff, Derek Paul Deakin, alleges that Kahn breached the parties' fee agreement by retaining a portion of the settlement owed to Deakin. However, the court finds that the issues addressed and decided against Deakin on the former ruling for summary judgment on the Cross-Complaint are res judicata and dispositive of the Complaint.

Even if res judicata does not apply, the court finds that Deakin has failed to establish a triable issue of material fact. Deakin has provided no competent evidence that his signature on the written agreement is a forgery, and the court finds that the agreement is unambiguous. The court also finds that there is no evidence that the written agreement was superseded by an oral agreement by which Kahn promises an amount between $875,000 and $1,000,000 in the settlement.

The court notes that it has liberally construed the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolved doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party. However, a responding party's evidence still must be substantial. Deakin has failed to carry his burden to establish a triable issue, and the court finds that there is no evidence by which a reasonable trier of fact could find in Deakin's favor on the Complaint.
