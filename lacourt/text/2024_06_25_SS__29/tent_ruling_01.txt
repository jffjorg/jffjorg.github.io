be addressed before the Court could approve the petition.  The first three issues have been
addressed.  The fourth – the absence of a
proposed order – has not been addressed.
 
The Court has reviewed the petition
and finds that the proposed settlement and the requested fees are fair and
reasonable.  All substantive requirements
are satisfied.  All procedural
requirements other than the submission of a proposed order are satisfied as
well.
 
The hearing is CONTINUED for a short
period of time so that Petitioner may submit a proposed order.
