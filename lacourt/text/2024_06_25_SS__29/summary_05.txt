Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the motions filed by Associated Ready Mixed Concrete, Inc. and Larry Tramaine Jr. Mosley to compel Eduardo Cruz Aquino to respond to discovery requests, including interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission. The judge found that Plaintiff has already responded to the discovery requests, albeit with objections, and that Associated has not filed a motion to compel further responses. The judge also noted that a "deemed admitted" order is not available when a party has responded to requests for admission, as is the case here. The judge further stated that if Associated contests the validity of Plaintiff's objections, it may file a motion to compel further responses under the Civil Discovery Act.
