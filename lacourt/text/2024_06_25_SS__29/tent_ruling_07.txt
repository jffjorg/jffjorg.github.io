Moonlight Rollerway Inc.
 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted in part.
Background
On July 20, 2022, Philip Kolodziey (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Moonlight Rollerway, Inc. (“Defendant”) for premises
liability and negligence arising out of trip and fall occurring on June 7,
2022. On September 29, 2022, Defendant filed an answer.
 
 
On May 17, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for summary
judgment set to be heard December 16, 2024.
 
On May 22, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to continue
trial. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the
court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make
them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance
should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
Each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance. Circumstances of good cause include:  
“(1) The unavailability of an essential lay
or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(2) The unavailability of a party because of
death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(3) The unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;  
(4) The substitution of trial counsel, but
only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in
the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The
new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare
for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's
involvement in the case;  
(6) A party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or  
(7) A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for
trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)  
 
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets
forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be analyzed when determining whether
good cause for a trial continuance is present. A court considers factors such
as:  
“(1) The proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;  
(3) The length of the continuance
requested;  
(4) The availability of alternative means to
address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;  
(5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses
will suffer as a result of the continuance; 
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential
trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a
continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;  
(9) Whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance;  
(10) Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant
to the fair determination of the motion or application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
Defendant brings this
motion to either specially set the hearing for the motion for summary judgment
to August 7, or to continue trial so its motion for summary judgment can be
heard on December 16, 2024. (Taylor Decl., ¶ 4.) Trial date is currently
September 6, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5.) 
Due to the Court’s impacted schedule, as noted in the Eighth Amended
Standing Order, the Court does not have dates available for a special setting
of the hearing for summary judgment to be heard before the trial date.
The Court finds good cause to continue trial so that Defendant’s timely
motion for summary judgment can be heard on December 16, 2024.
As such, the Court
GRANTS Defendant’s motion for a trial continuance.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant Moonlight
Rollerway Inc.’s motion to continue trial.
The Court ORDERS Trial Date to be set to a
date on or after January 24, 2025. FSC and all deadlines are reset based on the
new trial date.
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
