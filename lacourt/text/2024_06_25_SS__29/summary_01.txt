And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a minor's compromise case involving Heidy Medina, a 15-year-old claimant. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call instead. The court had previously identified four issues that needed to be addressed before approving the petition, and three of those issues have now been resolved. The fourth issue, the absence of a proposed order, remains outstanding. The court has reviewed the petition and finds the proposed settlement and requested fees to be fair and reasonable. However, the hearing is continued for a short time to allow the petitioner to submit a proposed order. The moving party is instructed to give notice of the continued hearing.
