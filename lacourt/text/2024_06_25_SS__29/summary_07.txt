And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial and hear the motion for summary judgment. The trial date is currently set for September 6, 2024, but the court does not have dates available for a special setting of the hearing for summary judgment before the trial date. The court finds good cause to continue the trial so that the defendant's timely motion for summary judgment can be heard on December 16, 2024. As a result, the court grants the defendant's motion for a trial continuance and sets the new trial date to a date on or after January 24, 2025.
