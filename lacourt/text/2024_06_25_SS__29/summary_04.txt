And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motions to compel filed by the defendant, County of Los Angeles, to require the plaintiff, Bradley Dodds, to respond to the supplemental interrogatory and request for production served on December 1, 2023. The plaintiff did not respond to the discovery, and the defendant filed the motions to compel on May 28, 2024. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and the court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery was unjustified. The court denies the requests for sanctions filed by the defendant, as the plaintiff's failure to respond was not necessarily intentional or malicious. The court orders the plaintiff to provide code-compliant, verified responses to the supplemental interrogatory and request for production within 10 days of notice of this order.
