Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Supplemental Request for Production 
 
Tentative
The motions are granted.
The requests for sanctions
are denied.
BACKGROUND
On July 2, 2021, Plaintiff Bradley Dodds
(“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint in this action against County of Los Angeles
(“County”), Santiago Javier Vazquez, and Does 1 through 10, asserting a cause
of action for motor vehicle negligence arising out of an accident on Angeles
Crest Highway (SR-2) on January 5, 2021.  County filed an answer to the complaint on July
29, 2021.
 
There have been some issues with discovery in this
matter, as set forth in the prior minute orders.
 
As it relates to the motions set for hearing on June 25,
County served Plaintiff with discovery on December 1, 2023, including
Supplemental Interrogatory (Number One) and Supplemental Request for Production
(Number One).  (Mallory Decls., ¶¶ 5-6
& Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff did not
respond.  (Id., ¶¶ 6-7.)
 
On May 28, 2024, Defendant filed these motions to
compel Plaintiff to respond to the discovery. 
Defendant also seeks sanctions.
Plaintiff filed a respond to each motion on June
11 in which Plaintiff does not oppose the motion, other than the request for
sanctions.  
LEGAL STANDARD
“In
addition to the number of interrogatories permitted by Sections 2030.030 and
2030.040, a party may propound a supplemental interrogatory to elicit any later
acquired information bearing on all answers previously made by any party in
response to interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.070, subd.(a).) 
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
“In
addition to the demands for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling permitted
by this chapter, a party may propound a supplemental demand to inspect, copy,
test, or sample any later acquired or discovered documents, tangible things,
land or other property, or electronically stored information in the possession,
custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.050, subd.(a).) 
If a
party to whom requests for production of documents are directed does not
provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling
response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial
responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On December 1, 2023, County served Plaintiff with Supplemental
Interrogatory (Number One) and Supplemental Request for Production (Number One).  (Mallory Decls., ¶¶ 5-6 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff did not provide any response.  (Id., ¶¶ 6-7.)
 
County
need not show anything more.  The motions
are GRANTED.
 
The
requests for sanctions are denied.  
 
Section
2030.290, subdivision (c), and section 2031.300, subdivision (c), authorize
sanctions against a party or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a
motion to compel.  Here, Plaintiff did
not oppose the motion.  Independently, for
the reasons discussed at prior hearings, including the paternity leave of
Plaintiff’s counsel, which began earlier than expected, the Court finds that
under the circumstances the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.
 
Conclusion
 
The
Court GRANTS the motions to compel.
 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Bradley Dodds to provide code compliant, verified
responses, without objection, to Supplemental Interrogatory (Number One) within
10 days of notice of this order.
 
The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff Bradley Dodds to provide code compliant, verified
responses, without objection, to Supplemental Request for Production (Number One)
within 10 days of notice of this order.

sanctions.
