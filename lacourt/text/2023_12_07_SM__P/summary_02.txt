Significant Statements:
  - The public policy in favor of arbitration is founded in the notion that arbitration is a "speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution."
  - A party waives its right to arbitrate when it "substantially invokes" the litigation machinery before moving to arbitrate, resulting in prejudice to the opposing party.
  - Unreasonable delay in moving to compel arbitration can lead to a waiver of arbitration rights.
  - The mere expense of responding to motions is not the type of prejudice that will result in waiver; the party opposing arbitration must show the other side obtained information that could not have been gained in arbitration.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration is denied. The defendants had argued that the arbitration clause in the release agreement signed by the decedent was enforceable, but the judge found that the delay in moving to compel arbitration was unreasonable and prejudiced the plaintiffs. The judge noted that the defendants had substantially invoked the litigation machinery by conducting extensive discovery, including propounding written discovery requests and deposing witnesses, before moving to compel arbitration. This delay and conduct inconsistent with the right to arbitrate waived the defendants' right to compel arbitration. The judge also found that the arbitration clause was not excessively inconspicuous and that the decedent had signed the release agreement freely and voluntarily. Therefore, the judge denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration.
