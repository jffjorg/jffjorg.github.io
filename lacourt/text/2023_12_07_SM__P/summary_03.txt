And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to Williams' cross-complaint. The court has sustained the demurrer to the quantum meruit claim, but given Williams ten days to amend. The court has overruled the demurrer to the breach of oral contract cause of action and the unjust enrichment claim. The court has sustained the demurrer to the breach of written contract cause of action, but given Williams ten days to amend.

The court has also denied Freeman's motion to strike paragraphs 42 and 45 of the cross-complaint, which relate to Freeman's alleged failure to respond to an offer to buy buildings owned by Plaza Diamond Bar Partners, LLC. The court has denied Freeman's motion to strike the request for punitive damages, but granted it with ten days leave to amend.

The court has also ruled on the uncertainty of the claims brought by Williams. The court has found that the breach of contract causes of action are uncertain because they do not specify the term Freeman allegedly breached or how he breached it. The court has also found that the unjust enrichment claim is sufficient to survive demurrer.

Finally, the court has ruled on the business judgment rule. The court has found that the business judgment rule does not apply when there is bad faith or a conflict of interest, and that Williams has alleged that Freeman acted in bad faith and was motivated by self-interest.
