And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Estate of Ka Ping Mak has moved to quash the summons and complaint filed by Maryanne Eckrem, citing lack of service. The Estate claims that Eckrem attempted service by mailing a copy of the complaint and summons to RST & Associates, a property management company that has no affiliation with the Estate and is not authorized to accept service on its behalf. Since there is no opposition to the motion, the court finds that service of the complaint and summons on RST was ineffective and grants the Estate's motion to quash.
