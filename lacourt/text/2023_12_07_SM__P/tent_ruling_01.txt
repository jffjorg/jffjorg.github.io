Eckrem v. Klasila
et al., Case No. 21SMCV01547
Hearing Date
December 7, 2023 
Defendant Estate
of Ka Ping Mak’s Motion to Quash (UNOPPOSED)
 
Defendant Estate
of Ka Ping Mak moves to quash plaintiff Maryanne Ecrkem’s summons and complaint
for lack of service. 
 
A defendant is
under no duty to respond to a defectively served summons, even if the defendant
has actual knowledge of the action. E.g. Kappel v. Bartlett (1988) 200
Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466. Personal service requires “personal delivery of a copy
of the summons and complaint on the person to be served.” Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. §415.10.
 
The Estate claims
Eckrem attempted service by mailing a copy of the complaint and summons to
property management company RST & Associates. Lam Decl. ¶¶2-3. RST has no
affiliation with the Estate and is not authorized to accept service on its
behalf. Id. ¶¶4-5.
 
There is no
opposition, so no basis for the court to doubt the statements in the Lam
declaration. Service of the complaint and summons on RST was ineffective and will
be quashed. GRANTED.
