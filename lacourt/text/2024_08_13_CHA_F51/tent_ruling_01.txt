Plaintiff is awarded $18,471.25 in attorney fees and costs.   Plaintiff is reminded that all documents “must be text searchable  when technologically feasible without impairment of the document's image.” (CRC  2.256(b)(3).) Plaintiff is further reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended  General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing  documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set  forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First  Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly bookmarking  declarations and exhibits).

Failure to comply with these  requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected, matters being  placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be resubmitted in  compliance with these requirements, documents not being considered and/or the  imposition of sanctions.   BACKGROUND   This is an employment action in which Plaintiff alleges that  she was an employee of Defendants between February and June 2021, during which  time Defendants failed to compensate Plaintiff for meal and rest breaks.   On 1/19/22, Plaintiff filed her complaint, alleging against  Defendant the following causes of action: (1) Failure to Pay Minimum Wage; (2)  Failure to Pay Overtime Wages; (3) Failure to Provide Meal Periods; (4) Failure  to Provide Rest Periods; (5) Failure to Provide Accurate Itemized Wage  Statements; (6) Failure to Reimburse Business Expenses; (7) Failure to Pay All  Wages Owed Upon Termination; (8) Failure to Provide Paid Sick Leave; (9)  Improper Wage Deductions from Gratuities; and (10) Unfair Business Practices.  On 3/10/22 and 6/17/22, Defendants filed their answers.   On 11/23/23, the parties executed a settlement offer  pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998, settling entire lawsuit  by Defendants paying Plaintiff $7,500.00, plus attorney fees, costs, and  expenses either by written stipulation or by noticed motion. (Ex. 1 to Decl. of  Svetlana Lukyanov, pp. 1–2.)    On 3/6/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. On 3/12/24,  Plaintiff filed a Notice of Conditional Settlement of the entire case. On 5/13/24, Defendants filed their  opposition. On 2/13/24, Plaintiff filed her reply.   On 5/24/24, the Court continued the instant motion and  requested further clarification from the parties. On 6/7/24, each of the  parties filed their supplemental briefs.   ANALYSIS   A.     Right to Recovery   An award of  attorney fees is proper when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code  Civ. Proc. §§ 1032, subd. (b); 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) Here, the parties  stipulated that “Plaintiff’s counsel, Bleau Fox, a P.L.C., shall be entitled to  bring a motion for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of suit incurred in  prosecuting this action on behalf of Plaintiff, to be determined by the Court,  unless the Parties are able to otherwise stipulate to an agreed upon amount.”  (Ex. 1 to Lukyanov Decl., p. 2.) Additionally, Plaintiff asserts, and  Defendants do not contest, that Plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable  attorney fees pursuant to Labor Code sections 226, subdivision (e)(1); 218.5,  subdivision (a); and 1194, subdivision (a). Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff  is entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees, costs, and expenses as  authorized by both statute and contract.   B.      Attorney Fees Incurred   “The burden  is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks are  reasonable.” (Gonzalez v. Santa Clara County Dept. of Social Services  (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 162, 169.) In determining a reasonable fee award, the  Court begins with the lodestar method of calculation, i.e., the number of hours  reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.¿(Karton v. Ari  Design & Construction, Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744; PLCM  Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095–1096.)    Here, Plaintiff  seeks to recover $25,180.00 in attorney fees, encompassing 73.18 hours of her  attorneys’ time, billed at the following rates:        Name   Title   Hourly    Rate   Hours   Total     Megan Childress   Attorney   $350.00   7.05   $2,467.50     Svetlana Lukyanov   Attorney   $350.00   3.0   $1,050.00     $450.00   38.8   $17,460.00     Thomas P. Bleau   Attorney   $450.00   5.4   $2,430.00     Paralegals/Law Clerks   $75.00   11.5   $862.50     $125.00   7.5   $937.50     Total   65.75   $25,207.50    (Ex. 3 to Lukyanov Decl.)[1]  Plaintiff also seeks to recover an additional $2,250.00 for her counsel  to review Defendant’s opposition, draft her  reply, and appear for the instant hearing. (Pl.’s Suppl. Brief 5:19–21.)   1.      Counsel’s  Hourly Rate   When  determining a reasonable hourly rate, courts consider whether the stated rates  “are within the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded  [to] comparable attorneys for comparable work.” (Children's Hosp. & Med.  Ctr. v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.) Lawyers who work on a  contingency fee basis may seek heightened attorney fees because of the inherent  contingent risk associated with their cases. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24  Cal.4th 1122, 1132 [“a contingent fee contract, since it involves a gamble on  the result, may properly provide for a larger compensation than would otherwise  be reasonable.”].)   Here,  Plaintiff asserts that her counsel’s hourly “rates are not only within the  range of rates charged by other litigators with comparable experience in the  highly specialized field of wage-and-hour litigation, but they are rather  toward the low end. Private attorneys in the Los Angeles/Orange County  metropolitan area with comparable experience typically charge on average over  $500.00 per hour.” (Pl.’s Mot. 8:23–26.)   In  opposition, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rates are  unreasonably high, specifically that “Plaintiff is demanding that Defendants  pay for legal services by Ms. Lukyanov – a 2019 Bar admittee - at the same  hourly rate as Ms. Childress (a 2009 Bar admittee) and Mr. Bleau (a 1991 Bar  admittee). Plaintiff offers no explanation or justification for this  excessively high hourly rate.” (Defs.’ Opp. 6:16–19.)   The Court  notes that neither party submits any further evidence supporting their  arguments relating to the reasonableness of Ms. Lukyanov’s hourly billing rate.  As such, the Court finds it reasonable to reduce Ms. Lukyanov’s hourly billing  rate to $350.00 per hour, for a total reduction of $3,880.00.   2.      Hours  Expended   Plaintiff  seeks to recover attorney fees for the 65.75 hours expended by her attorneys on  this matter, and proffer an itemized list of time entries detailing her  attorneys’ work on the matter. (Ex. 3 to Lukyanov Decl.)   In addition  to the attorney hourly billing rate, Defendants challenge the following  specific entries in Plaintiff’s attorneys’ proffered time log: (1) excessively  billed time entries; and (2) time incurred in preparing Plaintiff’s settlement  conference brief. (Def.’s Opp. 3:9–4:20.)   a.                   Excessively Billed Entries   Defendants  argue that the fees for the following time entries should be reduced as  “inefficient and excessive”: ·          3.5 hours spent drafting Plaintiff’s complaint; ·          2 hours spent attempting to strike Defendants’  answer; ·          11 hours of paralegal work responding and  propounding discovery; ·          1.5 hours spent reviewing Defendants’ document  production; ·          2.0 hours reviewing and revising the parties’  settlement agreement; ·          0.2 hours billed for each e-mail sent in the  case; and ·          14.6 hours drafting the instant motion.   The Court  notes that Defendants do not provide further explanation or argument as to how  or why the time incurred by Plaintiff’s counsel for these items is excessive  and/or unreasonable. In opposition, Plaintiff maintains that the time billed  was reasonable based on the circumstances of the case. (Pl.’s Reply 2:22–4:14.)   Based on  the foregoing, the Court finds it reasonable to reduce the fee award for time  incurred in drafting Plaintiff’s complaint to 2.0 hours; time spent propounding  and responding to discovery to 3.0 hours; and time spent preparing the instant  motion to 5.0 hours, for a total reduction of $5,945.00.     b.                   Settlement Conference Brief   Defendants further argue that Plaintiff should not be allowed  to recover attorney fees incurred in preparing Plaintiff’s settlement  conference brief. Defendants assert that “Plaintiff’s counsel billed seven and  four-tenth (7.4) hours to draft a settlement conference Brief that was not used  at the settlement conference. While a review of the docket reflects that  Plaintiff filed a settlement conference brief one day before the June 2  settlement conference, it does not appear that brief was in any way used to  support settlement discussions or otherwise move this case towards  settlement/completion.” (Defs.’ Opp. 5:19–23.)   In reply, Plaintiff argues that “even if somehow the  brief was not received by the mediator (which might be untrue and it is unclear  how Defendant’s attorney is aware of this fact), this happened due to technical  issues in the court filing system and was not Plaintiff’s fault. Plaintiff’s  attorney, Thomas P. Bleau, used this brief in preparation for the conference  and settlement discussions.” (Pl.’s Reply 3:4–9.)   Based on the foregoing, the Court sees no basis to  strike Plaintiff’s attorney fees incurred in preparing her settlement  conference brief, which Defendants concede was filed with the Court.   C.    Costs   Plaintiff asserts that she incurred costs and expenses  totaling $1,338.75, which encompasses research fees, filing fees, process  server fees, and courtesy copy delivery fees. (Ex. 4 to Lukyanov Decl.) The  Court notes that Defendants do not object to any of the costs claimed.  Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to recover $1,338.75 in costs  and expenses.   CONCLUSION   The motion is granted in part. Plaintiff is awarded $18,471.25  in attorney fees and costs.
