And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the unopposed motions filed by the Defendant, City of Los Angeles, acting by and through the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The motions seek to compel the Plaintiff, Jullion Jason Hernandez, to provide further responses to the Defendant's discovery requests, including Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two, and Form Interrogatories, Set One.

The Court finds that the Defendant has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer requirement and that the Plaintiff has failed to oppose the motions. Therefore, the Court grants the motions and orders the Plaintiff to provide further responses to the discovery requests within 30 days.

In addition, the Court declines to impose monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff, as the Plaintiff is self-represented and the imposition of sanctions would be unjust. The Court also notes that the Defendant failed to attach separate statements to the instant motions, as required by the California Rules of Court, but finds that the Plaintiff's failure to oppose the motions has waived this objection.
