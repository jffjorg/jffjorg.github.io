  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel further
  deposition of domingo perez
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Defendant Kia America, Inc.,
f/k/a Kia Motors America, Inc.  
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Plaintiffs Adela Sanchez and Livia Larios  
Motion to Compel Further Deposition of Domingo Perez
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Kia America, Inc., f/k/a Kia Motors America, Inc.
(“Defendant”) moves the court for an order compelling the further deposition of
Domingo Perez (“Perez”) on the ground that counsel for plaintiffs Adela Sanchez
and Livia Larios (“Plaintiffs”) instructed Perez not to answer various
questions.
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Perez to answer the
questions set forth as Excerpts Nos. 1-2 and 7-9 in Defendant’s separate statement
because counsel for Plaintiffs, in the opposition papers, has not shown that
there existed an attorney-client relationship for the purposes of Perez’s
deposition, such that the information sought was not subject to the
attorney-client privilege. 
“Ordinarily, when a party seeks legal advice from a lawyer, and the
lawyer provides such advice, an attorney-client relationship is formed.”  (Wood v. Superior Court of San Diego
County (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 562, 581.) 
“The attorney-client relationship requires something more than simply
speaking to an attorney about a legal matter. 
[Citations.]  To be a client for
purposes of the privilege, a person must ‘consult[] a lawyer for the purpose of
retaining the lawyer or securing legal service or advice from him in his
professional capacity . . . .’”  (Ibid.
[internal citations omitted] [emphasis in original]; Evid. Code, § 951.)
First, at his deposition, Perez testified “No” to the question “Have
you retained an attorney to represent you for this deposition?” (Alarcon Decl.,
Ex. A, Perez, p. 9:19-21.)  Perez did not
correct his deposition testimony. 
Moreover, Perez did not submit a declaration stating that (1) he did not
understand the question or the term “retain,” or (2) he consulted with counsel
for Plaintiffs for the purposes of securing legal service or advice from
counsel.  (Woods, supra, 46
Cal.App.5th at p. 581; Opp., p. 7:1-8.) 
Second, the court finds that counsel for Plaintiffs has not
established the existence of an attorney-client relationship between counsel
and Perez in their declaration. 
Counsel for Plaintiffs have submitted a declaration stating, in
relevant part, the following: “I met with Mr. Perez in preparation for the
deposition and subsequently defended his deposition on October 16, 2024. 
I represented Mr. Perez as his attorney for the purpose of the
deposition.  Mr. Perez provided substantive testimony on facts pertaining
to his knowledge regarding the Subject Vehicle.  All of my communications
with Mr. Perez were made under the protection of the attorney-client
privilege.”  (Reed Decl., ¶ 6.)  The
court finds that this declaration is insufficient to establish an
attorney-client relationship between Perez and counsel for Plaintiffs.  Counsel did not state facts establishing the
existence of such a relationship, including that Perez consulted with counsel
for the purpose of securing legal services or advice, and instead merely
stated, in conclusory fashion, that counsel represented Perez as his attorney
for the purpose of deposition.  (Ibid.)

            The court grants Defendant’s
motion to compel Perez to answer the questions set forth in Excerpts Nos. 3-4
and 6 because Plaintiffs’ counsel has withdrawn the objections to those
questions.  (Pl. Sep. Statement, pp.
8:2-6, 8:15-21, 11:10-15.) 
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Perez to answer
the question set forth as Excerpt No. 5 in the Separate Statement because the
court finds, after considering Perez’s right to privacy in his financial
information, his objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in these
circumstances, the threatened intrusion, and the legitimate and countervailing
interests that disclosure serves, that Perez’s privacy concerns are outweighed
by Defendant’s need to obtain the requested information in order to calculate
damages that may be awarded to Plaintiffs in this action.  (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 2
Cal.5th 531, 552 [setting forth framework for evaluation potential invasions of
privacy].) 
ORDER
            The court grants defendant Kia
America, Inc., f/k/a Kia Motors America, Inc.’s motion to compel further
deposition testimony of Domingo Perez. 
            The court orders Domingo Perez to
appear for and testify at a deposition to be taken for counsel by defendant Kia
America, Inc., f/k/a Kia Motors America, Inc. on ____________, 2024.  The court further orders that, at that
deposition, Domingo Perez shall answer the questions set forth in Excerpt Nos. 1-9,
as set forth in the separate statement filed by defendant Kia America, Inc.,
f/k/a Kia Motors America, Inc. on November 12, 2024. 
            The court orders defendant Kia
America, Inc., f/k/a Kia Motors America, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 16, 2024
