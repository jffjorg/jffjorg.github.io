plaintiff’s request for court judgment by

MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff Thiago Tambuque       
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Request for Court Judgment by Default
Plaintiff Thiago Tambuque (“Plaintiff”) requests that the court enter
default judgment in his favor and against defendant Eden Atias (“Defendant”) in
the total amount of $52,183.70, consisting of $39,856.92 in damages, $948.20 in
interest, $3,478.50 in costs, and $7,900 in attorney’s fees. 
First, the court finds that Plaintiff has proven that he is
entitled to recover damages in the amount of $10,000 in connection with the
first cause of action for willful misclassification in violation of Labor Code
section 226.8.  (Tambuque Decl., ¶¶ 6-7;
Lab. Code, § 226.8, subds. (a)(1) [it is unlawful for any employer to engage in
the willful misclassification of an individual as an independent contractor],
(b) [if the Labor and Workforce Development Agency or a court issues a
determination that an employer has engaged in a violation, the employer shall
be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more than $15,000
for each violation].)  The court notes
that, although Plaintiff has requested $15,000 in penalties, Plaintiff only
prayed for $10,000, such that $10,000 is the maximum amount that the court may
award.  (Compl., ¶ 25 [alleging that
Plaintiff is entitled to penalties in the amount of $10,000]; Sass v. Cohen (2019)
32 Cal.App.5th 1032, 1040 [“The ‘relief granted’ in the default judgment
‘cannot exceed’ what the plaintiff ‘demanded in the [operative] complaint’”];
Brief, p. 7:15-17 [requesting $15,000 for the intentional misclassification as
an independent contractor].) 
The court also notes that, in Noe v. Superior Court (2015) 237
Cal.App.4th 316, 338 (Noe), the court held, in construing the language
of Labor Code section 226.8, that “[t]here is no language suggesting a private
plaintiff may bring a direct action under section 226.8 action or that a
misclassified employee may collect the penalties described within the
statute.”  But section 226.8 has been
amended since Noe was decided.  As
amended, it appears that an employee may recover the penalties provided by
section 226.8.  (Lab. Code, § 226.8,
subd. (g)(2) [in an enforcement pursuant to this statute, the Labor
Commissioner or public prosecutor “may alternatively recover the penalties . .
. as damages payable to the employee.  An
employee is entitled to recover either the damages as provided for in
this section or to enforce a civil penalty, as set forth in subdivision
(a) of Section 2699, but not both, for the same violation”] [emphasis added]; Noe,
supra, 237 Cal.App.4th at p. 339 [finding that there was no private
right of action other than through a PAGA claim under section 226.8 because, inter
alia, it “contain[ed] no language suggesting the penalty is recoverable
directly by employees”].) 
Second, the court finds that Plaintiff has proven that he is entitled
to recover from Defendant (1) $2,764.32 in unpaid minimum wages, and (2)
$2,764.32 in liquidated damages for failure to pay minimum wages.  (Lab. Code, §§ 1197, 1194, 1194.2, subd. (a);
Tambuque Decl., ¶ 8; Compl., ¶ 35.)
Third, the court finds that Plaintiff has proven that he is entitled
to recover $47.88 for missed meal and rest periods.  (Lab. Code, § 226.7; Tambuque Decl., ¶ 9;
Compl., ¶ 46.)
Fourth, the court finds that Plaintiff has proven that he is entitled
to recover the requested $250 in damages for three failures on the part of
Defendant to provide to Plaintiff an accurate wage statement.  (Lab. Code, § 226, subd. (e)(1) [allowing for
an employee to recover penalties not to exceed $4,000 for violation of section
226 in the amounts of $50 for the first violation and an additional $100 for
each subsequent violation], Tambuque Decl., ¶¶ 4 [Plaintiff was promised weekly
payment], 8 [Plaintiff worked for Defendant for four weeks], 9 [Plaintiff did
not receive any wage statements].)
Fifth, the court finds that Plaintiff has proven that he is entitled
to recover damages in the amount of $3,830.40 in waiting time penalties since,
as set forth above, Defendant did not pay to Plaintiff all wages due.  (Lab. Code, § 203 [if an employer willfully
fails to pay wages of an employee who is discharged, the wages shall continue
as a penalty from the due date until paid or an action is commenced, but not
for more than 30 days]; Tambuque Decl., ¶¶ 8 [Plaintiff received only $300 in
compensation], 10 [Defendant did not pay Plaintiff for the work that he
performed].)
Sixth, the court finds that Plaintiff has proven that he is entitled
to recover indemnification for necessary expenditures incurred by Plaintiff in
the discharge of his duties for Defendant in the amount of $200.  (Lab. Code, § 2802, subd. (a); Tambuque
Decl., ¶ 9 [Plaintiff was not compensated for the use of his personal computer,
phone, and phone service which amounted to $200].) 
Seventh, the court finds that Plaintiff has not proven that he is
entitled to damages in the amount of $15,000 in connection with his wrongful
termination cause of action because (1) he did not present adequate argument,
authority, or evidence establishing that he has suffered damages in that
amount, and (2) to the extent that Plaintiff seeks to recover punitive damages
from Defendant, Plaintiff was required to, but did not, submit proof of
Defendant’s financial condition.  (Kim
v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 272 [“it is
incumbent on the plaintiff to prove up his damages, with actual
evidence”] [emphasis in original]; Compl., ¶ 66 [requesting, in connection with
the wrongful termination cause of action, “exemplary damages . . . in an amount
of $15,000”]; Soto v. BorgWarner Morse TEC Inc. (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th
165, 195 [“Evidence of a defendant’s financial condition is a legal
precondition to the award of punitive damages”].) 
Eighth, the court finds that the requested costs are recoverable as
costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivisions (a)(1)
and (a)(4).  (CIV-100, ¶ 7.)
Ninth, the court finds that the interest calculations filed on
December 2, 2024 are incorrect. 
Plaintiff requests prejudgment interest, at the rate of 10 percent per
annum, on the following damages: $5,528.64 for lost minimum wages and
liquidated damages, $47.88 for failure to provide meal and rest breaks, and
$200 for failure to reimburse business expenses.  (Dec. 2, 2024 MC-030 [asserting he is owed
$5,776.62 in wages based on those damages].) However, Plaintiff may only
recover 10 percent interest on $5,528.64 for the nonpayment of wages.  (Lab. Code, § 218.6 [“In any action brought
for the nonpayment of wages, the court shall award interest on all due and
unpaid wages at the rate of interest specified in subdivision (b) of Section
3289 of the Civil Code, which shall accrue from the date that the wages were
due and payable . . . .”].)  Plaintiff may
recover 7 percent interest on the total $247.88 in damages for failure to
provide meal and rest breaks and failure to reimburse business expenses.  (Ibid.; Naranjo v. Spectrum
Security Services, Inc. (2022) 13 Cal.5th 93, 122 [“for purposes of
prejudgment interest under Labor Code section 218.6, a section 226.7 suit is
also not an ‘action brought for the nonpayment of wages,’ as section 218.6
requires, and so does not qualify for that statute’s higher rate”].)  The court finds that Plaintiff may recover
prejudgment interest in the total amount of $992.02, consisting of 10 percent
interest as to the $5,528.64 for the 635-day period of March 17, 2023 (the date
of breach) through December 16, 2024 (amounting to $961.83) and 7 percent of
interest on the remaining $247.88 for the same period (amounting to $30.19).  (Tambuque Decl., ¶ 10 [Plaintiff’s last day of
work was March 17, 2023]; Dec. 2, 2024 MC-030 [requesting interesting from date
of March 17, 2023].) 
Tenth, the court awards Plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees in the
amount of $985.71 pursuant to Local Rule 3.214.
Finally, the court notes that Plaintiff has now dismissed all Doe
defendants.  (Dec. 2, 2024 Req. for
Dismissal, ¶¶ 1, 5.) 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has proven that he is entitled to
judgment in his favor and against Defendant in the total amount of $25,313.23,
consisting of (1) $19,856.92 in damages and penalties as set forth above, (2)
$3,478.58 in costs, (3) $992.02 in prejudgment interest, and (4) $985.71 in
attorney’s fees. 
The court will modify, sign, and file the proposed Judgment lodged by
Plaintiff on December 2, 2024.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
