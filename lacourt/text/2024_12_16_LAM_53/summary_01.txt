And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III regarding a motion to compel further deposition testimony of Domingo Perez. The motion was filed by Kia Motors America, Inc. (f/k/a Kia America, Inc.) and opposed by Plaintiffs Adela Sanchez and Livia Larios. The court grants the motion in part, finding that counsel for Plaintiffs did not establish an attorney-client relationship with Perez and therefore the attorney-client privilege does not apply. The court also finds that Perez's privacy concerns are outweighed by the defendant's need to obtain the requested information in order to calculate damages that may be awarded to the Plaintiffs.

The court orders Domingo Perez to appear for and testify at a deposition to be taken by the defendant on a date to be determined. At the deposition, Perez is ordered to answer the questions set forth in Excerpts Nos. 1-9, as set forth in the separate statement filed by the defendant. The court also orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
