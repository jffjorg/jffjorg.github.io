[tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel responses to
  form interrogatories – general and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Defendant California Department
of Social Services            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories – General and for
Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant California Department of Social Services (“Defendant”) moves
the court for an order (1) compelling plaintiff Antoinette Morris (“Plaintiff”)
to serve responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, General, and (2) awarding
monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff in the amount of
$440.
Defendant filed the pending motion on February 15, 2024 for a hearing
date of December 2, 2024.  On November
22, 2024, the court issued a Notice re Continuance of Hearing and Order, in
which the court (1) continued the hearing on Defendant’s motion from December
2, 2024 to December 16, 2024, and (2) ordered Defendant to give notice of the
new hearing date to all parties and to file a proof of service of such notice.  (Nov. 22, 2024 Notice, p. 1.)  The clerk served the notice on counsel for
Defendant on that date.  (Nov. 22, 2024
Notice, p. 2 [Cert. of Mailing].) 
Defendant did not file a proof of service of the court’s November 22,
2024 order on Plaintiff.  Thus, it
appears that Plaintiff has not been given notice of the new hearing date on
Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses and for monetary sanctions. 
The court finds that it is appropriate, and therefore exercises its
discretion, to continue the hearing on Defendant’s motion to ensure that
Plaintiff is given notice of the correct hearing date thereon and to file an
opposition, if desired. 
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
defendant California Department of Social Services’ motion to compel responses
to form interrogatories and for sanctions is continued to February 7, 2025, at
10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders defendant
California Department of Social Services (1) to give notice of this ruling to
plaintiff Antoinette Morris, and (2) to file a proof of service of the notice
of ruling with the court no later than January 8, 2025.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 16, 2024
