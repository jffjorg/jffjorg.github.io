 Case Number:  22SMCV01586    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  I The case is here for a final status conference.  The court gave its FSC order on March 14,
2023.  The matter is calendared for a 3
day bench trial, jury having been waived.
 
On April 3, 2024, the court received the following
documents: (1) Plaintiff’s trial brief; (2) Joint Witness List disclosing 7
witnesses, one of whom has no time estimates, but the remainder totaling about
16 hours for both phases if there are two phases; (3) Joint Exhibit List with
52 exhibits and boilerplate objections.
 
The court will order the parties to meet and confer further
on the exhibit list to discuss whether there are any documents to which
no objections are being made.  The
parties need not object on relevance grounds; by definition that is an
objection that cannot be waived in a bench trial.  The court does not really understand some of
the objections, such as objecting “hearsay” to a recorded deed.  The parties are urged not to make
authentication objections unless there is some basis to believe that the document
is truly not authentic.  The revised list
will be filed no later than close of business Wednesday (meaning 4:00 pm with a
courtesy copy to the court).  Defendant
will file a trial brief at the same time.
 
The court sees no deposition chart.  That is not a problem, but it does mean that
no deposition testimony will be allowed for any purpose other than impeachment.
 
Assuming the Wednesday materials are submitted, the court
deems the case READY FOR TRIAL.  On
Monday, the parties will bring in the following: (1) a trial notebook
containing the operative pleadings and the FSC materials; and (2) an exhibit
binder (3 copies); and (3) copies of all depositions that might be used for
impeachment.
 
The parties are urged to make a last effort at settlement,
but if they are unsuccessful, the trial will begin on Monday at 10:30.
