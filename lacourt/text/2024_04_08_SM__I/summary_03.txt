Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' submissions and materials for the FSC hearing, including the plaintiff's exhibit list, witness list, and statement of the case. The plaintiff believes that defense counsel is not forthcoming and may be working on a proposal for settlement. The court is concerned that the parties have not filed the necessary materials and warns that there will be little time to complete the FSC process. The court will give the parties until Wednesday noon to file joint materials, and if they do not comply, the court will discuss the matter further. The FSC is continued to Thursday at 8:30 am.
