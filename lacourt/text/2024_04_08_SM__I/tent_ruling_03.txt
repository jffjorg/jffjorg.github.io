 Case Number:  23SMCV04614    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for an FSC.  The FSC order was given on March 27, 2024,
when the court granted defendant relief from default.  The court warned the parties that the FSC
filings were significant and that there would be little time to get it
done.  All parties stated on the record
that they understood.   On Thursday, the
court received the following documents: (1) Plaintiff’s Exhibit List (7
exhibits); (2) Plaintiff’s Witness List (3 witness, estimated 8 hours total
testimony); and (3) Plaintiff’s Statement of the Case.  Plaintiff declares that he has tried to
contact defense counsel, but defense counsel has not been forthcoming.  Plaintiff believes that this might be because
the case has or is about to settle.  The
court will discuss this with counsel. 
The fact that the case is “about” to settle is of no moment to the
court.  It is not an excuse for failure
to file FSC materials.  An actual
settlement would be an excuse, but the fact that defendant is putting a
proposal together is not.
 
The court will be in trial Monday and Tuesday of next
week.  This trial will begin on
Wednesday.  Therefore, the court will
give the parties until Wednesday noon to file joint materials.  If they do not do so by then, the court will
discuss the matter further.  This FSC is
CONTINUED to Thursday at 8:30 am.
