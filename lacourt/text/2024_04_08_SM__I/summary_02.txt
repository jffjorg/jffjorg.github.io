And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the documents filed by the parties, including the trial brief, joint witness list, and joint exhibit list. The judge is concerned about the objections raised by the parties to the exhibit list and is ordering the parties to meet and confer to discuss whether there are any documents to which no objections are being made. The parties are also required to file a revised exhibit list and trial brief by the end of business on Wednesday. The judge notes that authentication objections should only be made if there is a basis to believe that the document is not authentic. The court deems the case ready for trial, assuming the parties submit the required materials. The parties are urged to make a last effort at settlement, but if unsuccessful, the trial will begin on Monday at 10:30.
