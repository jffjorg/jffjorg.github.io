Ruling 
Moqaddem
v. Pinto, Case No. 22STCV19241
Hearing
Date June 27, 2024
Plaintiff
Moqaddem’s Motion to Vacate Void Order Dated 5/23/23 
 
Plaintiff
sued Pinto but did not serve the underlying complaint. This case was related to
21STCV25467, Pinto v. Visconti, pending in Dept. P. That order was mailed by
the clerk to Moqaddem, who was then self represented on 2/17/23. 
 
It
came on for CMC on 3/21/23, and plaintiff did not appear. The clerk mailed
notice to Moqaddem on 3/21/23, setting a further CMC and OSC re failure to
appear and OSC re failure to file proof of service for 4/24/23. On that day,
there was no appearance for plaintiff, and the court continued the hearings,
set an additional failure to appear and an OSC re dismissal for 5/23/23. Notice
was mailed to Murphy, Moqqadem’s then-counsel. There was no appearance on
5/23/23, and the court dismissed the matter without prejudice. 
 
On
6/20/23 Murphy filed a Motion to Vacate Void Order dated 5/23/23. He got a
hearing date of 7/21/23, as stated on the pleadings. Then plaintiff moved the
date on multiple occasions, from 7/21/23 to 9/27/23, then to 2/2/24, then to
its current date of 6/28/24. The court did not continue the hearing; this was
done by plaintiff’s counsel via the court reservation system. This matter is
now on hearing for 6/28/24. 
 
The
court notes a prior tentative ruling by this court granting this motion was
posted on 7/20/23, in advance of the 7/21/23 hearing. However, plaintiff moved
the hearing date, as noted above.
 
Plaintiff
moves under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(d) to vacate the 5/23/23 order dismissing
as being void.
 
Plaintiff
argues the order is void because this court transferred this case from another
courthouse without any court order. This argument fails. There was a February
17, 2023 court order that related this case to 21STCV25467, in accordance to
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). 2/17/23 Minute Order. Good cause was shown
to reassign this case to Dept. P. Id. The clerk gave notice. Id.
 
Second,
plaintiff argues this order “totally confused Plaintiff and her counsel
believing that all hearing for both cases 21STCV25467 and Case 22STCV19241 will
be heard on the same day,” and that “the case should have been scheduled on the
same hearing date for [the] other case on May 19, 2023” which “totally confused
Plaintiff and her attorney in this case.” Motion, pp. 2, 6. In fact, the two
matters WERE heard on the same day, 3/21/23. Plaintiff did not appear on either
matter.
 
Plaintiff
seems to argue excusable neglect under Code of Civil Procedure sec. 473(b).
Excusable neglect exists when reasonably prudent person in similar
circumstances might have made same error. County of San Bernardino v.
Mancini (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1095, 1103. The court does not view the
circumstances of this case as the result of an error by a reasonably prudent
person. The facts indicate plaintiff and counsel were aware of this case. The court
finds plaintiff does not sufficiently indicate dismissal was entered as the
result of excusable neglect.
 
The
motion argues plaintiff and her attorney were never served notice about the May
23, 2023 hearing, which makes the May 23, 2023 dismissal order void. However,
the clerk gave notice on 4/24/23 to Murphy, plaintiff’s counsel of record.
 
None
of this explains the fact that plaintiff moved this motion at least three
times, over the span of almost a year from the date the matter was first set to
be heard. There is no basis to grant this motion. As such, the motion is
DENIED.
