```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Moqaddem, is seeking to vacate a void order that dismissed their case on May 23, 2023. The order was entered after the plaintiff failed to appear at a hearing and failed to file proof of service. The plaintiff argues that the order is void because the court transferred the case from another courthouse without an order, and that the order was confusing and caused them to miss the hearing. The court disagrees with these arguments and finds that the plaintiff's failure to appear and file proof of service was not due to excusable neglect. The court also notes that the plaintiff's counsel was served notice of the hearing and that the plaintiff moved the hearing date multiple times over the course of almost a year. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's motion to vacate the void order.
