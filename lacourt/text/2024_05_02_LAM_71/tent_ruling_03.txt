 Hearing Date:  May 2, 2024



 
Defendants
John Chae’s, Greenhouse Fairfax, LLC’s, and Greenhouse WeHo, LLC’s motion to
vacate and set aside the entries of default against Defendants on November 21,
2023, is granted.
 
Defendants
John Chae (“Chae”), Greenhouse Fairfax, LLC (“Fairfax”), and Greenhouse WeHo, LLC
(“WeHo”) (collectively, “Defendants”) move for this Court to vacate and set
aside the default and any judgment taken against Defendants on the basis Defendants
were never served process and therefore any default or judgment would be void
as a matter of law.  (Notice of Motion,
pg. 1; C.C.P. §§473(d), 473.5; Rogers v. Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d
1114.)
 
Background
          On August 22, 2023, Plaintiffs
Benjamin Kim (“Kim”) and William Shapiro (“Shapiro”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed their operative Complaint against Defendants alleging fourteen
causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of covenant of good faith
and fair dealing; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of covenant of good faith
and fair dealing; (5) common count: open book account; (6) common count:
account stated; (7) fraud- intentional misrepresentation; (8) fraud-
concealment; (9) fraud- promise without intent to perform; (10) conversion;
(11) accounting; (12) breach of fiduciary duty; (13) declaratory and injunctive
relief; and (14) violations of California Penal Code §496.  (See Complaint.)
On November
21, 2023, this Court entered default against all Defendants.  
Defendants
filed the instant motion on March 29, 2024. 
Plaintiffs filed their opposition on April 19, 2024.  Defendants filed their reply on April 25,
2024.
 
Motion to Vacate/Set Aside Dismissal
Pursuant
to C.C.P. §473(d), “[t]he court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its
own motion . . . set aside any void judgment or order.”  (C.C.P. §473(d).)
Pursuant
to C.C.P. § 473.5(a): 
When service of summons has not
resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default
or default judgment has been entered against him or her in the action, he or
she may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or default
judgment and for leave to defend the action. The notice of motion shall be
served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the
earlier of: (i) two years after entry of default judgment against him or her;
or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a written notice that the
default or default judgment has been entered. 
 
(C.C.P.
§473.5(a).)
A
motion under C.C.P. §473.5 must “be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the party’s lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was
not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party
shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other
pleading proposed to be filed in the action.”  (C.C.P. §473.5(b)). 
Relief
under C.C.P. §473(d) is available up to two years after a judgment is entered
where it is void for lack of proper service.  (Trackman v. Kenney (2010) 187
Cal.App.4th 175, 180).  Furthermore,
“when relief under section 473 is available, there is a strong public policy in
favor of granting relief and allowing the requesting party his or her day in
court.”  (In re Marriage of Stevenot (1984)
154 Cal.App.3d 1051, 1071 [referring to the period before a judgment has been
entered].)  “[B]ecause the law strongly
favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 473
must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.”  (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38
Cal.3d 227, 233.)
Similarly,
under C.C.P. §473.5, “it is the policy of the law to favor, whenever possible,
a hearing on the merits.”  (Luxury
Asset Lending, LLC v. Philadelphia Television Network, Inc. (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 894, 907-908.) 
Of
particular concern, where the issue is that the defendants have not even been
properly served, it is not even relevant whether the defendants have “actual
knowledge,” the default and any judgment entered thereafter is deemed void as a
matter of law.  (See, e.g.,
Rogers v. Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1124 [“Whether the
defendant caused his own lack of notice has no bearing on the propriety of
service. Even actual notice is not a substitute for proper service.”], citing 2
Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Jurisdiction §92 at pg. 459; Olvera v.
Olvera (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 32, 40 [“Until summons is served, there is no
need to respond; a defendant may believe that the action will not be pursued.”].)
 
Discussion
The
reliability of a service declaration from a Registered Process Server is set by
statute.  The return of a process server
registered pursuant to Chapter 16 (commencing with §22350) of Division 8 of the
Business and Professions Code upon process or notice establishes a presumption,
affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the return.  (Evid. Code §647.)  A declaration of a registered process server
averring that he personally served defendant at defendant’s address on a
certain date gave rise to a presumption of the facts stated therein, thus
requiring defendant to produce evidence that he was not served.  (American Express Centurion Bank v.
Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.)
The
determining factor for granting relief under C.C.P. §473.5 is whether service
of summons has resulted in “actual notice” to a party in time to defend the
action.  (C.C.P. § 473.5(a).)  “Actual notice” in C.C.P. §473.5 “means
genuine knowledge of the party litigant.”  (Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
540, 547.)
          Here, according to the Declaration
Robert Brooks (“Brooks”), a Registered Process Server (“RPS”), Brooks has been
an RPS for about 7 years, during which time he has performed thousands of
personal services in the litigation context. (Decl. of Brooks ¶2.)
 Brooks declares that it is his custom
and practice to show up at the residence and announce he is looking for the servee.  (Decl. of Brooks ¶6.)  Brooks declares once he receives clear confirmation that the individual in his presence
is the servee, he leaves the documents with them.  (Decl. of Brooks ¶6.)  Here,
the proofs of service on record describe the servee as 36-40 years of age,
181-200 pounds, black hair, male, 5’7-6’0, brown eyes, Asian race.  (Decl. of Brooks ¶10, Exh. 1.)
          In support of Defendants’ motion, Chae declares he is 6’2,
300 pounds, and 41 years old as of October 19, 2023.  (Decl. of Chae ¶¶3-5.)
          Chae submitted a declaration and a supplemental declaration
rebutting Plaintiffs’ argument that he did not provide evidence suggesting he
was not present at 1635 S. Gramercy Place, Los Angeles, California 90019
(“Gramercy Property”) on October 19, 2023. 
(Decl. of Chae ¶7; Supp.-Decl. of Chae ¶3.)  Chae further declares he does not own or
manage the Gramercy Property. 
(Supp.-Decl. of Chae ¶2.)  Chae
declares that by October 19, 2023, he was already living over one hundred miles
away with his wife and child, in San Marcos, California, and he was working for
the San Diego Sheriff’s Department. 
(Supp.-Decl. of Chae ¶4.)  Chae
declares he does not think that it is reasonable that any person who sees him,
even if they only see him for a brief period of time, could possibly think that
he weighed 180-200 pounds.  (Supp.-Decl.
of Chae ¶6.)
Defendant met his burden to
rebut the presumption that Plaintiff’s service of process declaration indicated
he was properly served by producing
evidence that he was not served.  (American
Express Centurion Bank, 199 Cal.App.4th at pg. 390.)
Accordingly,
Defendants’ motion to set aside the entry of default against Chae, Fairfax, and
WeHo on November 21, 2023, is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §473.5. 
 
Conclusion
Defendants’
motion to set aside the entries of default against Chae, Fairfax, and WeHo on November
21, 2023, is granted.
Moving Party to give notice.
