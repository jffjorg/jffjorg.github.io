English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants a motion to vacate and set aside default against John Chae, Greenhouse Fairfax, LLC, and Greenhouse WeHo, LLC. The defendants argue that they were not properly served with process and therefore any default or judgment would be void as a matter of law. The court agrees that the defendants were not served with process and grants the motion. The court notes that the burden of proof for demonstrating lack of actual notice is on the defendant, and the defendants have met this burden.
