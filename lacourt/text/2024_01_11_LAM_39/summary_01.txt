And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the pending demurrer and motion to strike in the case of Ternesha Peoples, et al. v. Villa Nueva RHCP, LP, et al. The case involves a habitability dispute, with the Plaintiffs alleging various causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of the implied warranty of habitability, nuisance, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and violation of Civil Code section 1942.4.

The Judge sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action (breach of contract) because the Plaintiffs have not attached a copy of the lease agreement and have not sufficiently alleged the term(s) that was allegedly breached. However, the Judge overrules the demurrer to the remaining causes of action, finding that the Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support their claims.

The Judge grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages because the Plaintiffs have not alleged the required elements to support a claim for punitive damages. The Judge also grants the motion to strike the prayer for attorneys' fees because the Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged a breach of contract or a provision in the lease that would permit attorneys' fees.

The Judge orders the Plaintiffs to file a second amended complaint within 30 days and sets a final status conference and trial date. The Judge also notes that the parties shall comply with all pretrial procedures for Department #39 and that jury fees shall be posted within 30 days or the parties shall waive jury.
