And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application to deem substituted service on defendant Mihir Sukthankar proper and complete. The plaintiff's counsel did not serve the application on the defendant, and the judge finds that this is a fatal defect. The judge also notes that the application is unnecessary at this stage, as service is presumed to have been proper, and the issue will be resolved if the defendant moves to set aside any default or default judgment based on allegedly ineffective service. The judge concludes that granting the application would be a due process violation and that the defendant's rights must be protected by giving notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue.
