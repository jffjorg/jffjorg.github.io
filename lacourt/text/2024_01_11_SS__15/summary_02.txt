significant_statements:

  - "A plaintiff's deposition testimony that the plaintiff has no knowledge of any exposure to the defendant's products may be sufficient to shift the burden to the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact."
  - "If plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses."

English-text summary: The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment in a case involving asbestos exposure. The defendant, Omya, Inc., argued that the plaintiffs, Ronald Babb and James Hefner, have not provided sufficient evidence to establish that Omya's talc caused the exposure. The court found that the plaintiffs' evidence is factually deficient and speculative, and that they have not demonstrated a disputed issue of fact that requires a trial. The court relied on several California court decisions to support its ruling, including Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., and Izell v. Union Carbide Corporation.
