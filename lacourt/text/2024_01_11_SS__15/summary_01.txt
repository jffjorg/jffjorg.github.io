And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by Amcord, Inc. The motion seeks to dismiss the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action in the complaint filed by Donna Smedley, Kristen Weir, and Suzanna Howard.

The judge has granted the motion as to the third and fourth causes of action, which allege fraudulent concealment and fraudulent misrepresentation, respectively. The judge has concluded that the plaintiffs have failed to show disputed issues of material fact regarding these claims.

The judge has denied the motion as to the request for punitive damages. The judge has found that the plaintiffs have presented evidence that Amcord knew the dangers of asbestos, took action to protect its own employees, knew that its products were likely to pose a danger to users, and did not warn them. This evidence may be sufficient to show malice, which is a requirement for punitive damages.

The judge has ordered that the moving party give notice of the ruling. The ruling is subject to change or withdrawal before the hearing date.
