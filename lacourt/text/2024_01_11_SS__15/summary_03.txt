And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by Defendant Amcord, Inc. regarding the fourth cause of action for premises owner/contractor liability and the request for punitive damages.

The judge has granted the motion for summary adjudication as to the fourth cause of action, finding that the evidence presented by the Plaintiffs is insufficient to support this claim. Specifically, the judge found that the Plaintiffs failed to provide evidence that Defendant owned or controlled the premises where Plaintiff Kathleen Hiland was exposed to asbestos.

As for the request for punitive damages, the judge has denied the motion, finding that there are disputed issues of material fact regarding Defendant's knowledge of the hazards of asbestos, its efforts to minimize exposure, and its compliance with regulations. The judge concludes that a reasonable jury could find clear and convincing proof of malice, fraud, or oppression.

The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of this tentative ruling.
