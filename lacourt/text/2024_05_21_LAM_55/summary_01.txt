Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling addresses a motion by the defendants (Darvin Ham and Deneitra Ham) to stay enforcement of a sister-state judgment and to vacate the judgment. The defendants argue that the judgment is legally deficient because it is not properly authenticated and is not a judgment, but rather a writ of fieri facias. The Judge finds that the defendants have not met their burden of establishing grounds for the sister-state judgment to be vacated. The Judge also grants the defendants' request to stay enforcement of the sister-state judgment pending the outcome of an appeal from the underlying judgment in Georgia. Further, the Judge grants the application of Attorney William Poplin Jr. to appear pro hac vice on behalf of the defendants. The Judge sets a status conference for May 21, 2025, to address any further proceedings.
