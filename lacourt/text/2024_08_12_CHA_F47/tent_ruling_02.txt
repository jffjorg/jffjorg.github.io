SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 12/8/23, Plaintiff Green Bay Properties, LP (Plaintiff)
filed this commercial unlawful detainer action against Defendants Hector
Gramajo dba Swiss Cleaners (Hector) and Edwin Gramajo dba Swiss Cleaners
(Edwin).  On 2/20/24, Plaintiff filed its
operative First Amended Complaint for commercial unlawful detainer against the
same parties.  
 
On 3/22/24, Edwin filed an answer.  On 5/23/24, Hector filed a motion to quash
service of summons which was denied on 6/28/24. 
(See 6/28/24 Minute Order). 
On 7/15/24, Hector filed and served the instant demurrer to the entire
First Amended Complaint pursuant to CCP 430.10 (with no subsection specified) on
the ground that it “[f]ails to state that the Plaintiff has met the applicable
requirements of the local ordinance (Complaint, p. 3, ¶16).”  (See Demurrer, p.1:26-p.2:3).  The demurrer was originally scheduled for
hearing on 8/23/24 but was advanced to 8/12/24 by the Court on 7/31/24.  (See 7/31/24 Minute Order; Notice of
Ruling filed 7/31/24).  Since an
opposition to the demurrer had already been filed and served, the Court ordered
a reply was due by 8/7/24.  Id.  As of 8/8/24, no reply has been filed.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
In addition to failing to specify the subsection of CCP
430.10 on which the demurrer is based, Hector has failed to identify the “local
ordinance” Plaintiff has purportedly failed to allege it complied with.  Hector merely concludes that the “property is
subject to protections of local rent control or eviction control ordinances.”  (See Demurrer, p.4:11-12).  However, Plaintiff has specifically alleged,
by not marking number 16 on page 3 of the First Amended Complaint, that Hector’s
tenancy is not subject to the local rent control or eviction control ordinance.  (See First Amended Complaint, p.3,
No.16).
 
Hector has failed to establish that the commercial
tenancy at issue in this action is subject to any local rent control of
eviction control ordinance.  Even if such
an ordinance does apply, the First Amended Complaint alleges sufficient facts
to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer and Hector may plead the
purported failure to comply with the unidentified applicable local ordinance as
an affirmative defense.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The demurer is overruled. 
Answer is due within 5 days.
