Here is a summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff, Valeria Segoviano Hernandez, to compel the deposition of the Person Most Qualified (PMQ) of the defendant, The Clorox Company. The court denies the motion, finding that the plaintiff improperly noticed a second deposition of Clorox's PMQ without leave of the court. The court also finds that the plaintiff failed to show good cause for a subsequent deposition and that the motion is procedurally defective in that it is not accompanied by a separate statement.

The court further finds that Clorox's request for sanctions is denied, and that the amount of sanctions sought by Clorox is excessive. The court notes that both parties have failed to properly electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the declarations filed in support of the motion and opposition, and warns counsel that failure to comply with this requirement may result in papers not being considered, matters being continued, and/or the imposition of sanctions.
