And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) is granted. The defendant, Salmeron, is ordered to serve verified responses, without objections, within 20 days of notice of the ruling. The request for sanctions is denied. The plaintiff, Marcia Lyn Jones, propounded the special interrogatories on December 16, 2022, but received no response. According to California Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.290, when a party fails to provide responses to discovery, a party can compel responses. Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. The Court declines to award sanctions as the motion is unopposed.
