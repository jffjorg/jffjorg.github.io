And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to a request for production of documents, Set One. The defendant served the request on January 6, 2023, but the plaintiff has failed to respond. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond waives any objections they may have had to the request. The court has ordered the plaintiff to serve verified responses, without objection, within 20 days from notice of the ruling. The request for sanctions is denied as the motion was unopposed.
