And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel responses to supplemental interrogatories, set one. The motion is granted, and the Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses, without objection, to the supplemental interrogatories within 20 days. The Plaintiff had failed to respond to the supplemental interrogatories, despite a demand for responses and a deadline. The Judge also grants the request for sanctions in the amount of $450, payable to the Defendants within 30 days. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to respond was unjustified and that the imposition of sanctions is warranted.
