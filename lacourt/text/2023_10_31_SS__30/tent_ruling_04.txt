(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) On May 10, 2023, defense counsel served Defendants’ supplemental interrogatory, set one to Plaintiff’s counsel with a due date of June 13, 2023. (Declaration of William G. Sorkin, ¶ 3; Ex. “A.”) On July 21, 2023, defense counsel sent a letter to Plaintiff’s counsel demanding responses by no later than July 31, 2023. (Sorkin Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. “B.”) To date, no responses have been received nor any response to the July 21, 2023 letter. (Sorkin Decl., ¶ 5.) In opposition, Plaintiff contends that Defendants’ motion is moot because Plaintiff intends to provide supplemental responses to Defendants’ request. However, until Plaintiff has presented evidence that is has provided supplemental responses, Defendants’ motion is not moot. Therefore, Defendant’s motion is granted unless Plaintiff provides supplemental responses by the hearing of this motion.Defendants also request monetary sanctions of $1,425 (7 hours incurred at hourly rate of $195, plus filing fee of $60) against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney Mdgesyan Law Firm, jointly and severally. (Sorkin Decl., ¶ 9.) In this instance, there are no circumstances that would make the imposition of sanctions unjust against Plaintiff. The Court grants Defendants’ request for sanctions but in the reduced amount of $450 (2 hours incurred at hourly rate of $195, plus filing fee of $60). (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.030, subd. (a); 2023.010, subd. (d); 2030.290, subd. (c).)¿
