And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Loya Casualty Insurance Company to intervene in the case, allowing the company to participate in the litigation. The company's motion was unopposed and the judge found that the company has a direct interest in the case because it may be obligated to pay any judgment rendered against the insured. The judge also found that the company's intervention would not enlarge the issues in the action, as its defenses would be similar to those of the defendants and based on the same facts. The company is instructed to file its proposed answer within five days of the order.
