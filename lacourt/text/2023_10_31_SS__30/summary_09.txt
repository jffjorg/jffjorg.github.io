And here is the summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling of the Court is that the Motion for Leave to File a Cross-Complaint is granted. The Defendant, Liquorama Market, may file and serve its Cross-Complaint, naming Terron Donnell Brock, Devon Juantee Allen, and Roes 1 to 20, Inclusive as Cross-Defendants. The Court found that the Defendant did not act in bad faith when it failed to file a cross-complaint at the time of its answer, as the names of the individuals involved in the shooting were unknown to the Defendant at the time. The Court also cited California Code of Civil Procedure Section 426.50 and the Supreme Court of California's statement in American Motorcycle Assn. v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 578, 606, that a defendant may file a cross-complaint against a person not named in the original complaint if claiming indemnity.
