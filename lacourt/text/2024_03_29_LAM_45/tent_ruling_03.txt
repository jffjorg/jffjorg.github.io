Background
            On
October 26, 2022, Plaintiffs Stanley Orwasher, individually and the Estate of
Phyllis Orwasher, by and through its Successor in Interest, Stanley Orwasher (“Plaintiffs”)
filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants Philip
Michels, a Professional Law Corporation dba Law Offices of Michels & Lew,
Philip Michels, an individual, Jinheung N. Lew, an individual, and DOES 1-10,
inclusive for: (1) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (2) Fraud; (3) Breach of the
Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; and (4) Professional
Negligence. 
 
            On
May 31, 2023, Defendant Philip Michels (“Michels”) filed this instant Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One). On March 18,
2024, Plaintiffs filed their opposition. On March 22, 2024, Michels filed his
reply. 
 
Legal
Standard
            Under
Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.300, subdivision (a), parties may move for
a further response to interrogatories where an answer to the requests are
evasive or incomplete or where an objection is without merit or too general.¿¿ 
 
Notice of the
motions must be given within 45 days of service of the verified response,
otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).) The motions must also be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).)¿¿
 
Finally, Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving
further discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request,
the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling
further responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3)).¿
 
 
 
 
Discussion
Notice
Defendant Philip
Michels (“Michels”) propounded Special Interrogatories (Set One) on February
10, 2023. (Lupton Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. D.) On March 21, 2023, Plaintiff Stanley
Orwasher (“Orwasher”) served initial responses. (Id. ¶ 5, Ex. E.) On
April 13, 2023, Orwasher served further responses that were substantively
identical to initial responses. (Id. ¶ 8, Ex. H.) Therefore, this
present motion was properly noticed because it was filed forty-five (45) days
after Michels received Orwasher’s supplemental responses. 
 
Meet and Confer
Michels advances
the declaration of his counsel of record, John T. Lupton attesting to meet and
confer efforts prior to the filing of this instant motion. Lupton avers he sent
a meet and confer letter to Orwasher’s counsel addressing deficient responses
to 27 interrogatories and requesting supplemental responses.(Lupton Decl. ¶¶ 5,
6; Exs. E-F.) Lupton further avers that Orwasher’s counsel responded with an
email arguing why he believed Michels was not entitled to more detailed
responses. (Id. ¶ 7, Ex. G.) The following day, Orwasher served
supplemental responses but only removed general objections. (Id. ¶ 8,
Ex. H.) Lupton declares he sent another letter on April 19, 2023 explaining why
further substantive responses were required and Orwasher’s counsel responded the
next day stating Orwasher had no obligation to further supplement the
responses. (Id. ¶¶ 9-10, Exs. I-J.) On April 24, 2023, Lupton avers he
wrote Orwasher’s counsel again and proposed withdrawing his requests to the remaining
interrogatories if Orwasher provided supplemental responses to Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6,
9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 21, 22, 25, 26, 29, and 30. (Id. ¶ 11, Ex. K.) On
May 8, 2023, after no receiving any response, Lupton sent a follow-up to Orwasher’s
counsel who ultimately responded that no further responses would be provided. (Id.
¶ 12, Exs. L-M.)
 
Therefore, Michels’
has sufficiently met and conferred on this matter before bringing the instant
motion. 
 
            Motion
to Compel Further Responses 
            Michels
moves for an order compelling Orwasher to serve further responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 21, 22, 26,
and 30. Michels argues the interrogatories require further responses because
Orwasher fails to provide the responsive information, much less in a complete
and straightforward manner as the information reasonably available to him
permits. Michels further argues the interrogatories at issue seek specific
information regarding whether Orwasher is making particular contentions and the
facts he has to support them. Lastly, Michels argues Orwasher makes baseless
objections and provides evasive or incomplete responses and refers Michels to
responses given to previous interrogatories propounded. 
 
            In
opposition, Orwasher argues he has provided sufficient responses to all Michels’
discovery request and no further information is necessary. Specifically,
Orwasher contends he has responded to each interrogatory in a straightforward
manner leaving Michels with no uncertainty as to his contentions. Furthermore,
Orwasher asserts pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.230, he may
refer Michels to other documents if the answer would necessitate making a compilation
or summary of information contained in such records. As such, Orwasher contends
he has been very transparent and forthcoming in their discovery as it pertains
to their claims and allegation leaving nothing unexplained. 
 
            In
reply, Michels argues Orwasher’s responses are facially non-responsive.
Furthermore, Michels contends Orwasher’s recitation of his own response in
response to other interrogatories muddle the issues. Finally, Michels asserts
it is not requesting a compilation or summary of information that has already
been provided because Orwasher never provided factual information responsive to
Special Interrogatory No. 30. 
 
            Upon
review of the Separate Statement, the Court finds that Michels’ is entitled to
code-complaint, objection-less further responses to Special Interrogatories
Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, 21, 22, 26, and 30. Each request seeks specific
information regarding whether Orwasher is making particular contentions as to specific
parties and the facts he has to support them. As such, Orwasher’s responses are
facially unresponsive, evasive, and incomplete because the either do not
provide straightforward responses to the interrogatories, generally lump
parties into one group, or simply refer to the response provided in Special
Interrogatory Nos. 1 and 2. 
 
            Therefore,
the motion to compel further responses is GRANTED.  Further responses within 20 days.
            
            Request
for Sanctions
Where the court
grants a motion to compel further responses, sanctions shall be imposed against
the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the
party acted with substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be
unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (e).)   
 
Michels’ request
monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,185.00. Michels’ counsel declares he
spent (1) 3.0 hours drafting this instant motion and supporting documents; (2) anticipates
an additional 1.0 hour drafting the reply brief; (3) anticipates a 1.0 attending
the hearing on the motion for an hourly rate of $225.00; and (4) $60.00 filing
fee. 
 
The Court finds
that Orwasher has not shown that he acted with substantial justification in not
providing further responses or that any other circumstance would make imposing
sanctions unjust in this instance. 
 
Therefore, the
request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $1,185.00 against Plaintiff Stanley
Orwasher and his counsel of record, Darren McBratney, Esq., payable within 20
days.
 
            It
is so ordered.
