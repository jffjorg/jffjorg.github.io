**English Text**

This is a tentative ruling written by Judge Rolf M. Treu on March 29, 2024, regarding a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories (Set One) filed by Defendant Philip Michels. The court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.

The plaintiffs, Stanley Orwasher and the Estate of Phyllis Orwasher, filed a second amended complaint against defendants Philip Michels, a Professional Law Corporation, Jinheung N. Lew, and Phil Michels, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and professional negligence.

The defendant propounded special interrogatories (Set One) on February 10, 2023, and the plaintiff initially responded on March 21, 2023. However, the plaintiff's responses were incomplete and evasive, and the defendant requested further responses. The court finds that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient responses to the interrogatories and grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses.

The court also grants the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,185.00 against the plaintiff and his counsel, payable within 20 days. The court finds that the plaintiff has not acted with substantial justification in not providing further responses or that any other circumstance would make imposing sanctions unjust in this instance.

Therefore, the defendant's motion to compel further responses is granted, and further responses are due within 20 days.
