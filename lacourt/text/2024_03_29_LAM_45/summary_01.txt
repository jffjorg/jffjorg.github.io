Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, Lucky's Two-Way Radios, Inc., Buddy Corporation, and James A. Kay, Jr. to the First Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiff, Frank J. Cannata, on February 9, 2023. The demurrer challenges the jurisdiction of the court to hear the case due to lack of standing by the plaintiff.

The judge sustains the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff did not provide the required information to the district attorney or insurance commissioner before filing the action, as required by INS § 1871.7(h)(2)(A). The judge also finds that the documents relied upon by the plaintiff were publicly disclosed, making the suit barred.

The judge grants leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to file a new complaint that complies with the requirements of INS § 1871.7(h)(2)(A).
