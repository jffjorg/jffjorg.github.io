MOTION
            Attorney
Michael R. Parker of M.R. Law, PC (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel
for Plaintiff Alireza Kehanpour (“Plaintiff”). 
 ANALYSIS
Counsel has filed
forms MC-051 and MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed
order on form MC-053 as required.  (Cal
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)  The basis
for the motion is a breakdown in the relationship between Plaintiff and Counsel.  This is a valid reason for withdrawal.  Accordingly, the motion is granted.  Counsel should note the order will become
effective upon the filing of proof of service on Plaintiff of a signed copy of
the order.  Counsel will remain the
attorney of record until Counsel files with the Court proof of service of the
signed order.  Counsel is to serve a copy
of the signed order (form MC-053) on Plaintiff within 10 days and file proof of
service thereof.
Counsel is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
