And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order regarding special interrogatories propounded by Defendant Man Staffing LLC on Plaintiff Ariel Alfaro. The Plaintiff has failed to specify the nature of the protective order she seeks, and therefore the motion is denied. The court also finds that the special interrogatories are justified and are not excessive. The court notes that the Plaintiff's complaint is lengthy and that the special interrogatories are narrowly-tailored to seek evidence supporting the Plaintiff's allegations. The court also denies the Plaintiff's request to strike the special interrogatories in their entirety, finding that the court cannot strike an entire set of interrogatories if any question in the set is proper.
