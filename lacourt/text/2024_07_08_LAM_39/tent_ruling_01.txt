Demurrers to Third Amended Complaint

OPPOSING PARTIES


Plaintiff Mario Cazares



 
MOTION
Plaintiff Mario
Cazares (“Plaintiff”) alleges he, a professional boxer, retained Defendants TGB
Promotions, Inc (“Defendant”) and Tom Brown (“Brown”).  Plaintiff contends Defendant violated
conflict of interest laws.  Defendant demurs
to the second, fourth, and sixth causes of action in Plaintiff’s third amended
complaint.  Plaintiff opposes the
demurrer.  Brown also demurred to
Plaintiff’s third amended complaint, but after Brown filed the demurrer,
Plaintiff dismissed his claims against Brown, and the dismissal was entered without
prejudice on May 14, 2024.  As such,
Brown’s demurrer is moot.  
ANALYSIS
“[A] demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis
v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In ruling on a
demurrer, the court must “liberally construe[] [the allegations [in the
complaint], with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”   (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)  “This rule of liberal construction means that
the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.) 
Plaintiff’s second
cause of action is for violation of the Professional Boxing Safety Act “the Act”).
 Under the Act, a boxing promoter cannot
receive compensation in connection with a boxing match until the promoter
discloses to the boxer the amounts of any compensation the promoter will
receive, any fees, charges, and expenses that the promoter will assess on the
boxer in connection with the event, and any reduction in the boxer’s
purse.  (15 U.S.C. § 6307e, subd.
(b).)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant “failed to disclose any of the
information required under” the Act (Third
Amended Complaint, ¶ 84), and “Plaintiff
has sustained monetary damages in an amount of $5,000,000 . . . ,” which
Plaintiff estimates based on viewership of the match, the sponsors of the
match, and the attendance at the match (Id., ¶ 86.)  These allegations
suffice for pleading purposes to state a claim against Defendant.  Defendant may obtain more information in
discovery.
Plaintiff’s fourth
cause of action is under Business and Professions Code section 17200 Plaintiff must
allege a claim under section 17200 “with reasonable particularity . . . .”  (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619.)  Plaintiff’s
allegations are essentially that Defendant induced Plaintiff to contract with
Defendant on unfavorable terms and without the intention to perform.  (See Third Amended Complaint, ¶ 105.)  These
allegations suffice to state a claim under section 17200.  (See Wilner v. Sunset Life Ins. Co.
(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 952, 965.)
Plaintiff’s sixth
cause of action is for negligence.  Plaintiff’s allegations are simply that Defendant
breached the agreement between Defendant and Plaintiff.  (See Third Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 123-126.)  These
allegations do not support a cause of action for negligence.  (Stop Loss Ins. Brokers, Inc. v. Brown
& Toland Medical Group (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1041.)  The Court has already provided Plaintiff an
opportunity to state a cause of action for negligence, and Plaintiff has failed
to do so.  As such, the Court considers
leave to amend futile and, therefore, unwarranted.  (See Grieves v. Superior Court (1984)
157 Cal.App.3d 159, 168.)  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendant’s
demurrer to the sixth cause of action for negligence in Plaintiff’s third
amended complaint is sustained without leave to amend.  The demurrer is otherwise overruled.  Defendant is to answer the third amended complaint
within 10 days.
Defendant is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service concerning it.
