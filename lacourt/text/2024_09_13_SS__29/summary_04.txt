And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The plaintiff, Gerardo Martinez-Guerra, filed a complaint against The M Shop, LLC, Joseph A. Barrios, and Richard K. II Dulay for general negligence and motor vehicle negligence arising from an accident on October 26, 2021. The plaintiff failed to timely demand and post jury fees, which resulted in a waiver of their right to a jury trial. However, the judge found that the waiver was inadvertent and that there would be no undue prejudice to the other parties or the court if the waiver were granted. The judge exercised its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g), to grant relief from waiver and allow a trial by jury.
