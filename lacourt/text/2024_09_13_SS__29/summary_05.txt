And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Nineli Sarkissian, Esq. on behalf of the plaintiff, without prejudice. The motion was initially set for August 8, but was continued to September 13 due to issues with service. The judge found that service was untimely and that no proof of service had been filed with the court showing that notice of the new hearing date was provided to the plaintiff and other parties. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice.
