And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge will hold a hearing to consider Plaintiff's Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to alleged unreasonable conduct by the Plaintiff, which makes it difficult for the Counsel to continue representing the Plaintiff effectively. Plaintiff has filed an objection to the motion, alleging that the Counsel has refused to litigate the case reasonably and has not communicated with the Plaintiff about critical dates. The Judge will inquire about whether the Counsel was served with the Objection, whether the attorney-client relationship is damaged beyond repair, and whether there are conflicts between the attorney and client that make it unreasonable for the attorney to continue the representation. The Judge will make a decision based on applicable laws and precedents, including the Code of Civil Procedure and California Rules of Professional Conduct.
