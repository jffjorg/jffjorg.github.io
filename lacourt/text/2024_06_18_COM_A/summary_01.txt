And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to seal the petition and supporting exhibits. The plaintiff has shown that there is an overriding interest to protect their privacy and safety, and that the proposed order is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The judge has also continued the hearing on the petition for compromise to July 30, 2024. The hearing was initially scheduled for June 18, 2024, but was continued due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with a court order requiring notice and service of the petition on three state agencies. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff did not lodge the amended petition with the Probate Division at least 30 days before the hearing, as required by court rules."
