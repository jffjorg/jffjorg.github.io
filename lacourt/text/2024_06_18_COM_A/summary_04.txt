And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

"In this tentative ruling, the court continues the hearing on the petition for a change of name for Learna Washington Watson, which was previously continued on April 25, 2024, due to the Probation Department's inability to complete its assessment without identification or fingerprinting. The court also notes that the petitioner did not cure the defects in her petition, including the lack of publication of the Order to Show Cause. As a result, the court orders the petitioner to comply with its order of April 25, 2024 and sets the hearing for July 30, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse."
