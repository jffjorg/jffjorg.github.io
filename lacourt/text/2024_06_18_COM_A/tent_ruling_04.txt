ORDER CONTINUING
 THE HEARING ON PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
Petitioner, LEARNA
 WASHINGTON WATSON, filed this Petition for an Order for Change of Name
in order to drop her married name. 
The court previously considered the Petition and continued the hearing
from April 25, 2024 as the Probation Department could not complete its
assessment without some form of identification or fingerprinting. Additionally,
the court’s file does not reflect that Petitioner has complied with the
requirements for publication of the Order to Show Cause. Code Civ. Proc., §
1277. Petitioner did not cure the above defects. 
Accordingly,
the court continues the hearing to July 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the
Compton Courthouse. Petitioner is ordered to comply the court’s order of April
25, 2024.
