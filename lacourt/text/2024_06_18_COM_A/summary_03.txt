And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling takes off the calendar three motions to compel filed by the defendant, Reginald Eugene Moreland, due to defective service. The defendant served the motions on the plaintiff's counsel at the wrong suite number, despite the proof of service reflecting the correct service. The court's records and the caption of the complaint show that the correct suite number for the plaintiff's counsel's office is actually 2230. As a result, the motions are taken off the calendar, and the defendant's attempts to compel the plaintiff's further responses to written discovery are put on hold.
