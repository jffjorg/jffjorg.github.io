FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
On May 15, 2024, Plaintiff Karen Bredice filed a complaint against
Met Warner Center Condominium Association; Labarre/Oksnee Insurance; Philadelphia
Indemnity Ins. Co.; Great American Ins. Co.; Everest National Ins. Co.; Liberty
Mutual Ins. Co.; Firemans Funds Ins. Co.; Ross Morgan & Company; et. al.
for negligence, gross negligence, and premise liability. Plaintiff alleges she
visited the Met Condominium Community, located at 5550 Owensmouth #204,
Woodland Hills, CA 91367, for the purpose of previewing a condominium unit for
sale on behalf of a client. While on the premises, Plaintiff alleges while
descending a staircase, she slipped and fell on what she identified as tanning
oil. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance
Company’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO
AMEND. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company moves for judgment on
the pleadings to Plaintiff Karen Bredice’s complaint on the grounds the action
is barred by the statute of limitations, Plaintiff lacks standing to bring a
direct lawsuit against Liberty Mutual and each of the three causes of action
fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a claim against Liberty Mutual. 
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings is the functional
equivalent to a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic
Indemnity Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.)  Like demurrers,
motions for judgment on the pleadings challenge the legal sufficiency of the
allegations, not their veracity.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) 
 
Any defects must either appear on the face of the pleading, or
else be taken by judicial notice.  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-22.)  The parties’ ability to prove their
respective claims is of no concern.  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 99.)  Though the Court must accept the
allegations of the complaint and answer as true (Gerawan Farming, Inc. v.
Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th 468, 515), it will not do so for “conclusions of
law or fact, opinions, speculation, or allegations contrary to law or
[judicially noticed] facts…” (Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v. CB
Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1219-20). 
 
If a motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted, it may be
granted with or without leave to amend.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(h)(1).)  As with a demurrer, “leave to amend should be granted if there
is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of
action.”  (Virginia G. v. ABC Unif. Sch. Dist. (1993) 15
Cal.App.4th 1848, 1852.)   
 
Time Barred
 
Defendant Liberty first moves for judgment on the pleadings on the
grounds the complaint is time barred on its face. Liberty argues Plaintiff’s
complaint admits on its face that it was filed more than two years after the
alleged slip and fall. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1 provides that any action for
negligence must be commenced within two years. In the context of a tort, the
statute of limitations begins to run when damage has occurred. (Budd v.
Nixen (1971) 6 Cal.3d 195, 200-01.) Plaintiff alleges the injury occurred
May 10, 2022 and therefore, the two-year deadline for filing this lawsuit
expired no later than May 10, 2024. The complaint is stamped filed on May 15,
2024. The court agrees the complaint is barred by the statute of limitations.
Plaintiff has failed to oppose this motion for judgment on the pleadings.
 
Accordingly, the motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
Standing & Cognizable Claims 
 
The court will briefly address Liberty’s remaining two arguments.
Liberty first argues Plaintiff lacks standing to sue Liberty because Plaintiff
has not obtained a judgment against Liberty Mutual’s insured nor any resolution
of the same by way of a “conclusive judicial determination of the [Insured’s]
liability.” The court agrees. “[W]henever judgment is secured against the
insured … in an action based on bodily injury, death or property damage, then
an action may be brought against the insurer on the policy and subject to its
terms and limitations, by such judgment creditor to recover on the judgment.”
(Ins. Code § 11580(b)(2).) “Because the insurer’s duties flow to its insured
alone, a third party claimant may not bring a direct action against an insurance
company. As a general rule, a third party may directly sue an insurer only when
there has been an assignment of rights by, or a final judgment against, the
insured.” (Shaolian v. Safeco Insurance Co. (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 268,
271, internal citations omitted.)
 
Liberty also argues the complaint fails to state facts pleading
negligence or premises liability. Liberty contends the allegations fail to
connect Liberty Mutual to the subject property or alleged incident including
owning, leasing, occupying, or controlling the subject property. The court
agrees. The complaint fails to allege a duty owed by Liberty or how Liberty breached
that duty to support a claim for negligence and moreover, the complaint fails
to allege Philadelphia’s possession or ownership of the subject premises.
 
Accordingly, Defendant Liberty’s Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings is GRANTED.
