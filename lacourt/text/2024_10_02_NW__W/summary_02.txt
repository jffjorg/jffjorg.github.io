And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the complaint is time-barred and that the plaintiff lacks standing to sue Liberty Mutual. The judge also found that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a claim for negligence and premises liability against Liberty Mutual. The judge determined that the complaint was filed more than two years after the alleged slip and fall incident, which is beyond the statute of limitations for a negligence claim. Additionally, the judge held that the plaintiff has not obtained a judgment against Liberty Mutual's insured nor any resolution of the same by way of a conclusive judicial determination of the insured's liability, which is a requirement for a direct lawsuit against Liberty Mutual.
