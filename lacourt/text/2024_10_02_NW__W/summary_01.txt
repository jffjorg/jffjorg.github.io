And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Plaintiff Sharona Baror's motion to compel the deposition of LDL General Contractors, Inc.'s person most qualified, which is Lance Daniel Lentz. The court finds that Renee Lentz, who was produced as the person most qualified, was not knowledgeable in the area and failed to prepare for the deposition, despite having ample notice to familiarize herself with the topics. The court also disagrees with Defendant LDL General Contractors, Inc.'s argument that Lance Daniel Lentz has already been extensively deposed, as the limitation on taking more than one deposition from a natural person does not apply when an individual is also the person most qualified. The court orders Defendant LDL General Contractors, Inc. to produce a person most qualified who has reviewed the requisite documents and spoken to the requisite persons to qualify to speak on all the noticed categories. Additionally, the court grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $2,560.00.
