And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case where AIG Property Casualty Company (AIG) is seeking to quash a deposition notice or issue a protective order to prevent the deposition of Kristen Davis, a senior complex claims advisor at Sedgwick Claims, Inc. The deposition notice was served in connection with an arbitration proceeding related to an underinsured motorist claim. AIG argues that the information Davis possesses is protected by attorney-client privilege and that there are more convenient and less burdensome discovery options available. Claimant opposes the motion, arguing that Davis verified AIG's discovery responses and that further discovery is necessary to determine the sources of that information.

The court denied AIG's motion, finding that Davis's verification of AIG's discovery responses allows for further discovery and that AIG must assert its attorney-client privilege objections during the deposition. The court also awarded $1,500 in sanctions against AIG and their counsel of record, jointly and severally.
