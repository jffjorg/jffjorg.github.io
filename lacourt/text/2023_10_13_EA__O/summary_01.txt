And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the first set of document demands and for sanctions against the plaintiff and its attorneys of record. The judge finds that the motion fails to meet the basic requirements of a memorandum, including a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, and a discussion of the statutes and cases cited. The judge also notes that the motion is identical in that it does not change the relief sought and only seeks further and complete responses to "first set form interrogatories." The judge denies the motion without prejudice, suggesting that the parties should proceed with formal discovery and that the plaintiff should provide sufficient responses to the discovery demands.
