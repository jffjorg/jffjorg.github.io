Background
 
This is a contracts case. Plaintiff Bao Li Da International,
Inc. alleges the following against Defendant Rich Pacific USA, Inc.: Between
October and November 2021, the parties signed agreements for FedEx and DHL
accounts to use for shipments. Plaintiff agreed to pay Defendant commissions
for use of the accounts plus a freight deposit, the latter of which would be
refunded upon termination of the agreement. “Defendant breached the Agreements
by failing to return the freight deposit balance of no less than $55,375.55 and
failing to facilitate Plaintiff’s use of FedEx accounts and failing to provide
services with official FedEx service standard at discounted freight rate as
required under the Agreements. (First Amended Complaint (FAC) p. 4.)
 
On December 29, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit. 
 
On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a FAC for: 1.    
Breach of Contract 2.    
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing 3.    
Conversion 4.    
Unjust Enrichment 5.    
Money Had and Received
 
On April 14, 2023, Defendant filed its answer and a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff and USKY Express Co., Ltd for: 
 
1.    
Breach of Contract
2.    
Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations and
3.    
Equitable Indemnification
 
On May 1, 2023, Defendant filed the instant 3 discovery
motions. 
 
On May 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed its answer to the
cross-complaint. 
 
On September 20, 2023, the court noted that the parties may
proceed with formal discovery as issues remained unresolved after the IDC. 
 
On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed its opposition. (The
opposition to the RFP and FROG are consolidated into one opposition; the
opposition to the RFA motion is filed separately.) 
 
On October 3, 2023, Defendant filed a Reply. 
 
Motion
 
The
three motions are denied because the motions fail to meet basic memorandum
requirements. 
 
According to California Rules of Court Rule 3.1113, a
memorandum is to consist of “a statement of facts, a concise statement of the
law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases,
and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” The motions do none. 
 
First, the motions to not explain the facts of the case,
which are already unclear from the complaint and FAC. 
Second, the motions are identical in that Defendant did not
change the relief it seeks as for all three. It only seeks further and complete
responses to “first set form interrogatories.” (Motions p. 2:8-13.) But, based
off the caption of the filings, there are three different discovery
devices at issue; FROGs, RFP (presuming that is equivalent to Document
Demands), and RFAs.
 
Third, as the motions are identical, the legal authority
under which the motion was also not changed. The motions only cite to CCP
section 2030.300 subdivision (a), which only applies to interrogatories.
(Motions p. 4:1-3.) 
 
Fourth, the motions do not provide a basic description of
the discovery sought and any meaningful explanation as to why they are
relevant. 
 
For those reasons, the motions are denied. 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the motions are denied without
prejudice should the supplemental responses not sufficiently respond to the
discovery. As noted by Defendant in its meet and confer email (Reply, Ex. C), a
party has a duty to answer if “the nature of the information sought is
apparent.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.) Here, a
review of the separate statement indicates that subject of nearly all the
discovery is apparent (i.e., not vague, not ambiguous, not intelligible, nor other
ways in which Plaintiff claims as based upon their objections). For example,
Plaintiff must know of USKY as they are sister companies. Thus, an objection
that USKY is an unidentified term is disingenuous. Therefore, should there be
any outstanding discovery regarding the three accounts, the motions are denied
without prejudice. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motions are denied without
prejudice.[1]
