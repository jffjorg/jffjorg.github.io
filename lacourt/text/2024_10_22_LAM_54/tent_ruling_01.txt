Hearing Date: October 22, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Moving Party: Plaintiff 740 South Broadway
Associates, LLC
Responding Party: Defendant Chol Enterprises, Inc.
 
T/R: PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES IS GRANTED IN THE REDUCED AMOUNT OF $18,371.32 IN
FEES AND $143.32 IN COSTS.
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
Plaintiff moves for an award of
attorney’s fees and costs under CCP § 685.040 which provides that “a judgment
creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a
judgment.” The parties’ lease agreement contains an attorney’s fees provision. 
 
Plaintiff seeks attorney’s fees in the
amount of $111,603.50 and costs in the amount of $2,785.13, for a total amount
of $114,388.63 to enforce the judgment. This total includes fees and costs
incurred defending a separate action (Case No. 23STCV31162) filed by Defendant
to recover personal property remaining at the premises after Plaintiff took
repossession the premises.  
 
In opposition, Defendant asserts this
motion is untimely and Plaintiff cannot recover fees for the separate action.
CCP § 685.030(d)(2) requires that a motion for post-judgment enforcement costs
be filed before full satisfaction of the judgment. Defendant represents that
Plaintiff delayed in providing instructions to pay the judgment to file this
motion. Ultimately, Defendant overnighted a check to Plaintiff on May 13, 2024,
which Plaintiff received on May 14, 2024. Plaintiff filed and served the motion
on May 13, 2024. The parties dispute the timeliness down to the minute of
filing and mailing.
 
The Court previously denied Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney’s fees on the ground that Plaintiff had failed to apportion
fees between work to enforce the judgment in this action and work on a separate
action filed by Defendant. Here, Plaintiff requests the same amount as the
first motion, $114,388.63, but states that it is willing to accept a 50%
reduction to account for fees spent to defend the second action. Plaintiff,
however, represents that only $18,371.32 in fees and
$143.32 are “indisputably related to efforts to collect and enforce the
judgment.”
 
As Plaintiff filed its first motion for attorney’s fees before receiving
payment from Defendant, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to fees for
enforcement. However, the Court will only allow recovery of fees that are
“indisputably related to efforts to collect and enforce the judgment” as
represented by Plaintiff.  
 
Plaintiff’s motion for is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $18,371.32 in
fees and $143.32 in costs.

Hearing Date: October 22, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Compel Acknowledgement of
Partial Satisfaction of Judgment
Moving Party: Defendant Chol Enterprises, Inc. 
Responding Party: Plaintiff 740 South Broadway
Associates, LLC
 
T/R:      DEFENDANT’S MOTION IS DENIED.
 
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
Under CCP § 724.030, a judgment
creditor is required to immediately file an acknowledgment of satisfaction of
judgment with the court when a money judgment is satisfied. If the judgment
creditor fails to do so, the judgment debtor may follow the procedures outlined
in CCP §§ 724.050 and 724.110 to obtain such an acknowledgment or a
court-entered satisfaction of judgment.
 
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff to
file an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment in the amount of $170,086.69. As the Court has awarded Plaintiff additional attorney’s
fees, the judgment has not yet been satisfied in full. Defendant’s motion is
DENIED.
