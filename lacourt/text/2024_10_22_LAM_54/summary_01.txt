Summary:
The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions related to a judgment in a case between 740 South Broadway Associates, LLC (Plaintiff) and Chol Enterprises, Inc. (Defendant). The first motion is for attorney's fees and costs, which the Judge grants in the reduced amount of $18,371.32 in fees and $143.32 in costs. The Judge is entitled to fees for enforcement, but only fees that are "indisputably related to efforts to collect and enforce the judgment" are recoverable. The second motion is to compel acknowledgment of partial satisfaction of judgment, which the Judge denies because the judgment has not yet been satisfied in full.
