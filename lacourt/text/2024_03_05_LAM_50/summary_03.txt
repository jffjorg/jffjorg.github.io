And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the central question of when the six-month limitation period for relief from default judgment due to attorney's neglect commences. The court notes that the Sugasawara v. Newland case (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294 held that the limitation period starts from the entry of judgment, not the default judgment. Additionally, the court highlights its power to impose reasonable monetary sanctions on parties who fail to comply with court rules without good cause. The ruling also cites California Rules of Court, rule 2.30, which applies to general civil cases, unlawful detainer cases, probate proceedings, civil proceedings in the appellate division of the superior court, and small claims cases.
