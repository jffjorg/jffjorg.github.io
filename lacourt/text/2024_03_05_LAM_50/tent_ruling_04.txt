[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 



 
Plaintiff Tax Resolution Plus (“Plaintiff”) requests entry
of default judgment against Defendants Reza Momeni (“Momeni”) and Cyrus Services Inc. (“Cyrus Services”). Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount of $54,993.56, comprising $54,389.34 in damages and $604.22 in costs. 
The Court notes that default
was entered against Momeni on October 4, 2023. However, it does not appear that
default has been entered against Cyrus Services. Plaintiff filed a request for
entry of default against Cyrus Services on November 27, 2023, but the request
does not show that default was entered as requested. Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is denied as to Cyrus Services. 
As to Momeni, the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently supported
its request with the submitted declaration and evidence. However, the Court notes that Item 1(a) of the Request (Form CIV-100) incorrectly states
that the Complaint was filed on June 28, 2023. The Complaint was filed on June
23, 2023. 
Plaintiff may file a revised Request for Court Judgment (Form
CIV-100) correcting the defect in Item 1(a) of the Request. Plaintiff may also
file a revised proposed judgment (Form JUD-100) removing “Cyrus Services Inc.”
from Item 5(a) of the judgment. If the foregoing defects are corrected before
the hearing, the Court will grant Plaintiff’s request for default judgment as to Momeni.
