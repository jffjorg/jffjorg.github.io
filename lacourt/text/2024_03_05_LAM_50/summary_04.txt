The court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Tax Resolution Plus's request for default judgment against Defendants Reza Momeni and Cyrus Services Inc. The court has denied the request for default judgment as to Cyrus Services, as default has not been entered against the company. However, the court has granted the request for default judgment against Momeni, pending correction of defects in the Request for Court Judgment and Proposed Judgment. The court notes that the Complaint was filed on June 23, 2023, not June 28, 2023, as stated in the Request. The court has given Plaintiff an opportunity to correct these defects before the hearing on March 5, 2024.
