And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, LVNV Funding LLC, seeks judgment in the amount of $62,561.68, but the complaint does not allege interest. The judge notes that the complaint does not comply with the Code of Civil Procedure, which requires that a complaint or cross-complaint contain a demand for judgment and state the amount demanded. The judge cites several cases to support the conclusion that a trial court has no jurisdiction to grant a plaintiff more relief against a defaulting defendant than is asked for in the complaint. The judge will discuss with counsel a schedule for submitting a new default judgment package.
