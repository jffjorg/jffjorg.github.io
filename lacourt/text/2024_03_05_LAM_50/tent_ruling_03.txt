[1]The Court notes that in Sugasawara v. Newland (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th
294, 296,“[t]he central question [was] whether the
six-month limitation allowed by section 473 for
relief based on attorney’s neglect commences at the time default is entered or
when the default judgment is rendered.” The Sugasawara Court found that “[t]he plain language of section 473
makes it clear that the six-month period starts to run from the entry of
judgment. In addition, section 473 requires the
court to vacate the underlying default upon vacating the default judgment as a
result of attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Id. at p. 295.) 


[2]Pursuant to California Rules
of Court, rule 2.30, subdivision (b), “[i]n addition to any other sanctions permitted by law, the court
may order a person, after written notice and an opportunity to be heard, to pay
reasonable monetary sanctions to the court or an aggrieved person, or both, for
failure without good cause to comply with the applicable rules.” Pursuant to California Rules
of Court, rule 2.30, subdivision (a), “[t]his sanctions rule applies to the
rules in the California Rules of Court relating to general civil cases,
unlawful detainer cases, probate proceedings, civil proceedings in the
appellate division of the superior court, and small claims cases.”
