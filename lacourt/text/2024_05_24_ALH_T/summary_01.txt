And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Defendant Ronald Smothers' motion to compel Plaintiff Jason Mota's deposition. The Court has ordered Plaintiff to appear for deposition within 20 days of Defendant giving notice of this order. The Court has also ordered Plaintiff and counsel of record, Jeffrey Bloeser, to pay sanctions in the amount of $660, jointly and severally, to Defense counsel within 30 days of Defendant giving notice of this order. The Court has found that Plaintiff's refusal to proceed with the deposition was improper and that Defendant was entitled to be present at the deposition. The Court has also taken into account the history of the case, including the fact that Defendant has been attempting to take Plaintiff's deposition since March 2023, for over a year.
