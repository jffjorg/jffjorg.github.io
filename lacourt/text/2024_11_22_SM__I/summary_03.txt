And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion to compel a response to the requests for production. The judge has also granted the request for sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $1325, payable within 30 days. The judge reduced the amount of sanctions because there was no opposition to the motion, and therefore, no time was spent reviewing or preparing a reply. The judge believes that the requests for production are proper and that there is no reason for the defendant's failure to respond. The defendant is required to serve verified responses to the requests for production, including documents, within 30 days. If the defendant withholds any documents based on privilege, they must provide a detailed privilege log that sets forth specific information about the document, including its author, recipients, and purpose.
