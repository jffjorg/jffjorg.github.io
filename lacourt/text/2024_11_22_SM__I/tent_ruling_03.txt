 Case Number:  23SMCV00985    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to compel is GRANTED.   The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the
amount of $1325, payable by defendant, but not counsel, within 30 days.  The reduction is because there was no
opposition and thus no time was spent reviewing it or preparing a reply.  The court believes that the requests for
production are proper, and there appears to be no reason for defendant’s
failure to respond in any way.  Defendant
will serve verified responses without objection other than privilege within 30
days.  Documents will be served at the
same time as the responses.  If any
documents are withheld on the basis of privilege, a detailed privilege log will
be provided that sets forth (1) the document’s author; (2) the document’s
principal recipient or recipients; (3) all others who have seen the document;
(4) the date the document was created; (5) the general subject matter of the
document; and (6) the basis for the privilege—not just the name of the
privilege or doctrine, but a short explanation of why the document falls within
the privilege or doctrine.
