The plaintiff was injured at the defendant's store and seeks the name and contact information of the person who conducted an investigation after the fact. The defendant objects to providing this information, citing the work product doctrine. The judge has decided that the name of the investigator is not privileged and is not subject to work product protection. The judge will grant the motion and order the defendant to provide the investigator's name and contact information within 5 court days. The judge notes that the contact information can be provided through counsel, but counsel will be responsible for ensuring contact even if the investigator leaves their job.
