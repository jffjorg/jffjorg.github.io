  Case Number:  22SMCV01644    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  I The application is DENIED. 
The court would be inclined to continue the debtor’s exam if that were
all that is before the court.  But the
issue is more than that.  Counsel stated
that he had authority to accept service. 
But then, there was a motion to quash for lack of service.  At this point, the court is quite concerned
that someone is lying either to the court or to plaintiff, or both.  The court takes that sort of thing seriously,
even if defendants do not.  If there were
travel plan problems, they should have been raised at the hearing or weeks ago.
 
Nor is the court overly enamored of defendants’ promises of
resolution.  The court has heard the
defense sing that song before, but nothing has ever come of it.
