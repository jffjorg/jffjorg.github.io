And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the application to continue the trial, scheduled for November 22, 2024. The parties had requested a continuance because they have not yet completed mediation, with a reserved date in February 2024. However, the court found that the parties' reason for seeking a continuance is not good cause, as they had failed to follow the court's order regarding the mediation completion date twice. The court notes that it has a heavy docket with 1200 cases, and granting a continuance would require bumping another case where the parties have acted diligently and in good faith preparing for trial. The judge expects the parties to file their FSC materials in a timely manner and is prepared to proceed with the trial on the current schedule.
