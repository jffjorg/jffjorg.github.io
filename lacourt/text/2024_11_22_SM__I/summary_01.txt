And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request to continue the debtor's exam. The issue is more complex than just the exam, as the court is concerned about whether someone is lying to the court or to the plaintiff. Counsel for the defendant claimed to have authority to accept service, but then the defendant moved to quash the service, claiming it was invalid. The court is skeptical of the defendant's promises to resolve the issue, as they have made similar promises in the past without following through. The court is also concerned that the defendant did not raise any travel plan problems earlier, and instead waited until the hearing to bring it up.
