And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is writing to set forth its thinking on how to allocate the settlement proceeds in this case. The case involves Miriam Sharkh, who sued an insurer for cutting off her health care coverage, and her children Liam and Levi. Liam died due to illness, and the parties have disagreed on how to divide the settlement proceeds.

The judge has decided to set priorities for recovery, starting with medical expenses that should have been covered but were not. The next priority is medical bills that Miriam or Benjamin, the father, are still liable for. The judge believes that it is fair to prioritize these expenses first.

The next priority is for medical expenses that will be incurred in the future due to the insurer's failure to pay benefits. The judge is not sure if there are any expenses that fit into this category, but if there are, the party claiming this recovery would have to prove causation.

After that, the judge would award emotional distress damages to Miriam and Levi in a 2:1 ratio, capped at the other recoveries. The judge is not convinced by Miriam's claims for lost income and emotional distress, and would not award punitive damages.

The judge also believes that costs of suit should be paid off the top, and would consider a different outcome if there is a surplus. The judge is hoping that the parties will be able to reach an accord, but if not, will set a status conference to see if the parties are making progress.
