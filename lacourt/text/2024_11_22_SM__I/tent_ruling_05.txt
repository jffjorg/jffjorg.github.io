 Case Number:  23SMCV05595    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  I The court is in receipt of the parties’ stipulation taking
this matter off calendar (or, more accurately, continuing it).  The court accepts the stipulation and
appreciates it.  Sadly, it was not
scanned in time for the court actually to take the matter off calendar, but the
court will nonetheless approve the stipulation and discuss with counsel a good
date for the continued hearing.  Hopefully,
the parties will be able to resolve the matter fully (or at least the discovery
issue) before that time.
