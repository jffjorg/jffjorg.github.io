 Case Number:  22SMCV01872    Hearing Date:   November 22, 2024    Dept:  I The application to continue the trial is DENIED.  Trial was originally set by virtue of a CMC
held on April 17, 2023.  At that time, an
April 2024 trial date was set and a mediation completion date of December 31,
2023 was set.  The court explained to the
parties that the mediation completion was designed to be far enough in advance
of trial so that the parties could focus on it, but that if it was not
successful, there would still be time to get ready for trial.  On April 4, 2024, the court reluctantly continued
the trial date to December 23, 2024.  At
that time, one reason given was so that the parties could complete discovery
and mediate.  The court set a new
mediation completion date of October 10, 2024, even though that was close to
the trial date.
 
The parties now seek to continue the trial because they have
not yet mediated and the date they have reserved is not until February
2024.  The problem with the argument is
that the supposed good cause asserted is the failure (twice) to follow the
court’s order regarding the mediation completion date.  But that is not good cause.  
 
The court expects that the FSC materials will be timely
filed in good form and that the matter will be ready for trial on the current
schedule.  The court notes that it
currently has about 1200 cases on its docket. 
If it continues this one, then that means that another case—one where
the parties have acted diligently and in good faith preparing for trial—will
have to be bumped.  That is not
appropriate, and the court has nowhere on its docket until about July 2026
where it does not have 4-8 cases on the trial calendar.  In short, while the court used to have some
flexibility in its trial calendar so as to accommodate counsel and parties
seeking a continuance, sadly that is no longer the case.
