Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has scheduled a hearing for November 22, 2024, to address a motion to compel further responses from the defendant. The plaintiff has sent the defendant requests for admissions (RFA's) and the defendant has responded, claiming that it lacked sufficient knowledge to admit or deny certain requests. However, the defendant later obtained medical records that would have allowed it to respond more accurately. The Judge notes that the parties could have resolved this issue more easily through a good faith meet and confer process.

The Judge is continuing the motion for 45 days to allow the parties to meet and confer and resolve the issue. The Judge emphasizes the importance of a good faith meet and confer process and provides guidelines for how this process should be conducted. The Judge also notes that the parties should be civil and polite during the meet and confer process and should not engage in name-calling or accusations.

The Judge's guidelines for the meet and confer process include providing a joint statement of the parties' positions, attending the meeting with a person who has the authority to agree to the other side's position, being willing to give up sanctions, and being flexible and willing to compromise. The Judge also notes that the parties should take careful notes of any agreements reached and confirm them in writing.

If the parties are unable to resolve the issue through the meet and confer process, the Judge will consider awarding sanctions to the prevailing party. The Judge emphasizes that the goal of the meet and confer process is to "get to yes" and to reach a resolution that is fair and reasonable for all parties.
