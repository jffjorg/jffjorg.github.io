And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for limited-expedited discovery, which allows the plaintiff to issue third-party subpoenas to non-party respondents GMX, Google, Inc., Instagram, LLC, Microsoft, Inc., and Naver, Inc. The plaintiff seeks to identify the Doe defendants by serving them with deposition subpoenas, as they do not know the identity of the defendants. The judge finds that there is good cause for the plaintiff to issue the subpoenas, as there is no other way for the plaintiff to obtain the necessary information. Microsoft does not oppose the motion, while Meta argues that the plaintiff improperly issued the subpoena without leave of court. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's motion is granted to the extent that it may issue third-party subpoenas.
