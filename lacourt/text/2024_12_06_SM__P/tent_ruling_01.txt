Weinstein v. Rise Luxury Rehab,
LLC, Case no. 23SMCV03723
Hearing date December 6, 2024
Defendant’s
Motions to Compel Discovery and for Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiff
Weinstein sues defendant Rise Luxury Rehab, LLC arising out of alleged
violations of plaintiff’s privacy rights and safety during his time as an
inpatient at defendant’s facility. Defendant served plaintiff with requests for
production and admissions 4/5/24. Plaintiff failed to respond. Defendant moves
to compel discovery and for sanctions totaling $5,215. No opposition was filed.
When
a party fails to timely respond to written discovery requests, including
interrogatories and requests for production of documents, propounding party can
move for an order compelling a response without objections. Code of Civ. Proc.
§2023.290. If a party fails to serve timely responses to requests for
admission, the requesting party can move for an order deeming the truth of any
matter specified in the requests admitted. Code of Civ. Proc. §2033.280.
Defendant
served general form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for
production of documents and request for admissions on 4/5/24. Decls. Costanzo
paras. 2, 4. Plaintiff failed to respond. Decls. Costanzo paras. 6, 10. Plaintiff’s
failure to produce discovery follows multiple meet and confer attempts. Decls.
Costanzo paras. 4-5, 6-8. The parties attended an informal discovery conference
9/25/24 where the court ordered plaintiff to respond and stated defendant should
file the instant motions if plaintiff failed to do so. Min. Order 9/25/24. The
court notes plaintiff’s counsel seeks to be removed from the case, with hearing
set for 1/7/25, citing plaintiff’s refusal to participate in the discovery
process and failure to communicate with his own counsel. Decl. Saunders para.
2. 
Plaintiff
does not oppose this motion. Defendant’s motions and request for sanctions are
meritorious. Defendant’s counsel spent 2 hours each preparing the instant
motions at $265/hour. Decls. Costanzo paras. 10, 11. 8 hours for form discovery
motions is unreasonable. Defendant requests an additional 2 hours each for
replies, as well as an additional 1 hour each for hearing. No opposition was
filed so no replies will be necessary. Defendant requests $60 in filing fees
for each motion. Id. The court grants 4 hours total at the requested
$265/hour for preparing the motions and an additional 1 hour for attending the hearing,
plus filing fees. Sanctions of $265x5, plus $60 are payable within 30 days.
Motion GRANTED.
