Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant M.S. Aerospace Inc.'s motion to compel deposition, ordering Plaintiff Hermenegildo Ahumada-Burgara to appear for deposition in-person on a date to be determined. The parties had previously agreed to conduct the deposition remotely, but the judge finds that this agreement is not binding on the instant action and that Defendant has demonstrated good cause for an in-person deposition due to the volume of exhibits involved. The judge has denied Defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the parties acted with substantial justification.
