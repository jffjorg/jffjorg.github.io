     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion to quash service of
  summons 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 26, 2023, Plaintiff
American Builders & Contractors Supply Co., Inc. filed this action against
Defendants Energy Roofing, Inc., Nadav Marciano, and Arturo Suarez. The
complaint asserts causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) open book
account, and (3) account stated. 
            On July 27, 2023, Defendants Energy
Roofing and Nadav Marciano filed the instant motion to quash the service of
summons on the grounds that it was served to the incorrect address. Plaintiff
filed its opposition on September 15, 2023. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“[T]he court in which an action is pending
has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served on him as
provided by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10).” (Code Civ. Proc, §
410.50(a).) “[A] court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of
process or by that party's general appearance.” (In re Jennifer O.
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 539, 547.) Actual notice of a lawsuit is not a
substitute for proper service of process. (Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 1199, 1206.) A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to
quash service of summons on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a).) 
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
            Defendants’ objections to the
Anderson declaration are overruled.
DISCUSSION
“If a copy of the summons and complaint
cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be
served . . . a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and
complaint at the person’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of
business, or usual mailing address . . . in the presence of a competent member
of the household or a person apparently in charge . . . at least 18 years of
age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a
copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid
to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and
complaint were left.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20(b).)
Defendant Marciano is the CEO of Defendant
Energy Roofing. (Marciano Decl. ¶ 2.) Plaintiff initially attempted service at
24007 Ventura Blvd., Ste. 240, Calabasas, CA 91302 (Ventura Blvd. address), the
address listed on Energy Roofing’s website and other materials. (Anderson Decl.
¶ 12.) The process server informed Plaintiff that Energy Roofing was not
located at the Ventura Blvd. address. (Id., ¶ 13, Ex. 5.) Plaintiff next
attempted service at 21926 Martinez St., Woodland Hills, CA 91364 (Martinez St.
address), Energy Roofing’s current address for service of process according to
the Secretary of State. (Id., ¶ 14.) The process server attempted
service at the Martinez St. address on eleven separate days in May and June
2023. (Id., ¶ 15, Ex. 6.) Plaintiff then discovered an alternate address,
a property owned by Marciano located at 6540 Franrivers Ave., Woodland Hills,
CA 91307 (Franrivers address). (Id., ¶ 16.) Plaintiff directed a process
server to serve both Defendants at the Franrivers address. (Id., ¶ 17.)
The proofs of service indicate that a registered process server effectuated
substitute service at the Franrivers address. (Id., Ex. 8.) 
Marciano denies that the Franrivers
address is his residence, business, or mailing address. (Marciano Decl. ¶ 4.) However,
Marciano confirms that the correct address is registered with the Secretary of
State. (Id., ¶ 5.) This means that the Martinez St. address where
Plaintiff previously attempted service is the correct address. (See Anderson
Decl. ¶¶ 14-15.) Indeed, Plaintiff personally served Energy Roofing’s agent for
service of process at the Martinez St. address on September 18, 2023. (October
5, 2023 Proof of Service.) 
Plaintiff has no evidence to contradict
Marciano’s testimony that the Franrivers address is not his “dwelling house,
usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address.” (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 415.20(b).) Mere ownership is insufficient. Marciano has confirmed
that the Martinez St. address is correct, and Plaintiff has demonstrated that
service is possible at that address. Therefore, the service at Franrivers is
ineffective and insufficient to confer jurisdiction.
Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ motion does
not comply with the notice and timing requirements of Code of Civil Procedure
section 418.10(b). However, Plaintiff had notice of the motion sufficient to file
a substantive response. A procedurally defective motion does not change the
fact that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction due to ineffective service at
the wrong address. Defendants have not generally appeared and therefore have
not waived the jurisdictional challenge. The Court also has discretion to extend
the time for filing a motion to quash. (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) Therefore,
the timing requirements in Section 418.10(b) do not dispose of the matter.  
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion to quash service
of summons is GRANTED.
