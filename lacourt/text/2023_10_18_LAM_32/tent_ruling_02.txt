2.     
Defendant
shall produce any Recall Notices and Technical Service Bulletins regarding defects
alleged in plaintiff’s complaint for vehicles for the same year, make, and
model of the subject vehicle.  Defendant
is not required to do a search of emails. 
3.     
Defendant
shall produce all documents evidencing policies and procedures used to evaluate
customer requests for repurchase pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act, for the period of date of purchase of the subject vehicle to present.

4.     
Defendant
shall produce all repair orders and invoices concerning the subject vehicle.
5.     
Defendant
shall produce all communications with dealer, factory representative and/or
call center concerning the subject vehicle.
6.     
Defendant
shall produce all warranty claims submitted to and/or approved by Defendant
concerning the subject vehicle.
7.     
All
other requests for further production are DENIED.
8.

shall provide supplemental responses in compliance with this order within 45
days of this order.

Court does not award sanctions as it finds both sides acted with substantial
justification.
