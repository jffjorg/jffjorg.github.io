And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents in a lemon law action. The plaintiff, rita rozedzadea, sued American Motors Co., Inc. for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, alleging defects with her 2018 Honda Odyssey. The court finds that the plaintiff's discovery requests are overly broad and unduly burdensome, and orders the defendant to provide specific documents, including the warranty policy and procedure manual, recall notices, technical service bulletins, and other relevant documents. The court also denies other requests for further production and orders the defendant to provide supplemental responses within 45 days. The court declines to award sanctions, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification.
