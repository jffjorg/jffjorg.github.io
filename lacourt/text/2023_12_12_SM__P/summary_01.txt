And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel production of an unredacted VISA credit card number used by an entity called "Cheatersrus" to pay for advertising on Facebook. The plaintiff had sought this information to uncover the identity of the creators of the Cheaterreport website, which he alleges published defamatory statements about him. The judge found that the plaintiff had not shown a compelling need for the discovery, as the information was protected by the California Constitution's right to privacy. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's evidence linking the Cheaterreport website to the Cheatersrus Facebook page was not strong enough to justify the production of the credit card number. No sanctions will be issued.
