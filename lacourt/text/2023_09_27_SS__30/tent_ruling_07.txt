 Case Number:  22STCV02045    Hearing Date:   September 27, 2023    Dept:  30 MARISOL SERRANO, et al. vs JOSE ADAN ALARCON GONZALEZDemurrerTentative Ruling:  Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with leave to amend within 20 days of notice of ruling.  Moving party to give notice.Discussion:  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONSDefendant demurs to Plaintiff’s complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred.Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1, “Within two years: An action for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the death of, an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another.”Here, Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that Defendant struck Serrano on July 16, 2019. Plaintiff’s deadline to file his complaint was July 16, 2021. Plaintiff’s Complaint was originally filed on January 18, 2022, which falls after two years from the date of the alleged injury.Judicial Council issued Emergency Rule 9 on April 6, 2020, which allowed the time to file the Complaint to be  tolled from April 6, 2020, until October 1, 2020 (179 days)  The Complaint, however, was filed beyond two years and 179 days, approximately a week. Defendant’s demurrer is sustained on this ground.Bystander DamagesDefendant next argues that Mangram cannot recover damages because he is the boyfriend of Serrano and cannot recover as a bystander.Because Plaintiff concedes this argument and has requested to dismiss Mangram, this issue is moot.The Court will grant leave to amend. Plaintiff notes that it has special circumstances that may further toll the statute of limitations. Without ruling upon the merits of those contentions, the Court will allow Plaintiff to amend to allege any tolling that will be necessary to make this action viable. The Court notes that the Complaint has two different dates that  Plaintiff alleges that the incident occurred.  This should be corrected as well.
