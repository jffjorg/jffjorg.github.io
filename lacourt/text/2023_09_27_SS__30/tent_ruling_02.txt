Discussion:  Defendant’s Counsel testifies that he propounded requests for written discovery on Plaintiff on November 30, 2022. (Sipprelle Decl., ¶ 3.) On January 25, 2023, Defendant’s Counsel sent Plaintiff a meet and confer letter inquiring after the late responses and numerous written correspondences to follow up. (Id., ¶ 4.) To date, Plaintiff has not served responses to Defendant’s discovery requests. (Id., ¶4.)Because Plaintiff has provided no responses to Defendant’s discovery requests, Defendant’s motion to deem RFAs admitted is granted. The genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in Defendant’s motions are admitted.Sanctions with respect to the motion to deem requests for admissions admitted are mandatory if a party to whom the requests for admissions have been directed failed to serve a timely response to the request for admission. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant $ 621.65 in sanctions for 2 hours of attorney time at a rate of $280.00 per hour and $61.65 in filing fees.
