And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to deem their requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted. This means that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the RFAs are now considered admitted. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff, ordering the plaintiff to pay $621.65 in monetary sanctions within 30 days. The sanctions are a result of the plaintiff's failure to respond to the defendant's discovery requests, despite multiple attempts by the defendant to resolve the issue through a meet and confer letter. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2033.280, subdivision (c), which requires mandatory sanctions if a party fails to serve a timely response to a request for admission.
