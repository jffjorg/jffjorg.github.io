## English Text Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mercury Insurance Company vs. Rochelle Yarjan, granting the Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions. This means that Ms. Yarjan's Answer to the Complaint will be stricken (removed from the case) because she failed to comply with court-ordered discovery requests for over 9 months. The judge found that less severe sanctions would not have forced Ms. Yarjan to comply with the discovery rules. The lack of response to Plaintiff's discovery requests, coupled with Ms. Yarjan's failure to oppose the motions, led the judge to conclude that she is no longer interested in pursuing the case.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Mercury Insurance Company's motion for terminating sanctions against Defendant Rochelle Yarjan, effectively ending her case. The Court made this decision due to Yarjan's failure to respond to discovery requests, despite being ordered to do so on July 11 and 12, 2023. Yarjan's lack of response and failure to oppose the motion suggest that she is no longer interested in pursuing the case. The Judge found that less severe sanctions would not be effective in compelling Yarjan to comply with discovery rules, and therefore granted the motion to strike her answer. The Plaintiff's counsel is to notify the parties of this ruling.

  - "It appears Defendant is no longer interested in litigating this matter."

Summary:
The tentative ruling is for the Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions to be granted. Defendant Rochelle Yarjan's Answer is stricken, and the moving party is to give notice of this ruling. This ruling is based on the fact that Defendant has not responded to discovery requests despite being granted motions to compel Defendant's responses in July 2023. The Court may grant Plaintiff's motion to dismiss due to the delay in responding to Plaintiff's discovery requests, which were originally due in January 2023. Defendant did not respond, did not oppose the July 2023 discovery motions, and does not oppose this motion, leading to the assumption that Defendant is no longer interested in litigating this matter.
