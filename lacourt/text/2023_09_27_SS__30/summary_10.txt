```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Mercury Insurance Company, has filed a motion for terminating sanctions against the defendant, Rochelle Yarjan, seeking to strike her answer and dismiss the case. The court has granted the motion, finding that the defendant has failed to respond to discovery requests despite the court's previous orders compelling discovery. The defendant's responses were originally due in January 2023, but they have not been forthcoming, and the defendant has not opposed the motion for terminating sanctions. The court finds that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, and it appears that the defendant is no longer interested in litigating the case. As a result, the court grants the plaintiff's motion and strikes the defendant's answer.
