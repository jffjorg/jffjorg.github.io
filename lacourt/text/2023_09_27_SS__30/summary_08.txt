And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant has moved for an order compelling a second deposition of the plaintiff, and the court has granted the motion in part. The court finds good cause for a second deposition, but only for the purpose of further questioning about the additional text messages between the plaintiff and her cousins that were produced after the initial deposition. The court does not find good cause for a second deposition to question the plaintiff about video evidence or tax returns. The court also denied the defendant's requests for sanctions against the plaintiff. The court's ruling is subject to change after the hearing on September 27, 2023.
