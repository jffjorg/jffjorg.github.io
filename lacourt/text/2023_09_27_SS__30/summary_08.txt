**English Summary:**

The judge tentatively rules to grant the defendant's motion to compel a second deposition of the plaintiff in part. This means the plaintiff will be required to give a second deposition, but only to answer questions about new text messages discovered after the initial deposition. 

The judge found good cause for this limited second deposition because the plaintiff produced 60 pages of additional text messages after her initial deposition.

The defendant also wanted to question the plaintiff about video evidence and tax returns, but the judge denied these requests.  The judge found that the defendant knew or should have known about the video evidence and the tax returns prior to the initial deposition.

Finally, the judge denied both parties' requests for sanctions.

The judge orders that the defendant give notice of this ruling.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel a second deposition of the plaintiff, but only for the purpose of further questioning about text messages. The plaintiff's initial deposition occurred on June 2, 2023, and the defendant has since received additional text messages that were not available at the time of the deposition. The judge found that this new information constitutes good cause for a second deposition. However, the judge did not find good cause for a second deposition to question the plaintiff about video evidence or tax returns, as the defendant had already received relevant information about these topics prior to the initial deposition. The judge also declined to award sanctions to either party. The defendant's objections to statements in the Declaration of Waukeen McCoy were partially sustained and partially overruled. The judge ordered the defendant to give notice of this ruling.

English text:
Judge Sofia Jamora has issued a tentative ruling for case number 22STCV10458 regarding a motion to compel a second session of the plaintiff's deposition. The judge grants the motion in part and denies the request for sanctions. The second deposition will only cover further questioning about the text messages, as the defendant received additional text messages after the first deposition. However, the court does not find good cause for a second deposition for further questioning about video evidence or Plaintiffâ€™s tax returns. The judge declines to award sanctions to either party. Additionally, the court sustains one of the defendant's evidentiary objections and overrules the other.
