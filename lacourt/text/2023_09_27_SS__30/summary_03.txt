## English Summary:

In this tentative ruling, the Judge is addressing a motion filed by Counsel to be relieved from representing Levonna Lacy in a case against Long Beach Public Transportation. 

The Judge found that Counsel has a valid reason to withdraw and that they followed the proper procedures outlined in the California Rules of Court. However, because the hearing dates and other details in the case have changed since Counsel filed their initial paperwork, the Judge is continuing the hearing to allow Counsel to amend the necessary forms. 

Furthermore, the Judge is directing the Judicial Assistant to schedule a trial date in Spring 2023 and continue the hearing on Counsel's withdrawal to a date within 60 days. This will allow Counsel to properly update their forms and reflect the current status of the case before the Judge makes a final ruling on their withdrawal.
