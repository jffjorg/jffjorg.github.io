And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to continue the trial date, scheduling the trial within 180 days. The moving party is required to file a motion for summary judgment 45-60 days prior to the trial date and provide notice to the opposing side. The judge found that the moving party had not filed a summary judgment motion, nor had they shown good cause to continue the trial. However, the ongoing discovery process provided sufficient reason to continue the trial date, and the opposing side would not be prejudiced.
