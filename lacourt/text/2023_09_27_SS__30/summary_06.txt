The judge has granted the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to form interrogatories and a request for production. The plaintiff is ordered to serve responses without objections within 20 days of the notice of the ruling. The defendant had served the discovery requests on November 4, 2022, but had not received any responses from the plaintiff. The judge cited California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290(b) and 2031.300(b) in support of the ruling, which allows a party to move for an order compelling responses if the other party fails to serve a timely response. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had waived its objections to the discovery requests by failing to serve a timely response. The court declined to award sanctions as the motions were unopposed. The plaintiff is now required to provide responses to the discovery requests without objections, and the defendant will give notice of the ruling.

The Plaintiff, Chul Hee Lim, is ordered to serve responses, without objections, within 20 days of notice of ruling. The Court declines to award sanctions as the motions are unopposed. This ruling is based on the fact that the Defendant, Kung Soon Han, served Form Interrogatories and Request for Production on the Plaintiff on November 4, 2022, but has not received any responses to date. Failure to serve a timely response to discovery requests results in waiver of objections under Code Civ. Proc sections 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), and 2032.300(a).
