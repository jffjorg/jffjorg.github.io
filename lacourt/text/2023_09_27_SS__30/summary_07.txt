This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a court case. The case is titled "Marisol Serrano, et al. vs Jose Adan Alarcon Gonzalez" and has a case number of 22STCV02045. The hearing date is September 27, 2023.

The defendant, Jose Adan Alarcon Gonzalez, has filed a demurrer, which is a request to dismiss the plaintiff's claims. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred, meaning they are too old to be pursued in court. The plaintiff's deadline to file their complaint was July 16, 2021, but they did not file the complaint until January 18, 2022, which is after the two-year statute of limitations.

The court has sustained the defendant's demurrer, meaning the plaintiff's claims are dismissed. However, the court has given the plaintiff leave to amend their complaint to allege any special circumstances that may further toll the statute of limitations. The court notes that the plaintiff has conceded that Mangram, the boyfriend of Serrano, cannot recover damages as a bystander and has requested to dismiss Mangram, so this issue is moot.

The court also notes that the plaintiff's complaint has two different dates that the incident allegedly occurred, which should be corrected.

## English Text Summary:

In this tentative ruling, the Judge sustains the Defendant's demurrer, meaning the court rejects the Plaintiff's complaint, due to the Plaintiff filing it past the statute of limitations.  The statute of limitations for assault is two years, and the alleged assault occurred in July 2019. The Plaintiff filed the complaint in January 2022, exceeding the deadline. 

While a Judicial Council emergency rule temporarily paused the statute of limitations, it was not enough time to avoid the deadline. The Court allows the Plaintiff to amend their complaint within 20 days, giving them a chance to argue for tolling of the statute of limitations based on special circumstances.  The Court also notes inconsistencies in the dates provided in the complaint and asks the Plaintiff to correct them.

English text:
This tentative ruling is for Case Number 22STCV02045, with a hearing date of September 27, 2023, in Dept 30. The Judge has reviewed the information presented and has made a decision based on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Jose Adan Alarcon Gonzalez, against the plaintiff, Marisol Serrano and et al.

The Judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained with leave to amend within 20 days of notice of ruling. The Judge's discussion includes the statute of limitations and bystander damages.

Regarding the statute of limitations, the Judge states that pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1, an action for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the death of, an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another must be filed within two years. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendant struck Serrano on July 16, 2019, and the deadline to file the complaint was July 16, 2021. However, the complaint was filed on January 18, 2022, which falls after two years from the date of the alleged injury. The Judge notes that the Judicial Council issued Emergency Rule 9 on April 6, 2020, which allowed the time to file the complaint to be tolled from April 6, 2020, until October 1, 2020 (179 days). However, the complaint was filed beyond two years and 179 days, approximately a week.

Regarding bystander damages, the defendant argues that Mangram cannot recover damages because he is the boyfriend of Serrano and cannot recover as a bystander. The plaintiff has requested to dismiss Mangram, making this issue moot.

The Judge will grant leave to amend and allow the plaintiff to amend to allege any tolling that will be necessary to make this action viable. The Judge notes that the complaint has two different dates that the plaintiff alleges that the incident occurred, and this should be corrected as well.
