And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a court case. The case is titled "Marisol Serrano, et al. vs Jose Adan Alarcon Gonzalez" and has a case number of 22STCV02045. The hearing date is September 27, 2023.

The defendant, Jose Adan Alarcon Gonzalez, has filed a demurrer, which is a request to dismiss the plaintiff's claims. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred, meaning they are too old to be pursued in court. The plaintiff's deadline to file their complaint was July 16, 2021, but they did not file the complaint until January 18, 2022, which is after the two-year statute of limitations.

The court has sustained the defendant's demurrer, meaning the plaintiff's claims are dismissed. However, the court has given the plaintiff leave to amend their complaint to allege any special circumstances that may further toll the statute of limitations. The court notes that the plaintiff has conceded that Mangram, the boyfriend of Serrano, cannot recover damages as a bystander and has requested to dismiss Mangram, so this issue is moot.

The court also notes that the plaintiff's complaint has two different dates that the incident allegedly occurred, which should be corrected.
