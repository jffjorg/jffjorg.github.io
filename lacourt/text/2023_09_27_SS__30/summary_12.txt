The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to dismiss the action, which was filed by Kafi Swaniker et al against Tracy R Childs M D et al. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to bring the matter to trial within the five-year deadline, which was July 23, 2023. However, the court found that the deadline was extended for six months to January 23, 2024, due to Emergency Rule 10. As a result, the five-year deadline has not passed, and the plaintiff's action is not dismissed.
