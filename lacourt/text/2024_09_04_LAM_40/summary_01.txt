And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint and the motion to strike portions of the complaint. The case involves claims of civil extortion, tortious violation of business and professions code section 6043.5(b), fraud, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, gross negligence, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, intentional interference with contract, and violations of the unfair business practices act. The defendants demurred to the second through tenth causes of action and moved to strike certain portions of the complaint.

The judge notes that the defendants have met the meet and confer requirement, but that the plaintiff did not serve his opposition until the day before the hearing, and that the opposition should have been served nine court days before the hearing. The judge also notes that the plaintiff did not submit separate oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike, but will hear the motions on their merits.

The judge continues the hearing to October 4, 2024, to permit further briefing by the parties on the effect of Business and Professions Code section 6094, subdivision (a), which provides that communications to the State Bar relating to lawyer misconduct or disability or competence are privileged.
