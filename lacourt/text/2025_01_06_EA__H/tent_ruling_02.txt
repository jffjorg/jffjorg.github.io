PHH Mortgage Corporation, et al., Case No. 24PSCV00578   ORDER ON MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL Counsel for Plaintiff Gregory Fess as  Administrator of the Estate of Barbara Fess’ (i.e., CDLG, PC) Motion  to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, effective upon the filing of a proof of  service showing service of the final  order upon the Client at the Client’s last known address.  The Court will set an Order to Show Cause Re:  Representation of Administrator for February 18, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. and will  continue the Case Management Conference to this same date.   Background Plaintiff  Gregory Fess as Administrator of the  Estate of Barbara Fess (“Plaintiff”) alleges  as follows:           Plaintiff is the owner of the property  located at 226 Shay Avenue in  La Puente (the “subject property”). The subject property is Plaintiff’s  personal residence. Plaintiff obtained a mortgage loan on the subject property  from Financial Freedom Senior Funding Corporation (“Financial Freedom”), which  was memorialized by a deed of trust recorded on September 5, 2006. On October  1, 2009, a “Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust” was recorded, in which Financial  Freedom transferred its rights to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems,  Inc. (“MERS”), as nominee for Financial Freedom. On September 22, 2015, an  “Assignment of Deed of Trust” was recorded, in which MERS transferred its  rights to CIT Bank, N.A. (“CIT”).           On September 26, 2019, an “Assignment  of Deed of Trust” was recorded, in which CIT transferred its rights to Bank of  New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as Trustee for Mortgage Assets Management  Series I Trust (“Bank of New York”). On November 15, 2021, a “Notice of Default  and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust” was recorded. On October 24, 2023, a  “Notice of Trustee’s Sale” was recorded. On December 2, 2023, another “Notice of  Trustee’s Sale” was recorded, which showed the beneficiary as U.S. Bank,  Successor to Lasalle Bank National Association As Indenture Trustee Under The  Transfer and Administration Agreement Dated February 7, 2007 for the Mortgage  Equity Conversion Asset Trust 2007-FF3  (“U.S. Bank”). On December 28, 2023, an “Assignment of Deed of Trust” was  recorded, in which Bank of New York transferred its rights to U.S. Bank. The  subject property was sold on January 4, 2024. The Notice of Default and Notice  of Trustee’s Sale are void as the beneficiary was not the entity that did the  foreclosure.  On  February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action  against PHH Mortgage Corporation (“PHH”), Bank of New York, and Does 1-10 for: (1) violation of Civ. Code § 2923.5, (2) violation of Civ. Code § 2924.9; (3) wrongful  Foreclosure; (4) unfair business practices, in violation of Bus. & Prof.  Code § 17200, et seq. and (5) cancellation of written instruments, Civ. Code §  3412.  Pending  before the Court is CDLG, PC’s motion to be relieved as counsel of record for  Plaintiff.   Discussion CDLG, PC (the “Firm”) seeks to be  relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff (the “Client”).  The  Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should  be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not  disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d  398.)  California  Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion directed  to the client (made on the Notice of  Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a  declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the  confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of  Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section  284(1) (made on the Declaration in  Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form  (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and  the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in  the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be  Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective  date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the  signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules Court,  rule 3.1362(e).)  Attorney Tony Cara (“Cara”) attests  that the “[a]ttorney client relationship has been compromised and a withdrawal  of representation is necessary. . .” Cara states that he served the Client by  mail at the Client’s last known address with copies of the motion papers served  with his declaration and that he has confirmed within the past 30 days that the  address is current, by mail, return receipt requested.  The
motion is not opposed. The Court determines that the requirements of Rules of Court
Rule 3.1362 enumerated above have been sufficiently met.  Accordingly,  the motion is granted, effective upon the filing of a proof of service showing serving of the final order upon the Client at the Client’s last known address.  The  Court notes that Plaintiff has sued in his capacity as administrator of the Estate  of Barbara Fess[FN];  accordingly, the Court will set an Order to Show Cause Re: Representation  of Administrator for February 18, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. The Court continues the  Case Management Conference to this same date and time (February 18, 2025, at 8:30  a.m.)
