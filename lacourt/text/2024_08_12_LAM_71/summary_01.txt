Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained Cross-Defendant's demurrer to Cross-Complainant's first and second causes of action with 20 days leave to amend. Cross-Complainant's first cause of action alleges breach of contract, and the court has ruled that Cross-Complainant fails to allege bargained-for consideration in exchange for Cross-Defendant's promise to pay Cross-Complainant's and her children's monthly expenses. The court has also ruled that Cross-Complainant's argument regarding the statute of frauds is unavailing because the oral agreement does not allege the agreement was for a lifetime.

Cross-Complainant's second cause of action alleges breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and the court has ruled that Cross-Complainant fails to allege the existence of some specific contractual obligation that frustrated Cross-Complainant's right to the benefits of the contract. The court has also ruled that Cross-Complainant's cause of action merely restates her breach of contract claim.
