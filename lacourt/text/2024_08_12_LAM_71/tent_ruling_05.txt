 Hearing Date:  July 31, 2024



 
Defendants
Fruit Street Health, P.B.C.’s, Laurence Girard’s, and Christopher Meatto’s demurrer
to Plaintiff Amr Beltagui, M.D.’s, 6th and 7th causes of action in his Complaint
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.  Defendants’ demurrer is overruled as to the
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action.
 
          Defendants Fruit
Street Health, P.B.C. (“FSH”), Laurence Girard (“Girard”), and Christopher
Meatto (“Meatto”) (collectively, “Defendants”) demur to Plaintiff Amr Beltagui,
M.D.’s (“Beltagui”) (“Plaintiff”) complaint (“Complaint”) on the grounds the 1st,
2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th causes of action do not state facts sufficient
to constitute causes of action.  (Notice
of Demurrer, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§430.10(e), (f), (g).)
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who
filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the
objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41, emphasis added.) 
Defendants’ counsel failed to
submit a meet and confer declaration with the instant demurrer in violation of C.C.P.
§430.41.  However, failure to
sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4); Dumas v. Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355; Olson v.
Hornbrook Community Services District (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 502, 515.)  Accordingly, the Court will consider
Defendants’ demurrer.
 
          Background
          Plaintiff
filed the operative Complaint on December 12, 2023, against Defendants alleging
seven causes of action: (1) sale of unqualified security; (2) operating an unlicensed
broker-dealer; (3) recission/damages pursuant to Corp. Code §25401; (4) breach
of fiduciary duty; (5) constructive fraud; (6) negligence; and (7) damages
pursuant to Penal Code §496.  Plaintiff’s
causes of action arise from Plaintiff’s alleged purchase of FSH stock and
options, which Plaintiff alleges were not registered or qualified securities
for sale.  (See Complaint ¶¶7-13.)
          Defendants
filed the instant demurrer on May 10, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed his opposition on July 17, 2024.  Defendants filed their reply on July 24,
2024.
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Defendants demur
to all seven causes of action alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint on the basis
each cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of
action and is uncertain.  (Demurrer, pgs.
3-5.)  Defendants also demur to the 6th
cause of action on the basis it is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  (Demurrer, pg. 4.)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Sale of Unqualified Security (Corp. Code
§§25110, 25120, 25130) (1st COA)
Corporations Code
§25110 provides:
It is unlawful for any person to offer or sell
in this state any security in an issuer transaction (other than in a
transaction subject to Section 25120), whether or not by or through
underwriters, unless such sale has been qualified under Section 25111, 25112 or
25113 (and no order under Section 25140 or subdivision (a) of Section 25143 is
in effect with respect to such qualification) or unless such security or
transaction is exempted or not subject to qualification under Chapter 1
(commencing with Section 25100) of this part. The offer or sale of such a
security in a manner that varies or differs from, exceeds the scope of, or
fails to conform with either a material term or material condition of
qualification of the offering as set forth in the permit or qualification
order, or a material representation as to the manner of offering which is set
forth in the application for qualification, shall be an unqualified offer or
sale.
 
(Corp. Code
§25110.)
Corporations Code
§25120 provides:
(a)  Except as provided
in subdivision (b), it is unlawful for any person to offer or sell in this
state any security in any of the following manners:
(1)    
In an issuer transaction in connection with any change in the
rights, preferences, privileges, or restrictions of or on outstanding
securities.
(2)    
In any exchange of securities by the issuer with its existing
security holders exclusively.
(3)    
In any exchange in connection with any merger or consolidation or
purchase of assets in consideration wholly or in part of the issuance of
securities.
(4)    
In an entity conversion transaction.
(b)  Subdivision (a)
shall not apply to a security if the security is qualified for sale under this
chapter (and no order under Section 25140 or subdivision (a) of Section 25143
is in effect with respect to the qualification) or if the security or
transaction is exempted or not subject to qualification under Chapter 1
(commencing with Section 25100) of this part.
 
(Corp. Code §25120.)
Corporations Code
§25130 provides:
It is unlawful for any person to offer or sell
any security in this state in any nonissuer transaction unless it is qualified
for such sale under this chapter or under Section 25111 or 25113 of Chapter 2
(commencing with Section 25110) of this part (and no order under Section 25140
or subdivision (a) of Section 25143 is in effect with respect to such
qualification) or unless such security or transaction is exempted or not
subject to qualification under Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 25100) of
this part. 
 
(Corp. Code
§25130.)
Plaintiff alleges
that in February of 2019, he started receiving unsolicited emails from Girard soliciting
a purchase of FSH stock.  (Complaint ¶7.)
 Plaintiff alleges he replied in October
of 2021 and spoke with Girard by phone.  (Complaint ¶7.)  Plaintiff alleges Girard explained that FSH
was a leading telemedicine company delivering a diabetes prevention program via
telehealth and live video chat with registered dietitians. (Complaint ¶7.)  
Plaintiff alleges
Girard went over FSH’s income and projections.  (Complaint ¶8.)  Plaintiff alleges Girard asserted that their projections
indicated that FSH would generate over $10 million in revenue in 2022.  (Complaint ¶8.)  Plaintiff alleges Girard told him that his
investment would double, triple, or more within the next few years.  (Complaint ¶8.)  
Plaintiff alleges
Girard wanted Plaintiff to meet FSH’s team which included Meatto, its Chief Financial
Officer, who was also represented to be an attorney.  (Complaint ¶9.)  Plaintiff alleges Meatto, in a telephone call
in late October - early November, 2021, told Plaintiff that he had full trust
in Girard and no doubt that his investment would double, triple, or more within
the next few years.  (Complaint ¶9.)  
Plaintiff alleges
that based on those and other representations, in November, 2021, he invested $400,000
in FSH.  (Complaint ¶10.)  Plaintiff alleges in return for his
investment, he received 450,000 shares of stock and 450,000 options.  (Complaint ¶10.)  
Plaintiff alleges
the securities were not registered or qualified for sale by the Securities and Exchange
Commission or the California Department of Business Oversight.  (Complaint ¶11.)  Plaintiff alleges Girard and FSH represented
that the securities were exempt from registration, and they were not.  (Complaint ¶11.)  
Plaintiff alleges
Girard solicited another purchase by telephone in February of 2023.  (Complaint ¶12.)  Plaintiff alleges in return for another
investment of $75,000, Plaintiff received another 150,000 shares of stock and
150,000 options. (Complaint ¶12.)  Plaintiff alleges like the 2021 purchase,
these securities were not registered or qualified for sale.  (Complaint ¶12.)  Plaintiff alleges these securities were also
falsely represented by Girard to meet an exemption from registration/qualification.  (Complaint ¶12.)  
Plaintiff alleges
during the entire time he was a shareholder, there was never a shareholder meeting
or a report to the shareholders. 
(Complaint ¶13.)  
Plaintiff alleges
that within the last 5 years, Defendants sold securities to him without having qualified
the offering pursuant to Corporations Code §§25110, 25120, and 25130.  (Complaint ¶15.)  
Plaintiff alleges
pursuant to Corporations Code §§25110, 25120, and 25130, FSH, Meatto, and Girard
are liable for the sale of said securities via §25503.  (Complaint ¶16.)  Plaintiff alleges pursuant to Corporations
Code §25504, all Defendants are liable to the same extent as FSH, Meatto, and
Girard, as they directly or indirectly controlled a person liable under §25503,
and/or as a principal executive officer or director of a corporation so liable,
and/or as a person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions,
and/or as an employee of a person so liable who materially aided in the act or
transactions constituting the violation, and/or as a broker-dealer or agent who
materially aided in the act or transaction constituting the violation.  (Complaint ¶17.)  
Plaintiff alleges
as a proximate result of Defendants’ actions, he has sustained direct, indirect,
consequential and incidental compensatory damages in the sum of $475,000 plus prejudgment
interest and attorneys’ fees as set forth in Corporations Code §25501.  (Complaint ¶18.)
Plaintiff
sufficiently alleges Defendants violated Corporations Code §§25110, 25120,
25130.  (Aubry, 2 Cal.4th at pg. 967 [“For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.”].)  The burden is on Defendants to demonstrate
the securities alleged are not exempt from §§25110, 25120, and 25130 per
Corporation Code §25100, and proof of an exemption would not be appropriate on
a demurrer, as such proof would require extrinsic evidence that is not
judicially noticeable by this Court. 
(Corp. Code §25100; see Corp. Code §25163 [“In any
proceeding under this law, the burden of proving an exemption or an
exception from a definition is upon the person claiming it.”].)
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action is overruled.
 
Operating an Unlicensed Broker-Dealer (Corp.
Code §§25210, 25501.5) (2nd COA)
Corporations Code
§25210 provides:
(a)  
Unless exempted under the provisions of Chapter 1 (commencing with
Section 25200) of this part, no broker-dealer shall effect any transaction in,
or induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this
state unless the broker-dealer has first applied for and secured from the
commissioner a certificate, then in effect, authorizing that person to act in
that capacity.
 
(b)  
No person shall, on behalf of a broker-dealer licensed pursuant to
Section 25211, or on behalf of an issuer, effect any transaction in, or induce
or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security in this state unless
that broker-dealer and agent have complied with any rules as the commissioner
may adopt for the qualification and employment of those agents.
 
(c)  
The commissioner shall, consistent with Section 25213, review the
disciplinary histories of agents upon the filing of notice of (1) the
employment or transfer of an agent for a broker-dealer, (2) an amendment to the
information filed by the agent at the time of employment or transfer, and (3)
the termination of employment of the agent from the broker-dealer.
 
(Corp. Code
§25210.)
Corporations Code
§25501.5 provides:
(a)  
(1) A person who purchases a security from or sells a security to
a broker-dealer that is required to be licensed and has not, at the time of the
sale or purchase, applied for and secured from the commissioner a certificate
under Part 3 (commencing with Section 25200), that is in effect at the time of
the sale or purchase authorizing that broker-dealer to act in that capacity,
may bring an action for rescission of the sale or purchase or, if the plaintiff
or the defendant no longer owns the security, for damages.
 
(2) Upon rescission and tender of the security, a purchaser may
recover the consideration paid for the security plus interest at the legal
rate, less the amount of any income received on the security.
 
(3) Upon rescission and tender of the consideration paid for the
security plus interest at the legal rate, a seller may recover the security
plus the amount of any income received by the defendant on the security.
 
(4) Damages recoverable under this section by a purchaser shall be
an amount equal to the difference between the following:
 
(A)   
The price at which the security was bought plus interest at the
legal rate from the date of purchase.
(B)   
The value of the security at the time it was disposed of by the
plaintiff plus the amount of any income received on the security by the
plaintiff.
 
(5) Damages recoverable under this section by a seller shall be an
amount equal to the difference between the following:
 
(A)   
The value of the security at the time of the filing of the
complaint plus the amount of any income received by the defendant on the
security.
(B)   
The price at which the security was sold plus interest at the
legal rate from the date of sale.
 
(6) A tender of a security or of consideration paid for a security
plus interest pursuant to this section may be made at any time before entry of
judgment.
 
(b)  
The court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorney’s fees
and costs to a prevailing plaintiff under this section.
 
(Corp.
Code §25501.5.)
          Plaintiff alleges at the time of his
purchases of the securities described herein, Defendants were required to sell
their securities through a licensed broker dealer.  (Complaint ¶20.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants did not sell
their securities through a licensed broker dealer as FSH is not a registered
broker dealer.  (Complaint ¶20.)  
Plaintiff alleges
Defendants FSH, Meatto, and Girard sold securities to Plaintiff without having applied
for and obtained a certificate to act as a broker-dealer pursuant to
Corporations Code §25210(a) and in violation of Corporations Code §25210(b).  (Complaint ¶21.)
Plaintiff alleges
as a proximate result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff has sustained direct, indirect,
consequential, and incidental compensatory damages in the sum of $475,000.  (Complaint ¶22.)
Plaintiff
sufficiently alleges a cause of action for sale of security by an unlicensed
broker dealer.  The burden is on Defendants to demonstrate they qualify for the exemption
in Corporations Code §25210(a), and proof of an exemption would not be
appropriate on a demurrer, as such proof would require extrinsic evidence that
is not judicially noticeable by this Court. 
(See Corp. Code §25163.)
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 2nd cause of action is overruled.
 
Recission/Damages (Corp. Code §25401) (3rd COA)
Corporations Code
§25401 provides: 
It is unlawful for any person to offer or sell a
security in this state, or to buy or offer to buy a security in this state, by
means of any written or oral communication that includes an untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which the statements
were made, not misleading.
 
(Corp. Code
§25401.)
          Plaintiff alleges The Corporate
Securities Act applies whenever an offer to purchase or an offer to sell a
security is made to or from the State of California.   (Complaint ¶24.)  Plaintiff alleges §25401 prohibits the sale
of securities by means written and oral communications which included untrue
statements of a material fact and/or omitted to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. 
(Complaint ¶24.)  
Plaintiff alleges
the securities at issue were sold to Plaintiff by means of written and oral
communications which included untrue statements of a material fact and/or
omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.  (Complaint ¶25.)  
Plaintiff alleges
the material representations included that FSH was a leading telemedicine
company; that the investment would double, triple, or more within the next few years;
and that FSH’s securities were exempted from registration.  (Complaint ¶26.)
Plaintiff alleges
the material omissions included that FSH was not exempt from registration; and
FSH was not a legitimate corporation as it was not following corporate
formalities.  (Complaint ¶27.)
Plaintiff alleges
Pursuant to Corporations Code § 25504, all Defendants are liable to the same extent
as FSH, Meatto, and Girard, as they directly or indirectly controlled a person
liable under §25501 and/or as a principal executive officer or director of a
corporation so liable, and/or as a person occupying a similar status or
performing similar functions, and/or as an employee of a person so liable who
materially aided in the act or transactions constituting the violation, and/or as
a broker-dealer or agent who materially aided in the act or transaction
constituting the violation.  (Complaint
¶28.)
Plaintiff alleges
as a proximate result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff has sustained direct, indirect,
consequential, and incidental compensatory damages in the sum of $475,000 plus prejudgment
interest and attorneys’ fees as set forth in Corporations Code §25501.  (Complaint ¶29.)
Plaintiff
sufficiently alleges a cause of action in violation of Corporations Code §25401
based on the allegation that Defendants offered or sold a security in
California by means of any written or oral communication that includes an
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact.  (Complaint ¶¶26-27.)
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s 3rd cause of action is overruled.
 
Breach of
Fiduciary Duty (4th COA)
To plead a cause
of action for breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must allege facts showing
the existence of a fiduciary duty owed to that plaintiff, a breach of that duty,
and resulting damage.  (Pellegrini v.
Weiss (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 515, 524.)
Plaintiff alleges
that at all times, Defendants, as corporate insiders and a corporation seeking investment
monies from Plaintiff, owed plaintiff the fiduciary duty to be truthful and
disclose all facts that would be material to Plaintiff as well as to act in his
best interest.  (Complaint ¶31.)
Plaintiff alleges
Defendants breached that fiduciary duty by, among other things, selling
Plaintiff securities that were not registered or otherwise qualified for sale
and misrepresenting the securities by claiming that they are exempt from
registration.  (Complaint ¶32.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendants also
misrepresented the prospects of earning a profit by investing in FSH.  (Complaint ¶32.)
Plaintiff alleges
as a result of Defendants’ acts, errors, and omissions set forth above,
Plaintiff has suffered detriment in that he is deprived of a large portion of
his life savings, by reason of which Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount
believed to be at least in the sum of $475,000. 
(Complaint ¶33.)
Plaintiff
sufficiently alleges Defendants owed Plaintiff, a shareholder, a fiduciary duty
as a corporate insider.  (Complaint ¶31; Cleveland
v. Johnson (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1339 [“[T]he relationship ‘between
a corporate insider and the stockholders of his corporation gives rise to a
disclosure obligation’ and ‘[a fiduciary] duty arose from (i) the existence of
a relationship affording access to inside information intended to be available
only for a corporate purpose, and (ii) the unfairness of allowing a corporate
insider to take advantage of that information by trading without disclosure.’”]
quoting Eisenbaum v. Western Energy Resources, Inc. (1990) 218
Cal.App.3d 314, 324.)  Plaintiff
sufficiently alleges breach of that duty and damages.
          Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiff’s 4th cause of action is overruled.
 
          Constructive Fraud (5th COA)
The elements for
constructive fraud are (1) a fiduciary duty or confidential relationship; (2)
breach of fiduciary duty; (3) intent to deceive and (4) reliance and resulting
injury.  (See, e.g., Younan
v. Equifax Inc. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 498, 516; see also Prakashpalan v.
Engostrom, Lipscomb & Lack (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1131.)
“The failure of
the fiduciary to disclose a material fact to his principal which might affect
the fiduciary’s motives or the principal’s decision, which is known (or should
be known) to the fiduciary, may constitute constructive fraud.  Also, a careless misstatement may constitute
constructive fraud even though there is no fraudulent intent.”  (Assilzadeh v. California Federal Bank
(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 399, 415.)
Plaintiff alleges
by reason of the fiduciary duty owed by Defendants to Plaintiff as set forth
above, each of the Defendants owed to Plaintiff the concomitant duty not to
sell him unregistered securities that did not meet an exemption as well as a
duty to inform Plaintiff that the securities they were selling to him were not
registered and did not meet an exemption. 
(Complaint ¶36.)  Plaintiff
alleges Defendants also had the duty to be truthful in their dealings with
Plaintiff and to disclose all material facts. 
(Complaint ¶36.)  
Plaintiff alleges
he justifiably relied on Defendants’ failures to inform him that the unregistered
securities did not meet an exemption and that the future prospects of FHS were
not as disclosed.  (Complaint ¶37.)  
Plaintiff alleges
as a result of Defendants’ acts, errors, and omissions set forth above,
Plaintiff has suffered detriment in that he permitted Defendants to engage in
highly unprofitable trading in his account, by reason of which Plaintiff has
been damaged in an amount not fully computed as yet but believed to be at least
in the sum of $475,000.  (Complaint ¶38.)
Plaintiff
sufficiently alleges a cause of action for constructive fraud.  Plaintiff alleges a fiduciary duty owed by
Defendants (Complaint ¶31), breach of duty (Complaint ¶32), and reliance and
injury (¶¶37-38).
Accordingly, Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 5th cause of action is overruled.
 
Negligence (6th
COA)
“The elements of
a cause of action for negligence are well established. They are (a) a legal
duty to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c) the breach as
the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.”  (Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12
Cal.4th 913, 917, internal quotations omitted.)
Plaintiff alleges
at all times described herein, each of the Defendants owed Plaintiff a duty of
care to conduct themselves as would a reasonable issuer of securities and of
persons selling securities.  (Complaint
¶41.)
Plaintiff alleges
each of the Defendants breached that duty of care by not ensuring that the securities
they were selling were registered or met an exemption and not adequately
disclosing the risks and prospects of Plaintiff making a profit on the
securities they sold him.  (Complaint
¶42.)
Plaintiff alleges
as a result of Defendants’ acts, errors, and omissions set forth above,
Plaintiff has suffered detriment in that he gave Defendants the majority of his
life savings, by reason of which Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount
believed to be at least in the sum of $475,000. 
(Complaint ¶43.)
Defendant’s
argument that the cause of action is subject to the two-year statute of
limitations in C.C.P. §335.1 is unavailing. 
C.C.P. §335.1 applies to negligence causes of action resulting in a
personal injury or death.  Here, the
applicable statute of limitations is two years set forth in C.C.P. §339 because
Plaintiff’s cause of action arises from an obligation or liability not founded
upon an instrument of writing. 
Therefore, allegations in Plaintiff’s cause of action for negligence are
barred by the two-year statute of limitations and allegations of negligence
occurring in November 2021 are therefore barred because Plaintiff filed his
Complaint on December 12, 2023.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 6th cause of action is sustained with
20 days leave to amend.
 
          Damages Pursuant to Penal Code §496
(7th COA)
Penal
Code §496 provides that “any person who has been injured by a violation of
subdivision (a) or (b) may bring an action for three times the amount of actual
damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable
attorney’s fees.”  (Pen. Code §496(c).)
“While
[Penal Code §496(a)] covers a spectrum of impermissible activity relating to
stolen property, the elements required to show a violation of section 496(a)
are simply that (i) property was stolen or obtained in a manner constituting
theft, (ii) the defendant knew the property was so stolen or obtained, and
(iii) the defendant received or had possession of the stolen property.”  (Switzer v. Wood (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 116, 126, as modified (May
10, 2019), quoting Lacagnina v. Comprehend Systems, Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 955, 970 [stating elements
of Penal Code §496 offense].)
“A
violation of section 496(a) may, by its own terms, relate to property that has
been ‘stolen’ or ‘that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or
extortion.’”  (Id.,
quoting Pen. Code §496(a).)
          Plaintiff alleges Defendants, and each
of them, violated Penal Code §496 by receiving from Plaintiff property, in the
form of money, which they knew had been obtained by fraudulent and dishonest
means, i.e., misrepresentation of the nature and risks of the investments
offered.  (Complaint ¶45.)
          Plaintiff alleges by reason of the
foregoing, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $475,000, or according
to proof, and are entitled to the relief described in the statute, including but
not limited to treble damages, attorneys fees, and interest.  (Complaint ¶46.)
          Plaintiff fails to allege Defendants
received Plaintiff’s $475,000 was “stolen” or “[was] obtained in
any manner constituting theft or extortion.” 
(Pen. Code §496(a).)  Plaintiff
merely alleges Defendants received Plaintiff’s money via fraudulent and
dishonest means.  (Complaint ¶46.)
          Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiff’s 7th cause of action is sustained with
20 days leave to amend.
 
          Conclusion
Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 6th and 7th causes of action are sustained with
20 days leave to amend, and overruled as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th
causes of action.
