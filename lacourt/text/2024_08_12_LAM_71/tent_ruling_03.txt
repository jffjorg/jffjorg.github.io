Background
On August 22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their operative complaint
(“Complaint”) against Defendants alleging fourteen causes of action: (1) breach
of contract (Fairfax Agreements); (2) breach of covenant of good faith and fair
dealing (Amended Fairfax Agreement); (3) breach of contract (WeHo Agreement);
(4) breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing (WeHo Agreement); (5)
common count- open book account; (6) common count- account stated; (7) fraud-
intentional misrepresentation; (8) fraud- concealment; (9) fraud- promise
without intent to perform; (10) conversion; (11) accounting; (12) breach of
fiduciary duty; (13) declaratory and injunctive relief; (14) violations of
Penal Code §496.  Defendants filed the
instant motion on March 29, 2024.  As of
the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Motion to Compel Arbitration
A.  Arbitration Agreement
1.    
The Arbitration
Agreements are enforceable
Federal
law provides for enforcement of these Arbitration Agreements. The Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq. (“FAA”), establishes a strong
federal policy in favor of arbitration of disputes where a written arbitration
agreement exists. Section 2 of the FAA provides, in pertinent part that “[a]
written provision . . . to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter
arising out of such contract . . .  shall
be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.”  (9 U.S.C. §2.) 
The purpose of the FAA is to “reverse the longstanding judicial
hostility to arbitration agreements.” (Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane
Corp. (1991) 500 U.S. 20, 24.)  The
FAA places arbitration agreements “on an equal footing with other contracts and
[requires courts] to enforce them according to their terms.”  (AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion (2011)
563 U.S. 333, 339; see also Rent-A-Center West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010)
561 U.S. 63, 67 [“The FAA reflects the fundamental principle that arbitration
is a matter of contract.”].)  The FAA
will preempt not only a state law that “discriminat[es] on its face against
arbitration,” but also a state law that “covertly accomplishes the same
objective by disfavoring contracts that (oh so coincidentally) have the
defining features of arbitration agreements.”  (Kindred Nursing Centers Limited
Partnership v. Clark (2017) 137 S.Ct. 1421, 1426.)
The
FAA restricts a court’s inquiry related to compelling arbitration to two
threshold questions: (1) whether there was an agreement to arbitrate between
the parties; and (2) whether the agreement covers the dispute.  (Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (2002)
537 U.S. 79, 84.)  Here, both criteria
are satisfied. First, Plaintiffs agreed to arbitration when they entered into
the Phantom Membership Unit Grants that contained the relevant arbitration
clauses.  (Complaint, Exhs. A, B, C.)  Second, the Arbitration Agreements expressly cover “[a]ny dispute, controversy,
or claim arising out of, in connection with, or relating to the Phantom Units
or the performance of these [Terms and Conditions] or its termination” between Fairfax
LLC, WeHo LLC, Kim, and Chae in his capacity as manager.  (Complaint, Exhs. A, B, C at ¶¶5.)  
California
law also favors arbitration for dispute resolution. The California Arbitration
Act (“CAA”), codified at C.C.P. §1281 et seq., provides, “A written
agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy
thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such
grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.”  (C.C.P. §1281; see also Grafton Partners
L.P. v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 955 [“[U]nlike predispute
jury waivers, predispute arbitration agreements are specifically authorized by
statute.”].)  
“California
law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.”  (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97, 99.)  The public policy in favor of arbitration is
so strong that California courts have held that an employee is “bound by the
provisions of the [arbitration] agreement regardless of whether [he] read it or
[was] aware of the arbitration clause when [he] signed the document.”  (Brookwood v. Bank of America (1996)
45 Cal.App.4th 1667, citing Macaulay v. Norlander (1992) 12 Cal.App.4th
1.)  The only prerequisite for a court to
order arbitration is a determination that the parties have entered into an
agreement to arbitrate the dispute.  (United
Transportation Union v. Southern California Rapid Transit District (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 804, 808.)  Thus, arbitration
must be ordered “unless the agreement clearly does not apply to the dispute in
question.”  (Vianna v. Doctors’
Management Co. (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1189.)
Defendants
proved the existence of an arbitration agreement with Plaintiffs.  Defendants submitted evidence that on or
about May 21, 2021, Plaintiffs executed the Fairfax Agreement with Defendants; on
or about December 14, 2021, Plaintiffs executed the Amended Fairfax Agreement
with Defendants; and on or about December 14, 2021, Plaintiffs executed the
WeHo Agreement with Defendants.  (Complaint
¶¶25, 29, 32, Exhs. A-C.)  
Based
on the foregoing, Defendants proved the existence of a valid Arbitration
Agreement that is enforceable by Defendants. 
 
2.    
Covered Claims
The
Arbitration agreements state that they apply to“[a]ny dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, in
connection with, or relating to the Phantom Units or the performance of these
[Terms and Conditions] or its termination.” 
(Complaint, Exhs. A-C, ¶¶5.)  Plaintiffs’ claims arise out of the $140,000
that Plaintiffs allegedly gave Defendants pursuant to the Phantom Membership
Unit Grant Agreements.  (See Complaint ¶¶56,
64a.)  Based on the foregoing, Defendants
met their burden of establishing the Arbitration Agreements cover the causes of
action asserted in Plaintiffs’ Complaint.
 
C.   
Stay of Current
Action
Pursuant
to C.C.P. §1281.4, if an application has been made to a court involving order
to arbitrate a controversy and such application is undetermined, the court
where the application is pending shall, upon motion of a party to the action,
stay the action until the application for an order to arbitrate is determined.  (C.C.P. §1281.4.)
Accordingly,
this case is stayed pending arbitration.
 
D.  
Conclusion
Defendants’
motion to compel arbitration is granted. 

The case is
stayed pending arbitration. The Court sets a non-appearance case review for August
12, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.  The parties are
directed to submit a joint statement five calendar days in advance, apprising
the Court of the status of the arbitration.
Moving Party to
