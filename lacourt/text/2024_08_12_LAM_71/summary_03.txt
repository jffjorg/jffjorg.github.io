And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' unopposed motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiffs' claims. The arbitration agreements between the parties are enforceable under both federal and California law. The plaintiffs executed the arbitration agreements when they entered into the Phantom Membership Unit Grants with the defendants. The arbitration agreements cover all claims asserted by the plaintiffs in their complaint, including breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and conversion. The case is stayed pending arbitration, and the parties are directed to submit a joint statement five days in advance of the next case review date to update the court on the status of the arbitration.
