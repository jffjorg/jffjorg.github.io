Background
On April 13, 2022,
Hector Castillo (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Kaifa Best
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10, asserting causes of action for negligence,
negligence per se, and statutory liability arising out of a motor vehicle
accident occurring on April 13, 2020. On January 8, 2024, Defendant filed an answer
to the complaint.
 
On January 5, 2024, Defendant
propounded written discovery on Plaintiff, including Form Interrogatories (Set
One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One).
(Prager Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.) 
Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id.,
¶ 5.)
 
On April 4, 2024, Defendant filed these
three motions to compel. Defendant also seeks sanctions.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion],
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Discussion
 
Defendant served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for
Production (Set One) on January 5, 2024. (Prager Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff has not served responses.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
Defendant
need not show anything more.  The motions
to compel are granted.
 
The
requests for sanctions are denied.  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 does not provide an independent basis to award sanctions; to the
contrary, that statute states that the sanctions award must be “authorized by
the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of
this title.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.)
The statutory provisions governing
motions to compel initial responses authorize sanctions against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion].” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (c) & 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
Here, Plaintiff did not file an opposition.
