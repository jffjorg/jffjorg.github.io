And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The court will consider the following issues: (1) whether it is necessary for the judgment creditor to intervene; (2) if intervention is necessary, whether the motion to intervene is unopposed; (3) whether the settlement agreement is enforceable; and (4) whether the court should exercise its discretion to allow the judgment creditor to obtain proceeds subject to a more senior lien.

The court notes that the judgment creditor, Swift Financial, LLC, has a money judgment against the judgment debtor and is seeking to intervene in the case. The court will consider whether the judgment creditor has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation and whether the proposed intervenor's interests will be affected by the judgment.

The court will also consider whether the settlement agreement is enforceable, particularly in light of Code of Civil Procedure section 708.440, which provides that the parties to the litigation cannot enter into a settlement agreement without the written consent of the judgment creditor or authorization by order of the court.

The court will hear from counsel on these issues.
