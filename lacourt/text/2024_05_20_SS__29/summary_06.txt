And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The plaintiff failed to respond to the written discovery served on January 5, 2024. The defendant filed the motions to compel on April 4, 2024. The court finds that the plaintiff has waived all objections and that the defendant is entitled to the relief sought. The court grants the motions to compel and orders the plaintiff to serve verified, written, and code-compliant responses to the defendant's requests within 21 days of notice. The court also denies the defendant's request for sanctions.
