  Case Number:  19STCV34970    Hearing Date:   May 20, 2024    Dept:  29 Petition to
Approve Minor’s Compromise as to Claimant Heidy Medina (Age 15)
 
Tentative: 
 
The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.  
 
The Court has reviewed the petition
filed on April 23, 2024. There are a number of issues that must be addressed before
the Court can approve the petition:
 
(1)  Item
13b.  Counsel lists $435 for “Filing Fee
for Petition for Approval of Compromise.” 
This does not appear to be described accurately; it may be the filing
fee for the complaint in this action.
(2)  Items
12a(1), 12a(4), 12b(1), and 14b(1) all list $1005 in medical fees, but
Attachment 14 shows only $805 in medical fees.
(3)  Item
18b(6) is checked, but Attachment 18b(6) does not provide name and address of
proposed custodian.
(4)  No proposed
order was submitted.
 
As such,
the Hearing for Petition for Approval of Minor’s Compromise is CONTINUED so that
Petitioner can address these issues and file a proposed order.
