 Case Number:  21STCV34650    Hearing Date:   May 20, 2024    Dept:  29 Cross-Complainant’s Motion
to Compel Deposition of Prudent Security Solutions, Inc.
Tentative
The Court
will hear from counsel.
Background
This
case arises out of an alleged slip and fall incident in a Sprouts market on
North Western Avenue in San Pedro on October 11, 2019.
On
September 20, 2021, Edith Reynolds (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against SF
Markets, LLC; Sprouts Farmers Market; Sprouts Farmers Market dba Sprouts; and
Does 1 to 25, asserting causes of action for negligence and premises liability.
On
September 30, 2021, Plaintiff amended her complaint to name Sprouts Farmers
Market, Inc. as Doe 1. (Plaintiff named additional defendants on November 5,
2021, and subsequently filed a request to dismiss those defendants on May 23,
2022.)
On
December 3, 2021, Defendant SF Markets, LLC (“SF”) filed an answer.
On
October 12 and 14, 2022, Plaintiff amended her complaint to name Single Source
Security, Inc. dba Protos Security as Doe 1 and Single Source Security, LLC as
Doe 2.
On
February 28, 2023, Single Source Security, LLC filed an answer to the complaint
and a cross-complaint against Prudent Security Solutions, Inc. (“Prudent”) and
Does 1 through 500.
On March
1, 2023, Plaintiff amended her complaint to name Prudent as Doe 3.
On May
10, 2023, SF filed a cross-complaint against Single Source Security, LLC dba
Protos Security and Roes 1 through 50.  On the same day, SF amended
the cross-complaint to name Prudent as Roe 1.
On July
20 and 21, 2023, Prudent filed an answer to the complaint and a cross-complaint
against SF; First Washington Realty, Inc. (“First Washington”); GRI Park Plaza,
LLC (“GRI”); Sprouts Farmers Market; Sprouts Farmers Market dba Sprouts; and
Moes 1 through 30.
On
August 1, 2023, SF, First Washington, and GRI filed an answer to Prudent’s
cross-complaint.
As is
relevant to the motion set for hearing on May 20, 2024, SF also served a
deposition notice on September 13, 2023, setting the deposition of Prudent for
November 9, 2023.  (Crossin Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.)
Prudent
did not serve objections or appear.  (Crossin
Decl., ¶ 2.)  SF inquired about the nonappearance, but Prudent did
not (until after this motion was filed) offer alternative deposition dates (Id.,
¶ 3.)
On March
26, 2024, SF filed this motion to compel.  SF also seeks sanctions.
The
motion was initially set for hearing on May 8, 2024.  No timely opposition was filed.
On May
3, 2024, Prudent filed an untimely opposition stating that the motion is moot
because Prudent has now agreed that the deposition will proceed on May 17,
2024.  (Childers Decl., ¶ 1 & Exh. A.)
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.010.)  Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through
2025.280 provide the requirements for (among other things) what must be
included in a deposition notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and
how and when the notice must be served. 
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)
Section
2025.230 provides: “If the deponent named is not a natural person, the
deposition notice shall describe with reasonable particularity the matters on
which examination is requested.  In that event, the deponent shall
designate and produce at the deposition those of its officers, directors,
managing agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to testify on its
behalf as to those matters to the extent of any information known or reasonably
available to the deponent.” 
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated
by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having
served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id., subd. (b).) 
When a
motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d),
defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond
to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party
or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Id.,
§ 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Motion to Compel Deposition of Prudent Securities
Solutions, Inc.
SF
properly noticed the deposition of Prudent Securities Solutions, Inc.
(“Prudent”).  Prudent did not object or appear at the
deposition.  SF inquired about Prudent’s nonappearance, but Prudent
did not – until after this motion was filed – offer alternative
dates.  (Crossin Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.)
In its
untimely opposition, Prudent states that it agreed that the deposition will
proceed on May 17, 2024.  
The
Court, on May 8, continued the motion to a date after May 17.  
The
Court will hear from counsel.  If the
deposition has gone forward, the Court will consider whether to deny the motion
as moot.  The Court will also consider the request for sanctions.
Conclusion
The Court will hear from
counsel.
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
