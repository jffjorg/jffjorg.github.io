And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition filed by Heidy Medina, a 15-year-old claimant, to approve a compromise. Before approving the petition, the court has identified several issues that need to be addressed. These issues include the accuracy of the filing fee, discrepancies in medical fees, the lack of a proposed order, and the absence of information about the proposed custodian. As a result, the hearing is continued to allow the petitioner to address these issues and file a proposed order. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and guardian ad litem and allows counsel to appear via phone or video conference.
