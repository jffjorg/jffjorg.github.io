 Case Number:  21STCV38177    Hearing Date:   May 20, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, for Summary Adjudication
filed by Defendant City of Redondo Beach.
 
Tentative Ruling
 
The motion for summary adjudication as to the First Cause of Action (for
negligence) is GRANTED. 
 
The motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
 
Background ,
 
This
action arises out of an incident on November 19, 2020 in which Plaintiff Debra
Barker (“Plaintiff”) allegedly tripped and fell while walking along a sidewalk
near 1717 South Catalina Avenue in Redondo Beach, California.
On October
15, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants City of Redondo Beach
(“City”); VLMD, LLC dba Abbracci Med Spa (“VLMD”); Abbracci Aesthetics, P.C.
(“Abracci”); and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for negligence
and premises liability/dangerous condition of public property.  
On
December 16, 2021, VLMD and Abracci filed an answer to the complaint.  On December 17, 2021, City filed an answer to
the complaint.
On March
9, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Wood Investments Companies,
Inc. as Doe 1.  The default of Wood
Investments Companies was entered on August 21, 2023. 
On July 5,
2023, Plaintiff filed a request to dismiss, with prejudice, the claims against
VLMD and Abbracci.
On
February 14, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Wood HS Family Trust
as Doe 2, Wood Family Investments, Inc. as Doe 3, and Wood Investments, Inc as
Doe 4.
On May 16,
2024, Wood Investments, Inc. filed an answer to the complaint and a
cross-complaint against City and Roes 1 through 20.
As it
relates to the matter set for hearing on May 20, 2024, City filed this motion
for summary judgment on January 31, 2024. Plaintiff filed her opposition on April
10.  City filed its reply, along with
objections to some of Plaintiff’s evidence, on April 19.
The
hearing was initially scheduled for April 26. 
The Court, on its own motion, continued the hearing to May 20.
Legal Standard
“The purpose of
the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each cause
of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment
or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing
a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon
the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)
Evidentiary Objections 
City objects to certain portions of
the evidence submitted by Plaintiff.  Evidence
presented in support of, or in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment
must be admissible.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (d); Perry v.
Bakewell Hawthorne LLC
(2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 541-43.)  The court
must “consider all of the
evidence set forth in the papers, except the evidence to which objections have
been made and sustained.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
City’s Objections
Nos. 1-6 and 10-15 are OVERRULED.  
City’s
Objection Nos. 7-9 are SUSTAINED as to relevancy.  
As to the City’s
objections (all of which relate to the expert opinion testimony of Brad Avrit,
P.E.,), the Court further notes that Mr. Avrit has appropriate credentials and his
testimony relates to a subject
that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert
witness would assist the trier of act; is based on information of the type on
which an expert may reasonably rely; is based on reasons supported by the
information on which the expert relies; and is not speculative.  (Evid. Code, §§ 801-802; Sargon Enterprises
v. USC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 747, 771-21.) 
Mr. Avrit’s opinion testimony is not, of course, binding on the Court.  “The fact
that a witness can be found to opine that … a condition constitutes a
significant risk and a dangerous condition does not eliminate this court’s
statutory task pursuant to Government Code section 830.2, of independently
evaluating the circumstances.”  (Thimon
v. City of Newark (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 745, 755; accord Sun v. City of
Oakland (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1189; Davis v. City of Pasadena
(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 701, 705.)  But
expert opinion may be admissible, relevant, and helpful to the Court, even if
it is not determinative.  The Court will consider all of the
admissible evidence (including expert opinion evidence) in conducting its
independent obligation (in which expert opinion evidence is not determinative)
to evaluate whether the existence of a dangerous condition may be resolved on
this record as a matter of law.
Discussion
In her
Complaint, Plaintiff asserts causes of action against City for common law
general negligence and for a dangerous condition of public property under
Government Code section 835.  City moves
for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication.
First
Cause of Action (General Negligence)
City
seeks summary adjudication as to the common law cause of action for general
negligence.  A cause of action against a
public entity, however, must be based on a specific statute, not common law
theories untethered to a particular statute. 
(Gov. Code, § 815; Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority (2003)
31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183.)  In her
Opposition, Plaintiff concedes this point.
Accordingly,
City’s motion for summary adjudication as to the negligence cause of action is
granted.
Second
Cause of Action (Government Code Section 835)
Plaintiff
asserts that she was injured as a result of a dangerous condition on public
property under Government Code section 835. 
As set forth in the statute, there are four elements for such a claim: 
“[A] public entity is
liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the
plaintiff establishes [1] that the property was in a dangerous condition at the
time of the injury, [2] that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous
condition, [3] that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable
risk of the kind of injury which was incurred, and [4] either: (a) A
negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity
within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition; or¿(b) The
public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition
under Section 835.2 a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken
measures to protect against the dangerous condition.”
(Gov’t
Code, § 835; see also, e.g., Tansavatdi v. City of
Rancho Palos Verdes (2023) 14 Cal.5th 639, 653; Thimon, supra, 44
Cal.App.5th at p. 753.)  
Here, City moves
for summary judgment on the sole ground that the undisputed facts show that as
a matter of law that there was only a “trivial defect,” and not a “dangerous
condition” on the sidewalk at the time of the incident.  
The
term “dangerous condition” means a “condition of property that creates a
substantial (as distinguished from a minor,¿trivial¿or insignificant) risk of
injury when such property or adjacent property is used with due care in a
manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable that it¿will be used.”¿ (Gov. Code,
§ 830, subd. (a); see also Thimon, supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at p. 754.)¿
“The existence of a dangerous condition ordinarily is a question of fact, but
the issue may be resolved as a matter of law if reasonable minds can come to
only one conclusion.”  (Peterson v.
San Francisco Comm. College Dist.¿(1984) 36 Cal.3d 799, 810; accord Stack
v. City of Lemoore (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 102, 110.)  
“A
condition is not dangerous within the meaning of the statute unless it creates
a hazard to those who foreseeably will use the property ... with due
care.  Thus, even though it is foreseeable that persons may use public
property without due care, a public entity may not be held liable for failing
to take precautions to protect such persons.”¿¿(Matthews v. City of Cerritos¿(1992)
2 Cal.App.4th 1380, 1384.)  “The condition of the property involved should
create a ‘substantial risk’ of injury, for an undue burden would be placed upon
public entities if they were responsible for the repair of all conditions
creating any possibility of injury however remote that possibility might
be.”¿¿(Fredette¿v. City of Long Beach¿(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 122, 130,
fn.5.) 
Government Code section 830.2 provides that a
condition is not a “dangerous condition” under the Government Claims Act “if
the trial or appellate court, viewing the evidence most favorably to the
plaintiff, determines as a matter of law that the risk created by the condition
was of such a minor, trivial or insignificant nature in view of the surrounding
circumstances that no reasonable person would conclude that the condition
created a substantial risk of injury when such property or adjacent property was
used with due care in a manner in which it was reasonably foreseeable that it
would be used.”  (Gov’t Code, § 830.2.)  This statutory principle is sometimes
referred to as “the trivial defect doctrine.”
It
is impossible to maintain public walkways in perfect condition.  (Stack, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at pp. 109-110;
Kasparian v. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 11,
26.)  The Government Claims Act is not
intended to make public entities “insurers” against injuries arising from
trivial defects.  (Stack, supra, 91
Cal.App.5th at p. 109; Thimon, supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at p. 757.)  Rather, the trivial defect
doctrine shields public entities from liability for “minor, trivial, or
insignificant” defects.  (Huckey v.
City of Temecula (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1092, 1104; Kasparian,
supra, 156 Cal.App.4th at p. 27.)  “The trivial defect doctrine is not
an affirmative defense.  It is an aspect
of duty that a plaintiff must plead and prove.”  (Huckey, supra, 37
Cal.App.5th at p. 1104.)   
“In
appropriate cases, the trial court may determine ... whether a given walkway
defect was trivial as a matter of law.”  (Ibid.)  “‘Where
reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion—that there was no
substantial risk of injury—the issue is a question of law, properly resolved by
way of summary judgment.’”  (Id. at pp. 1104-1105 (quoting Caloroso v.
Hathaway (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 922, 929).)  “If, however,
the court determines that sufficient evidence has been presented so that
reasonable minds may differ as to whether the defect presents a substantial
risk of injury, the court may not conclude that the defect is trivial as a
matter of law.”  (Huckey, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1105.)  
Where
a plaintiff alleges a cause of action based upon a dangerous condition in a
sidewalk or other walkway, courts generally begin their analysis by considering
the size of the defect.  The size of the
height differential, rise, or other defect is often the “most important”
factor.  (Stack, supra, 91
Cal.App.5th at p. 111; see also, e.g., Huckey, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p.
1105 [stating that size of defect “may be one of the most relevant
factors”].)  As the Court of Appeal has
explained, however, “[i]n determining whether a given walkway defect is trivial
as a matter of law, the court should not rely solely upon the
size of the defect.”  (Huckey, supra, 37
Cal.App.5th at p. 1105 [emphasis in original].) 
“[A] tape measure alone cannot be used to determine whether the defect
was trivial.”  (Caloroso, supra, 122
Cal.App.4th at p. 927.)  Rather, a “court
should consider other circumstances which might have rendered the defect a
dangerous condition at the time of the accident.”  (Huckey, supra, 37
Cal.App.5th at p. 1105.)  “These other circumstances or factors include
whether there were any broken pieces or jagged edges in the area of the defect,
whether any dirt, debris or other material obscured a pedestrian’s view of the
defect, the plaintiff’s knowledge of the area, whether the accident occurred at
night or in an unlighted area, the weather at the time of the accident, and
whether the defect has caused any other accidents.”  (Ibid.) 
“In sum, ‘[a] court should decide whether a defect may be dangerous only after
considering all of the circumstances surrounding the accident that might make
the defect more dangerous than its size alone would suggest.’”  (Ibid. [quoting Caloroso,
supra, 122 Cal.App.4th at p. 927].) 
The incident in this case occurred on November
19, 2020.  (Defendant’s Statement of
Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”], No. 3; Plaintiff’s Statement of Additional
Material Facts [“PSAMF”], No. 23.)  At
approximately 5 pm, Plaintiff walked out the door of the Abbracci Medical Spa,
located at 1717 South Catalina Avenue in Redondo Beach.  (DSUMF, Nos. 2, 6, 7; PSAMF, Nos. 26-27.)  Just outside of the spa, Plaintiff’s left toe
caught a rise in the concrete of the sidewalk, causing her to fall.  (DSUMF, Nos. 7, 11; PSAMF, Nos. 27-29.)
The size of the defect or rise in the
sidewalk is 1.3 inches.  (DSUMF No. 16-17;
PSAMF, No. 30; City’s Evidence, Exh. E.). 
Photographs submitted by City show that the size of the defect or rise decreases
as one moves away from its maximum height. 
(DSUMF, No. 18; City’s Evidence, Exh. C [“Plaintiff’s Depo.”], Exh. B
& Exh. D-E.)  Plaintiff testified that
her toe caught on the defect somewhat to the left (from the perspective of the
photograph) of the maximum height of the rise. 
(Plaintiff’s Depo., Exh. A.) 
At the time of the accident, the weather
was dry and clear, and the sun was out just before sunset.  (DSUMF, No. 4; PSAMF, No. 31.)  Plaintiff was familiar with the area and
visited the spa for treatment approximately once every three to four weeks.  (Plaintiff’s Depo., at 16:13-17:1.)  There was no debris, trash, twigs, or foliage
in the area at the time.  (DSUMF, No.
15.)  There is no evidence of prior
injuries or accidents at this location. 
(DSUMF, Nos. 19-21.)  There is
some cracking in the sidewalk visible in the photographs of the accident scene,
at or about the location that Plaintiff caught her toe.  (Plaintiff’s Depo., Exhs. A & B.)  The manager of the spa, Stephanie Hughes, testified
that she had noticed the unevenness of the sidewalk many years before the
accident and had reported it to City.  (Yazdi
Decl., Exh. F.)
The
Court has considered all of the evidence submitted by the parties (except the
evidence as to which an objection was sustained) and has evaluated that
evidence based upon the extensive case law (including, but not limited to, that
cited above and that cited by the parties) regarding dangerous conditions and
trivial defects.  Based on a
consideration of the evidence, the law, and the applicable factors, the Court cannot conclude that
the defect in this case was trivial as a matter of law.  Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of
the non-moving party, as is required, the Court concludes that the trier of
fact could find that the sidewalk was uneven, and that the defect (or uplift or
rise) was only slightly less than 1.3 inches in size.  There was some cracking in the sidewalk, but,
based on the evidence in the record, there were no other aggravating factors.  On
these facts, reasonable minds could differ as to whether the defect was
trivial or whether the sidewalk constituted a dangerous condition under
Government Code section 835.  
Accordingly,
the motion for summary judgment Is denied.
Conclusion
The Court
DENIES City’s motion for summary judgment.
 
The Court GRANTS
City’s motion for summary adjudication as to the negligence cause of action.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
