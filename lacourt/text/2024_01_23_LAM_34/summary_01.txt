And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by Jason Oh. The service was attempted at 13050 San Vicente Blvd, Los Angeles, California 90049, but Jason Oh claims that address is not his usual place of business. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not met its burden to show that the address is indeed Jason Oh's usual place of business, and therefore the service is quashed. The judge also notes that the plaintiff is unlikely to be prejudiced by this determination, as Jason Oh's business address is listed as 4251 W. Oquendo Road, Las Vegas, Nevada 89118.
