BACKGROUND
 
This is an action for partition by sale of the real property located at
8900 Geyser Avenue, Northridge, California 91324 (the “Subject Property”).
 
On June 2, 2023, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant David Reyes (“David”) filed a
Complaint against Defendants/Cross-Complainants Manuel Reyes (“Manuel”), Janet
Cazarez (“Cazarez”), all persons unknown claiming any interest in the property
described in the Complaint, and Does 1 through 20, alleging the following
causes of action: (1) Partition by Sale of Real Property (Code Civ. Proc., §
872.210.), (2) Accounting of Rents and Profits, (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty,
(4) Conversion, (5) Trespass, (6) Injunctive Relief, and (7) For Appointment of
A Receiver. Subsequently, Cazarez and Manuel filed their respective Answers to
the Complaint on July 28, and August 3, 2023.
 
On July 31, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Cazarez filed her
Cross-Complaint (“7/31/23 Cross-Complaint”) against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant David,
Defendant/Cross-Defendant/Cross-Complainant Manuel, and Roes 1 through 10, for
Declaratory Relief. Subsequently, David and Manuel filed their respective
Answers to the 7/31/23 Cross-Complaint on August 25, and December 6, 2023.
 
On August 4, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Defendant/Cross-Complainant Manuel
filed his Cross-Complaint (“8/4/23 Cross-Complaint”) against
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant David, and Cross-Defendant Gloria Huizar, both
individually (“Huizar”) and as Trustee for the Gloria Huizar Trust dated
12/20/2011 (“Huizar as Trustee”), all persons unknown claiming any interest in
the property described in the Complaint, and Roes 1 through 20, for Partition
of Real Property by Sale (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.210). Subsequently, David and
Huizar as Trustee filed their respective Answers to the 8/4/23 Cross-Complaint
on September 1, 2023, and March 15, 2024.
 
On July 31, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Cazarez’s counsel, Carol
L. Newman (“Counsel” or “Newman”), filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel (the “Motion”).
 
No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the Court.
            
ANALYSIS
 
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The determination
whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) An
application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Forms
MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
 
            In
addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subsection (d) requires that
the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal
service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must
be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:
 
            (A) The
service address is the current residence or business address of the client; or
(B) The service address is the last
known residence or business address of the client and the attorney has been
unable to locate a more current address after making reasonable efforts to do
so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be relieved.
 
            (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(1)(A) & (2).)
 
Here, Counsel has filed Judicial Council Forms MC-051 and
MC-052. Counsel has also lodged Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the Court. 
 
Counsel has provided a declaration stating that the Motion
is necessitated by that “[t]he client has failed repeatedly to cooperate with counsel
and has made it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the
representation effectively [Rule of Professional Conduct 1.16(b)(4)]. There has
been a breakdown in the Attorney-Client relationship.” (MC-052, ¶ 2.)
 
 
The Court finds Counsel’s
reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory. 
 
Counsel states in the
declaration that the Motion was served by mail at Cazarez’s last known address,
for which Counsel has confirmed within the past 30 days that the address is
current “by conversation.” (MC-052, ¶ 3b(2)(c).) Counsel has filed Proof of
Service, demonstrating that proper service was made on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).)
 
Counsel indicates on the MC-052 and MC-053 forms that the
next hearing scheduled for this action is a Mandatory Settlement Conference, set
for December 12, 2024, in this department. (MC-052, ¶ 4.) A jury trial is set
for April 7, 2025. (Id. ¶ 6.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Counsel
Carol L. Newman’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel for Defendant/Cross-Complainant Janet Cazarez
is GRANTED.
 
Moving Counsel
to give notice.
