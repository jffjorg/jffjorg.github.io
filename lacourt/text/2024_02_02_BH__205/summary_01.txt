And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The case is about a landlord-tenant dispute between the Plaintiff, Daniel Glauberg, and the Defendants, Windward Village Apartments, et al. The Plaintiff claims that there was a bed bug infestation in his apartment and that the Defendants did not take action to resolve the issue despite his complaints. The Plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at a case management conference and OSC hearings, resulting in the dismissal of the case. The Plaintiff is seeking to vacate the dismissal due to his counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's motion is timely and that mandatory relief is available under Code of Civil Procedure §473(b). The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff's counsel's calendaring error was an isolated incident and that the Plaintiff is entitled to relief. The action is reinstated, and a new case management conference is set for March 12, 2024.
