 Case Number:  23SMCV05304    Hearing Date:   February 2, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  CARL BARNEY,   Plaintiff, v.  SIENNA CHARLES, LLC, et al.,    Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV05304     Hearing Date:  February 2, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANTS’ DEMURRER AND    MOTION TO STRIKE COMPLAINT       This hearing is on Defendants Sienna Charles LLC and Jaclyn Sienna India-Reinert’s demurrer and motion to strike the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Carl Barney.   Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5 requires that before the filing of a demurrer or motion to strike, the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer or motion to strike for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer or motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a), 435.5(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc §§ 430.41(a)(2), 435.5(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(3), 435.5(a)(3).)   Defendants submit the Declaration of Kenneth G. Ruttenberg which fails to show the parties met and conferred in “person or by telephone.”  Rather, Defendants sent counsel for Plaintiff a letter by email, which letter in any event fails to outline all the arguments raised in the demurrer and motion to strike.  For this reason, the Court will continue the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike, so that Defendants can comply with the requirements of Sections 430.41 and 435.5.  The hearing is continued to March 13, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: February 2, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
