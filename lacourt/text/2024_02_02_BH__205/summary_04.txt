And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is on a hearing for Plaintiff A&M Engineering, Inc.'s applications for a writ of attachment against multiple defendants, including Christopher Klein, Stelaro, LLC, Instant Infosystems, Inc., Alondra Group, LLC, Luxury Lift, LLC, and Executive Auto Rentals, LLC. The Plaintiff is seeking to attach property to secure recovery on its claims, which arise from a breach of promissory notes. The loans, totaling $14 million, were made to the defendants, who allegedly used the funds to buy cars in Mexico, which were then resold for a profit in other countries. The Plaintiff claims that only $1 million of the loans have been repaid, and is seeking to attach property to secure the remaining debt.

The Judge has previously denied the Plaintiff's original applications for a writ of attachment, finding that the Plaintiff had failed to show a probability of prevailing on its alter ego claims. The Plaintiff has now renewed its applications under Code Civ. Proc. ยง1008, which allows for a motion to reconsider based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law. However, the Judge has denied the renewed applications, finding that the Plaintiff has not identified any new or different facts or law that would justify a reopening of the case. The Judge has also declined to consider evidentiary objections raised by the defendants and has denied the applications for a writ of attachment.
