And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion filed by American Express National Bank to vacate the dismissal entered in this case on January 21, 2022, and to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against Adelaida Rodriguez. The plaintiff filed the lawsuit against Rodriguez on July 27, 2021, and the parties entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement on January 21, 2022. Under the agreement, Rodriguez was required to make consecutive monthly payments of $1,000, $3,700, or $3,709.24, depending on the date, in order to pay off the debt of $100,809.24. However, Rodriguez defaulted on the agreement and failed to make any payments. After being given notice of the default, Rodriguez failed to cure the default. As a result, the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to have the dismissal set aside and to have judgment entered in its favor and against Rodriguez.
