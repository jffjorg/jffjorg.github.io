Case #21CHCV00576
 
MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Motion filed on 10/17/23.
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Anne L. Holland
CLIENTS: Defendants Fresh Start
Healthy School Meals, Inc.; K12 Schools Services and Juan Carlos Saucedo

 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
relieving attorney Anne L. Holland as counsel for Defendants Fresh Start
Healthy School Meals, Inc.; K12 Schools Services and Juan Carlos Saucedo in
this action.

 
RULING: The motion is moot as to Fresh Start
Healthy School Meals, Inc. and otherwise placed off calendar.      
 
On 10/17/23, attorney Anne L. Holland filed and served
the instant motion seeking an order relieving her as counsel for Defendants
Fresh Start Healthy School Meals, Inc.; K12 Schools Services and Juan Carlos
Saucedo in this action.
 
The declaration filed in support of the motion indicates
that the clients were served with the motion and supporting documents by mail
at their last known address and that the last known address was confirmed “By
checking for entity and contact information through the Secretary of State of
the State of California and also confirming all address information orally by
telephone with a representative od that state agency on October 17, 2023.”  The declaration then references Attachment 3
which includes copies the Statements of Information for K12 Schools Services
and Fresh Start Healthy School Meals, Inc. 

 
Despite the Court’s 9/21/23 ruling on attorney Holland’s
prior motion to be relieved as counsel which was denied without prejudice
indicating that electronic service is improper in this situation, the proof of
service for the instant motion indicates that it was electronically served on
the clients.  (See 9/21/23 Minute
Order; Proof of Service filed 10/17/23). 
Again, there is no evidence that the clients have consented to
electronic service.  See CCP
1010.6(c).  Similarly, as noted in the
9/21/23 ruling, Judicial Council Form MC-052 which must be used for such a
motion does not provide for service on the client by email.  (See 9/21/23 Minute Order).  Even if service by email was permissible, the
attorney has failed to adequately establish the confirmation of the email
addresses for the client as the documents attached to the declaration do not
contain email addresses. 
 
On 11/27/23, a Substitution of Attorney form was filed
with regard to Fresh Start Healthy School Meals, Inc. rendering the motion moot
as to that client.  No substitutions or
other response to the motion has been filed with regard to the other clients to
cure the defects in notice.  Therefore,
the motion is placed off calendar as to K12 Schools Services and Juan Carlos
Saucedo.
