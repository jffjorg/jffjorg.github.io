Pursuant to the stipulation/settlement agreement, the

and every month commencing January 2023 through and including November 2024.  Id.  Then, one final payment of $3,709.24 was due
on or before December 15, 2024.  Id.  If Defendant failed to comply with the terms

written notice of the default and allow Defendant 14 days to cure same.  Id.

Defendant notice of the default.  (Dyle
Decl., Ex.B).  Defendant has not cured
the default.  (Dyle Decl.).  Plaintiff has incurred costs of $563.00.  Id.
 
On 7/13/23, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order vacating the dismissal entered in this case on 1/21/22 and

ANALYSIS
   
CCP 664.6(a) provides: 
 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.”
 
Based on the settlement agreement/stipulation entered on
1/21/22 and Defendant’s default thereunder and failure to cure same after being
given notice, Plaintiff is entitled to have the dismissal set aside and have
judgment entered in its favor and against Defendant as requested.

The motion is granted.
