And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Facey Medical Group, has moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication in this case, which was filed by Karey Kibbe and her husband Brian Kibbe. The plaintiffs allege that Karey sustained injuries from a slip-and-fall accident at a medical facility in Valencia, California, and that the defendant's failure to provide a step stool or other assistance caused the accident.

The defendant argues that it did not breach its duty of care to Karey and that Karey's injuries were not caused by its negligence. However, the court finds that the defendant has failed to meet its initial burden of proof to negate an essential element of the plaintiffs' cause of action. Specifically, the court finds that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendant breached its duty of care to Karey and whether Karey's injuries were caused by its negligence.

The court also finds that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendant's failure to provide a step stool or other assistance was a breach of its duty of care to Karey. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is denied.
