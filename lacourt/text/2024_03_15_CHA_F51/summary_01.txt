Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for reconsideration of the court's February 6, 2024 order denying the defendant's motion for terminating and monetary sanctions against the plaintiff. The plaintiff is the trustee of the Gesner L. Martin Living Trust, and the defendant is an individual who entered into a month-to-month lease agreement with the plaintiff. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff had no legal authority to bring the action, as the plaintiff was suspended as the successor trustee by court order on March 6, 2019. However, the court found that the plaintiff does not have the legal standing to maintain the action because he is no longer the real party in interest as the trustee of the Gesner Martin Revocable Living Trust. The court also found that the defendant did not meet her burden to show any grounds for reconsideration of the court's order, as she did not present any new or different facts, circumstances, or law that was not previously presented and considered by the court.
