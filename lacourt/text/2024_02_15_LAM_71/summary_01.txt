And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Dominic Hill, granting his motion for attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses in the reduced amount of $16,379.50. The plaintiff seeks to recover attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with a lemon law action against Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC and Mercedes-Benz of Beverly Hills.

The plaintiff's counsel seeks to recover attorneys' fees and costs based on the 31.6 hours spent working on the case, as well as an additional 4.5 hours in anticipated fees for reviewing the defendants' oppositions, preparing a reply, preparing for the hearing, and attending the hearing.

The judge has reviewed the defendants' objections to the plaintiff's counsel's billed hours and finds them to be unavailing. The judge also denies the defendants' request to tax costs, finding that the plaintiff's memorandum of costs is incomplete and does not provide sufficient detail to justify the costs incurred.

Overall, the judge's ruling is in favor of the plaintiff, granting his motion for attorneys' fees and costs, but reducing the amount of the requested award.
