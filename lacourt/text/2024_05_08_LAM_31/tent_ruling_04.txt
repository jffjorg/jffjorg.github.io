I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On March 29,
2024, Plaintiff, Christina Gozy, filed these motions to compel Defendant, Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC, to provide responses to Plaintiff’s First Set of Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of
Documents, and to deem Requests for Admission admitted against Defendant.  Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Defendant
and its counsel.
                                                     
            On April
30, 2024, Defendant filed untimely oppositions. 
The oppositions referenced Declarations of Vanessa Dao and Defendant’s responses
which were not filed with the court.
 
            On May 1,
2024, Plaintiff filed replies.
 
            On May 6,
2024, Defendant filed the supporting Declarations of Vanessa Dao and
Defendant’s belated discovery responses. 
The discovery responses are not verified.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
            If a party
to whom interrogatories or inspection demands were directed fails to serve a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order to compel
responses without objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b);
2031.300, subd. (b).)¿ If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
that the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ Failure to timely
serve responses waives objections to the requests. ¿(Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (a); 2031.300, subd. (a); 2033.280, subd. (a).)  
 
A party moving to compel discovery responses under these
statutory provisions is not required to meet and confer prior to filing the
motion.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (b); see
also Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411 (Sinaiko) (citing Leach v. Superior Court (1980)
111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 for the proposition that “meet and confer” requirement
“did not apply when propounding party sought order compelling responses to
interrogatories and sanctions for responding party's failure to respond ‘within
the statutorily permitted time’”).)
 
            Monetary
Sanctions 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
¿ 
            If the
court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel
responses to inspection demands, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction .
. . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  In the context of a motion to deem requests
for admission admitted, it is mandatory that the court impose monetary
sanctions on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely
response to the request necessitated the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff moves
for an order compelling Defendant to provide responses to Plaintiff’s interrogatories
and production request and to deem admitted the requests for admissions.
 
            It is
undisputed that Plaintiff properly served Defendant with the at-issue discovery
requests and Defendant did not provide timely responses.  Objections to the discovery requests are therefore
waived.¿ 
 
            In
opposition, Defendant argues the motions should be denied because full
responses have been served.  Defendant did
not initially include the response with its oppositions, but instead, separately
submitted the responses to the court after Plaintiff filed her replies.  The responses are a mixture of objections and
substantive responses.  (See Declarations
of Vanessa Dao, Exs. A.)  The responses
are not verified.  Defendant represents that
“Plaintiff does not take issue with the substance and completeness of the
responses served.”  Defendant further
argues the court should relieve Defendant of the waiver of objections because “there
is no prejudice to any party” and because the delay was due to mistake,
inadvertence, and excusable neglect. [1] [2]
 
            Defendant’s
arguments lack merit.  As Plaintiff
points out in her replies, Defendant served unverified responses on April 30,
2024.  “Unsworn responses are tantamount
to no responses at all.”¿ (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)¿ Defendant’s service of unverified responses does not
moot Plaintiff’s motions.  
 
             Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Defendant and its counsel.  Given the Court’s ruling, sanctions are
warranted.  Defendant concedes untimely
responses were served.  In the context of
untimely responses to requests for admission, sanctions are mandatory.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Pursuant to Hennings, supra,
imposition of monetary sanctions against counsel is also proper unless counsel
shows that he or she did not counsel the discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings, 58
Cal.App.5th at p. 81.)¿ Defense counsel does not meet their burden.[3]¿
Defendant succeeds only in showing the untimely discovery responses were
attributable to Defendant’s error alone.  Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against defense
counsel only in the sum of $3,153.20, consisting of six hours at Plaintiff’s
counsel’s hours rate and $153.20 in filing fees.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motions
are GRANTED.  Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA,
LLC is ordered to serve verified, objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s First
Set of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for
Production of Document, within 30 days of this order.  Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set One, is
deemed admitted against Defendant.  If
Defendant provides proof of service of verifications for its responses to
Plaintiff’s discovery requests, the court will adopt this order with respect to
sanctions only. 
 
            The request
for sanctions is granted.  Defense
counsel is ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $3,153.20 to Plaintiff, by
and through her counsel, within 30 days of this order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
