MOTIONS
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Laurie
M. Cortez, Emilio Law Group
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On March 4,
2024, Laurie M. Cortez, counsel for Defendants, SP Star Enterprise, Inc. and
Mohan S. Makkar, filed these Motions to Be Relieved as Counsel.
 
            The Motions
are unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and
without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship
why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).  
 
The court
has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿
            
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Laurie M. Cortez seeks to be
relieved as counsel of record for Defendants for the following reasons: “Substantial,
irreconcilable differences have developed between this law firm and the client,
which make it impossible to continue to represent the client in this matter.
Under the circumstances, we believe it is in the best interest of all concerned
to terminate the attorney-client relationship between the client and our firm.
In our judgment, our ethical responsibilities preclude our providing the Court
with any additional detail. However, should the Court desire further
information, we will attempt to provide it in a matter consistent with these
ethical considerations.”  (Form
MC-052.)    
 
Absent a showing
of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398,
406.)¿¿ 
 
Upon review, the
court finds that the Motions comply with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362. 
 
IV.        CONCLUSION
            
Accordingly, the unopposed Motions to Be Relieved as Counsel
are GRANTED and effective upon the filing of the proof of service of this
signed order on Defendants.  
 
The court sets a Status Conference re: Counsel for Defendants
SP Star Enterprise, Inc. and Mohan S. Makkar on June 14, 2024.  
 
 
Dated:   May 8, 2024
