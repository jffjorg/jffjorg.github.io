[1] Defendant also requests relief
from its waiver of objections. Defense counsel explains that Plaintiff’s
discovery was inadvertently missed due to absence of the lead attorney on
medical leave and the departure of the previous handling attorney.  (See Dao Decls., ¶ 5.)  With respect to requests for admission, the
court, on motion, may relieve a party of a waiver of objections if the party
has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230, and the party’s failure to serve a
timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a)(1), (2).)  “The law governing the consequences for failing to
respond to requests for admission may be the most unforgiving in civil
procedure. There is no relief under section 473. The defaulting party is
limited to the remedies available in [CCP § 2033.280].” (Demyer v. Costa
Mesa Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 394-395 (disapproved on
other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 983, fn.
12).)  A relief from waiver should be
brought by motion.  (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (a); see also Weil & Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 8:1369.1.)
 
 
Here,
the court has reviewed Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff’s requests for
admission.  The court is inclined to find
the responses to the requests for admission to be substantially compliant, but
for the lack of verification.  (Allen-Pacific,
Ltd. v. Sup.Ct. (Chan) (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1546, 1551, disapproved on
other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 983, fn.
12 [unsworn responses are not substantially compliant].)  If, at the hearing, Defendant provides proof
that verifications have been served, the court will not adopt the portion of
this ruling deeming the admissions admitted.  The court further notes that, although
Defendant should have brought a motion for relief from waiver pursuant to
Section 2033.280, the court will exercise its discretion to consider
Defendant’s request as to the request for admission.
 


[2] Defendant also requests relief
from waiver of objections as to the interrogatories and production
demands.  As with relief from waiver of
objections to admissions requests, a noticed motion is required when seeking
the same relief as to interrogatories and production demands.  (See Code of Civil Procedure, §§ 2030.290,
subd. (a); 2031.300, subd. (a).)  If, at
the hearing, Defendant provides proof that verifications have been served, the
court will not adopt the portion of this ruling as to the interrogatories and
production demands.  The court further
notes that, although Defendant should have brought a motion for relief from
waiver pursuant to Sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, the court will exercise its
discretion to consider Defendant’s request as to interrogatories and production
demands.
 


[3] Additionally, Defendant represents
that Plaintiff did not take issue with the belated service of unverified
responses.  Plaintiff objects to the
representation.  There is support for Plaintiff’s
position.  Plaintiff provides
time-stamped emails showing that Defendant served the unverified responses at
11:09 p.m. on April 30, 2024—after Defendant filed its oppositions.  (See Reply, Declaration of Sam Azimtash, Exs.
A and B.)  Plaintiff could not have taken
issue with discovery responses that were served after the oppositions were
filed.
