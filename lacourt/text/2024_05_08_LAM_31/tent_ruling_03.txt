I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a construction defect case.  David Bilfeld (“Bilfeld”) and his company,
1978, LLC, were in the business of developing and building residential homes.  In 2018, Plaintiff Cathy Arkley (“Plaintiff”)
entered into an agreement to purchase a residential property located at 462 N.
Croft Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90048 (the “Subject Property”) from Bilfeld
and his company.  Douglas Elliman of
California, Inc. (“Elliman”) and Tracy Tudor (“Tudor”) were Plaintiff’s real
estate broker and agent, respectively.  Dream
Team Real Estate Consultants Inc. dba Keller Williams Realty Encino – Sherman
Oaks (“Keller Williams”) and Andrew Dinksy (“Dinsky”) were Bifeld and 1978,
LLC’s agent in the transaction.  At
closing, inspections uncovered undisclosed defects in the Subject Property.  Bilfeld and 1978, LLC promised to repair the
defects but failed to do so.  Plaintiff discovered
additional undisclosed defects after moving into the Subject Property.  Further, when Plaintiff attempted to resell
the Subject Property, her real estate broker and agent discovered that the square
footage of the Subject Property had been misrepresented in the property listing.
This suit followed.
 
On March 23, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Bilfeld
and 1978, LLC for (1) Violations of Building Standards as outlined in
Cal. Civ. Code § 896, (2) Breach of Contract, (3) Breach of Express and
Implied Warranty, (4) Fraud, and (5) Strict Liability.
 
            On May 12,
2023, Bilfeld and 1978, LLC filed a cross-complaint against Dinsky, Keller
Williams, and PLG Estates, Inc. aka Peter Lorimer Group Estates, Inc., for
indemnity and contribution.  The
operative cross-complaint was filed on June 8, 2023.
 
            On July 14,
2023, Dinsky and Keller Williams (hereafter, “Cross-Complainants”) filed a
Cross-Complaint against Bilfeld; 1978, LLC; Elliman; and Tudor, alleging causes
of action for (1) Indemnity, (2) Contribution, and (3) Declaratory Relief.  The First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”),
which is the operative pleading, was filed on December 14, 2023. 
 
            On February
14, 2024, Elliman and Tudor (hereafter, “Cross-Defendants”) filed this Demurrer
to FACC.
 
Cross-Complainants filed an opposition   Cross-Defendants replied. 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            A demurrer
tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and will be sustained only where
the pleading is defective on its face.¿ (City of Atascadero v. Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)¿
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿ We accept the factual
allegations of the complaint as true and also consider matters which may be
judicially noticed.¿ [Citation.]”¿ (Mitchell v. California Department of
Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged
in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].)
Allegations are to be liberally construed.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)¿ In
construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific factual
allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory
allegations.¿ (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 764, 769.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿           
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).)¿“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint
is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.”¿(Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)¿¿¿¿ 
 
Where the complaint contains substantial factual allegations
sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a
demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given leave to
amend.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135,
139, fn. 2.)¿ Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment.¿ (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)¿ 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
A.   
Meet and Confer 
 
“Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer
for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a).)¿ 
 
Here, Cross-Defendants have not made a sufficient showing that
they made efforts to  meet and confer prior
to filing this Demurrer.  (See
Declaration of Ari Markow, ¶ 2.)  However,
“[a] determination by the court that the meet and confer process was
insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)¿
Accordingly, the court exercises its discretion to consider the Demurrer.¿¿¿ 
 
B.    
Analysis 
 
Cross-Defendants argue the FACC fails to allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action for indemnity, contribution, or
declaratory relief.  The court addresses
each in turn.
 
1.     
First Cause
of Action for Indemnity
 
Cross-Defendants demur to the First Cause of Action on two
grounds: (1) there are no facts alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint or the
Cross-Complainants’ FACC that give rise to Cross-Defendants’ liability and (2)
Cross-Defendants improperly seek equitably indemnity for Plaintiff’s breach of
contract action.  Cross-Defendants’
arguments have merit.
 
First, there is no alleged liability against
Cross-Defendants.  The elements of a
cause of action for indemnity are (1) a showing of fault on the part of
the indemnitor and (2) resulting damages to the indemnitee for which the
indemnitor is contractually or equitably responsible.”  (Expressions at Rancho Niguel Ass’n v.
Ahmanson Developments, Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1139 (italics in
original).)  “[T]there can be no
indemnity without liability.”  (Prince
v. Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1151, 1156.)  
 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that Cross-Complainants made
intentional misrepresentations about the condition and square footage of the
Subject Property and concealed defects.  Plaintiffs
also argue that such information was completely within Cross-Complainants’
control.  (See FAC ¶¶ 18-21,24,76-91.)  The FACC does not allege any additional facts
to the contrary.  (See FACC, ¶¶ 7-11.)  In other words, there are no allegations showing
that Cross-Defendants have any liability for Plaintiff’s injury.  
 
Second, Plaintiff’s claim against Cross-Complainants is
based in contract.  (See FAC, ¶¶ 7, 40, 41,
52-70.)  Yet, Cross-Complainants seek
comparative equitable indemnity.  (See
FACC, ¶ 11.)  Equitable indemnity is not
available to apportion damages arising from a breach of contract claim.  (Stop Loss Ins. Brokers, Inc. v. Brown
& Toland Med. Grp. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1054-55 (Pollack, J.,
concurring) [“Nonetheless, there are conceptual problems in imposing equitable
indemnity on a party whose liability is based on breach of contract that do not
exist in applying equitable indemnity between two tortfeasors. The measure of
damages in most tort cases is all loss proximately caused by the wrongdoing,
whether anticipated or not. However, the measure of contract damages remains
very much the same as articulated in Hadley v. Baxendale (1884 Ex.) 156
Eng.Rep. 145—those damages that the parties could reasonably have anticipated
when they entered the contract. [Citation.] Thus, apportionment between parties
who have breached different contracts entered at different times would in
theory require the use of different measures of damages, as would apportionment
as between a party liable in tort and a party liable for breach of contract.
[Citation.] This would, at a minimum, complicate the apportionment formula.”].)  Cross-Complainants’ indemnity claim fails for
this additional reason. 
Cross-Complainants do not offer any argument or authority to the contrary.
 
2.     
Second Cause
of Action for Contribution
 
Equitable contribution is the right to recover from a
co-obligor who shares liability with the party seeking contribution.  (Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Md. Cas. Co. (1998)
65 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1293.)  A right of
contribution requires: 1) two or more parties jointly at fault; 2) common
liability between or among those parties because of that fault; and 3) one
party paying an unequal portion of the common liability.  (4 Restatement (Second) of Torts § 886A. Rev.
191, 240.) Contribution requires a joint obligation.  (Civ. Code, § 1432.) “An action to enforce the
right of contribution is governed by equitable principles.  (Overholser v. Glynn (1968) 267
Cal.App.2d 800, 807; Jans v. Nelson (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 848, 855.)  Contribution presupposes a common liability
which is shared by joint tortfeasors on a pro rata basis.  (Rollins v. State of California (1971)
14 Cal.App.3d 160, 165.)
 
Like an indemnity cause of action, a contribution claim
requires a share of liability.  Because
the court has found there are no allegations demonstrating Cross-Complainants’
liability liability, the Second Cause of Action likewise fails.  Cross-Complainants do not present any
argument or authority directing a different conclusion.
 
3.     
 Third Cause of Action for Declaratory
Relief
 
“To qualify for declaratory relief, a party would have to
demonstrate its action presented two essential elements: (1) a proper subject
of declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving justiciable
questions relating to the party’s rights or obligations.”¿ (Jolley v. Chase
Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909, [cleaned up].)  A demurrer to a declaratory relief cause of
action may lie where it is wholly derivative of a claim that is invalid as a
matter of law.  (See Ball v.
FleetBoston Fin. Corp. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 794, 800 [sustaining demurrer
to declaratory relief claim which was wholly derivative of a statutory claim].)
 
Here, Cross-Complainants seek “a declaration that it is
entitled to total indemnity and contribution or, in the alternative, to partial
indemnity from Cross-Defendants, in the event Cross-Complainants are determined
to be held liable to Plaintiff for any damages alleged in the Complaint.”  (FAC, ¶ 16.) 
As alleged, the Third Cause of Action is wholly derivative of the indemnity
and contribution claims.  The Third Cause
of Action is deficient.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Demurrer is SUSTAINED.  Leave to amend is GRANTED as to the Second
Cause of Action only.
 
            Defendants
and Cross-Complainants Dream Team Real Estate Consultants Inc. dba Keller
Williams Realty Encino – Sherman Oaks and Andrew Dinksy are to file and serve
