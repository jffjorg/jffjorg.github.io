And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering Defendant's requests for relief from waiver of objections regarding Plaintiff's requests for admission, interrogatories, and production demands. The court has reviewed Defendant's responses and is inclined to find them substantially compliant, except for the lack of verification. The court will not adopt the portion of this ruling deeming the admissions admitted if Defendant provides proof that verifications have been served at the hearing. Additionally, the court notes that Defendant should have brought a motion for relief from waiver, but will exercise its discretion to consider the request. The court will also consider Defendant's representation that Plaintiff did not take issue with the belated service of unverified responses, but Plaintiff objects to this representation. The court will review the emails showing that Defendant served the unverified responses at 11:09 p.m. on April 30, 2024, after Defendant filed its oppositions.
