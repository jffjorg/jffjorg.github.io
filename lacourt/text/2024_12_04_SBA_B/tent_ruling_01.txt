RULING
            The motions are GRANTED.  Sanctions
are GRANTED against defendant Adonnis Alexander Andrade, and his counsel of
record, in the total amount of $1,780.00.  Sanctions are payable within 30 days to
counsel for moving party.
BACKGROUND
            On February 22, 2024, plaintiff
Joselyn L. Marquez filed a complaint against defendants Rollins, Inc., Wheels
LT, and Adonnis Alexander Andrade for (1) negligence, (2) negligent hiring,
supervision, retention, and (3) negligent entrustment.  Plaintiff alleges that defendant Adonnis
Alexander Andrade, operating a vehicle owned by defendant Orkin Services of
California (erroneously sued as Rollins, Inc.), collided into plaintiff’s
vehicle causing plaintiff to sustain severe injuries.
            On April 19, 2024, defendants Orkin
Services of California (erroneously sued as Rollins, Inc.) and Adonis Alexander
Andrade filed an answer to the complaint.
            These Motions all involve a
significant failure of counsel for defendant to attempt in good faith to comply
with defendant’s discovery obligations.  The
uniform response provided by counsel demonstrates a meaningful misunderstanding
of the obligation to comply with the discovery statutes. To all discovery the
same response was given.
 
Defendants Response to Form
Interrogatories Nos. 1.1 - 2.10; 3.1 - 4.2; 7.1 - 7.3; 12.2 - 12.7; 17.1; and
20.1 - 20.11
Defendants Response to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1 through 32
Defendants Response to Request for
Admissions Nos. 1-14:
“Objection.  Defense counsel submits these objections in
good faith and in the spirit of complying with the Professional Rules of
Conduct and Guidelines for Civility in Litigation.  Professional courtesies have been extended
previously and the parties have been able to resolve issues in the past.  Defense counsel remains willing to cooperate
so that substantive responses can be provided.  However, due to unforeseen circumstances
additional time is necessary to complete the meet and confer process to allow
Responding Party to provide substantive responses.  At this time, out of an abundance of caution
to preserve appropriate objections, this responding party objects as follows:  The request is vague, ambiguous, overbroad,
burdensome, harassing, unintelligible, and shotgun in nature.  Responding party further objects to the
request in that it is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence, irrelevant to the subject matter of the action, and
therefore a misuse of discovery.  The
request lacks foundation and calls for a legal conclusion.  This request seeks information gathered in
anticipation of litigation and information protected by the attorney-client and
attorney-work product privileges, including violating the authorities of Nacht
& Lewis Architects, Inc. v. Super Ct. (McCormick) (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th
215 and Soltani-Rastegar v. Super. Ct. (Brinzo) (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d
424, 429.  This request is also objected
to in that it seeks the premature disclosure of expert opinions or witness
information and seeks information that violates the privacy rights of
responding party and/or third-parties.”
            The Court does not find that this
boilerplate response to all the discovery is an acceptable response nor is it given
“in good faith.”
 
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            Timeliness
A motion to compel further
discovery responses must be filed and served within 45 days after the initial
verified response or supplemental verified response was personally served or by
any specific later date that the discovering party agreed to in writing.  CCP §§ 2030.300(c), 2031.310(c), 2033.290(c);
see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.  Extra
time is added to the 45 days if the response was served by a method other than
personal delivery.  See CCP §§
1010.6(a)(3)(B), 1013(c), (e), 2016.050.
            Meet and Confer 
A motion to compel further
interrogatory responses or further admission responses must be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under CCP § 2016.040.  CCP §§ 2030.300(b)(1), 2033.290(b)(1).  A meet and confer declaration in support of a
motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.  CCP § 2016.040.
Separate Statement
A motion to compel further
responses to interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admissions
must be accompanied by a separate statement unless (1) no response has been
provided to the discovery request or (2) the court has allowed the moving party
to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in
dispute in place of the separate statement. 
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(1); see CCP
§§ 2030.300(b)(2), 2031.310(b)(3), 2033.290(b)(2).

Interrogatories
A motion to compel a further
response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable
objections to interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission.  See CCP §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a); Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403 [interrogatories and
demands to produce].
To compel a further response to
interrogatories, the movant can show that: (1) the responding party’s answer to
a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) the responding party’s
exercise of the option to produce documents in response to an interrogatory was
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents was inadequate;
and (3) the responding party’s objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general.  CCP § 2030.300(a)(1-3).
Request for Admissions
To obtain further responses to
requests for admission, the movant must establish that (1) the response to a
request for admission is evasive or incomplete, CCP § 2033.290(a)(1), or (2)
the objection to a request for admission is without merit or too general.  CCP § 2033.290(a)(2).
DISCUSSION
            Procedural
Requirements
Plaintiff
served Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and
Request for Admissions, Set One, on defendant Adonnis Alexander Andrade (Andrade) via electronic service on June 21, 2024.  All Mots., Klein Decl., ¶ 4; Ex.  1.  Andrade
served objection only responses on September 3, 2024.  All Mots., Klein Decl., ¶ 5; Ex. 2.  Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel
further on October 18, 2024.  Thus, the
motions are timely.  CCP §§ 2030.300(c),
2033.290(c).
On
September 28, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel sent a letter to Andrade’s counsel
outlining the deficiencies of the discovery responses and requesting
supplemental responses.  All Mots., Klein
Decl., ¶ 6; Ex. 3.  The parties were
unable to resolve the issues presented in these motions.  All Mots., Klein Decl., ¶¶ 8-9; Ex. 4.  Thus, the parties have satisfied the meet and
confer requirement.  CCP §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2033.290(b)(1).
Plaintiff also filed separate
statements accompanying each motion.  All
Mots., Separate Statement; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(1); CCP §§
2030.300(b)(2), 2033.290(b)(2).
Form
Interrogatories
            Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses from Andrade
to Form Interrogatories Nos. 1.1- 2.10,
4.1-4.2, 7.1-7.3, 12.1-12.7, 17.1, and 20.1-20.11.
            Andrade
responded to each interrogatory is not a good faith response.  The Court has quoted it above.  Contrary to the statements contained in it, the
objections are not provided “in good faith.” 
They are not provided “in the spirit of complying with the Professional
Rules of Conduct and Guidelines for Civility in Litigation.”  They are the antithesis of what counsel
professes.
            Andrade’s responses are evasive and incomplete.  Further the Court finds that the objections to this discovery are not
meritorious.  For example, Andrade
objects to Form Interrogatory No. 2.2 which requests his date and place of birth
as vague, burdensome, violating attorney-client privilege, and seeking
premature disclosure of expert opinions, among other objections.  Mot. FROGs, Klein Decl., Ex. 2, pp 4:24-5:18.  Andrade is required to answer each
interrogatory as completely and straightforwardly as possible.  CCP §2030.220(a).  Additionally, Andrade has not filed an
opposition substantiating his objections. 
The responding party has the burden of justifying the objections thereto.  Coy v. Superior Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d
210, 220-221.)  
Thus, Andrade has not provided code complaint
response to plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One.
            Accordingly,
plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, without
objection, from defendant Adonnis Alexander Andrade is GRANTED.
Special
Interrogatories
Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses from Andrade
to Special Interrogatories Nos. 1
through 32.  Andrade responded to each interrogatory
with the same objections as stated above. 
Mot. SROGs, Klein Decl., Ex. 2.  The
Court adopts its reasoning from the preceding section that Andrade’s responses
are evasive and incomplete, and his objections are without merit.  Thus, Andrade has not provided code complaint
response to plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One.
            Accordingly,
plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set
One, without objection, from defendant Adonnis Alexander Andrade is GRANTED.
Request
for Admissions
Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses from Andrade to Request for Admissions Nos. 1
through 14.  Again, Andrade responded to
each request for admission with the objection only response quoted above.  Mot. RFAs, Klein Decl., Ex. 2.  The Court adopts its reasoning from the Form
Interrogatories section above to find that Andrade’s responses are evasive and
incomplete, and his objections are without merit.  Thus, Andrade has not provided code complaint
response to plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set One.
            Accordingly,
plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Admissions, Set
One, without objection , from defendant Adonnis Alexander Andrade is GRANTED.
Sanctions

The court
must impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  CCP §§ 2030.300(d), 2033.290(d).
The court
may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a
motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed,
or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was
provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.  Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).
Plaintiff
requests sanctions for the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, against defendant Adonnis Alexander Andrade, and
Andrade’s counsel, in the total amount of $860.00 based upon counsel’s rate of $400/hour
for: (1) 0.5 hours attempting to resolve this matter informally; (2) 1.0 hour
preparing the motion and accompanying documents; (3) 0.5 to prepare for and
attend the hearing; (4) $60 in filing fees. 
All Mots., Klein Decl., ¶ 11.
The
request for sanctions is GRANTED in the total amount of $860.00.
 
Plaintiff
requests sanctions for the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, against defendant Adonnis Alexander Andrade, and
Andrade’s counsel, in the total amount of $860.00 based upon counsel’s rate of
$400/hour for: (1) 0.5 hours attempting to resolve this matter informally; (2)
1.0 hour preparing the motion and accompanying documents; (3) 0.5 to prepare
for and attend the hearing; (4) $60 in filing fees.  All Mots., Klein Decl., ¶ 11.  Because the 0.5 hours spent attempting to
resolve the matter informally and the 0.5 hours spent to attend the hearing are
duplicative of the time for the other motions, a 1.0 hour reduction is
appropriate.
The
request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $460.00.
