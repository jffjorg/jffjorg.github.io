And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants plaintiff Andy Martin's motion to compel defendant Sylvia McArthur and Douglas McArthur as Trustees to respond to interrogatories and special interrogatories. The court finds that the interrogatories were properly served on the defendants, and that the defendants failed to respond. The court awards sanctions in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants in the amount of $410, which must be paid within 30 days. The court orders the defendants to respond without objections to the interrogatories and special interrogatories within 20 days. The court also orders the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.

The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendants violated California Civil Code §51 and California Civil Code §54 and §54.1 by failing to provide accessible facilities at their sports card and memorabilia shop. The plaintiff is a paraplegic who uses a wheelchair and was unable to enter the shop due to an architectural barrier. The defendants did not respond to the plaintiff's interrogatories, despite a meet and confer letter sent by the plaintiff's counsel. The court doubts the veracity of the claimed time spent by the plaintiff's counsel on the motion, and awards a reduced amount of $350 in fees and $60 for the filing fee.
