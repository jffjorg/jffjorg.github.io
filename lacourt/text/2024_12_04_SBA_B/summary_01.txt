Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for admissions filed by plaintiff Joselyn L. Marquez against defendant Adonnis Alexander Andrade. The court finds that Andrade's responses to the discovery requests were evasive and incomplete, and that his objections were without merit. As a result, the court orders Andrade to provide further responses to the discovery requests.

The court also imposes sanctions against Andrade and his counsel in the amount of $1,780.00 for failing to comply with discovery obligations. The sanctions are payable within 30 days to counsel for the moving party.

The court notes that Andrade's responses to the discovery requests were not provided in good faith, and that his objections were not justified. The court finds that Andrade and his counsel acted unreasonably in failing to comply with discovery obligations, and that the requested discovery was necessary to allow the plaintiff to prepare for trial.

The court concludes that the motions are granted, and that sanctions are imposed against Andrade and his counsel. The court orders Andrade to provide further responses to the discovery requests, and to pay the sanctions within 30 days.
