And here is a brief summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is denied, and the Motion in the Alternative for Summary Adjudication is granted as to the third cause of action for negligence and denied as to the first and second causes of action. The Court found that the Defendant failed to prove that the Plaintiff's claims were barred by the statute of limitations or precluded by Commercial Code section 4406(f). The Court also found that the Defendant was entitled to summary adjudication on the third cause of action for negligence, as the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate a triable issue of fact that precluded the express terms of the Business Account Agreement from barring the Plaintiff's negligence claim.
