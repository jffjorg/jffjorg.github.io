On March 20, 2024, the Court continued
trial from May 20, 2024, to January 27, 2025, pursuant to an ex parte
application filed by defendants Ty Labbe and Liza Gonzalez (collectively,
“Defendants”). The discovery and motion cut-off dates did not track the new
trial date, but on June 5, 2024, the parties stipulated to have the instant motion
heard on July 17, 2024. 
This motion was filed on April 12, 2024.
Defendants move for an order compelling plaintiff Gerald Wachel’s (“Plaintiff”)
to serve verified responses to Request for Production of Documents Set Three
without objections within 7 days of the hearing after Plaintiff served unverified
hybrid responses containing statements of compliance and objections on April
10, 2024. 
The objections are preserved because
the portion of the responses containing objections did not need to be verified
and were timely filed. (Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 656.) Furthermore, on July 12, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel, Sacha V. Emanuel, filed a declaration attaching a verification by
Plaintiff that was served the same day. 
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion is
DENIED as moot.
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 17th
day of July, 2024
