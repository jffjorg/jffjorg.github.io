And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to a request for production of documents. The motion was filed on April 12, 2024, and the hearing is scheduled for July 17, 2024. The plaintiff served unverified hybrid responses on April 10, 2024, which included statements of compliance and objections. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's responses are incomplete and that the plaintiff should be compelled to serve verified responses without objections. The judge has denied the motion as moot because the plaintiff's counsel filed a declaration attaching a verification on July 12, 2024, which preserved the objections. The judge notes that the objections are preserved because they do not need to be verified and were timely filed.
