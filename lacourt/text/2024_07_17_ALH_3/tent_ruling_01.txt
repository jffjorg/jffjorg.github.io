          This is the
second of two motions filed by defendant Wang’s Golden Enterprises, Inc. dba
Golden Motel (“Defendant”) asking the Court to enforce monetary sanctions of $1,120
previously imposed against plaintiff Annora Renfroe (“Plaintiff’) in a minute
order dated January 26, 2024 issued by the Honorable Lisa R. Jaskol (“January
26 Order”). Although the January 26 Order did not impose sanctions against
Plaintiff’s counsel, Defendant argues that Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel
should be jointly liable for $5,000 due to their failure to comply with the
January 26 Order. 
          The motion is
DENIED because no additional court order is necessary to “enforce” an order
imposing sanctions. (Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th
608, 615 [monetary sanctions orders “have the force and effect of a money
judgment, and are immediately enforceable through execution, except to the
extent the trial court may order a stay of the sanction.”])
Moving party to give notice.      
 
Dated
this 17th
day of July, 2024
