And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court finds that Defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Plaintiff cannot prevail on his claims as a matter of law. Specifically, the court notes that Defendant's Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Fact contains deficiencies and that the image included in Defendant's Memorandum of Points and Authorities does not establish the zone which is the target of the wet-floor sign. As a result, the court cannot interpret the image as demonstrating that Plaintiff was on notice of any open and obvious hazard at the place where the injury occurred. Therefore, the court denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment and the case will proceed to trial.
