And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the petition for release of property from a mechanics lien filed by LA Tigertail, LLC against Apollo Glazing Contractors, Inc. The lien was recorded on February 28, 2022, and Apollo failed to bring an action to enforce the lien within 90 days. The petition alleges that Apollo is unwilling to execute a release of the lien and that the time period during which suit can be brought to foreclose the lien has expired. The court finds that LA Tigertail has complied with the statutory service requirements and has satisfied the requirements for filing a petition to release the mechanics lien. As a result, the court grants the petition and awards LA Tigertail $480.00 in costs and $1,600.00 in attorney's fees.
