And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the arguments presented by both parties regarding the warranty claims. While the plaintiff argues that the warranty claims are not barred by the statute of limitations (SOL), the court finds that the claims are demurred to only on the grounds that they are barred by the SOL, not that they generally fail to state sufficient facts. The court requests that the parties provide binding cases addressing the issue of whether implied warranties of merchantability have prospective application. The court also notes that the complaint does not allege a duty independent of the warranty agreement/underlying contract(s), which is necessary to plead around the economic loss rule.
