 Case Number:  24PSCV01645    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
DEFENDANTS’ DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT is OVERRULED
in part (i.e., 1st-3rd COAs because express warranty claims
are not patently time-barred) and SUSTAINED in part with leave to
amend (i.e., as to 4th COA (implied warranty of merchantability does
not have prospective application) and 5th COA (fails to allege
damages). 
 
Background
 
This is a
lemon law case. 
 
On June 21,
2024, Plaintiff SERGIO SALDIVAR filed suit against Defendants Ford Motor
Company and Ford of Upland arising from defects with his November 16, 2016
purchase of a 2017 Ford Explorer.
 
On June 27,
2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer. 
 
On August 1,
2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. 
 
On August 7,
2024, Defendant filed a reply. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant
demurs to the complaint “on the grounds that the first through fourth causes of
action for violations of the Song-Beverly Act are time-barred and therefore
fail to plead facts sufficient to state a cause of action pursuant to Section
430.10(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure” (Demurrer p. 2:5-9; see also Demurrer
p. 8:11-12 [SBA COAs are “time-barred by the four-year statute of
limitations”])[1]
and the fifth COA fails “to plead essential elements to state the claim” and is
otherwise barred by the economic loss rule. (Demurrer pp. 3-4; see also p.
8:21-22; p. 9:3-4.)
 
1.     Whether Express Warranty Claims (1st-3rd
COAs) are Time-Barred? (Demurrer
p. 10)
 
A plaintiff
can bring a breach of express warranty claim within four years from the claim’s
accrual date. (See Krieger v. Nick Alexander Imports, Inc. (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 205, 213-214; Cal. Com. Code, § 2725, subds. (1)-(2).) For express
warranties, “Song-Beverly claims accrue when the plaintiff discovers or
reasonably should have discovered the breach of warranty, and such claims
may accrue before an express warranty expires.” (Galvez v. Ford Motor Co.,
No. 2:17-cv-02250-KJM-KJN, 2018 WL 4700001, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Sep. 30, 2018).)[2]
 
Here,
Defendant focus on the date of the first repair presentation
dated January 13, 2017. (Complaint ¶24 [no repairs were made that day].) But, as noted by Plaintiff in
opposition, a buyer cannot know of the breach until after (1) the buyer
provides the defendant with a reasonable number of repair attempts and (2) the
defect manifests again outside of the warranty period, thereby establishing
that the defendant's repairs did not conform the vehicle to warranty.
(Opp. p. 3, citing Donlen v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138,
148-49.) Effectively, when Ford’s authorized repair facilities supposedly fixed
the complained of issues, representing to Plaintiff that the Vehicle and the
complained of defects had been repaired (Complaint, ¶24-30), Plaintiff did not
have reason to know of any defects. 
 
Even if the
date of discovery of defects is unclear from the face of the complaint, the
legal standard on a demurrer would ultimately resolve the issue in favor of
Plaintiff. First, on a demurrer when the SOL is raised, it must be explicitly
evident from the pleading itself, without requiring additional facts, that
the SOL has indeed expired. (Coalition for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012)
209 Cal.App.4th 408; Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001)
94 Cal.4th 963.) Here,
Defendant itself maintains that there are insufficient facts, making
sustaining the demurrer improper. (See Reply p. 1:22-23 [“However, Plaintiff
does not include a single fact regarding when they discovered this breach of
warranty.”].) Additionally, on a demurrer, the allegations are liberally
construed such that the court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant. (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.) Here, considering that repairs were first conducted on
2/1/2017 and thereafter on 3/22/2017, 4/13/2017, 5/5/2017, and 5/16/2023
(Complaint pp. 3-4), the inferences drawn in favor of Plaintiff do not suggest
that Plaintiff first discovered the defect on 1/13/2017 as there were continuing
problems. 
 
Therefore, as
Defendant only demurs on the grounds that the claims are time barred,
the court OVERRULES the demurrer as to the 1st through 3rd
COAs for breach of express warranties. 
 
2.     Whether the Implied Warranty Claim (4th
COA) is Time-Barred?
 
Under Civil Code
section 1792, every consumer good sold in California is covered by an
implied warranty that the goods are “merchantable.” A claim for breach of implied warranty
accrues upon tender of delivery. (Cal.
Comm. Code § 2725, subds. (1), (2), emphasis added.) “That warranty is of limited duration; “[t]he duration of the implied warranty of
merchantability ... shall be coextensive in duration with an express warranty
which accompanies the consumer goods, provided the duration of the express
warranty is reasonable; but in no event shall such implied warranty
have a duration of … more than one year following the sale of new
consumer goods to a retail buyer.” (Civ.Code, §
1791.1, subd. (c), emphasis added;
see Atkinson v. Elk Corporation of Texas (2006)
142 Cal.App.4th 212, 231.) Because an implied warranty is one that arises by operation of law
rather than by an express agreement of the parties, courts have consistently held
it is not a warranty that explicitly extends to future
performance of the goods[.]” (Demurrer p. 11, quoting Cardinal Health
301, Inc. v. Tyco Electronics Corp. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th at 134,
emphasis added.)[3]
For this reason, “[t]he delayed discovery doctrine does not apply to implied
warranty claims.” (Demurrer p. 11, quoting Nguyen v. Nissan North America,
Inc., 487 F.Supp.3d 845, 854 n.3 (2020).) California, implied warranty
claims are subject to a four-year statute of limitations. (Montoya v. Ford
Motor Co., (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 493, 495.) 
 
Here, with a purchase date of 11/16/2016, a claim
for breach of implied warranty would have finalized by 11/16/2017, requiring
suit by 11/16/2021 (4-year SOL). In opposition, Plaintiff heavily focuses on Mexia v. Rinker Boat Co.
(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1297 wherein the court effectively expanded consumer
rights by allowing for an implied warranty COA where a latent defect is
discovered after tender of delivery and within a reasonable time of notifying
the seller of the breach. (Id. at pp. 1310-1311.) Though Plaintiff maintains that
“[m]any federal courts have been persuaded by Mexia,” (Opp p. 4:16-17), not
necessarily. As noted in Reply (and as stated on WestLaw), the court in Marchante
v. Sony Corp. of America, Inc. 801 F. Supp.2d 1013 (S.D. Cal. 2011) found
that the plaintiff’s reliance on Mexia “unconvincing.” (Marchante,
supra, at p. 1022.) In doing so, the court reasoned the following:


Significant to the analysis is the
character of the latent defect. Mexia concerns
latent defects that render the product unmerchantable from the outset. This
distinction can be drawn from Mexia's reliance on Moore v. Hubbard & Johnson Lumber Co., 149 Cal.App.2d 236, 308
P.2d 794 (1957).
In Moore a defendant sold lumber to a contractor for
construction purposes. The lumber was infested with beetles that would eat
their way out of the wood, leaving holes in the wood. And in such a situation,
the latent defect, whether or not it was discovered, rendered the lumber
unmerchantable from the outset. It is this distinction that renders Mexia inapplicable. Plaintiffs here do not
allege that the televisions failed to work properly from the outset. They
instead allege issues arising after several years of use. In relying
on Mexia, Plaintiffs request this Court accept that
televisions that may manifest issues after several years of use are comparably
unmerchantable-from-the-outset as building lumber infested with beetles. The
comparison is unconvincing. (Id. at pp. 1021-1022, emphasis added.)
 
Here, similarly, Plaintiff does not
allege that the vehicle was defective from the outset. Even if Mexia were not limited to items that are unmerchantable from
the outset, the court in Marchante also spoke to that. “[Mexia] renders
meaningless any durational limits on implied warranties. Every
defect that arises could conceivably be tied to an imperfection existing during
the implied warranty period. And in that vein, Mexia enjoys the
limelight as a case ‘contrary to established California case law with
respect to the duration of the implied warranty of merchantability.’” (Id.
at p. 1022, emphasis added, quoting Hovsepian v.
Apple, Inc., 2009 WL 2591445, at *8 n. 7 (N.D.Cal. Aug. 21, 2009).) Thus, echoing the Marchante
court, the court determines that Plaintiff’s reliance on Mexia
unconvincing because there is no indication that the vehicle was unmerchantable
from the outset, and even if it was unmerchantable form the outset, Mexia is
an outlier of a case. 
 
Therefore, the court
SUSTAINS the demurrer as to the 4th COA for breach of implied
warranty with leave to amend.[4]
 
3.     Whether the Negligent Repair COA Fails
to State Sufficient Facts Re: Damages? 
 
To state a
cause of action for negligence, the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating
the existence of a duty, breach of that duty, causation, and damages. (Seo
v. All-Makes Overhead Doors (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1202.)
 
Defendant
demurs on two grounds: claim is barred by economic loss rule[5]
and the COA fails to state sufficient facts. The court for purposes of this
demurrer will focus on the latter argument.
 
Here, the
court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff has failed to plead damages. (See
Complaint ¶68 [“Defendant UPLAND's negligent breach of its duties owed to
Plaintiff was a proximate cause of Plaintiff's damages.”].) While Plaintiff
maintains that he need not plead whether he paid out-of-pocket for any repairs
performed by Upland, that may be true, but damages (e.g., out-of-pocket
expenses, or any other monetary losses or property damage he may have
sustained), in whatever form, must still be pled. To the extent that Plaintiff
argues that pleading of such facts are not required because they are within the
control of Upland (Opp. p. 6:13-15), it is unclear why Plaintiff would not be
the one to know of how he was damaged.
 
Therefore,
the court SUSTAINS the demurrer as to the 5th COA with leave to
amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the demurrer as to the 1st-3rd COAs is
OVERRULED; 4th COA is sustained with leave to amend; and 5th
COA is sustained with leave to amend.
