```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice for three reasons. Firstly, the plaintiff failed to dismiss the Doe defendants, as required by CCP section 585. Secondly, the plaintiff did not adequately prove up his general damages, including pain and suffering, which is a subjective and difficult-to-quantify claim. Finally, the plaintiff's statement of damages was incomplete and did not provide a breakdown of the damages claimed, making it difficult for the court to ensure that the damages sought in default judgment comports with the statement of damages. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file a revised statement of damages and to prove up his general damages in order to proceed with the application for default judgment.
