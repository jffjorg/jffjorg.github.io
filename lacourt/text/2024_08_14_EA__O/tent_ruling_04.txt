[1] The court emphasizes
that the warranty claims are only demurred to on the grounds that they are
barred by the SOL, not that they alternatively generally fail to state
sufficient facts, which may have otherwise warranted sustaining the demurrer
with leave to amend. (See also Table of Contents [focusing on SOL].) 


[2] Both parties cite to
Krieger and Galvez. 


[3] Without more,
Plaintiff argues that these facts don’t consider the policy considerations
expressed in Cardinal Health 301. (Opp. 4:7-8.) 


[4] Should Defendant
demur to the COA again, the court requests the parties to adequately the binding
cases that address the issue of whether implied warranties of
merchantability have prospective application.  
  


[5] Under the economic loss rule,
“[w]here a purchaser’s expectations in a sale are frustrated because the
product he bought is not working properly, his remedy is said to be in contract
alone, for he has suffered only ‘economic’ losses.” (Robinson Helicopter Co.,
Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988 (Robinson Helicopter), quotation
marks omitted.) However, tort damages may be permitted when the breach of
contract is accompanied by a tort such as fraud. (Id. at pp. 989-990.) To plead
around the economic loss rule, a party must plead the existence of a duty that
arises independent of any contractual duty and independent injury, other than
economic loss, that arises from the breach of that duty. (Id. at pp. 988-991.) Here,
briefly, the complaint expressly alleges that Plaintiff’s COAs are predicated
upon warranty obligations, suggesting that the complaint does not allege a duty
independent of the warranty agreement/underlying contract(s).
