And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, William Sieber, has applied for a default judgment against the defendant, Eugenio Montelongo Fraire, for damages resulting from a motor vehicle accident on May 16, 2022. The plaintiff is seeking $49,831.93 in damages, which includes $40,552.05 in damages, $8,710.36 in prejudgment interest, and $569.52 in court costs. However, the court has denied the plaintiff's application for three reasons: (1) the plaintiff failed to dismiss the Doe defendants, (2) the plaintiff did not adequately prove up his general damages, and (3) the plaintiff did not file the statement of damages with the court. The court has limited its default judgment to the amount demanded in the statement of damages. The case is set for further hearing on August 14, 2024.
