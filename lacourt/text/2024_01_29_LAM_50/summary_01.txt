And here is a brief English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to stay the case pending the resolution of a related case, Crawford v. Michaels Stores Procurement Company, Inc. The judge finds that the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction applies, which means that the court with jurisdiction over the first case has exclusive jurisdiction over the same parties and subject matter until all related matters are resolved. The judge concludes that a stay is warranted to avoid inconsistent rulings and to protect the rights of the parties. The case is stayed pending the resolution of Crawford, and a status conference is set for a later date.
