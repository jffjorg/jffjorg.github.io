Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge, Judge Beaudet, discloses that approximately 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price without involving litigation. Judge Beaudet does not believe that this experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party, but she gives notice to the parties that they may file and serve a verified statement of disqualification if they believe otherwise. The hearing on the Case Management Conference will be continued to February 13, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file such a statement.
