And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, issues a tentative ruling in the case of Lawrence Adams (Plaintiff) vs. Neutral Ground, et al. (Defendants). The case involves multiple causes of action, including abuse of process, negligence, breach of contract, and others. On November 13, 2023, defendant Corey Sims filed a demurrer with motion to strike the Complaint. However, on December 15, 2023, the Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, rendering the demurrer and motion to strike moot. The Court notes that the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a prior complaint, citing JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468. Therefore, the Court grants the Plaintiff's motion and dismisses the demurrer and motion to strike.
