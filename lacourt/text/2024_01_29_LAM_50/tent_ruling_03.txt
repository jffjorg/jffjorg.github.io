  ORDER RE:
 
DEMURRER WITH
  MOTION TO STRIKE COMPLAINT




 
On April 17, 2023,
Plaintiff Lawrence Adams (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants
Neutral Ground, Corey Sims (“Sims”), City of Los Angeles, and Los Angeles
Housing Department. The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) abuse of
process, (2) “Civil Code § 1714(A) (Negligence and
Duty of Care)” (3) “Govt. Code § 814 (Breach of
Contract)” (4) “Govt. Code § 815.2 (Government
Entity Respondeat Superior Liability…)” (5) declaratory relief, (6) civil
conspiracy, (7) replevin, (8) breach of an express contract, (9) deceit based
on concealment, (10) conversion, (11) promissory fraud, (12) negligence, and
(13) promissory estoppel/detrimental reliance.[1] 

On November 13,
2023, Sims filed a “demurrer with motion to strike Complaint.” No opposition to
the demurrer and motion to strike was filed. However, on December 15, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint. The Court notes that “[b]ecause there is but one
complaint in a civil action…the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion
directed to a prior complaint…Thus, the filing of an amended complaint renders
moot a demurrer to the original complaint.” ((JKC3H8
v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th
468, 477 [internal citations omitted].) 
Accordingly, Sims’s demurrer to the
Complaint and motion to strike the Complaint is moot.
