And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet, discloses that she and her husband purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago, which developed electrical problems. Despite the issues, the manufacturer and dealer agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price without litigation. The judge does not believe this experience will bias her in this case, but allows parties to file a verified statement of disqualification if they believe otherwise. The hearing on the Case Management Conference is continued to February 13, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file a statement of disqualification.
