And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge in a court case involving an employment dispute. The Plaintiff, Daryl G. Crouse, alleges that he was discriminated against and terminated from his position as an attorney at Defendant eAccidents, APC, based on his religion and for reporting Defendant Avi E. Muhtar's harassing behavior. The Judge has sustained the demurrer (an objection to the pleading) filed by the individual defendants, Tal Hassid, Avi Muhtar, and Jeff Goldstein, and has also sustained the demurrer filed by the Defendants regarding the Plaintiff's claims for wrongful termination, retaliation, and religious discrimination. The Judge has concluded that the Plaintiff's claims against the individual defendants are insufficient and that they are not liable for discrimination under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The Judge has also concluded that the Plaintiff's claim for retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5 is insufficient because it fails to allege an employer-employee relationship and fails to allege any protected activity.
