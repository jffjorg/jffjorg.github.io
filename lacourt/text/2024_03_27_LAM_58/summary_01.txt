Summary in English:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Alvarado-Ortiz v. Architectural Surfaces, Inc. The case involves a personal injury action alleging exposure to toxic silica, metals, and other fibrogenic substances while working with natural stone and artificial stone countertops.

The Court has overruled the demurrer by Category 2 Defendants, but granted the motion to strike, with leave to amend, regarding punitive damages. The Court has also overruled the demurrer by Category 3 Defendants, but granted the motion to strike, without leave to amend, regarding references to "other stone products" and the request for punitive damages.

The Court has applied the standard set forth in Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187 to determine that the allegations of fraudulent concealment by Category 3 Defendants are sufficient to state a claim. The Court has also held that the allegations of a duty to disclose by defendants are sufficient to state a claim.

The Court has granted the motion to strike certain allegations, including references to "other stone products" and the request for punitive damages, as they are not supported by specific allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice. The Court has also granted the motion to strike the request for punitive damages as it is not supported by specific allegations of wanton, willful, or fraudulent conduct by Category 3 Defendants.
