And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to file certain documents under seal, filed by Defendant Netflix, Inc. The motion was opposed by Plaintiff Francisco Ferreras Rodriguez, who argued that the public has a right of access to court documents. The judge found that the purportedly confidential information in the documents was too vague to identify specifically and that Defendant failed to demonstrate a substantial probability that serious injury would occur absent a sealing order. The judge also noted that Defendant's assertion of commercial and competitive harm was conclusory and lacked specific showing. As a result, the judge ordered Defendant to file unredacted versions of the documents electronically within three court days.
