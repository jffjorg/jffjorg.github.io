English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Yervand Vardumyan's motion to compel defendant Celeste C. Esguerra's responses to Form Interrogatories 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, and 16.5. The Court finds that defendant's lack of direct facts in its supplemental responses is delaying discovery and disagrees with defendant's objections. The Court orders defendant to comply with the requests without further delay or prejudice to Plaintiff. The Court also imposes sanctions of $1,000 on defendant and/or their counsel for defendant's alleged failure to provide the requested documents. The hearing is set for July 12, 2024.
