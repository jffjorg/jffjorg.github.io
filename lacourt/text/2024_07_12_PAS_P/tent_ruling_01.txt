  Case Number:  23AHCV00735    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF YERVAND VARDUMYAN’S MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO
PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE; GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S
REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS                           I.         
INTRODUCTION
            This
personal injury case arises from a dog bite incident. Plaintiff Yervand
Vardumyan (“Plaintiff”) alleges that Defendant Celeste C. Esguerra
(“Defendant”) owns the dog that attacked Plaintiff and his dog. Plaintiff sues Defendant
both in her individual capacity and her capacity as trustee of her trust. The
complaint asserts two causes of action: (1) strict liability and (2) negligence
per se.  
On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff
propounded his “First Set of Requests for Production” on Defendant, including Form
Interrogatories, Set One. 
Before the Court is a Motion to
Compel Further Discovery Responses as to Form Interrogatory Nos. 16.2, 16.3,
16.4, and 16.5 filed by Plaintiff on February 28, 2024. Plaintiff also requested
sanctions of $1,000 be imposed against Defendant and/ or her counsel. Defendant
filed an opposition on June 13, 2024. Plaintiff filed a reply on June 27, 2024.
            The hearing
was initially reserved for April 19, 2024. The hearing was continued to July 5,
2024, and continued again to July 12, 2024. (Min. Order, June 20, 2024.) Originally,
three separate hearing reservations were made on motions to compel further
discovery responses for July 12, 2024. (Reservation Nos.: 890767701495,
489705389241, and 733061673421.) On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel took two
of three reserved motions off the calendar. (See Reservation No.: 489705389241
and 733061673421.) The instant motion remains on the calendar to
which Plaintiff filed a reply to on June 27, 2024. (See Reservation No: 890767701495.)
As such, the Court is unaware and uninformed of any subsequent further meet and
confer efforts that may have occurred after the June 25, 2024 hearing
cancellations by Plaintiff’s counsel. 
Having reviewed the moving,
opposition, and reply papers, the Court makes the following rulings:
            
                       
II.         
ANALYSIS
A.   
Procedural Matters
45-Day
Rule
This
motion must be served within 45 days after service of the response in question
(extended if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax; see CCP §1013);
otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further response
to the CCP §2031.010 demand.  CCP §§2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber
v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745.  The 45-day time limit
is mandatory and jurisdictional.  Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)
58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.  The parties, however, can also agree in writing
on a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel.  CCP
§2031.310(c).  
 
Meet-and-Confer
Requirement 
The
motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a declaration showing
“a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues outside of court
(so-called “meet and confer”).  CCP §§2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2). 
 
Separate
Statement
 Any motion involving the content of a
discovery request or the responses to such a request shall be accompanied by a
separate statement.  This includes a motion to compel further responses to
demand for inspection of documents or tangible things.  CRC Rule
3.1020(a)(3).   
 
On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff
served Form Interrogatories, Set One; Request for Production, Set One, and
Request for Admission, Set One on Defendant. Plaintiff moves the Court issue an
order compelling Defendant to produce responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, and 16.5. The deadline to
respond was November 21, 2023. On November 6, 2023, Defendant served responses
to the Form Interrogatories, Set One. On January 12, 2024, Defendant served
further responses, which include responses to the Interrogatories at issue. On
November 14, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel delivered a meet and confer letter to
Defendant’s counsel informing Plaintiff that the objections as to all
interrogatories except 15.1 were waived pursuant to CCP §2030.290 because they
were not timely (Burunsuzyan Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 3, p. 2.) On January 12,
2024, Defendant served further responses, which include responses to the
Interrogatories at issue. Plaintiff argues the supplemental responses are
untimely and waived. (Id., ¶ 5, Ex. 4.) On February 1, Plaintiff’s counsel delivered
another meet and confer letter asking for responses by February 9, 2024.
Defendant’s counsel delivered a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff on February
9, 2024.
 The motion is not timely as it was filed on
February 28, 2024, forty-seven days after service of Defendant’s supplemental
responses. The parties exchanged meet and confer correspondence following
receipt of Defendant’s supplement responses. The meet and confer requirement is
fulfilled. The motion is accompanied by a separate statement that contains some
procedural defects.
Therefore, all procedural
requirements are not satisfied. However, the Court will consider the motion on
its merits.
 
B.   
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories – General 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, a court may order a party to serve a further response to
interrogatories when the court finds that any of the following apply: 
1.    
An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. 
2.    
An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. 
3.    
An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.  
Under Civil Procedure Code 2030.22(a) and (b), a
responding party’s answer to interrogatories must be “as complete and
straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party
permits. If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be
answered to the extent possible.” It is improper for an answer to only respond
to a portion of the information sought, particularly when an interrogatory is
specific and explicit. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
783.)  
Plaintiff moves the Court issue an
order compelling Defendant to produce responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, and 16.5. 
Defendant’s opposes the motion on Plaintiff’s alleged
failure to “specifically meet and confer over Interrogatory Nos. 16.2, [16.3],
16.4 and 16.5.” (Babadjanian Decl., ¶ 12.) Defendant also argues that their
responses are proper because she does “not have personal knowledge sufficient
to know whether the incident giving rise to this action caused any, some,
and/or all of plaintiff’s claimed injuries because I am not a medical or
biomechanical expert and cannot answer or explain the question(s) of medical causation
presented by this interrogatory”. (Opp’n., p. 10.)
Plaintiff motion to compel further
responses to its Form Interrogatories 16.2, 16.3, 16.4 and 16.5 is premised on
the argument that Defendant’s responses of a “lack of personal knowledge” are
meritless and evasive. (Reply, p. 5.) Since Plaintiff has filed this motion to
compel further responses, Defendant has the burden to justify each of its
objections. (Coy v. Superior
Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220 - 221.) 

 
a)     Form Interrogatory No. 16.2 asks Defendant whether Plaintiff was injured in the incident.
Specifically, it states:
 
“Do you contend that plaintiff was not injured in the INCIDENT? If so:
(a) all facts upon which you base your contention; (b) state the names,
ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of the
facts; and (c) identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support
your contention and state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON
who has each DOCUMENT or thing...” (Plaintiff’s Mot., Exh. 1, p. 6.) 

 
Defendant’s Response to Form Interrogatory No. 16.2:
 
 “(a) Responding party lacks
sufficient information to respond, as discovery into plaintiff’s medical
history remains outstanding. [Response to FROG No. 6.2]
 
b)     Form Interrogatory No. 16.3 asks Defendant about the extent of Plaintiff’s injuries from the
incident. Specifically, it states:
 
“Do you contend that the injuries or the extent of the injuries claimed
by plaintiff as disclosed in discovery proceedings thus far in this case were
not caused by the INCIDENT? If so, for each injury… (a) identify it; (b) state
all facts upon which you base your contention; (c) state the names, ADDRESSES,
and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of the facts; and (d)
identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support your contention
and state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who has each
DOCUMENT or thing” (Plaintiff’s Mot., Exh. 1, p. 7.)  
 
Defendant’s Response to Form Interrogatory No. 16.3:
 
 “All of plaintiff’s injuries at
this time as discovery and case evaluation continues.” [Response to FROG No.
6.3]” (Opp’n., p. 10.)
 
c)     Form Interrogatory No. 16.4 asks Defendant to confirm if any of the healthcare services furnished were
not due to Plaintiff’s injuries arising from the incident. Specifically, it
states:
 
“Do you contend that any of the services furnished by any HEALTH CARE
PROVIDER claimed by plaintiff in discovery proceedings thus far in this case
were not due to the INCIDENT? If so? If so, for each injury… (a) identify each
service; (b) state all facts upon which you base your contention; (c) state the
names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of
the facts; and (d) identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that
support your contention and state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of
the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT or thing.” (Plaintiff’s Mot., Exh. 1, p.
7.)  
 
Defendant’s Response to Form Interrogatory No. 16.4:
 
“a) All services furnished by Healthcare Provider. [Response to FROG No.
6.4.]” (Opp’n., p. 10.)
 
d)     Interrogatory No. 16.5 asks Defendant to confirm whether any costs of furnished healthcare services
were necessary or unreasonable. Specifically, it states:
 
“Do you contend that any of the costs of services furnished by any HEALTH
CARE PROVIDER claimed as damages by plaintiff in discovery proceedings thus far
in this case were not necessary or unreasonable? If so: (a) identify each
service; (b) state all facts upon which you base your contention; (c) state the
names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of
the facts; and (d) identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that
support your contention and state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of
the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT or thing” (Plaintiff’s Mot., Exh. 1, p.
7.)  
 
Defendant’s Response to Form Interrogatory No. 16.4:
(a) Costs of services for all services furnished by any Healthcare
Provider.” [Response to FROG No. 6.5.] (Opp’n. p. 10.)
As to subsection (b) of each of the Interrogatories at
issue, Defendant responds:
“(b) . . . To the extent defendant can respond, I do not have personal
knowledge sufficient to know whether the incident giving rise to this action
caused any, some, and/or all of plaintiff’s claimed injuries because I am not a
medical or biomechanical expert and cannot answer or explain the question(s) of
medical causation presented by this interrogatory. I am not required to inquire
of other natural persons or organizations because the information is at least
equally – and in fact more – available to the propounding party than to
responding party. Indeed, ‘Contention interrogatories cannot be used to require
a layperson to provide answers to scientific matters on which expert testimony
will be required at trial,’ and as such, a layperson’s ‘I don’t know’ responses
to such interrogatories are not admissions that he or she will be unable at
trial to provide expert testimony on causation.’ (Weil & Brown, Civ. Proc.
Before Trial (Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 8:986.5, citing Bockrath v. Aldrich Chem.
Co., Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 84.)” “(c) Responding party” and “(d) Not
applicable.” [See P’s Motion – Exh. 4, at 13:20-17:28.] (Opp’n. p. 10.)
            The Court agrees with Plaintiff’s
reasoning for requesting additional responses to the interrogatories at issue.
 
“The facts sought, those presently relied upon by
plaintiffs to prove their case, are discoverable no matter how they came into the
attorney’s possession.” (Southern Pacific Co. v. Superior Court (1969) 3
Cal.App.3d 195, 199 [83 Cal.Rptr. 231.) Further, “[v]erification of the answers
is in effect a declaration that the party has disclosed all information which
is available to him. . . . [A]n answer which supplies only a portion of the
information sought is wholly insufficient. Likewise, a party may not provide
deftly worded conclusionary answers designed to evade a series of explicit
questions.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782-783 [149 Cal.Rptr.
499].) Plaintiff has clearly not disclosed “all information which is available
to him.” Finally, it is not appropriate to incorporate another pleading by
reference: “[I]t is not proper to answer by stating, . . . ‘See my pleading’.”
(Deyo, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 784.) The party raising objections has the
burden of demonstrating that the objections apply. See Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255, citing Coy v. Superior Court (1962)
58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21 (if a timely motion to compel has been filed, the burden
is on responding party to justify any objection). In failing to file a timely
Opposition, Plaintiff as the party raising the objections has failed to justify
the objection
 
            Specifically,
the Court finds that Defendant’s lack of direct facts in its supplemental
responses to the Interrogatory Nos. 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, and 16.5 are delaying
discovery by failing to address the key questions in determining the outcome of
the case. The Court agrees that Plaintiff is entitled to supplemental responses
45 days after receipt of these provided responses. Thus, Defendant must comply
in providing code compliant responses to the foregoing requests without further
delay or prejudice to Plaintiff. Failure to do so will result in the Court
awarding sanctions on its own motion.
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion compelling Defendant to produce the request form interrogatory responses.

 
C.    Sanctions 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery
sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which includes (without
limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without substantial justification,
an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive response to
discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification making or
opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery. 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010.) 
If sanctions are sought, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity
of the person against whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction
requested, that the motion be supported in the points and authorities, and the
facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the amount of any monetary
sanction.   
Plaintiff requests the court to
impose a monetary sanction of $1,000.00 on Defendant and/or their counsel for Defendant’s
alleged failure to prove the requested documents. (Motion, p. 5.) Plaintiff’s
Counsel, Kristine Azatyan, Esq., a California-licensed attorney, and associate of
the Law Offices of Maro Burusuzyan states that $1,000.00 were incurred in
preparing this motion based on her hourly billing rate of $250.00 as applied to
4 hours to prepare this motion. (Decl. of Azatyan, ¶ 1-2.). 
In opposition, Defendant argues
that attorney fees should not be awarded because the Plaintiff has not cited
the correct authority. (Opp’n., p. 5.) In their reply, Plaintiff’s counsel argues
that an award for sanctions remains reasonable because “Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions is 5 times less than the costs expanded in bringing this motion”.
(Reply, p. 5.)
Plaintiff was justified in bringing
the motions. Defendant failed to successfully oppose the motions and sanctions
are therefore mandatory. Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $1,000.00.
Each Defendant and Defendant’s counsel are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to
pay sanctions of $1,000.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days of today’s date.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendant is ordered to provide code compliant responses to form
interrogatories 16.2, 16.3, 16.4 and 16.5 within 30 days of this order. 
Moving party to give notice.
