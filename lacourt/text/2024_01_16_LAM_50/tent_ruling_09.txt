[1]As an initial matter, the Court notes that on December
1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a “Sur-Reply to Defendants’ reply to Opposition to
Anti-SLAPP Motion to Strike.” Plaintiff does not appear to cite any Court order
authorizing him to file a surreply. Thus, the Court disregards the surreply
filed by Plaintiff on December 1, 2023.  
 


[2] Plaintiff
alleges that the sixth cause of action is based upon Civil
Code section 1942.5. (Compl., ¶ 61.) “Civil
Code § 1942.5 prohibits landlords from evicting
residential tenants, raising their rent or decreasing housing services, in retaliation
against the exercise of lawful tenant rights. Proscribed landlord ‘retaliation’
is an affirmative defense to an unlawful detainer; and may render the landlord
liable to aggrieved tenants for damages.” (Friedman et al., Cal. Practice Guide Landlord-Tenant
(The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 7:331 [emphasis
omitted].)
