And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling notes that the defendant's counsel states that they spoke with the plaintiff's counsel about the unavailability of a hearing date for a summary judgment motion, and the plaintiff's counsel raised stipulating to a trial continuance. The defendant's counsel prepared a stipulation to continue trial, but the plaintiff's counsel rejected it. The plaintiff's counsel has also stated that they intend to move forward with a motion for sanctions if the defendant's counsel continues to pursue the motion to continue the trial date. The judge notes that the plaintiff does not request sanctions in their opposition to the instant motion, and that a motion for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 must be made separately from other motions or requests.
