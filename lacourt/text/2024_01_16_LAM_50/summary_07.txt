And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this tentative ruling, Judge Beaudet discloses her own experience with a pickup truck that developed electrical problems 24 years ago. She purchased the truck with her husband, and after multiple visits to the dealer, the manufacturer and dealer agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. Judge Beaudet does not believe that this experience will cause her to be biased in favor of or against either party. However, she allows either party to file and serve a verified statement of disqualification within 14 days if they believe she is biased. The hearing on the case management conference is continued to March 6, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
