And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to continue the trial date from March 20, 2024, to August 31, 2024. The defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, seeks this continuance because its counsel has a paternity leave from mid-February 2024 to mid-April 2024 and because there were no available hearing dates for a motion for summary judgment before the current trial date. The court finds that the defendant has demonstrated good cause for the continuance, as the interests of justice are best served by allowing the defendant to have its motion for summary judgment heard. The court grants the defendant's motion and continues the final status conference and trial date.
