  RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS; 
 
MOTION OF
  PLAINTIFF TO COMPEL DEFENDANT TO PROVIDE FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM

Background
On November 8, 2021,
Plaintiff Maricela Torres (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant
Basta, Inc. (“Defendant”). Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint on January 30, 2023, alleging causes of action for (1) wrongful
termination in violation of public policy, (2) disability discrimination in
violation of FEHA, (3) failure to prevent discrimination in violation of FEHA,
(4) failure to engage in a good faith interactive process in violation of FEHA,
(5) failure to provide reasonable accommodation in violation of FEHA, (5)
failure to provide reasonable accommodation in violation of FEHA, (6)
retaliation in violation of California whistleblower statute, (7) failure to
provide sick leave, (8) failure to reimburse work expenditures in violation of
the California Labor Code, and (9) failure to provide employment records in
violation of the California Labor Code.
            Plaintiff’s
counsel states that on December 6, 2021, Plaintiff served on Defendant
“Requests for Production” and “Form Interrogatories.” (Akopyan Decls., ¶ 4.) On
or about January 30, 2023, Plaintiff re-served such discovery. (Akopyan Decls.,
¶ 5.) 
            On August 15, 2023, the parties
attended an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”). The Court’s August 15, 2023
minute order provides, inter alia, that “[t]he parties agreed and the
Court ordered as follows: Plaintiff will email serve defendant by 5:00p.m. the
first set of form interrogatories, both general and employment, requests for
admissions and requests for production of documents. Defendant will email serve
its verified responses within 30 days, September 14, 2023 by 5:00p.m.” 
            Plaintiff’s counsel indicates that on
August 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel “Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production [Set Two] Propounded to Defendant,” as well as Plaintiff’s
Form Interrogatories – General, Set No. Two and Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories – Employment Law, Set No. Two. (Akopyan Decls., ¶ 10, Exs.
C, emphasis added.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel states that on September 15, 2023, Defendant
served “Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set No. One.”
(Akopyan Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. D, emphasis added.) Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that
“Defendant did not produce documents along with the Responses. Defendant did
not produce any documents since then.” (Akopyan Decl., ¶ 13.) Plaintiff’s
counsel also indicates that on September 15, 2023, Defendant served
“Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories (General), Set
No. One” and “Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories
(Employment), Set No. One.” (Akopyan Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. D, emphasis
added.) 
On September 27, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel sent meet and confer
correspondence to Defendant’s counsel. (Akopyan Decl., ¶ 14, Exs. E.) 
On October 16, 2023, the
parties participate in another IDC. The Court’s October 16, 2023 minute order
provides, inter alia, that “Defendant did not file an Informal
Discovery Conference Statement and Defendant is unable to discuss allegations
that are set forth in Plaintiff’s Informal Discovery Conference Statement filed
October 12, 2023. Therefore, the Court finds today's IDC useless and will not
contribute to resolving the issues set for in Plaintiff’s IDC Statement.
Plaintiff may file their Motions to Compel.” 
Plaintiff now moves for an
order “(1) compelling [Defendant] to provide further responses to all Requests
for Production; (2) compelling Defendant to provide a privilege log; (3)
compelling Defendant to produce all documents it has agreed to produce; and (4)
imposing monetary sanctions jointly and severally against Defendant and its
attorney of record Daniel Bramzon, Esq. in the amount of $6,560.00.” Plaintiff
also moves for an order “(1) compelling [Defendant] to provide further verified
responses to Form Interrogatories, General No’s. General No’s. [sic] 12.1,
13.2, 15.1, 17.1, and Form Interrogatories, Employment Law, Nos. 200.1, 200.3,
200.4, 201.1, 201.2, 201.3, 201.5, 201.6, 207.1, 207.2, 211.1, 216.1, 217.1;
and (2) imposing monetary sanctions jointly and severally against Defendant and
its attorney of record Daniel Bramzon, Esq. in the amount of $6,560.00.” The
motions are unopposed.  
Discussion
A.   
Motion to Compel Further Reponses to “Requests
for Production” 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310,
subdivision (a) provides that “[o]n
receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response
to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to comply
is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.” A
motion under subdivision (a) shall “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand,” and “shall
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration…” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b).) In addition, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction…against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)

As
set forth above, Plaintiff’s notice of motion states that Plaintiff moves, inter
alia, “for an order: (1) compelling [Defendant] to provide
further responses to all Requests for Production; (2) compelling Defendant
to provide a privilege log; (3) compelling Defendant to produce all documents
it has agreed to produce…” (Mot. at p. 1:5-8, emphasis added.) 
As an initial matter, it is unclear which set of requests for
production are the subject of the instant motion. As set forth above,
Plaintiff’s counsel states that on August 15, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant
with “Plaintiff’s Requests for Production [Set Two] Propounded to
Defendant.” (Akopyan Decl., ¶ 10, Ex. C, emphasis added.) However, Plaintiff’s
counsel then indicates that on September 15, 2023, Defendant served
“Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set No. One.”
(Akopyan Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. D, emphasis added.) To the extent Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production, Set Two are the subject of the motion, Plaintiff does
not appear to provide responses by Defendant to such requests. Further, Plaintiff’s
notice of motion does not specify which set of requests for production are the
subject of the motion. 
In addition, Plaintiff’s notice of motion states that she moves for an
order compelling Defendant “to provide further responses to all Requests for
Production.” (Notice of Motion at p. 1:6, emphasis added.). It is unclear
what “all Requests for Production” refers to. In addition, Plaintiff’s separate
statement in support of the motion references requests for production numbers
2, 14, 40-48, 58, 59, 61-69, 72, 74, 75, 79, 81-91, 94, 96, and 98. Thus, it is
unclear whether Plaintiff’s motion is directed to all requests in a certain
(unspecified) set of requests for production, or only certain requests. In
addition, Plaintiff’s separate statement does not appear to specify which set
of requests for production are the subject of the instant motion. 
The Court notes that “[a] notice of motion
must state in the opening paragraph the nature of the order being sought and
the grounds for issuance of the order.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1110, subd. (a).) The Court does not find that Plaintiff’s notice of
motion is adequate. It is also unclear from the memorandum of
points and authorities in support of the motion which set of requests and which
specific requests are at issue. 
In light of the foregoing, the Court denies the “Motion of Plaintiff
to Compel Defendant to Produce Documents, and Provide Further Responses to
Requests for Production and Request for Sanctions.”  
B.    Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300,
subdivision (a) provides that “[o]n receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete.
(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general.”
Such a motion “shall be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) In addition, “[t]he
court shall impose a monetary sanction…against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)

As an initial
matter, it is also unclear which sets of discovery are at issue with
respect to Plaintiff’s motion pertaining to “Form Interrogatories.” 
As discussed, Plaintiff’s counsel states that on August 15, 2023, Plaintiff
served  Defendant with Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories – General, Set No. 2 and Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories – Employment Law, Set No. 2. (Akopyan Decls., ¶ 10, Exs.
C.) However, Plaintiff’s counsel also states that on September 15, 2023,
Defendant served “Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories
(General), Set No. One” and “Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories (Employment), Set No. One.” (Akopyan Decl., ¶ 11, Ex.
D.) It is unclear whether Plaintiff seeks an order pertaining to the first or
second sets of Plaintiff’s form interrogatories. To the extent Plaintiff seeks
an order pertaining to the second sets of Plaintiff’s form interrogatories,
Plaintiff does not appear to provide copies of any responses by Defendant to
such interrogatories. 
Plaintiff’s notice of motion states that Plaintiff moves, inter
alia, for an order “compelling [Defendant] to provide further verified
responses to Form Interrogatories, General No’s. General No’s. [sic] 12.1,
13.2, 15.1, 17.1, and Form Interrogatories, Employment Law, Nos. 200.1, 200.3,
200.4, 201.1, 201.2, 201.3, 201.5, 201.6, 207.1, 207.2, 211.1, 216.1, 217.1.” (Notice
of Motion at p. 1:4-7.) Thus, the notice of motion does not specify which sets
of interrogatories are at issue. As discussed, “[a]
notice of motion must state in the opening paragraph the nature of the order
being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1110, subd. (a).) The Court does not find that Plaintiff’s
notice of motion pertaining to the form interrogatories is adequate. 
In light of the foregoing, the Court denies the “Motion of Plaintiff
to Compel Defendant to Provide Further Responses to Form Interrogatories and
Request for Sanctions.” 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motions are denied. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
