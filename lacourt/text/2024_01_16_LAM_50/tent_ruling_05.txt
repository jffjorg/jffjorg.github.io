  Time:    10:00 a.m. 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANT’S
  MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL DATE, EXTEND ALL RELATED PRE-TRIAL DEADLINES AND
  CUT-OFFS TO COMPORT WITH NEW TRIAL DATE DEADLINES
 



 
Background
On November 4, 2022, Plaintiff Jerry Usselman (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (“Defendant”). The
Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) religious discrimination in
violation of FEHA, (2) disability discrimination in violation of FEHA, (3)
failure to provide reasonable accommodations in violation of FEHA, 
(4)
failure to engage in good faith interactive process in violation of FEHA, (5)
retaliation in violation of FEHA, and (6) failure to prevent discrimination
and/or retaliation in violation of FEHA. 
The
trial date in this action is currently set for March 20, 2024.         
Defendant now moves for
an order continuing the March 20, 2024 trial date to August 31, 2024, or as
soon thereafter as the Court can accommodate and continuing all related
pre-trial dates and discovery deadlines in accordance with the new trial date. Plaintiff opposes.  
            Discussion
“The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.
(c).) “In ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the court must
consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the
determination.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subd.
(d).) 
            Defendant
asserts that good cause exists for continuing the trial date here. In
his supporting declaration, Defendant’s counsel states that “[o]n August 11,
2023, my office attempted to reserve the earliest date for a hearing on a
motion for summary judgment/adjudication. No hearing dates before the March 20,
2024 trial (and with enough time to provide timely notice of same) were
available. Ultimately, my office reserved the earliest date available for a
hearing on a motion for summary judgment/ adjudication, which was August 1, 2024.
After October 23, 2023, I have repeatedly checked the Court’s Reservation
System to see if any summary judgment hearing dates prior to trial (and with
enough time to provide timely notice of same) have become available and have
seen none.” (Waneis Decl., ¶ 7.) 
            Defendant asserts that “[t]he
interests of justice are best served by a continuance. Granting a trial
continuance is in the interest of justice and judicial economy, as Defendant
believes that the ruling on its MSJ/MSA will obviate the need for a trial in
this matter or significantly limit the issues to be determined by the fact
finder.” (Mot. at p. 7:15-19.) Defendant further asserts that “[a]bsent a
continuance, Defendant will undoubtedly be prejudiced by commencing trial on
March 20, 2024, before Defendant’s MSJ/MSA can be heard.” (Mot. at p. 2:14-16.)
Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, circumstances relevant to
the Court’s determination of a motion for a trial continuance include, inter
alia, “[w]hether the interests of
justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by
imposing conditions on the continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(10).) 
Another
circumstance relevant to the Court’s determination is “[w]hether there was any previous continuance, extension of
time, or delay of trial due to any party.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(2).) Defendant’s counsel states that “[t]here
has been no previous continuance of trial in this case.” (Waneis Decl., ¶ 14.)
In addition, circumstances relevant to the Court’s determination include “[a]ny other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair
determination of the motion or application.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332, subd. (d)(11).) Defendant’s counsel states that he “intend[s] to be on
paternity leave from mid-February 2024 to mid-April 2024.” (Waneis Decl., ¶
13.) 
In the opposition, Plaintiff asserts that “Plaintiff has had his
deposition taken as [sic] is prepared to go to trial on the merits. Any delay
in the case, would lead to prejudice, since it would be a delay to his day in
court. As to the factor (10), the interests of justice are not served with a
continuance, because LAUSD should not be bailed out from its counsel’s
negligence.” (Opp’n at p. 4:21-24.) In the reply, Defendant counters that
“Plaintiff seems to suggest that the Court’s unavailability of an earlier
MSJ/MSA hearing date is somehow due to Defendant’s counsel’s ‘negligence;’ this
is absurd. No earlier hearing dates were available and the parties were
initially amendable [sic] to a trial continuance.” (Reply at p. 3:12-14.)[1] 
In the opposition, Plaintiff also notes that on December 1, 2023, the
Court issued a minute order providing, inter alia, that “DEFENDANTS EX
PARTE APPICATION FOR AN ORDER TO CONTINUE TRIAL AND RELATED PRE-TRIAL DEADLINES
AND DEADLINES TO AUGUST 1, 2024, AND SETTING THE HEARING ON DEFENDANTS MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT FOR JUNE 3, 2024 IN ORDER FOR DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR SUMMARY
filed by LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT on 11/30/2023 is Denied. Denied
pursuant to C.R.C. 3.1202(c).” 
On December 5, 2023, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter
alia, that “DEFENDANTS EX PARTE APPICATION FOR AN ORDER TO ADVANCE
DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT HEARING DATE filed by LOS ANGELES
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT on 12/05/2023 is Denied. Pursuant to CRC 3.1204 (b)(1)
declaration is silent on proposed opposition, if any.” In addition, on December
6, 2023, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter alia, that
“DEFENDANTS EX PARTE APPICATION FOR AN ORDER TO ADVANCE DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR
SUMMARY JUDGMENT HEARING DATE filed by LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT on
12/05/2023 is Denied. Paragraph 7 of Declaration of Peter Waneis is largely
hearsay and not considered. Denied pursuant to C.R.C
3.1202(c).” 
Plaintiff appears to argue that because the foregoing ex parte
applications were denied, the instant motion must also be denied. As noted by
Defendant, Plaintiff does not provide authority for such an assertion. 
As discussed, Defendant’s counsel states that “[o]n August 11, 2023,
[his] office attempted to reserve the earliest date for a hearing on a motion
for summary judgment/adjudication. No hearing dates before the March 20, 2024
trial (and with enough time to provide timely notice of same) were available.
Ultimately, [his] office reserved the earliest date available for a hearing on
a motion for summary judgment/ adjudication, which was August 1, 2024.” (Waneis
Decl., ¶ 7.) Defendant asserts that “[a]s this hearing date is after the
currently set trial date, a continuance is necessary to allow Defendant to have
its motion for summary judgment heard.” (Mot. at p. 7:8-9.) Based on the
foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant has demonstrated that “the interests of justice are best served by a continuance.”
(Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(10).) In Sentry Ins.
Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 530, cited by Defendant, the Court of Appeal noted
that “[w]e are sympathetic to the
problems the trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many
motions for summary judgment. However, the solution to these problems cannot
rest in a refusal to hear timely motions.” 
Based on the foregoing,
the Court finds that Defendant has demonstrated good cause for a trial continuance.[2]
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
motion is granted.
The Court continues the
final status conference to ______________, at 10:00 a.m., in Dept. 50 and trial
to _____________, at 9:30 a.m., in Dept. 50.
All discovery deadlines
are continued based on the new trial date. 
Defendant is ordered to
give notice of this ruling.
