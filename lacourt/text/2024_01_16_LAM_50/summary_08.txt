And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to strike the sixth cause of action of the Complaint and paragraph 22 of the Complaint. The motion was filed by the defendants, Victoria Billings and 5523 Harold Way, LLC, to strike the sixth cause of action, which is for "retaliation eviction." The defendants argue that the cause of action arises from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute, but the court finds that the complaint is based on the dispute or conduct underlying the alleged unlawful detainer action, rather than the service of a notice of termination or the filing of an unlawful detainer complaint. The court also finds that the motion is not frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.

The court notes that the anti-SLAPP statute is a mechanism through which complaints that arise from the exercise of free speech rights can be evaluated at an early stage of the litigation process and resolved expeditiously. The court also cites to several cases, including Ulkarim v. Westfield LLC, which holds that a tenant's complaint against a landlord filed after the service of a notice of termination and the filing of a complaint for unlawful detainer does not arise from those particular activities if the gravamen of the tenant's complaint challenges the decision to terminate the tenancy or other conduct in connection with the termination apart from the service of a notice of termination or filing of an unlawful detainer complaint.

The court denies the defendants' request for attorney's fees and costs, as they are not the prevailing party on the motion.
