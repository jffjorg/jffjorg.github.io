[1]In his declaration
in support of the motion, Defendant’s counsel states that “I spoke with
Plaintiff’s counsel, Amanda Collins, about the unavailability of a hearing date
on a summary judgment motion before the current trial date and Ms. Collins
raised stipulating to a trial continuance to allow such a motion to be heard. I
then began preparing a stipulation to continue trial, consistent with my
discussion with Ms. Collins.” (Waneis Decl., ¶ 8.) Defendant’s counsel states
that “On October 27, 2023, after I had followed up with Ms. Collins regarding a
stipulation to continue trial so that Defendant’s MSJ/MSA could be heard,
Plaintiff’s counsel, Ali Sachani, emailed me stating Plaintiff is not amenable
to continue the trial date.” (Waneis Decl., ¶ 11.) 


[2]The Court notes
that Plaintiff also states in the opposition that “Plaintiff’s counsel intends
to move forward with the Motion for Sanctions pursuant to CCP 128.7, should Defense Counsel continue to proceed
with this Motion to Continue the Trial and related dates.” (Opp’n at p.
5:26-28.) Plaintiff does not request sanctions in the opposition to the instant
motion, and as noted by Defendant, a motion for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 “shall be made separately
from other motions or requests…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (c)(1).)
