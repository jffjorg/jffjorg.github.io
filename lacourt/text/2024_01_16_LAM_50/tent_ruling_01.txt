PLAINTIFF
  CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUP, INC.’S MOTION FOR DEEMED ADMISSIONS AGAINST
  DEFENDANT PEGASUS TRUCKING, LLC DBA FALLAS DISCOUNT STORES TO REQUESTS FOR
  ADMISSION, SET TWO
 



 
Plaintiff Consumer
Advocacy Group, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order compelling Defendant
Pegasus Trucking, LLC dba Fallas Discount Stores (“Defendant”) to provide
initial responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set Two. Plaintiff
also moves for an order that the truth of the matters specified in Plaintiff’s
second set of Requests for Admission, served upon Defendant, be deemed
admitted.
Plaintiff’s motions will be continued to a
new date as set forth below. NO HEARINGS WILL TAKE PLACE ON JANUARY 16,
2024.   
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court
orders the parties in this case to participate in an Informal Discovery
Conference (“IDC”). (Note:¿The Court’s policy regarding IDCs appears in the
Courtroom Information available in Dept. 50 and on the Court’s website.)¿Lead
or other designated counsel for the parties with full authority are ordered to
participate in person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel
regarding available dates, Plaintiff must make
a prompt reservation for the IDC using the Court’s online reservation system. Plaintiff must file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the department
seven days prior to the IDC, and the responding parties may file the same form
in the department setting forth a response three days prior to the IDC.   
Once Plaintiff has
confirmed an IDC date, Plaintiff must use the
Court’s online reservation system to continue the motions to a post-IDC
discovery hearing date. The parties are ordered to have with them whatever
materials are needed to make the IDC session productive and successful. Prior
to the IDC date, lead or other designated counsel for the parties, with full
authority, are to meet and confer, in person or via telephone
in a further attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before
the IDC. (See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).) If the parties resolve
their discovery disputes before the IDC date, Plaintiff is ordered to take both the IDC and the motions off
calendar as soon as possible. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
