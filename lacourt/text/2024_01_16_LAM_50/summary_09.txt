And here is the English-text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling begins by noting that the Plaintiff filed a surreply on December 1, 2023, without authorization, and therefore disregards the document. The Court then turns to the sixth cause of action, which the Plaintiff alleges is based on Civil Code section 1942.5, which prohibits landlords from evicting residential tenants, raising their rent, or decreasing housing services in retaliation against the exercise of lawful tenant rights.
