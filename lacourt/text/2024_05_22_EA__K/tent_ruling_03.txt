MHC
30 (Walnut CA) LLC’s Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
This is an unlawful detainer action
involving the commercial premises located at 975 Fairway Drive, Walnut, CA
91789 (“subject property”).
On March 3, 2023, Plaintiff MHC 30 (Walnut CA)
LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for
Unlawful Detainer against Albert Halim dba The Wheel Supply, Inc. (Defendant”)
and Does 1-10.
On July 24, 2023, Defendant’s default was entered and on
August 10, 2023, a clerk’s default judgment for possession only was entered.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is set for May
22, 2024.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
The only declaration submitted in support of the
instant default prove-up application is from Plaintiff’s attorney Eric Leenerts
(“Leenerts”). No declarations are submitted from any members of Plaintiff. It
is unclear to the court how Leenerts would have personal knowledge of the
underlying facts and be capable of authenticating the Industrial Lease
Agreement. Further, “[a]n affidavit based on information and belief is hearsay
and must be disregarded.” (Baustert v. Superior Court (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 1269, 1275, fn. 5 [quotations and citation omitted].) Paragraph 5
and the first sentence of Paragraph 10 are based on information and belief.
2.                 
Plaintiff seeks $19,932.00 in attorney’s fees, but has
not provided the court with any fee statements. The court, moreover, is
inclined to award attorney’s fees in accordance with the default schedule set
forth in Local Rule 3.214, as the instant case appears to be a straightforward
unlawful detainer case.
3.                 
Plaintiff’s Judicial Council Form CIV-100 Request for
Entry of Default filed July 24, 2023 lists attorney’s fees as $13,098.00 and
costs as $1,527.92 and does not reference holdover damages whatsoever. The
proposed judgment seeks $25,600.00 in holdover damages, $1,847.92 in costs and
$19,932.00 in attorney’s fees. These discrepancies must be reconciled.
4.                 
The court will not entertain piecemeal submissions.
Plaintiff is instructed to comply with California Rules of Court rule 3.1800
with any future submission.
5.                 
Plaintiff’s proposed judgment utilizes Judicial Council
optional Form UD-110 [New January 1, 2003. In the event Plaintiff elects to
resubmit its proposed judgment utilizing Judicial Council optional Form UD-110,
Plaintiff should submit same on “UD-110 [Rev. January 1, 2024]”.
