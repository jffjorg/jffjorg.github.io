  Case Number:  19STCV21535    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff Guifeng
Zhang’s Motion for Entry of Judgment to Enforce Settlement is DENIED without
prejudice. 
Background[1]  
On or about
July 8, 2018, Plaintiff Guifeng Zhang (“Zhang”) underwent a cosmetic surgical
facelift procedure performed by Joseph Dinglasan, M.D. (“Dinglasan”). Zhang alleges
that the procedure was not properly performed, that the operating facility was
not properly sanitized and equipped, and that her stitches were not removed by
medical personnel.
On June 20,
2019, Zhang filed a complaint, asserting a cause of action against Defendants Ebenezer
Medical Clinic, Dinglasan and Does 1-100 for:
1.                 
Negligence
On July 22, 2019, Eben Ezer DB Inc. (“Eben Ezer”) and
Dinglasan filed a cross-complaint against Zhang and Roes 1-100, asserting
causes of action for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
2.                 
Fraud
On October 24, 2019, this action was transferred from the
personal injury hub (Department 3) to this department.
On November
21, 2019, the court sustained Zhang’s demurrer to the cross-complaint, without
leave to amend.
On May 22,
2023, a “Joint Stipulation and Request for the Court to Retain Jurisdiction
Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6; Order Thereon”
was entered.
An Order to
Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement) is set for June 3, 2024.
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court for an order, per Code of Civil Procedure §
664.6, enforcing the settlement and entering judgment in accordance with the
terms of the settlement. Plaintiff also requests $960.00 in attorneys’ fees and
costs.
The motion is denied
without prejudice, due to the notice deficiency identified above.
Additionally, page 4 of Exhibit B appears to be missing from the copy of the
motion filed with the court; any future filing must include a full and complete
copy of the Agreement.
