 Case Number:  24PSCV00020    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff
Comerica Bank’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff Comerica Bank (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On December 20, 2019, Benny’s General
Building Inc. (“BGBI”) executed and delivered to Plaintiff a Revolving
Installment Note (“Note”) and Commercial Security Agreement (“CSA”) (together,
“Loan Documents”) pursuant to which BGBI borrowed and promised to pay to
Plaintiff the principal sum of $60,000.00, together with interest, in monthly
installments as stated in the Note. The CSA granted Plaintiff a security
interest in certain personal property (“Collateral”) described therein.
Milagros Maria Serrano Ortiz (“Ortiz”) and Marcoss M. Espinoza (“Espinoza”)
executed guaranties. On July 20, 2023, BGBI defaulted under the Loan Documents
by failing to make the payment due. 
On January 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting
causes of action against BGBI, Ortiz, Espinoza and Does 1-100 for:
1.                 
Breach of Promissory Note
2.                 
Foreclosure of Security Agreement and Possession of
Collateral
3.                 
Breach of Personal Guaranty
4.                 
Breach of Personal Guaranty
5.                 
Money Lent
6.                 
Account Stated
7.                 
Unjust Enrichment
On March 11, 2024, BGBI’s default was entered.
A Case Management Conference is set for May 22, 2024.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff has failed to provide the court with a brief
summary of the case, as per 
California Rules
of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(1).
2.                 
Plaintiff has failed to comply with CRC Rule 3.1800,
subdivision (a)(7) (i.e., Plaintiff must include “[a] dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported
by a showing of grounds for each judgment”). While Plaintiff has dismissed Does
1-100, Plaintiff has not provided the court with a section 579 application.
Espinoza filed a general denial on March 6, 2024. Ortiz has been served, but
has not filed a responsive pleading or been dismissed or defaulted, to date (i.e.,
as of March 19, 2024, 11:30 a.m.). 
3.                 
Plaintiff has not provided the court with any evidence
of the Prime interest rate in effect.
