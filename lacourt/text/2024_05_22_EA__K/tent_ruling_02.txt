[1]              The proof of service accompanying
the motion filed April 3, 2024 reflects that the motion was mail-served to
Garrett Skelly (“Skelly”) only at “709 Bowcreek Drive Diamond Bar CA 91765”
(“Bowcreek Drive Address”). The court notes that the “Settlement Agreement and
Release in Full of All Claims and Rights” (“Agreement”) was executed as of
March 20, 2023. (Shambaugh Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. B.) The “Joint Stipulation and
Request for the Court to Retain Jurisdiction Pursuant to California Code of
Civil Proc Section 664/6. Order Thereon” (“Stipulation/Order”) was entered May
22, 2023; however, it had been executed by the settling parties and their
counsel in March 2023. On April 24, 2023 (i.e., between the time the Agreement
and Stipulation/Order was executed by the settling parties and the time the
Stipulation/Order was entered), a “Substitution of Attorney” was filed, wherein
Skelly substituted out as Dinglasan’s counsel of record and Dinglasan became
self-represented. Dinglasan’s address in the “Substitution of Attorney” is
listed as the Bowcreek Drive Address and Skelly’s address is listed therein as
“160 Centennial Way Ste 21 Tustin CA 92780;” while the motion appears to have
been sent to the correct address, it was not listed to the appropriate
addressee.
