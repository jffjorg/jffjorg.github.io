And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling states that the petition raises issues related to the Public Safety Agency's (PSA) actions, which are governed by traditional mandate. The court must determine whether the PSA's actions were arbitrary, capricious, or lacking in evidentiary support, or whether the agency failed to follow the required procedure and give the required notices. The judge also references a section of the City of Los Angeles code that states that rules, regulations, orders, and directives shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon announcement of the termination of a local emergency. The judge is seeking to determine whether the PSA followed the required procedure and gave the required notices in this situation.
