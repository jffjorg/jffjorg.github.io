            Petitioner Cynthia Sims (“Petitioner”), a self-represented
litigant, filed this petition for writ of mandate against Respondent Kimberley
Johnson, Director of the California Department of Social Services (the “Department”
or “Respondent”).  In 1998, a teacher
reported that Petitioner had hit her daughter with a switch, leaving marks.  Further investigation revealed that
Petitioner had also used a switch on her grandchildren.  Petitioner pleaded no contest to misdemeanor
child abuse; the completed court-ordered parenting classes; and the charges
were dismissed.  Then, in 2019,
Petitioner submitted an application seeking custody of some of her other
grandchildren.  Petitioner did not
cooperate with the interview, though she admitted that she hit her daughter
with a switch and left marks on her. 
When asked if she would do things differently, Petitioner said she
should have “kicked the teacher’s ass” and expressed no remorse for her
actions.  Therefore, the County denied
Petitioner’s application, and Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate to set aside
that decision.  
 
            The
court has no tentative order on this petition for writ of mandate.
