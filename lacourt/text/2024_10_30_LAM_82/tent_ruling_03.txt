[Tentative] Order Granting Petition for
Writ of Mandate
  
            
INTRODUCTION 
 
In December 2022,
Mayor Karen Bass declared a local emergency in
response to the City of Los Angeles’s ongoing housing and homelessness
crisis.  As authorized by the City Charter,
the Mayor issued Executive Directive No. 1 (“ED1”),
which created a streamlined ministerial approval process for 100 percent
affordable housing projects throughout the City.  Petitioner Mamba 24 LLC (“Mamba”) applied
to build a 100 percent affordable housing project in a single-family
residential zone.  The City initially
acknowledged that the project was “eligible” for the ED1 process.  Then, the Mayor amended ED1 to exclude
projects in single-family zones.  The  City informed Mamba that its project no longer
qualified for ministerial review under ED1 and that the project would be
subject to discretionary review.  The
City deemed Mamba’s application incomplete after Mamba did not submit
application materials and pay the fees required for a discretionary
project.  Mamba appealed the decision, and
the City Council voted to uphold the City’s incompleteness determination.  
 
Petitioners Yes In
My Back Yard, Sonja Trauss, and Mamba (collectively, “Petitioners”) now petition
for a writ of mandate directing Respondents City of Los Angeles and the City
Council (collectively, the “City” or “Respondents”) to, among other things, set
aside the denial of Mamba’s appeal under the Permit Streamlining Act (“PSA”)
and to process Mamba’s development application for an affordable housing
project pursuant to the Housing Accountability Act (“HAA”).  Because Mamba filed a preliminary application
that included all information required by state law, the project was vested by
operation of law in the ED1 ministerial review process.  Accordingly, the City violated the PSA and
HAA when it denied Mamba’s appeal and upheld the City’s incompleteness
determination.  The petition for writ of
mandate is granted.  The court has no
tentative order on the issue whether the City acted in bad faith.   
 
BACKGROUND 
 
A.        The
Mayor’s Emergency Declaration and Executive Directive 1 
 
On December 12, 2022, Mayor Karen
Bass issued a Declaration of Local Emergency (the “Declaration”), pursuant to
City Charter section 231(i) and Los Angeles Administrative Code (“LAAC”)
section 8.27, in response to the City’s ongoing housing and homelessness
crisis.  (Petitioner’s Request for
Judicial Notice (“RJN”) Exh. A.)  The
Declaration states that “the continuing state of emergency shall be regularly
evaluated, in coordination with City Council.” (Ibid.)  The Declaration of Local Emergency remains
operative, nearly two years later, and has been ratified by the City
Council.  (See RJN Exh. H.)  
 
On December 16, 2022, Mayor Bass
issued Executive Directive No. 1 (“ED1”) ordering the “Expedition of Permits
and Clearances for Temporary Shelters and Affordable Housing Types.”  (AR 713.) 
In ED1, the Mayor ordered that: 
 
Applications for 100% affordable housing projects, or for
Shelter as defined in Section 12.03 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC)
(hereinafter referred to as Shelter), shall be, and hereby are deemed exempt
from discretionary review processes otherwise required by either the zoning
provisions of Chapter 1 of the LAMC or other Project Review including Site Plan
Review as described in LAMC Section 16.05 and LAMC Section 13B.2.4, as long as
such plans do not require any zoning change, variance, or General Plan
amendment. All City departments are directed to process all plans for such 100
percent affordable housing projects or Shelter using the streamlined
ministerial review process currently used for projects eligible under
Government Code section 65913.4, State Density Bonus law.
 
(AR 713 at ¶ 1.)
 
            On
February 9, 2023, the City issued implementation guidelines for ED1 (the “Guidelines”)
that outlined the eligibility criteria and procedures for projects seeking ministerial
approval under ED1. (RJN Exh. B.)  In
relevant part, the Guidelines state: 
 
An ED 1 project may qualify for
vesting of City ordinances policies and standards through either the submittal
of plans sufficient for a complete plan check to LADBS, consistent with LAMC
§12.26-A.3 or the submittal of a complete Housing Crisis Act (HCA) Vesting
Preliminary Application prior to case filing.
 
(Id. at 11.)  The Guidelines also state: “Most housing
projects qualify to submit an optional HCA Vesting Preliminary Application,
which ‘locks in’ local planning and zoning rules at the time the complete
application is submitted.”  (Id. at
14.)
 
B.        Mamba
Submitted a Preliminary Application under ED1
 
On
March 21, 2023, Mamba submitted a Housing Crisis Act (“HCA”) preliminary
application for an affordable housing project at 10898, 10898 1/2, and 10900
West Olinda Street, in the City of Los Angeles (the “Olinda Project” or the
“Project”). (AR 137-47.)  In their
opposition, Respondents have not disputed that the Olinda Project qualifies as
a “100 percent affordable housing project” within the meaning of ED1.  
 
In the application, Mamba proposed
to replace two existing single-family dwellings, which are to be demolished,
with a three-story affordable housing development with 78 new affordable rental
units.  (AR 138-139.)  On March 23, 2023, a City planning staff
person signed the preliminary application, verified a “submittal completion
date” of March 21, 2023, and checked the box identifying the project as “ED1
eligible.”  (AR 137.)  The City assigned the application an
“administrative review” case number (Case No. ADM-2023-4205).  (Ibid.)  
 
            Mamba also
submitted an Affordable Housing Referral Form (“AHRF”) to the City’s Affordable
Housing Services Section (“AHSS”).  (AR
171.)  On May 9, 2023, AHSS staff signed
the form and assigned it an ED1 case number (Case No. PAR-2023-2458-AHRF-ED1).
(Ibid.)  
 
            On
June 6, 2023, Mamba submitted a formal Department of City Planning application
for the Project.  (AR 184-190.)  By June 21, 2023, Mamba had paid $2,926.98 for
a building permit and a certificate of occupancy (AR 107) and $4,892.94 for
administrative review and other application fees (AR 229).  
 
C.        The Mayor Amended ED1 
 
On June 21, 2023, Mayor Bass issued an
amended version of ED1 (“Amended ED1”).  Amended
ED1 was largely the same as ED1 except that it excluded any 100 percent
affordable housing projects “located in a single family or more restrictive
zone.”  (AR 764.)
 
D.        The City Deemed the Project Ineligible under
ED1 
 
On
July 6, 2023, the City sent Mamba a letter referring to Amended ED1 and stating
that “the
proposed project located at 10898, 10898 1/2, and 10900 West Olinda Street is
in the R1-1-CUGU [single-family] zone and is not eligible for ED1 processing.”  (AR 296.) 
On July 10, 2023, City Planning informed Mamba that
its application was incomplete.  City
Planning identified the following items for correction: (1) there was no
Environmental Assessment Form (“EAF”); (2) the AHRF was inconsistent with
Project plans with regard to the number of Very Low Income Units; (3) there
were no Landscape Plans as part of the Project Plan submission; and (4) the
entitlement number needed conversion from an administrative review case number
(starting with “ADM”) to a different case number for City Planning Commission
(“CPC”) review (Case No. CPC-2023-4205-DB-PHP-VHCA).  (AR 1125-1127.)  City Planning also invoiced Mamba for more
than $35,000 in additional fees in connection with the conversion of the
application from “ADM” to “CPC” review. 
(AR 300-301.)
 
On August 4, 2023, City Planning sent
Mamba a Second Status of Project Review explaining that the Project did not
qualify for ED1 processing and was converted to a regular entitlement process
under the new “CPC” case number. (AR 1128.) 
City Planning also referred to the prior incompleteness determination,
including the need to provide the EAF materials required for discretionary review
under the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”).  (AR 1129.)
 
In July and August 2023, Mamba’s
representative asked City staff to explain why the Project would be subject to
Amended ED1.  (AR 806-809.)  It appears that City staff did not respond to
that request in July or August 2023.  (Ibid.)  On September 27, 2023, Mamba provided a
response to the City’s July 10, 2023, incompleteness letter.  (AR 815, 821, 852.)  Mamba indicated that the EAF materials were
not required because the Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to ED1, and that
Mamba would appeal “under SB330 vesting” the City’s determination to convert
the Project from “ADM” to “CPC” processing. 
With respect to items two and four in the City’s incompleteness letter, Mamba
provided revised plans, indicated that the AHRF was correct with respect to the
number of Very Low Income Units, and provided landscape plans.  (AR 852.)  
 
On November 22, 2023, City Planning sent Mamba
a letter of non-compliance pursuant to California Government Code section 65589.5(j)(2)
explaining that the Project was inconsistent and not in compliance with the
City’s Zoning Code with regard to density/use, residential floor area, setbacks
/ encroachment plane, vehicular parking, bicycle parking, and open
space/landscape. (AR 1026–30.) The City identified missing information and
requested a response within 30 days. (AR 1030, 1133–37.) Specifically, the City
requested the EAF for environmental analysis, supplemental documents to
accompany the EAF, and payment of outstanding fees. (AR 1030.)
 
E.         Mamba Appealed the City’s
Incompleteness Determination 
 
On
December 1, 2023, Mamba filed an administrative appeal of the City’s
incompleteness determination.  (AR
979-993.)  Mamba argued that “as a matter of
State law the HCA Preliminary Application filed for the Project grants vesting
protections that require the City's continued ED 1 processing of the Case
Filing, as the Project became vested prior to the issuance of the Revised ED
1.”  (AR 981.)  Mamba analyzed the HAA, as follows:
 
[T]he
HAA specifically, intentionally and very broadly defines “ordinances, policies,
and standards” to include “general plan, community plan, specific plan, zoning,
design review standards and criteria, subdivision standards and criteria, and
any other rules, regulations, requirements, and policies of a local agency.”
Given this statutory provision, any attempt by the City to claim that ED 1 - a
formal regulation promulgated pursuant to the Mayor’s authority under the
City's Administrative Code - cannot be vested against because it is not an
ordinance directly contradicts the plain statutory language and crystal clear
intent of both the HCA and HAA.
 
(AR
991, emphasis in original.)  
 
F.         The City Council Grants Vesting Rights
to a Similarly Situated Project 
 
City Planning also deemed a different
affordable housing project, at 5511 North Ethel Avenue (“Ethel Project”), ineligible
for ED1 and the applicant appealed.   On
September 14, 2023, the State, through its Department of Housing and Community
Development (“HCD”), sent the City Council a Letter of Technical Assistance
sharing HCD’s views with respect to the Ethel appeal.  (RJN Exh. C.) 
HCD’s letter stated: “The central question between the City and the
Applicant is as follows: Is an executive directive one of the rules,
regulations, requirements, and policies that vest upon submission of a complete
Preliminary Application? The answer is ‘yes.’” (RJN Exh. C.)  HCD’s letter further explained that “ED1 is
not excluded from the expansive HAA definition of ‘ordinances, policies, and
standards’” and is therefore eligible for vesting. (Ibid.)
 
At the City Council meeting on September
26, 2023, some City Council members recognized the precedential nature of the
Ethel appeal.  As examples, Councilmember
Rodriguez stated, “the process is gonna be delineated here today by this action
for all future projects.” (RJN Exh. E at 34.) 
Councilmember Yaroslavsky stated: 
 
So I'm
going to be voting yes today in support of the appeal, and I want to say why.
My vote is largely centered on the fact that if we deny this appeal today, we
are very likely going to lose in court on this project and the other projects
that are in a similar position, and it's gonna cost taxpayers millions of
dollars we cannot afford to lose. As we discussed earlier, the state of
California Housing and Community Development -- Housing Accountability Unit has
made their position clear on this matter, that ED-1 does constitute a policy
under which these projects are vested, and our own planning department
initially said so as well.
 
(Id.
at 39-40.)  After deliberation, the
City Council voted 8 to 5 to grant the Ethel Project appeal and determine that the
Ethel Project could vest in ED1’s ministerial process, even though the Ethel
Project was located in a single-family residential zone.  (Id. at 64; RJN Exh. F.)
 
G.        The City Council Denied Mamba’s Appeal
of the Incompleteness Determination 
 
On
January 11, 2024, City Planning issued an Appeal Recommendation Report
recommending that the City Council deny Mamba’s appeal of the incompleteness
determination.  (AR 410-423.)  In summary, City Planning opined that “ED1 is not a
standard, ordinance or policy that is subject to the vesting rules in” the HAA
or the HCA.  (AR 413; see also AR
419-422.)  At
its meeting on January 30, 2024, the City Council considered Mamba’s
appeal.  (AR 1150, 1165.)  The City Council unanimously denied the
appeal.  (AR 1150.)  The meeting transcripts do not include any express
findings or deliberation of the City Council with respect to Mamba’s
appeal.  (See AR 1151-1246.)  However, the motion approved by the City
Council adopted the reasoning of the City Planning’s appeal report dated
January 11, 2024.  (AR 1149-1150.)
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
This is an action to enforce the Housing
Accountability Act (“HAA”).  Although
Petitioners also plead a cause of action under the Permit Streamlining Act
(“PSA”), the “completeness” of Mamba’s application under the PSA is,
fundamentally, a question of whether ED1 granted vesting rights to the Project
under the HAA.  Accordingly, the standard
of review from the HAA governs that issue. 

 
The HAA requires that, “[a]ny action
brought to enforce the provisions of this section shall be brought pursuant to
Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. . . .”  (Gov. Code § 65589.5(m)(1).)  The court’s task “is therefore to determine
whether the City proceeded in the manner required by law,’with a decision
supported by the findings, and findings supported by the evidence; if not, the
City abused its discretion.”  (Cal. Renters Legal Advocacy and Education Fund v.
City of San Mateo (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 820, 837, citations
and internal quotations omitted.)  The City
“bear[s] the burden of proof that its decision has conformed to all of the
conditions specified in Section 65589.5.” 
(Gov. Code § 65589.6.)[1]  
 
            The court exercises independent
judgment on questions of law arising in mandate proceedings, such as the
interpretation of a statute or regulation. 
(See Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017)
15 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.)  To the
extent “purely legal issues involve the interpretation of a statute [or
regulation] an administrative agency is responsible for enforcing, [the court]
exercise[s] [its] independent judgment, taking into account and respecting the
agency’s interpretation of its meaning.” 
(Housing Partners I, Inc. v.
Duncan (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343, citations and internal quotations
omitted; see also Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. Of Equalization (1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 11.)  How much weight to accord an agency's
construction is “situational,” and depends on the circumstances.  (See American
Coatings Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist. (2012) 54
Cal.4th 446, 461-462.)
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES 
 
            Petitioner seeks judicial notice of Exhibit A through
Exhibit J.  Respondent does not oppose
the request.  Consistent with
section 1094.5(e), the court may consider these exhibits for purposes of
statutory construction.  Therefore, the
request is granted.  However, the court
would reach the same result on the petition even if judicial notice was denied.
            
            Respondent
seeks judicial notice of a decision by another Superior Court Judge.  Although Petitioner does not oppose the
request, it is denied.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 8.1115(a); B.F. v.
Sup.Ct. (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 621, 627, fn. 2 [denying judicial notice
because “trial court decisions are not precedent”].)

 
DISCUSSION  
 
A.        ED1 Is Subject to the
Vesting Provisions of the HCA and HAA 
 
In denying Mamba’s appeal, the City Council adopted the City
Planning appeal report, which concluded that “ED1 is not a standard, ordinance or
policy that is subject to the vesting rules in” the HAA or the HCA.  (AR 413, 419-422, 1149-1150.)  Petitioners
contend that the City Council erred in its interpretation of the HAA.  (Opening Brief (“OB”) 13-16.)  
 
The rules governing
statutory construction are well settled. We begin with the fundamental premise
that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate
legislative intent.  To determine
legislative intent, we turn first to the words of the statute, giving them
their usual and ordinary meaning. When the language of a statute is clear, we
need go no further. However, when the language is susceptible of more than one
reasonable interpretation, we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including
the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the
legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative
construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.  
 
(Nolan v. City of Anaheim (2004)
33 Cal.4th 335, 340 [internal citations omitted].) 
 
In 2019, the Legislature enacted the HCA and added a new
“preliminary application” process designed to “stop[] [local governments] from
changing the rules on builders who are in the midst of going through the
approval process.”  (RJN Exh. G at 7; see
also Gov. Code 
§ 65941.1(a).)  Under
the HAA, a
housing developer that submits a preliminary application that contains all the
information required by section 65941.1(a) “shall be subject only to the ordinances,
policies, and standards” in effect at the time the preliminary application is
submitted. (§ 65589.5(o)(1).)  The HAA
defines “ordinances, policies, and standards” broadly to include “general plan,
community plan, specific plan, zoning, design review standards and criteria,
subdivision standards and criteria, and any other rules, regulations,
requirements, and policies of a local agency … including those relating to
development impact fees, capacity or connection fees or charges, permit or
processing fees, and other exactions.” (Gov. Code § 65589.5(o)(4), emphasis
added.)  
 
Here, ED1 orders
that “[a]pplications for 100% affordable
housing projects . . . shall be, and hereby are deemed exempt from
discretionary review processes otherwise required by either the zoning
provisions of Chapter 1 of the LAMC or other Project Review including Site Plan
Review ….”  (AR 713.)  It is undisputed that the Project is a “100%
affordable housing project” within the meaning of ED1 and that Mamba submitted
a preliminary application that contained all the information required by section 65941.1(a).  (See AR
137-47.)  Thus, the court need only determine
whether ED1
fits within the HAA’s definition of “ordinances, policies, and standards.”
 
ED1 was issued by
the Mayor pursuant to section 231(i) and (j) of the City Charter.  Section 231(i) of the City Charter states
that the Mayor “shall have the power and duty to: … declare a local emergency ….”  Section 231(j) states that the Mayor has the
power and duty to issue “executive directives, which, in the absence of
conflicting provisions in the Charter or ordinance, and until revised
or rescinded by the Mayor, shall be binding on all departments,
commissions, appointed officers and employees of the City.”  (RJN Exh. C at 3.)  Respondents do not argue that ED1 conflicted
with the Charter or City ordinances in any way. 
Thus, because ED1 sets forth a “binding” development rule, it falls
within the HAA’s broad definition of “ordinances, policies, and standards.” 
 
The City concluded
that an emergency directive, like ED1, “does not carry with it the legislative
intent of process, procedures, and development regulations expected to be
vested under Government Code Sections 65589.5 and 65941.1.”  (AR 421.) 
However, the plain language of the statute shows that the Legislature
intended the HAA’s vesting provision to apply to more than just legislatively
enacted development standards.  Section
65589.5 broadly defines the items eligible for vesting to include “any other
rules, regulations, requirements, and policies of a local agency.”  (Gov. Code § 65589.5(o).)  By contrast, the provision that requires a
local agency to identify project inconsistencies is only applicable to “general
plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and criteria, including design review
standards.” (Gov. Code § 65589.5(j)(1).)  The provision that allows for the disapproval
of affordable housing projects is narrower still and limited to instances of
inconsistency with a “jurisdiction’s zoning ordinance and general plan land use
designation.”  (Gov. Code §
65589.5(d)(5).)  When
interpreting a statute, “significance
should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance
of the legislative purpose.”  (People
v. McCart (1982) 32 Cal.3d 338, 342-343.) 
The HAA also instructs that “[i]t is the policy of the state that this
section be interpreted and implemented in a manner to afford the fullest
possible weight to the interest of, and the approval and provision of, housing.”  (Gov. Code § 65589.5(a)(2)(L).)  Accordingly, the phrase “any other rules, regulations,
requirements, and policies” in section 65589.5(o)(4) is reasonably interpreted to
include housing development rules or policies of a local agency created by an
emergency directive of the local agency’s mayor and that are binding on the
City during the declared emergency.  
 
Respondents contend that ED1 did not fall
within the scope of the HAA’s vesting provision because “an emergency
declaration is limited in duration” and the HAA “is intended to vest projects
against changes in long-term substantive requirements, not the temporary
emergency processing schedules referenced in Original ED1.”  (Oppo. 14, citing City Charter § 231(i) and
LAAC §§ 8.27, 8.29, and 8.31.)  This
argument conflicts with the Legislature’s purpose in enacting the HCA and HAA
provisions at issue.  The Legislature
acknowledged that all local development rules are limited in duration and can
be amended at any time, and the vesting rule was added to stop local
governments “from changing the rules on builders who are in the midst of going
through the approval process.”  (RJN Exh.
G at 7.)  The fact that ED1 could be
changed at any time supports applying the vesting rule, as affordable
housing developers like Mamba relied on ED1 when deciding to pursue a project.
(See AR 905.)  Further, the City
Charter and LAAC do not impose any specific time limit on how long an emergency
declaration may last.[2]  Indeed, the City’s declared housing emergency
has been ongoing for nearly two years and was ratified by the City Council.
(RJN Exh. H.)  
 
The City is not entitled to deference in
its interpretation of the HAA and HCA vesting rules, which are state law, not
local ordinances.  Further, as
Petitioners argue, the City’s position with respect to the vesting rules has
not been consistent.  (See Reply
5:19-25.)  As examples, the ED1
Guidelines inform applicants that a preliminary application “locks in” existing
standards. (RJN Exh. B at 14.)  The City
Council granted the Ethel Project appeal and determined that the Ethel Project
could vest in ED1’s ministerial process, even though the Ethel Project was
located in a single-family residential zone. 
(RJN Exh. E at 64; RJN Exh. F.) 
The City does not explain this inconsistency to the court’s
satisfaction.    
 
            In contrast, HCD has been consistent
in its interpretation of the HAA vesting rules as applied to ED1.  (See RJN Exh. C.)  Respondents do not show otherwise.  Further, HCD’s interpretation is well-reasoned
and supported by the plain language of the HAA. 
“The amount of deference given to the administrative construction
depends upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity
of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and
all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to
control.”  (Hoechst Celanese Corp. v.
Franchise Tax Bd. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 508, 524.)  Based on these factors, HCD’s interpretation of the HAA vesting rules as applied to ED1 is
entitled to some weight, while the City’s interpretation is not.  
 
Based on the foregoing, the City Council prejudicially abused its
discretion when it concluded that an emergency directive, like ED1, does
not qualify for vesting under section 65589.5(o) of the HAA.  (AR 413, 419-422, 1149-1150.)  
 
B.        ED1 Applied to Projects
in Single-Family Zones
 
Respondents contend that the original ED1 was meant to apply to
multi-family zones, not single-family zones, and that the court should defer to
the City’s interpretation of ED1.  (OB
15-16.)  City Planning and the City
Council did not deny Mamba’s appeal on this basis.  (See AR 413, 419-422, 1149-1150.)  City
Planning acknowledged in the appeal report that “the
Mayor's [original] ED1 was not express about disqualifying multiunit projects
in R1 and more restrictive zones,” and City Planning did not opine in the
appeal report that the original ED1 should be interpreted to apply only to
multi-family zones.  (AR 413.)  Generally, courts do not accept post hoc
rationalization for agency action.  (See Motor
Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. v. State Farm Mut. (1983) 463 U.S. 29, 50; No Oil,
Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 81.)  
 
Regardless, the original ED1 applies to all “[a]pplications for
100% affordable housing projects . . . as long as such plans do not require any
zoning change, variance, or General Plan amendment.”  (AR 713.)  ED1 did not restrict projects to multi-family
zones and it was later amended to add this restriction.  (AR 713-715 and 764-67.)  If the original ED1 had prohibited projects in
single-family zones, there would have been no need to amend it. (See Times
Mirror Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 1325, 1337 [“Where changes
have been introduced to a statute by amendment it must be assumed the changes
have a purpose….”].)  
 
The City is not
entitled to deference in its interpretation of the original ED1.  (See Oppo. 15.)  The City’s interpretation conflicts with the
plain language of the original ED1. 
Further, The City’s interpretation has not been consistent.  Notably, the City’s own planning department
confirmed that projects in single-family zones were eligible for ED1.  (See e.g., AR 137, 171, 296.)  The
City assigned the application an “administrative review” case number (Case No. ADM-2023-4205),
which the City would not have done if the Project was not ED1 eligible.  (Ibid.; see AR 296-299, 1029-30.)  The City also has interpreted ED1
inconsistently, as evidenced by its approval of the Ethel Project and its
denial of the Olinda Project even though both are located in single-family
zones.  Deference is only afforded to
“consistent” and “long standing” interpretations, which is not the case
here.  (Mason v. Retirement Board
(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1221, 1228.)  
 
C.        Estoppel Does Not Apply 
 
Respondents argue that the City “cannot be estopped from
applying its zoning laws” based on its initial “error” in accepting Mamba’s application
with an “administrative review” case number. 
(Oppo. 16-17.)  
 
[T]he rule
of law is clear, that, where one by his words or conduct willfully causes
another to believe the existence of a certain state of things, and induces him
to act on that belief, so as to alter his own previous position, the former is
[precluded] from averring against the latter a different state of things as
existing at the same time.
 
(Feduniak v. Cal. Coastal Comm. (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 1346, 1359 [internal quotations and citations omitted].)  As discussed, the City did not err in its
initial determinations that the Project was “ED1 eligible” and that it should
be assigned an administrative review case number.  (See AR 137, 296-299, 1029-30.)  Petitioners do not argue that the City is estopped,
by its prior statements or actions, from applying its zoning laws.  Rather, Petitioners contend that the
Projected vested under the development rules set forth in ED1 – by operation of
law – when Mamba filed its HCA preliminary application.  Estoppel does not apply in these
circumstances and Respondents’ arguments based on estoppel are irrelevant.  
 
The City’s reference to its status as a charter city is also
irrelevant.  (See Oppo. 17-18.) The HAA explicitly
applies to charter cities, and the Court of Appeal has confirmed the HAA does
not violate a charter city’s municipal authority. (See California Renters
Legal Advocacy & Education Fund v. City of San Mateo (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th
820, 835, 847-853.)
 
D.        Mamba Complied
with the PSA and its Appeal Was Not Moot 
 
Respondents raise
arguments concerning the completeness of Mamba’s preliminary application and compliance
with deadlines specified in the Permit Streamlining Act (“PSA”).    Respondents
contend that the City Council properly denied Mamba’s appeal because “the
Project Application was factually incomplete” and “[t]he City has no
ministerial duty to accept an incomplete application.”  (Oppo. 19.) 
As discussed, the application was complete under ED1.  It
is undisputed that the Project is a “100% affordable housing project” within
the meaning of ED1 and that the application contained all the information
required by section
65941.1(a). 
(See AR 137-47.)  
 
E.         The City Violated the
HAA By Failing to Recognize Vesting Rights under ED1
 
Petitioners contend that the City’s failure to recognize
vesting rights is a violation of the HAA. 
(OB 16-17.)  Respondents do not argue
otherwise.  (Sehulster
Tunnels/Pre-Con v. Traylor Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1345,
fn. 16 [failure to address point is “equivalent to a concession”].)  The HAA states that a local agency violates
the HAA if it “required or attempted to require a housing development project
to comply with an ordinance, policy, or standard not adopted and in effect when
a preliminary application was submitted.” (§ 65589.5(k)(1)(A)(i)(III).)  As shown by the analysis above, this is
exactly what the City did.  (See AR
296-299, 302-303, 413-422, 1149-1150.) 
Accordingly, the court will issue a writ compelling compliance with the HAA
within 60 days.  (Gov. § 65589.5(o) and
(k)(1)(A)(i) and (ii); Pet. Prayer ¶ 3.)
 
F.         The City Violated the
HAA by Disapproving the Project 
 
Petitioners
contend that the City Council violated the HAA when it denied Mamba’s
administrative appeal and thereby “disapproved” of the ministerial Project for
which Mamba applied.  (OB 17.)  It is undisputed that the Project qualifies
as a “housing development project” and “housing for very low, low-, or
moderate-income households” under the HAA. 
(Gov. Code § 65589.5(h)(2) and (3).) 
The HAA prohibits a local government from disapproving of such housing
projects unless it makes written findings based on a preponderance of the
evidence in the record as to one of five specifically enumerated findings. (Gov.
Code § 65589.5(d).)  As Respondents
acknowledge, the City has not made such findings.  (See Oppo. 20-21.)  Thus, the legal issue is whether the City
“disapproved” the Project within the meaning of the HAA.
 
The HAA states, in relevant part, that the phrase
“disapprove the housing development project” includes “any instance in which a
local agency . . . [v]otes on a proposed housing development project
application and the application is disapproved, including any required
land use approvals or entitlements necessary for the issuance of a building
permit….”  (Gov. Code §
65589.5(h)(6), emphasis added.)  The HAA
must “be interpreted and implemented in a manner to afford the fullest possible
weight to the interest of, and the approval and provision of, housing.”  (Gov. Code § 65589.5(a)(2)(L).)  In addition, “[a]s a basic principle of
statutory construction, ‘include’ is generally used as a word of enlargement
and not of limitation…. Thus, where the word ‘include’ is used to refer to specified
items, it may be expanded to cover other items.”  (Rea v. Blue Shield of California
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1209, 1227.)   
 
The City Council’s decision to deny Mamba’s appeal of the incompleteness
determination falls within the broad definition of “disapprove” under the
HAA.  As
discussed, the Project is a “100% affordable housing project” that qualifies
for ministerial processing under ED1.  (See
AR 137-47.)  Despite this, City
Planning converted the Project from ministerial to discretionary through the incompleteness determination. 
(See AR 296-299, 302-303.) 
City
Planning’s conversion of the ministerial application to a discretionary one was
the equivalent of a disapproval of the application based on a substantive
determination that the Project was no longer eligible for ED1.  Stated another way, City Planning determined
that Mamba could not obtain the “required
land use approvals or entitlements necessary for the issuance of a building
permit” for the ministerial project for which Mamba applied.  Accordingly, when the City Council voted
to uphold that determination, it “disapproved” of the ministerial project for
which Mamba applied.  (Gov. Code §
65589.5(h)(6).)  
 
Respondents assert that “[t]here is no text in the HAA or the PSA that
equates a decision on a PSA incompleteness appeal with a disapproval of the
merits of a development application subject to the HAA.”  (Oppo. 21.) 
Respondents’ argument is unpersuasive because it is based on the premise
that a local agency can convert a ministerial project to a discretionary one
and then claim “incompleteness” when the applicant does not submit materials
only required for a discretionary project. 
Respondents do not cite any legal authority in support of that position,
and the court has not found any.   
 
The court finds that the City Council “disapproved” of the Project
within the meaning of the HAA when it voted to deny Mamba’s appeal of the
incompleteness determination.  The City
did not make written
findings based on a preponderance of the evidence in the record as to one of the
five findings required by the HAA to disapprove of a housing development
project.  Accordingly, the court will
issue a writ compelling compliance with the HAA within 60 days.  (Gov. Code § 65589.5(d) and (k)(1)(A)(i) and
(ii); Pet. Prayer ¶ 3.)
 
            G.        The Court Has No Tentative Order Whether
the City Acted in Bad Faith
 
Petitioners
contend that the City Council acted in bad faith when it disapproved the
Project and, as a result, the court “must order the local government to approve
the project within 60 days.”  (OB 18.)  Under the HAA, “[t]he court may issue an
order or judgment directing the local agency to approve the housing development
project or emergency shelter if the court finds that the local agency acted in
bad faith when it disapproved or conditionally approved the housing development
or emergency shelter in violation of this section.”  (Gov. Code § 65589.5(k)(1)(A)(ii).)  The HAA states that “‘bad faith’ includes,
but is not limited to, an action that is frivolous or otherwise entirely
without merit.”  (§ 65589.5(l).)  A claim may be “frivolous” if it is “not well
grounded in fact” or “not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument
for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.”  (Guillemin v. Stein (2002) 104
Cal.App.4th 156, 167.)  Bad faith may
also be established if actions are taken for an improper purpose. (Trujillo
v. City of Los Angeles (1969) 276 Cal. App. 2d 333, 338; Smith v. Selma
Cmty. Hosp. (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 1, 34.)  
 
The court has no
tentative order on the issue whether the City acted in bad faith.   On the one hand, the question of whether HAA
vesting rights apply to an emergency directive of a local agency is one of
first impression.  It appears the Court
of Appeal has not decided that issue, or a similar one, in a published
appellate decision.  Although HCD’s
technical guidance deserves some deference, it is not binding on the court or
on the City.  It was not frivolous or
improper for the City to disagree with HCD with respect to the proper
interpretation of the HAA.  Since a
mayor’s declaration of emergency will often be of temporary duration and is not
legislative in nature, the court cannot say that it was entirely without merit
for the City to conclude that ED1 does not qualify for HAA vesting.   On the other hand, the City does not
sufficiently explain the different treatment between the Ethel Project and the
Olinda Project.  
 
H.        Remaining Issues 
 
Petitioners also contend that the Project vested under Los
Angeles Municipal Code section 12.26.A.3. 
(OB 16.)  Because the court finds
that the Project vested under ED1 and the HAA, the court need not reach this
contention.  
 
Petitioners also seek declaratory relief.  The court declines to issue a declaratory judgment
because Petitioners have an adequate remedy in the writ causes of action.  (See General of America Ins. Co. v. Lilly (1968)
258 Cal.App.2d 465, 470-471; Hood v. Sup.Ct. (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 319,
324.)  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The court grants the petition for writ
of mandate on the first and second causes of action.  
 
2.         The court will
enter a judgment and writ directing the City Council to set aside its decision
finding Mamba’s application to be incomplete and to reconsider that decision in
light of this court’s opinion and judgment. 
The court will grant a writ directing the City to review and process
Mamba’s application pursuant to the PSA and in a manner not inconsistent with
this court’s opinion and judgment.  (Pet.
Prayer ¶ 1.)  The court will also issue a
writ compelling compliance with the HAA within 60 days.  (§ 65589.5(d), (o), and (k)(1)(A)(i) and
(ii); Pet. Prayer ¶ 3.)  
 
3.         The court
declines to issue a declaratory judgment because Petitioners have an adequate
remedy in the writ causes of action.  (See
General of America Ins. Co. v. Lilly (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 470-471; Hood
v. Sup.Ct. (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 319, 324.) 

 
4.         The parties shall
meet-and-confer and lodge a proposed judgment.
 
5.         The court’s clerk shall
provide notice.
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED
