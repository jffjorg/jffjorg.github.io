And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has not yet made a final decision on the petition for writ of mandate filed by Cynthia Sims, a self-represented litigant. The petition challenges the County's decision to deny Sims' application for custody of some of her grandchildren. Sims was previously convicted of misdemeanor child abuse in 1998 after a teacher reported that she hit her daughter with a switch, leaving marks. Further investigation revealed that Sims had also used a switch on her grandchildren. Sims did not cooperate with an interview and expressed no remorse for her actions. The judge is considering the petition and will make a final decision at the hearing on October 30, 2024.
