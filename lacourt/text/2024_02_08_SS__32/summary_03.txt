And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying a motion filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Alivia Abreu of Wilshire Law Firm, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in communication with the client. However, the judge notes that the client has not received proper notice of the hearing, as the documents filed by counsel did not include the correct dates, times, locations, and subject matter of future proceedings. The judge also states that counsel has not complied with California Rules of Court and California Rule of Professional Conduct regarding the withdrawal of counsel. Therefore, the motion is denied, and counsel is required to provide notice of the Court's ruling.
