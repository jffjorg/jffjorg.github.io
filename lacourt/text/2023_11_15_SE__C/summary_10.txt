```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants/cross-complainants' motion to compel further responses to their supplemental requests for production, as the motion is untimely and they have waived their right to compel a further response. The judge also denies the request for sanctions, as the motion is denied. The judge orders the defendants/cross-complainants to give notice to the plaintiff/cross-defendant. The dispute concerns a business dispute between the parties, including a produce wholesaler and its largest customer, and the judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(a) and (c).
