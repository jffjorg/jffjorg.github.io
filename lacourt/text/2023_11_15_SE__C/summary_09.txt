And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Sagitta Anderson's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. The case involves a motor vehicle incident, and Defendant filed a Complaint for personal injuries on May 5, 2023. Plaintiff Kaylee Troncoso then requested entry of default, which was granted on September 13, 2023. Defendant moved to set aside default on September 29, 2023, arguing that she mistakenly believed her insurance carrier was handling the claim and did not respond to the service of the Complaint. The Judge finds that Defendant's mistake is reasonable due to her unfamiliarity with legal proceedings. As a result, the default judgment is set aside, and Defendant is ordered to file an answer to the Complaint within 10 days.
