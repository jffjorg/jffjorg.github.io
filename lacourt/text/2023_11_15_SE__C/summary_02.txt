And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, C Esquibel, has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiffs and Jerome D. Stark, PC and Jerome D. Stark. The Defendants, IEV Factory, Inc., Martin Kruszelnicki, and Yutaka Miyazaki, seek to file a cross-complaint alleging various causes of action, including conversion, deceit, fraud, and breach of contract.

The Judge notes that the Defendants' motion was filed on June 26, 2023, before a trial date was set in this matter, and that the importance of trying cases on the merits weighs in favor of granting the motion. The Judge also finds that the Defendants' delay in filing the motion is inexcusable, but that the motion is still granted due to the policy of liberal construction of section 426.50 to avoid forfeiture of causes of action.

The Judge orders the Defendants to file their attached cross-complaint within 10 days of this order.
