And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by IPSWICH SHELLFISH CO., INC. without granting leave to amend. The demurrer was filed in response to the Third Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Henry Aguila. The complaint alleges that the defendant breached a contract and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The judge has determined that the plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of showing that he was an intended third-party beneficiary of the credit agreement between TAI, Defendant, and Euler Hermes. The credit agreement does not reveal an intent to benefit the plaintiff from the terms of the contract.

Additionally, the judge has determined that the plaintiff has failed to show that the defendant breached a duty under the contract. The plaintiff demanded an insurance claim, but the defendant refused to submit it. However, it is not apparent from the terms of the credit agreement that the defendant had a duty under the contract to submit the insurance claim.

The judge has also determined that the plaintiff has failed to provide any facts that would support a showing that his pleading can be amended successfully. Therefore, leave to amend is denied.
