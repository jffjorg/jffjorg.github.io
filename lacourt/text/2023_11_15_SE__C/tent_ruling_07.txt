Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike Defendant’s
Answer is GRANTED.  Defendant to answer,
through counsel, within 30 days.  
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff Aimpacific Services, Inc. (Plaintiff)
moves for an order striking Defendant Woody & Lamy Floor, Inc.’s
(Defendant) answer on the grounds that Defendant cannot represent itself and
file an answer as a corporation.
“The
court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its
discretion...Strike out all or any part of any pleading...” (CCP § 436.)
Plaintiff
filed a Form Complaint alleging common counts for an open book account for the
sum of $39,046.28. Defendant filed an answer without an attorney and is
currently self-represented. “[A] corporation cannot represent itself in court,
either in propria persona or through an officer or agent who is not an
attorney.” (Merco Construction Engineers Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21
Cal.3d 724, 731.) Thus, Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike is GRANTED and Defendant’s
improperly filed answer in its entirety is STRUCK.
