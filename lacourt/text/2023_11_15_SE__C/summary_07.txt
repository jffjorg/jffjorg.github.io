The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's answer due to the defendant's improper representation. The defendant, Woody & Lamy Floor, Inc., is a corporation that cannot represent itself in court and filed an answer without an attorney. The plaintiff, Aimpacific Services, Inc., filed a complaint alleging common counts for an open book account in the amount of $39,046.28. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 436 and Merco Construction Engineers Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724, 731, which holds that a corporation cannot represent itself in court. The court therefore grants the motion to strike the defendant's answer in its entirety and orders the defendant to answer through counsel within 30 days.
