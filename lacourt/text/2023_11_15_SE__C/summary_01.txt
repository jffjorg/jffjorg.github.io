Summary in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, finding that the Defendant has satisfied its initial burden of showing a complete defense to the Plaintiffs' causes of action. The Defendant argued that the Commercial Lease Agreement (CLA) waived any claims by the Plaintiffs for loss or damage to personal property, and the Judge agreed. The Judge found that the waiver in the CLA was clear and unambiguous, and that it applied to the Plaintiffs' claims for loss or damage to personal property. The Judge also found that the Plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a triable issue of material fact as to whether the waiver applied to their claims. As a result, the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment was granted.
