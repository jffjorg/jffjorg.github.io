And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the Defendant, Los Angeles County, to the First Amended Complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Deodre Cotton. The Plaintiff alleges that she was terminated as a Dental Program Director and Dental Instructor at Tri-Cities Regional Occupation Program after she fell and sustained injuries in a classroom on campus. The Plaintiff also alleges that the termination was based on her disability, her request for accommodations, and her race. The Defendant demurred to the First Amended Complaint, arguing that it did not state a cause of action and that the Plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to establish an employment relationship with the County. The Judge determined that the Plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to withstand the demurrer, except for the eleventh cause of action, which claimed intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Judge sustained the demurrer to this cause of action, finding that the County is immune from liability for common law torts like IIED. The Judge ordered the Plaintiff to give notice, unless waived, and the Defendant to file an Answer within 21 days.
