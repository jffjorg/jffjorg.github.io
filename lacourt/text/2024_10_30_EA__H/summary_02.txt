And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this professional negligence case. The plaintiff, Evelia Brenes, alleged that the defendant, United Therapy Network, failed to use the appropriate standard of care during physical therapy treatments, which caused her to experience pain and delay in her recovery. The defendant presented expert opinions that their therapists acted within the standard of care, and that any pain experienced by the plaintiff was not caused by the defendant's actions.

The judge found that while there was a dispute as to whether the defendant's administration of a massage gun fell within the applicable standard of care, the plaintiff failed to establish a causal connection between the use of the massage gun and the alleged injuries. The judge noted that the expert opinion presented by the plaintiff did not address the defendant's expert opinion that the cause of the plaintiff's pain was postoperative peripheral inflammation that developed before the plaintiff visited the defendant. Therefore, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiff's claim.
