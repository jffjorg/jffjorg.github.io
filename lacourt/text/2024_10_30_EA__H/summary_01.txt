And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's unopposed motion for entry of judgment to enforce the settlement. The plaintiff, Guifeng Zhang, had a cosmetic surgical facelift procedure performed by Joseph Dinglasan, M.D. in 2018. Zhang alleges that the procedure was not properly performed, and that the operating facility was not properly sanitized and equipped. In 2019, Zhang filed a complaint against Ebenezer Medical Clinic, Dinglasan, and Does 1-100, alleging negligence.

In 2023, Zhang and Dinglasan entered into a settlement agreement, where Dinglasan agreed to pay Zhang $35,000.00 in installments of $1,000.00 per month. However, Dinglasan has only made one payment and has failed to make further payments. Zhang is seeking to enforce the settlement and recover attorneys' fees and costs.

The judge awards Zhang attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $960.00, which includes two hours of preparation time at $450.00 per hour and a $60.00 filing fee. The judge also grants the motion to enforce the settlement.
