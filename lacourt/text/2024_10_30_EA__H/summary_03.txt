```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a preliminary ruling on the case between UTN (the defendant) and the plaintiff. The court grants UTN's request to take judicial notice of the dictionary definition of "diagnosis". The court also acknowledges that Dr. Lim, an expert witness for the defendant, is not qualified to render medical diagnoses as a physical therapist. However, the court does not need to decide whether Dr. Lim is qualified to testify on medical causation because his opinion does not establish that the massage gun caused the plaintiff's injuries. The court also overrules UTN's evidentiary objections. The court's ruling is based on the expert opinions of Dr. Lim and Dr. Miller, who both agree that the use of the massage gun may have caused pain, but Dr. Miller attributes the pain to postoperative changes and neuropathic pain condition rather than the massage gun itself.
