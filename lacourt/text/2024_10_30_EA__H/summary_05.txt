- "Where a complaint does not reveal on its face that it is barred by the statute of limitations, a plaintiff has no obligation to plead around the defense."
- "It follows, then, that a plaintiff is obligated to plead around the defense when the complaint reveals on its face that it is time-barred."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint is sustained, without leave to amend. The plaintiff alleges that she sustained injuries in a motor vehicle accident on January 20, 2022, and that the defendants operated their motor vehicle in violation of CA Vehicle Code Section 22350. The defendants argue that the complaint is barred by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1, because the plaintiff filed her original complaint on January 24, 2024, and the date of injury alleged is January 20, 2022. The judge agrees with the defendants and holds that the statute of limitations bars the claim. The judge also holds that section 351 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not toll the statute of limitations, citing cases such as Bigelow v. Smik and Litwin v. Estate of Formela.
