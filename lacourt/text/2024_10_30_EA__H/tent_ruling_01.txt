v. Ebenezer Medical Clinic, et al., Case
No. 19STCV21535
 
ORDER
ON MOTION TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT

Plaintiff Guifeng Zhang’s unopposed
Motion for Entry of Judgment to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED. The Court awards
Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of $960.00.

Background
On
or about July 8, 2018, Plaintiff Guifeng Zhang (“Zhang”) underwent a cosmetic
surgical facelift procedure performed by Joseph Dinglasan, M.D. (“Dinglasan”).
Zhang alleges that the procedure was not properly performed, that the operating
facility was not properly sanitized and equipped, and that her stitches were
not removed by medical personnel.
On
June 20, 2019, Zhang filed a complaint, asserting a negligence cause of action
against Defendants Ebenezer Medical Clinic, Dinglasan and Does 1-100.
On
July 22, 2019, Eben Ezer DB Inc. (“Eben Ezer”) and Dinglasan filed a
cross-complaint against Zhang and Roes 1-100, asserting causes of action for
(1) breach of contract and (2) fraud.
On
November 21, 2019, the Court sustained Zhang’s demurrer to the cross-complaint,
without leave to amend.
On
May 22, 2023, a “Joint Stipulation and Request for the Court to Retain
Jurisdiction Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6;
Order Thereon” was entered.
Pending
before the Court is Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for entry of judgment to
enforce settlement. For the reasons stated herein, the motion is granted.
Legal
Standard 
“If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court for an
order, per Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, enforcing the settlement and
entering judgment in accordance with the terms of the settlement. Plaintiff
also requests $960.00 in attorneys’ fees and costs.
In March 2023, Plaintiff and Dinglasan entered into
a “Settlement Agreement and Release in Full of All Claims and Rights”
(“Agreement”), wherein Dinglasan agreed to pay Plaintiff $35,000.00 payable at
$1,000.00/month beginning on April 1, 2023, at no interest, and continuing
thereon on the first day of each month, until paid in full; in return,
Plaintiff agreed to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, with the Court
reserving jurisdiction under section 664.6 to enforce the terms of the
Agreement. (Shambaugh Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. B, ¶¶ 1 and 2.) The Agreement includes a
provision for attorneys’ fees for the prevailing party to enforce the
Agreement. (Id., ¶ 4, Exh. B, ¶ 3(I).)
The Court notes that on May 22, 2023, a “Joint
Stipulation and Request for the Court to Retain Jurisdiction Pursuant to
California Code of Civil Proc Section 664.6, Order Thereon” was entered on May
22, 2023. (See also Shambaugh Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. A).
Dinglasan has paid only $1,000.00 and has failed and
refused to pay any further amount as agreed. (Shambaugh Decl., ¶ 5).
The unopposed motion is granted. Further, Plaintiff
seeks to recoup $960.00 in attorneys’ fees and costs [calculated as follows:
two hours preparing motion at $450.00/hour, plus $60.00 filing fee]. The Court
awards attorney’s fees and costs in the amount requested.
