DEFENDANT Honda’s Motion to Compel Binding Arbitration is
CONTINUED pending the Ochoa decision. 
 
Background
 
This is a lemon law case. 
 
On June 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed suit.
 
On August 4, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion. 
 
On January 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed her opposition to the
motion. 
 
On February 6, 2024, Defendant filed its reply. 
 
Discussion
 
As
Plaintiffs rely upon Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 (“Ochoa”),
which has created a split of authority, and the case is on appeal to the
California Supreme Court, the court continues the motion pending a
determination by the Court.[1]
 
Conclusion
 
Based
on the foregoing, the motion to compel arbitration is continued.
