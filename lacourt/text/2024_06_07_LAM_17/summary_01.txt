The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Fleet Logic LLC dba Velocity Truck Rental and Leasing (Defendant) in response to the lawsuit filed by Valsoft Corporation, Inc.

The court has overruled the demurrer as to the third cause of action for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and sustained it with 15 days leave to amend as to the sixth cause of action for unauthorized computer access and fraud. The court found that the Plaintiff's allegations of breach of implied covenant are not duplicative of the breach of contract claim, and that the Plaintiff's claims are not preempted on their face by the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA). However, the court found that the Plaintiff's allegations of unauthorized computer access and fraud are insufficient and that the Plaintiff must allege some facts to show that it has a basis for believing that the defendant accessed the plaintiff's software without permission.
