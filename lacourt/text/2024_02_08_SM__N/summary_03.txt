And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Lara Shapiro's Motion for Leave to File Amended Answer. The Motion is DENIED. The Judge finds that the amendment is not warranted because Defendant fails to state when she learned of the facts underlying her proposed affirmative defense, and she waited nearly a year to move for leave to file her amended answer. Additionally, it is not clear how the facts provided by Defendant would serve as an affirmative defense to Plaintiff's claims. The Judge notes that the court applies a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint, but that policy is limited by the potential for prejudice to the adverse party. The Judge concludes that Defendant's failure to move for leave to amend her answer earlier and her lack of clarity regarding the timing of her discovery of the facts underlying her proposed affirmative defense are significant factors in denying the Motion.
