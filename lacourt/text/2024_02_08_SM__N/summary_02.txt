And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The defendants, Apartments Finders Inc. and Fox Knoll II, LLC, are entitled to judgment as a matter of law because they have met their burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact regarding the plaintiff's claims for premises liability, negligence, and negligent hiring, retention, and supervision.

The plaintiff, Katie Burgess, alleges that she was sexually assaulted by an intruder while living in a unit at the property. She claims that the defendants failed to take adequate measures to prevent criminal activity on the property, despite knowing of prior incidents. However, the defendants have presented evidence that they were not responsible for security at the property and that the plaintiff failed to voice any concerns about security or her safety.

The judge found that the defendants have met their burden of showing that they did not breach a duty of care to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff's claims are not valid. The judge also found that the plaintiff's failure to oppose the motion renders it unnecessary to consider the merits of the claims.

Accordingly, the judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication and has ordered them to prepare, serve, and submit a proposed judgment as per statute.
