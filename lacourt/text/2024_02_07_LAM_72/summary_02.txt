The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in limine filed by both parties. Plaintiff's motions were generally denied, except for MIL No. 1, which permits jurors to award "millions" in damages if the evidence supports it, and MIL No. 5 and 6, which restrict Defendant's ability to present certain testimony. Defendant's motions were also generally denied, except for MIL No. 1, 2, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, and 17, which were granted. The judge also denied several motions as too general or vague to rule on at the in limine stage.
