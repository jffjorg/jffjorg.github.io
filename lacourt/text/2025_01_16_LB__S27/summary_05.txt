And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bankers Small Business Community Development Corporation of California (Plaintiff) versus Triplecorp, Inc. and Leslie R. Riley (Defendants). The Plaintiff filed an application for a writ of possession on September 25, 2024, and an application for service on October 7, 2024. However, the proof of service documents filed on December 3, 2024, indicate that the process server was unable to serve the Defendants because the address listed did not exist. As a result, the judge has denied the application for a writ of possession. The judge also reminds the Plaintiff that there is an outstanding order to show cause (OSC) regarding proof of service on the same calendar date as the hearing on the application, and asks the Plaintiff to make arrangements to appear remotely at the OSC.
