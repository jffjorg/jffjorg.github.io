 Case Number:  24LBCV02074    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, Bankers Small Business
Community Development Corporation of California filed this action against
Defendants, Triplecorp, Inc. and Leslie R. Riley for possession of personal
property and related claims on 9/25/24. 
On 10/07/24, they filed an application for writ of possession.  On 12/03/24, Plaintiff filed the only proof
of service documents filed to date in the case; the documents, however,
indicate that the process server was unable to serve Defendants because the
address does not exist.  
 
Because Defendant has not been
served, the application is denied. 
Plaintiff is reminded that there is an OSC re: proof of service on
calendar contemporaneously with the hearing on the application.  The Court asks Plaintiff to make arrangements
to appear remotely at the OSC.
