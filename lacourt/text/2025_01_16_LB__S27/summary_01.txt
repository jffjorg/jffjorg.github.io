And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a decision regarding a motion for attorneys' fees and costs filed by the plaintiffs, James and Cynthia Setka, against the defendants, Ford Motor Company and Southbay Ford, Inc. The plaintiffs are seeking to recover $128,902.62 in attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the litigation, which includes a 1.35 multiplier.

The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiffs' attorneys' hourly rates are inflated, that the request includes unreasonable and unnecessary tasks, and that costs should not be awarded. The plaintiffs contend that their rates are justified and that the defendant has not met its burden to show that the rates should be reduced.

The judge finds that the rates are extremely high and reduces them to a blended rate of $400/hour. The judge also finds that the billing is padded and redundant with other cases and reduces the billing by 1/3.

The judge agrees with the defendant that a multiplier is not appropriate in this case and finds that an hourly rate of $400/hour is sufficient to compensate for the work done. The judge denies the request for costs and expenses because the plaintiff did not file a memorandum of costs.
