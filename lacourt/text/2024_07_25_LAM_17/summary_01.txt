And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to amend her answer to add a new affirmative defense. The defendant seeks to clarify her statute of limitations defense by adding direct references to Code of Civil Procedure section 366.2 and Probate Code sections 9100 and 9103. The court finds that the amendment would not result in meaningful prejudice to the plaintiff and therefore grants the motion. The court notes that the policy favoring leave to amend is strong and will only deny an amendment if the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice. In this case, the trial is set for February 3, 2025, and the court finds that the amendment would not delay the trial or cause significant added preparation costs.
