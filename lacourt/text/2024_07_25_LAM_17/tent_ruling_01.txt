 Case
  No.:  22STCV06421  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: July 25, 2024



 
Defendant’s
motion for leave to amend to file an amended answer is GRANTED.
 
On 2/22/2022,
Plaintiff Skyler Wells (Plaintiff) filed suit against Strategic Acquisitions,
Inc., BDR, Inc., Open House Realty & Investments, LLC, and Peter Baer. On
2/15/2023, Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint (TAC) alleging: (1) breach
of contract; (2) construction defects; (3) construction defects; (4)
negligence; (5) negligence; (6) negligent infliction of emotional distress; and
(7) negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
 
Now,
Defendant Christina Baer (Defendant) seeks to leave to amend to file an amended
answer.
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
seeks leave to amend to file an amended answer in order to clarify her statute
of limitations affirmative defense (20th Affirmative Defense) to add direct
reference to Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 366.2, and Probate Code
sections 9100 and 9103.
 
Additionally,
Defendant seeks leave to assert as an additional affirmative defense (35th
Affirmative Defense), Plaintiff’s Failure to Comply with Code of Civil
Procedure section 474 (as to naming fictitious parties). Adding this defense
would require renumbering the current 35th defense as the 36th defense.
 
            Defendant
explains that she became aware of the need for these amendments during
preparation for her motion for summary judgment.  More specifically, she became aware that her
20th Affirmative Defense did not specifically refer to relevant CCP
and Probate sections, and also became aware of Plaintiff’s failure to abide by
the requirements of CCP.
 
“This statutory provision giving the
courts the power to permit amendments in furtherance of justice has received a
very liberal interpretation by the courts of this state.” (Klopstock v.
Superior Court (1941) Cal.2d 13, 19. The policy favoring leave to
amend is so strong that it is an abuse of discretion to deny an amendment
unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice, such as the running of
the statute of limitations, trial delay, the loss of critical evidence, or
added preparation costs.  (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003)
109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.)
 
            Given
that trial is set for 2/3/2025, the Court finds no meaningful prejudice will
result if amendment is allowed. 
 
            Defendant’s
motion for leave to amend to file an amended answer is granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
