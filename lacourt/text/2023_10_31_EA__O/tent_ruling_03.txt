“Claimant”), a minor by and through their guardian ad litem, Richard Albanese
(“Petitioner”), filed suit against Defendant Megan Frances Kaffunger (“Defendant”)
for motor vehicle and negligence causes of action.

Legal
Standard
 
CCP
§372(a)(1) provides: 
 
When a minor, a person who lacks legal
capacity to make decisions, or a person for whom a conservator has been
appointed is a party, that person shall appear either by a guardian or
conservator of the estate or by guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the
action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” 
 
 
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner brings forth the petition on behalf of Aaron, who
is a minor. As a result of the 1/14/2022 accident wherein Defendant rear-ended
Alexa’s vehicle, the claimant has suffered injuries to his neck, upper-middle
back, left knee, whiplash (Petition p. 2 of 65 of PDF) and minor second degree
burn on her fingers and the palms of her hands (Petition p. 50 of 65 of PDF). (Alexa
is Aaron’s sibling and they were driving in Alexa’s vehicle.) 
 
Defendant has offered to pay Claimant a lump sum of $27,000.00.
After certain expenses (medical, attorney fees, and other costs), $12,620.63
will be allocated to Claimant, which will be placed in a blocked account. 
 
As there are no defects with the petition, it is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the petition is granted.
