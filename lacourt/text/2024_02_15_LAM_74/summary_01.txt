```

And here is the summary text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The Judge found that the Plaintiff did not demonstrate reasonable diligence in serving the Defendant, and that the attempted service was not proper. The Judge also found that the Defendant did not identify himself as one and the same with B-Reel Creative Agency, Inc., and that the Plaintiff did not show that the Defendant agreed to be served through B-Reel's agent. The Judge therefore concludes that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Defendant and grants the motion to quash.
