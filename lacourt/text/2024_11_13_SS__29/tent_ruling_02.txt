21STCV15566
Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant Kimberly Brooks.
 
TENTATIVE
 
The motion is granted. 
 
Background
 
According
to the Complaint, on April 26, 2019, Plaintiff Rogelio Magana Castillo
(“Plaintiff”)
met
with Defendant Kimberly Brooks (“Defendant”) at Zen Buffet in Monrovia,
California.
Plaintiff
alleges (among other things) that Defendant “raised her glass of water towards
Plaintiff, stared at him and sta[r]ted yelling obscene words at Plaintiff right
before she threw the glass at Plaintiff from a distance of less than four (4)
feet from Plaintiff.” (Complaint, ¶ 9.) Plaintiff asserts (among other things)
that the glass hit him “on the left cheekbone area injuring Plaintiffs
cheekbone, left eye socket and left ear.” (Id., ¶ 10.)
 
Plaintiff
filed the complaint against Defendant and Does 1 through 50 on April 26, 2021,
alleging
causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and
battery.
 
Defendant
filed her answer on November 15, 2022.
 
On
October 25, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved as counsel. Since that time,
Plaintiff has been representing himself in pro per.
 
On August 12, 2024, the Court granted
Defendant’s motion to deem Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified
in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set Two). 
 
On August 23, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion for summary judgment. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide
courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to
determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c),
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
 
As to each cause
of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment
or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing
a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon
the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)
Discussion
In
his complaint, Plaintiff asserts causes of action for intentional infliction
of emotional distress; assault; and battery.
The
elements of a cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress are: “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct
by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the
probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering
severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of
the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct. (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050.)
 
The elements of a cause of action for assault are: “(1) defendant
acted with intent to cause harmful or offensive contact, or threatened to touch
plaintiff in a harmful or offensive manner; (2) plaintiff reasonably believed [he]
was about to be touched in a harmful or offensive manner or it reasonably
appeared to plaintiff that defendant was about to carry out the threat; (3)
plaintiff did not consent to defendant's conduct; (4) plaintiff was harmed; and
(5) defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff's harm.”
(So v. Shin (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 668–669.)
 
The elements of a cause of action for
battery are: “(1) defendant touched plaintiff, or caused plaintiff to be
touched, with the intent to harm or offend plaintiff; (2) plaintiff did not
consent to the touching; (3) plaintiff was harmed or offended by defendant's
conduct; and (4) a reasonable person in plaintiff's position would have been
offended by the touching.” (Id. at p. 669.)
 
On August
12, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion for an order deeming Plaintiff
to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for
Admission (Set Two). The following were deemed admitted by Plaintiff: 
1.     REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 1: Admit that YOU have no physical
damages from the INCIDENT. For the purpose of these requests, the terms “YOU”
or “YOUR” refers to defendant Rogelio Magana Castillo. The term “INCIDENT”
refers to the acts identified in YOUR complaint wherein YOU allege that BROOKS
threw a glass at YOUR face from a distance of less than four feet. The term
“BROOKS” refers to defendant Kimberly Brooks. 
2.     REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 2: Admit that YOU have no emotional
damages from the INCIDENT. 
3.     REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 3: Admit that YOU have no mental damages
from the INCIDENT. 
4.     REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 4: Admit that YOU have threatened bodily
harm against BROOKS. 
5.     REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 5: Admit that YOU have threatened
monetary harm against BROOKS. 
6.     REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 6: Admit that YOU have laundered money. 
7.     REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 7: Admit that YOU stated to BROOKS that
YOU have connections with a Mexican cartel/mafia. 
8.     REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 8: Admit that YOU stated to BROOKS that
YOU have contacts with a Mexican cartel/mafia. 
9.     REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 9: Admit that YOU stated to BROOKS that
YOU have previously bribed judges. 
10.  REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 10: Admit that YOU have failed to comply
with this Court’s August 14, 2023 Order to pay monetary sanctions to BROOKS. 
11.  REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 11: Admit that YOU have failed to comply
with this Court’s August 16, 2023 Order to pay monetary sanctions to BROOKS. 
12.  REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 12: Admit that YOU have failed to comply
with this Court’s August 18, 2023 Order to pay monetary sanctions to BROOKS. 
13.  REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 13: Admit that YOU have failed to comply
with this Court’s August 21, 2023 Order to pay monetary sanctions to BROOKS. 
14.  REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 14: Admit that YOU have failed to comply
with this Court’s January 17, 2024 Order to pay monetary sanctions to BROOKS. 
15.  REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 15: Admit that YOU have failed to comply
with this Court’s January 17, 2024 Order to produce all documents in YOUR
possession responsive to Defendant’s Requests for Production Nos. 11 and 12
from Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One. (Exh. A.)
The
Court may take judicial notice of admissions that “contain statements of the
plaintiff or his agent which are inconsistent with the allegations of the
pleading before the court.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.
(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604-605.) Moreover, if a party does not move the
trial court to allow for withdrawal or amendment of an admission, the admission
is conclusively established against that party in the action. (See Joyce v.
Ford Motor Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1478, 1489.) 
“[A]
deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial fiat, that a nonresponding party
has responded to the requests by admitting the truth of all matters contained
therein.” (Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979.) 
In
this case, the facts that were deemed admitted by Plaintiff establish that
Plaintiff did not sustain physical, emotional, or mental damages from the incident
with Defendant. Thus, Defendant has met her initial burden on summary judgment
of showing “that one or
more elements of [each] cause of action ... cannot be established.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts
to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to the cause of action.” (Ibid.) Here, however, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition or otherwise shown
that there are triable issues on any of the causes of action in the complaint. 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is granted.
Conclusion
The Court
GRANTS the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Kimberly Brooks.
 
Moving Party is
to provide notice.
