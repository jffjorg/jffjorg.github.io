Transportation Authority
23STCV08463
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Brian Jacobson, Esq. of Wilshire Law Firm
Tentative
The motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Background
On April 17,
2023, Charlette Ann Lawrence (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Los
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“Defendant”) and Does 1
through 50 for negligence action arising out of bus accident on August 22,
2022.
 
On August 14,
2024, Defendant filed an answer and cross-complaint against Tanesha Anderson
and Roes 1 through 100.
 
On October 21,
2024, Brian Jacobson, Esq. of Wilshire Law
Firm (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. No
opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel seeks to
be relieved as Plaintiff’s attorney of record. There are numerous procedural issues,
however. 
However, Counsel
failed to serve Defendant with the motion. 
Further, the
service of motion was untimely; 16 court days before this November 13 hearing was
October 21, plus five days for mail service, requires service of the papers on October
16. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) Service of this motion was made on October
21.
Lastly, Counsel did
not file a declaration on mandatory form MC-052. (See California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(c).) 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
 
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.  
 
Moving counsel
to give notice.
