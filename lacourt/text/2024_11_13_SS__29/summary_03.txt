And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The plaintiff, Denise Chow, has repeatedly failed to comply with discovery orders, including failing to respond to written discovery requests. Despite being given numerous opportunities to comply, the plaintiff has continued to violate her obligations under the Civil Discovery Act. The court has previously imposed monetary sanctions on the plaintiff and counsel, but these sanctions have been ineffective in bringing the plaintiff into compliance. As a result, the court finds that the plaintiff's misuse of the discovery process has been overwhelmingly prejudicial to the defendant. Given the long history and pattern of willful discovery abuse, the court grants the motion for terminating sanctions and dismisses the complaint with prejudice.
