 Case Number:  23STCV12815    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Rojas v. Covian
23STCV12815
Motion to Consolidate
 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted. 
 
Background
 
These
three related cases arise out of a bus accident on September 7, 2022. 
 
In
the first filed action, Case No. 23STCV09010, on April 24, 2023, Plaintiff Jack
Axelrod (“Axelrod”) filed a complaint asserting causes of action for negligence
and statutory liability against Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (“Metro”) and Does 1 through 25 (the “Axelrod Action”).
 
On
August 16, 2023, Metro filed an answer.
 
On
July 25, 2024, Axelrod amended the complaint to name Susana Covian (“Covian”)
as Doe 1.
 
On
September 4, 2024, Covian filed an answer and a cross-complaint against Metro
and Does 1 through 10.
 
In
this action, the second filed action, Case No. 23STCV12815, on June 6, 2023,
Azucena Rojas and Efrain Mercado (the “Rojas Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against
Covian, Metro, and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for negligence,
negligence, negligent hiring, training , supervision, and retention, and strict
liability under Civil Code sections 2100, et seq. (the “Rojas Action”).
 
On
October 26, 2023, Covian filed an answer and a cross-complaint against Metro
and Roes 1 through 10. 
 
On
November 7, 2023, Metro filed an answer to the complaint.  On January 16, 2024, Metro filed an answer to
the cross-complaint. 
 
In
the third filed action, Case No. 23STCV13913, on June 15, 2023, Ana Belen
Garcia (“Garcia”) filed a complaint against Metro, Doe Driver, and Does 1
through 100, asserting causes of action for negligence, vicarious liability,
Vehicle Code section 17001, negligence, and vicarious liability (the “Garcia
Action”).
 
On
May 2, 2024, Metro filed an answer and a cross-complaint against Roes 1 through
20.
 
On
November 4, 2024, a notice of settlement was filed in the Garcia Action.
 
As
is relevant here, on August 19, 2024, the Court determined that these three
actions are related, and all were assigned to Department 29.
 
On October 8, 2024, LACMTA filed the motion to
consolidate. Notice of the motion was filed in all three related matters on
October 8. No opposition has been filed. 
 
This matter was initially set for hearing on November
4.  The Court, on its own motion,
continued the hearing to November 13. 
(The Court also continued the hearing in the Axelrod Action to November
18.)
 
Legal Standard
 
“When actions involving a common question of law or fact are
pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all
the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated
and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid
unnecessary costs or delay.”  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1048, subd. (a).)  The purpose of
consolidation is to enhance trial court efficiency by avoiding unnecessary
duplication of evidence and the danger of inconsistent adjudications.  (See Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield
Claimants Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-979.)
There are two types of consolidation: a
complete consolidation for all purposes, and a more limited consolidation for
trial or certain other specific purposes (such as pre-trial discovery).  (Hamilton
v. Asbestos Corp., Ltd. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147; Sanchez v. Super. Ct. (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1391, 1396; see also 3
Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (2024),
¶¶ 12:340-341.3.)  When cases are
consolidated for all purposes, “the two actions are merged into a single proceeding
under one case number and result in only one verdict or set of findings and one
judgment.”  (Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1147; see also Sanchez, supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1396.)  In a consolidation for limited purposes, “the
two actions remain otherwise separate.” 
(Hamilton, supra, 22 Cal.4th at
p. 1147; see also Sanchez,
supra, 203 Cal.App.3d at p.
1396.)  
“Consolidation under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1048 is permissive, and it is for the trial court to
determine whether the consolidation is for all purposes or for trial only.” (Hamilton,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1149.) 
The
trial court should not consolidate actions where prejudice would result to any
party.  (See State Farm Mutual Auto.
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d 428, 430.)
 
There are a number of special procedural
requirements for a motion to consolidate. 
Such a motion must (among other things): “(A) List all named parties in
each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their
respective attorneys of record; (B) Contain the captions of all the cases
sought to be consolidated; with the lowest numbered case shown first; and (C) Be
filed in each case sought to be consolidated.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350, subd. (a)(1).)  The motion must be “served on all attorneys
of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases sought to be
consolidated.”  (Id., subd.
(a)(2)(B).)  And before the motion is
heard, the cases must all be assigned to the same department.  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3,
subd. (g)(1) [“A motion to consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and
heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been
related into a single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that
department.”].)
 
Discussion
 
Metro requests
an order consolidating for all purposes Case Nos. 23STCV09010,
23STCV12815, and 23STCV13913. 
 
Metro
has satisfied all of the procedural requirements for this motion.  Metro has also shown that there is good cause
for the consolidation: all three actions arise out of the same accident, there
are common issues of law and fact in the three cases as well as common parties,
and consolidation would promote judicial efficiency as to discovery and motions
and preserve resources.
 
Accordingly, Metro’s
motion to consolidate is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Metro’s motion to
consolidate.
 
The Court ORDERS that Case Nos. 23STCV09010, 23STCV12815, and 23STCV13913
are consolidated for all purposes.  The
lead case is Case No. 23STCV09010.  All
future filings are to made in the lead case.
 
The Court PLACES OFF CALENDAR as moot the
motion to consolidate these actions that is set for hearing on November 18, 2024,
in Case No. 23STCV09010.
