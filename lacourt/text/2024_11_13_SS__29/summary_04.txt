And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff's response to discovery, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The judge also grants the defendant's motion for a deemed-admitted order, deeming the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission to be admitted. The judge imposes sanctions on the plaintiff in the amount of $700, but finds that imposing additional monetary sanctions on a homeless and ill person would be unjust. The judge orders the plaintiff to respond to the discovery requests and pay the sanctions within 30 days.
