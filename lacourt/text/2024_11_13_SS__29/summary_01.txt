And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice the motion to compel nonparty witness Dr. George Graf to appear for deposition. The motion was filed by the defendants, but no evidence was presented in support of the motion. Additionally, service on Dr. Graf was untimely, as it was completed only 13 court days before the hearing date. The judge notes that the court must deny the motion for two procedural reasons. The ruling does not address the merits of the motion, but rather is based on the procedural errors that were committed. The judge orders that the moving party give notice of the ruling.
