Plaintiffs’ Motion to Continue Trial 
Tentative
The motion is granted in part.
Background
On November 18, 2021, Martha Villalobos, Lucia
Villalobos, and Dayanne Villalobos (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a
complaint against Biagi Bros., Inc., Sergio Amador (collectively “Defendants”),
and Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of action for general negligence and
motor vehicle negligence arising out of an automobile accident on November 22,
2019.
 
On May 16, 2023, Defendants filed an answer.
 
On October 18, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion to
continue trial. No opposition has been filed.
 
The current trial date is December 5, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(8),
provides that the court has the power to amend and control its process and
orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine
when a continuance should be granted is within the discretion of the trial
court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) 
 
“A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
Plaintiffs request a continuance of the
December 5, 2024 trial date as counsel for both parties are engaged in other
trials leading up to and on the date of trial.
Plaintiffs’ lead counsel, Michael Geoola, is
engaged in trial (1) on October 25, 2024 in case no. CVPS2200671, (2) on
November 1, 2024 in case no. 19STCV18324, (3) on November 13, 2024 in case no.
20STCV38710, (4) on December 5, 2024 in case no. 19CV351276. (Pashai Decl., ¶¶4-6.)
The later three cases were all filed before Plaintiffs’ matter. (Id.) 
Further, defense counsel is engaged in trial,
case no. 37-2022-00033002-CU-PO-NC, set to begin on December 6, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 8.) 
Defendants have stipulated to the continuance.  (See id., ¶ 10 & Exh. B.)
The Court finds that
there is good cause to grant in part the motion to continue trial.  The parties have shown good cause to continue
trial, but they have not shown good cause to continue the trial for almost five
months.
The request is
granted in part.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS IN PART the motion to
continue trial. 
The Court CONTINUES the trial for
approximately 90 days, to a date on or after March 5, 2024.  The Final Status Conference and all deadlines
are reset based on the new trial date.
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
