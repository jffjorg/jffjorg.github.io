And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has granted in part the Plaintiffs' motion to continue the trial date from December 5, 2024 to a date on or after March 5, 2024. The motion was granted due to the fact that counsel for both parties are engaged in other trials, and the Court finds that there is good cause to continue the trial. However, the Court did not grant a continuance for almost five months, as the parties did not show sufficient good cause for that length of time. The Court also notes that the Defendants have stipulated to the continuance.
