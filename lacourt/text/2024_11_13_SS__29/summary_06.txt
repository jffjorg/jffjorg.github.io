And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Plaintiff's Counsel, Brian Jacobson, Esq., to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed on October 21, 2024, but was not served on the defendant until October 21, which is 16 days after the required 16-day notice period. Additionally, the required declaration on mandatory form MC-052 was not filed. The judge has noted that the court may order the substitution of counsel at any time before or after judgment, but that the determination of whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that Plaintiff's Counsel may refile the motion if the procedural issues are resolved.
