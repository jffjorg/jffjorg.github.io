Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on EAN Holdings, LLC's demurrer to the complaint filed by Brandon Ray McComb Evans, alleging negligence in a motor vehicle collision on August 13, 2021. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint sufficiently states a cause of action against EAN. EAN had argued that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the case due to preemption and that the complaint fails to state a cause of action. The judge disagreed, finding that the complaint alleges direct negligence on the part of EAN, rather than vicarious liability, and that the uncertainty argument raised by EAN is contradicted by the allegations in the complaint. The court has also denied EAN's request for judicial notice of certain facts. A case management conference and an order to show cause re: failure to file proof of service are set for January 30, 2024.
