  Case Number:  23PSCV02450    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  K Defendant EAN
Holdings, LLC’s Demurrer to Complaint is OVERRULED.
Background[1]  
Plaintiff Brandon Ray McComb
Evans (“Plaintiff”) sustained injuries in an August 13, 2021 motor vehicle
collision.
On August 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting a
cause of action against EAN Holdings LLC (“EAN”), Francisco J Rivera Alvarado
(“Alvarado”) and Does 1-20 for:
1.                 
Negligence
A Case Management Conference and an Order to Show Cause Re:
Failure to File Proof of Service are set for January 30, 2024.
Legal Standard
A
demurrer may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e) and(f).) A demurrer may also be made on
the ground that the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of
action alleged in the pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (a).)
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a
plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant
of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer
does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded
therein, or facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which
a court may take judicial knowledge.” (S.
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations
omitted].)
Discussion
EAN demurs, pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10, to Plaintiff’s complaint, on the basis
that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over EAN based on preemption
and that the sole cause of action therein fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.
Request for Judicial
Notice
The court denies EAN’s Request for Judicial Notice as unnecessary.
(Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th
26, 45, fn. 9 [“A request for judicial notice of published material is
unnecessary. Citation to the material is sufficient.”].)
Merits
“The elements of a negligence cause of action are the
existence of a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and proximate cause
resulting in injury.” (Castellon v. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th
994, 998).
Plaintiff has
alleged, inter alia, that on August 13, 2021 he was driving a
2017 Jeep Cherokee on SR-60 West (Complaint, ¶¶ 7-8); that Alvarado was driving
an MV Box Truck at the aforementioned time and place (Id., ¶ 9); that EAN “owned,
maintained, repaired, controlled, entrusted, managed, supervised, drove, and/or
operated motor vehicles that were
involved in the subject accident with Plaintiff” (Id., ¶ 10 [emphasis added]);
that “Defendants negligently entrusted, maintained, controlled,
managed, drove, manufactured, operated, repaired, distributed, inspected, and
repaired said automobiles so as to cause them to collide or be involved in
some way with the vehicle Plaintiff was driving, thereby causing the
hereinafter described injuries and damages to Plaintiff herein” (Id., ¶
11 [emphasis added).
EAN argues that
“vicarious liability based on permissive use has been preempted by application
of 49 U.S.C. § 30106(a)[2]
and eliminated as a basis for liability on the part of a rental car owner.”
(Demurrer, 4:22-25). Plaintiff has not alleged anywhere in the complaint,
however, that EAN rented or leased any of the vehicles involved in the incident
or that it is “engaged in the trade or business or renting or leasing motor
vehicles,” nor is this purported fact judicially noticeable. Further, EAN’s
focus on vicarious liability overlooks Plaintiff’s allegations of direct
negligence.
EAN’s uncertainty
argument (i.e., that it “is uncertain in how it states a cause of action
against defendant(s) on a basis other than ownership of an accident participant
vehicle” [Demurrer, 2:11-13]) is contradicted by the allegations in Paragraphs
9 and 10 of Plaintiff’s complaint.
EAN’s demurrer is overruled.
