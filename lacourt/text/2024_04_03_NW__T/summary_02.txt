And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the ex parte application to advance the hearing on the motion to compel the deposition of Dr. Avila and for sanctions. The court has denied the application, citing a congested calendar and the fact that the motion is being heard three months before trial. Additionally, the court is inclined to stay the entire action due to the bankruptcy of Partnership Staffing. The court notes that if Partnership Staffing returns to the case, depositions taken in the interim may need to be repeated, and access to information in the defendant's possession may be difficult to obtain. The court will discuss the ex parte application at the hearing.
