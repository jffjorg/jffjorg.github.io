 Case Number:  23VECV01049    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01049 Alvarez v McGuire
Tentative ruling: Motion by defendant for stay: DENIED.
Defendant asks for a stay of this action pending a criminal matter in which he has already been convicted but is awaiting sentencing asserting that his 5th Amendment Rights are at stake.  It is notable that this concern has not stopped defendant from affirmatively filing his own cross-complaint (without leave of court) setting forth judicial admissions, nor has the criminal case impeded his own service of discovery and discovery motions during the pendency of his criminal case.  If he deems it appropriate to assert 5th Amendment objections, he will be free to do so but having filed his own affirmative relief action, he cannot prevent answering discovery on his own claims, as well.
