And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's request for a stay of the action pending a criminal matter in which he has already been convicted but is awaiting sentencing. The defendant argues that his 5th Amendment Rights are at stake, but the judge notes that the defendant has already affirmatively filed a cross-complaint and has served discovery and discovery motions during the pendency of his criminal case. The judge rules that the defendant will be free to assert his 5th Amendment objections if he deems it appropriate, but he cannot prevent answering discovery on his own claims.
