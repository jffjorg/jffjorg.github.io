 Case Number:  22VECV01240    Hearing Date:   April 3, 2024    Dept:  T Soto v
Puretek Corporation 22VECV01240
The court denies the ex parte application to advance the hearing on the
motion to compel the deposition of Dr. Avila and for sanctions.  The court has a congested calendar, and the
motion is being heard 3 months before trial.  However, as to the trial date, the court is
now inclined to stay the entire action because of the bankruptcy of Partnership
Staffing.  If Partnership Staffing comes
back into this case, depositions taken in the interim may need to be repeated.  Access to information in the possession of
defendant will be difficult to obtain. 
The court will discuss as the hearing on the ex parte application.
