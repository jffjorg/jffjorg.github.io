And here is the summary in English text:

The judge, Joel L. Lofton, issues a tentative ruling in the case of Jackie Chen vs. Sunny HOA, Van Hoan Wong, and others. The case stems from a physical attack on August 26, 2020, which Jackie Chen claims to have suffered. Jilbert Tahmazian, counsel for the defendants, moves to be relieved as counsel due to the defendants' inability to pay for his legal services. The judge grants the motion, but delays the effective date of the order until proof of service of the signed order on the clients and proof that the clients have been properly served with notice of the next trial date have been filed with the court. The judge finds that Tahmazian has complied with the necessary procedures and has provided adequate notice to the clients and other parties.
