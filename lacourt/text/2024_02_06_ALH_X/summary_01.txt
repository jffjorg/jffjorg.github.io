And here is the English summary:

The Judge, Joel L. Lofton, has issued a tentative ruling in a case between V&K Properties, LLC (Plaintiff) and Amguard Insurance Company and Prolink Elite Financial & Insurance Services (Defendants). The case involves allegations of bad faith by the Defendants while handling an insurance claim. The Plaintiff has filed a first amended complaint alleging breach of contractual duty, breach of implied covenant, and negligence. The Defendants have entered into a settlement, and Prolink is seeking a determination that the settlement was made in good faith.

The Judge has granted Prolink's motion to file its motion under seal, meaning that the specific amount of the settlement and related information will be kept confidential. The Judge has also granted Prolink's motion for determination of good faith settlement, finding that the settlement was made in good faith.

The Judge's decision is based on the terms of the settlement and the circumstances surrounding the settlement. The Judge considered factors such as the amount of the settlement, the alleged tortfeasor's potential liability, and the existence of an express indemnity agreement between Prolink and Amguard. The Judge also noted that the burden of proving the lack of good faith is on the contesting party, and that Amguard has not demonstrated that the settlement was not made in good faith.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling is a favorable one for Prolink, as it determines that the settlement was made in good faith and therefore bars any further claims by Amguard against Prolink.
