 Case Number:  20STCV35537    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving and responding papers, the Court rules as follows.   BACKGROUND  On  September 17, 2020, Plaintiff Shiv Andrew Arora (“Plaintiff”)  filed this action against Defendants City of Los Angeles (“City of Los Angeles”),  City of West Hollywood (“City of West Hollywood”), County of Los Angeles  (“County”), State of California (“State”), and Does 1-100 for  negligence/statutory liability under Government Code section 815.2.  On  October 22, 2020, the City of West Hollywood filed an answer and a cross-complaint  against Cross-Defendants City of Los Angeles, County, State, and Does 1-100 for  indemnification.  On November 20, 2020, the  City of Los Angeles filed an answer.  On  December 27, 2021, the Court dismissed the City of West Hollywood’s cross-complaint  with prejudice at its request.  On  November 9, 2020, the Court dismissed the State without prejudice at  Plaintiff’s request. On November 10, 2020, the Court dismissed the County  without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. On November 29, 2021, the Court  dismissed the City of West Hollywood with prejudice at Plaintiff’s request.  On  November 13, 2020, the City of Los Angeles filed an answer to Plaintiff’s complaint.  On  May 5, 2021, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendants Arnold P.  Keller as Doe 1 and Zipora Keller as Doe 2.   On July 2, 2021, Plaintiff filed additional amendments stating that, having  designated defendants by the incorrect names of Arnold P. Keller and Zipora  Keller, Plaintiff was amending the complaint to substitute their true names, Arnold P. Keller as Trustee of Fairfax Marquis  Trust (“Arnold Keller”) and Zipora Keller as Trustee of Fairfax Marquis Trust (“Zipora  Keller”).  On August 10, 2021, Arnold Keller and Zipora Keller filed an answer. On August 12, 2021, Arnold Keller and Zipora  Keller filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants the City of Los Angeles  and Roes 1-20 for indemnity, equitable apportionment, and declaratory relief. On January 13, 2022, the Court dismissed Arnold Keller and Zipora Keller from Plaintiff's complaint without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request.  On March 14, 2022, the Court dismissed the  cross-complaint filed by Arnold Keller and Zipora Keller without prejudice at their request.  On  March 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement.   On  November 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to enforce settlement to be heard  on November 30, 2023. On November 16, 2023, the City of Los Angeles filed a  declaration responding to the motion.  No  trial date is currently scheduled.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Plaintiff  requests that the Court enforce a settlement agreement.  The  City of Los Angeles does not make a specific request.  LEGAL STANDARD                    Code  of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part:  “(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a  writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally  before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon  motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If  requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to  enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.  “(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed  by a party if it is signed by any of the following:  “(1) The party.  “(2) An attorney who represents the party.  “(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is  authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subds. (a), (b).)  In  deciding motions made under section 664.6, courts “must determine whether the  parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.”  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th  1530, 1533.)  On a motion to enforce a  settlement under section 664.6, courts have the power to decide disputed facts  and to interpret the agreement.  (Fiore  v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566; L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal.  Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶¶ 12:977–12:978.5, pp.  12(ll)-139 to 12(ll)-140.) Courts may receive evidence, determine disputed  facts including the terms the parties previously agreed on, and enter the terms  of a settlement agreement as a judgment, but they may not create new material  terms. (Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1360.)  DISCUSSION  Plaintiff  asserts that on March 14, 2023, he and the City of Los Angeles (“City”) agreed  to settle Plaintiff’s claims against the City.   On April 28, 2023, Plaintiff signed and returned a release at the City’s  request but he has not yet received a settlement check. Plaintiff asks the Court  to enforce the settlement.  By its terms, the  release contains the “entire agreement” between Plaintiff and the City.  (See Yousefian Dec. ¶ 15 & Exh. A.)  The release does not contain any provision ensuring  payment of the settlement amount to Plaintiff by a particular date – in fact,  the release, which Plaintiff and his counsel signed, states that Plaintiff  acknowledges the “receipt and sufficiency” of the settlement amount.  Plaintiff  does not contend that the City agreed to pay him the settlement amount without first  subjecting the settlement to the City’s approval process.  His complaint, apparently, is that the  approval process is taking too long.  In  short, Plaintiff has not identified any provision of the settlement agreement  that requires the City to pay him the settlement amount by a particular date or  without first receiving approval from appropriate City officials.  Nor has Plaintiff shown that the City is trying to back out of the settlement agreement.  The Court denies the motion.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES Plaintiff Shiv Andrew Arora's motion to enforce  the settlement agreement reached with the City of Los Angeles on March 14, 2023.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
