  Case Number:  20STCV14497    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 15, 2020, Plaintiff Mark Rufin (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Abraham Dominguez (“Defendant”) and Does
1-25 for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. 
On
September 28, 2021, the clerk entered Defendant's default. 
On
January 27, 2023, the Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice. On May
30, 2023, the Court vacated the dismissal. 
On
September 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for court judgment to be heard on
September 18, 2023.  The Court continued
the hearing to November 30, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter a default judgment against Defendant Abraham
Dominguez and award Plaintiff $376,586.85, consisting of $176,586.85 in special
damages, $200,000.00 in general damages, $0.00 in prejudgment interest, $0.00 in
attorney’s fees, and $0.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default
judgment 
“[With
exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party seeking a default judgment on
declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to
Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following must be included in the
documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief
summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's
claim; 
“(2)  Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A declaration of nonmilitary status for each
defendant against whom judgment is sought; 
“(6)  A proposed form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request for attorney fees if allowed by
statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
  On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
The
relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed
the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury cases where
damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount listed in the statement
of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).) “The notice
requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental fairness.” (Becker
v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The
statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have
adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken against them. [Citation.]
‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the
defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a right to a hearing on the
matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial court exceeds its
jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the
complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494; see Cal. Practice
Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258, p. 5-70.)  
The
Court may not award speculative damages such as compensation for future loss or
harm which, although possible, is conjectural or not reasonably certain.  (Scognamillo v. Herrick (2019) 106
Cal.App.4th 1139, 1151 [default judgment’s damage award for a second surgery
was speculative where “the trial court did not have before it sufficient
evidence, based on a reasonable medical probability, to make such an award”].)  
DISCUSSION 
A.   Plaintiff did not properly serve the statements
of damages 
“If
a defendant has not appeared in the action, the CCP §425.11 statement of
damages must be served ‘in the same manner as a summons’ . . . .”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:91,
p. 5-33, citing Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11, subd. (d)(1).)  
For
service in California, a summons may be served by “substitute service,” which
consists of “[d]elivery to someone else at defendant’s usual residence or place
of business” coupled with mailing copies to the defendant.  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶
4:181(2), p. 4-28; ¶ 4:193(2), p. 4-31; Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20.)  To serve an individual using substitute
service, “a good faith effort at personal service must first be
attempted.”  (Id., ¶ 4:196, p.
4-32.)  That is, “there must be a showing
that summons ‘cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered’ to the
individual defendant.”  (Ibid.,
quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).) 
Here,
on May 3, 2021, Plaintiff purportedly “sub-served” a statement of damages on Defendant and
filed the corresponding proof of service on May 10, 2021 (the first statement of damages). (Declaration of H.
Dean Aynechi, Esq. Regarding Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to
Submit Default Judgment Packet (filed September 26, 2022), ¶ 23 & Exhibit
I.) The statement of damages (Exh. I) requests $27,675 for “pain, suffering,
and inconvenience” and $1,000 for “emotional distress,” for a total of $28,675
in general damages.  In addition, the first statement of damages lists $11,070 in medical expenses to
date and states that future medical expenses are “unknown.” 
The
proof of service attached to the first statement of damages asserts that
substituted service took place on May 3, 2021. 
However, the proof of service does not provide any evidence that the
statement of damages could not with reasonable diligence be personally
delivered to Defendant.  Therefore,
service of the first statement of damages was ineffective. 
Because
Plaintiff did not properly serve a statement of damages on Defendant before the
clerk entered Defendant’s default, the Court vacates the September 28, 2021
default. 
On
August 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a second statement of damages claiming $100,000 for pain and suffering, $100,000 for emotional distress, $111,586.85
for medical expenses to date, and $65,000 as the present value of future
medical expenses.  The proof of service attached to the second statement
of damages asserts that substituted service took place on February 12,
2023.  However, the proof of service does
not provide any evidence that the statement of damages could not with
reasonable diligence be personally delivered to Defendant.  Therefore, service of the second statement of
damages was ineffective. 
B.   Additional issues 
Section
2 of Plaintiff’s CIV-100 form does not request costs and no cost amount is
included in the judgment requested. 
Similarly, Plaintiff's JUD-100 form does not request costs.  However, Section 7 of Plaintiff’s CIV-100
form requests $1,453.64 in costs and counsel requests costs in his
declaration.  (Amended Dec. of H. Dean
Aynechi ¶ 32.) 
The
application does not explain how Plaintiff calculated the cost of future
medical care ($65,000).  The Court needs
additional information to support this element of damages. 
Plaintiff
has not dismissed or applied for separate judgment against the Doe defendants.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7)
[requiring “A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or
an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment”].) 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court VACATES Defendant Abraham Dominguez’s
default entered on September 28, 2021. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Mark Rufin’s application for default judgment filed on
September 11, 2023.   
The
Court sets an Order To Show Cause Re: Status of Entry of Default on January 4, 2024,
at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
