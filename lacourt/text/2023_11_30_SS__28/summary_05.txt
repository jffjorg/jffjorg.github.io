The Court also awards sanctions of $1,180.00 to Plaintiff for the failure of Defendant Wine Warehouse to respond to these requests. The Court finds that Defendant Wine Warehouse is responsible for its failure to respond, despite having filed an answer to the complaint and having been granted extensions of time to respond. The Court notes that Defendant Wine Warehouse's counsel has tried diligently but without success to contact Defendant Wine Warehouse, and therefore does not impose sanctions on counsel. The Court orders Defendant Wine Warehouse to pay the sanctions by January 2, 2024.
