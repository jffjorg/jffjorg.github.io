```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows: the defendant's motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, served on the plaintiff, is granted. The plaintiff failed to provide timely responses to the requests for admission, and the court finds that the defendant's failure to serve a timely response was not the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The court therefore deems admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission. The defendant also requests monetary sanctions of $265.00, which the court grants. The plaintiff is ordered to pay the defendant $265.00 by January 2, 2024.
