BACKGROUND 
On August 26, 2022, Plaintiff Anthony Holt
  (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Los Angeles County
  Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“LACMTA”), City of Long Beach
  (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), California Department of Transportation,
  and Does 1-50 for dangerous condition of public property under Government
  Code section 815.2 and Vehicle Code section 17001. 
On October 20, 2022, the City filed an answer. On
  October 28, 2022, the County filed an answer. On October 31, 2022, Defendant
  The People of the State of California, acting by and through the Department
  of Transportation, erroneously sued as California Department of
  Transportation (“State”), filed an answer. On November 21, 2022, LACMTA filed
  an answer. 
On April 13, 2023, the Court dismissed the County
  without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. On May 11,
  2023, the Court dismissed the State without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On October 18, 2023, Plaintiff's counsel Steven
  Ross, Downtown LA Law Group, LLP, filed a motion to be relieved as counsel to
  be heard on November 15, 2023. The Court continued the hearing to November
  30, 2023. 
Trial is currently scheduled for February 23, 2024. 
COUNSEL’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s counsel Steven Ross, Downtown LA Law
  Group, LLP, asks to be relieved as counsel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
  Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed
  to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
  form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising
  the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under
  Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent
  under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in
  Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
  service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order
  on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
  proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion
  to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw.  The motion should be granted if there is no
  prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
DISCUSSION 
Counsel has submitted completed MC-051, MC-052 and
  MC-053 forms. Counsel has provided a declaration stating: “The
  attorney-client relationship (ie: communication) has broken down and
  differences have arisen such that the firm of Downtown LA Law Group, LLP, can
  no longer continue representation. Request has been made upon Plaintiff to
  cooperate with the prosecution of his case but Plaintiff has not done so.” 
Counsel states that he served Plaintiff at his last
  known address by mail. Counsel was unable to confirm the address but made
  efforts to confirm by calling Plaintiff and conducting a locate search. 
The Court previously continued the hearing to allow
  counsel to submit proof of service on all parties that have appeared in this
  action. On November 21, 2023, counsel filed a corrected proof of service showing
  that all parties that have appeared in the case were served. 
The Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS the motion of Plaintiff’s counsel
Steven
  Ross, Downtown LA Law Group, LLP, to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel will be relieved upon filing proof
  of service of the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
  Counsel--Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053) on Plaintiff
Anthony
  Holt. 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Counsel is ordered to file the proof of service of
  this ruling with the Court within five days.
