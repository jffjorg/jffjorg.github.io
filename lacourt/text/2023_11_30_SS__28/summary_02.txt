The judge has denied a motion by Plaintiff Shiv Andrew Arora to enforce a settlement agreement reached with the City of Los Angeles on March 14, 2023. The settlement agreement was reached after the filing of a complaint by the plaintiff against the city and others. The agreement was signed by the plaintiff and the city, but it does not contain any provision ensuring payment of the settlement amount by a particular date. The plaintiff has not shown that the city is trying to back out of the settlement agreement, but rather is disputing the delay in payment. The judge has ruled that the settlement agreement is valid and binding, but that the city is not required to pay the settlement amount by a particular date.
