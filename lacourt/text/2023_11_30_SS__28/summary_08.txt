And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the case, 21STCV45883, will not proceed as a Personal Injury Case in Department 28 due to the case not falling under the Standing Order Re: Personal Injury Procedures, Central District. As a result, the case has been referred to the Supervising Judge in Department 1, Stanley Mosk Courthouse, for review and reassignment to an Independent Calendar Court. The Plaintiff will receive direct notice of the new courtroom assignment. The hearing scheduled for November 30, 2023, in Department 28 will not take place. If the case is reassigned, the Plaintiff may need to reschedule the hearing or make a new reservation for a motion in the new department.
