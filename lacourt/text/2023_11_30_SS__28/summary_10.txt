And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 22STCV29241, determining that the case is complicated due to the number of pretrial hearings and complexity of issues. As a result, the case is being transferred and reassigned to Department 8 in the Inglewood Courthouse, presided over by Judge Ronald F. Frank. The hearing scheduled for November 30, 2023, in Department 28 will not proceed. Any pending motions or hearings will be reset, continued, or vacated at the direction of the newly assigned department. The parties are advised to contact the newly assigned department to reschedule matters, and not to contact Department 8 on November 28, 2023, as that department will not have been informed of the transfer.
