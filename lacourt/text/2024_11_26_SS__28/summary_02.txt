And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff is seeking $200,000.00 in damages for an auto accident that occurred in 2019. The plaintiff has submitted evidence of medical expenses and lost income, but the judge finds that this evidence is insufficient to support the plaintiff's claim. The judge notes that the plaintiff has requested $100,000.00 in special damages, but has only submitted bills showing $6,333.00 in medical expenses. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's witness, Thomas Winn, has provided no evidence to support his assertions about the plaintiff's income before and after the accident. Therefore, the judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment.
