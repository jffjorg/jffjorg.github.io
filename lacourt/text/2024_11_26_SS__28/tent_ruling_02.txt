 Case Number:  21STCV00165    Hearing Date:   November 26, 2024    Dept:  28 Having considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default judgment, the Court rules as follows. BACKGROUND On January 4, 2021, Plaintiff Tony Nguyen (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Grant McPheron (“Defendant”) and Does 1-5 for negligence (auto accident) and negligent infliction of emotional distress. On June 27, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of personal service of the summons and complaint on Defendant on January 30, 2021. On June 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages with a proof of personal service on Defendant on June 27, 2022. On September 16, 2022, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. On November 29, 2022, the Court dismissed Does 1-5 without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. On August 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment. PARTY’S REQUEST Plaintiff Tony Nguyen asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant Grant McPheron and award Plaintiff $200,000.00, consisting of $100,000.00 in special damages and $100,000.00 in general damages.LEGAL STANDARDA.      Default judgment           California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a), provides: “[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: “(1)  Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's claim; “(2)  Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; “(3)  Interest computations as necessary; “(4)  A memorandum of costs and disbursements; “(5)  A declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; “(6)  A proposed form of judgment; “(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; “(8)  Exhibits as necessary; and “(9)  A request for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) B.       Damages  The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494.) DISCUSSION           Plaintiff asserts that on January 5 or 6, 2019, Defendant’s vehicle rear-ended Plaintiff’s vehicle, injuring Plaintiff and damaging his vehicle.  Plaintiff seeks $200,000.00 in damages, consisting of $100,000.00 in special damages and $100,000.00 in general damages. Despite Plaintiff’s request for $100,000.00 in special damages, Plaintiff has submitted bills showing only about $6,333.00 in medical expenses. Plaintiff has also submitted statements from Hung Dinh Doan, M.D. (“Dr. Doan”), who asserts that Plaintiff has incurred medical expenses of not less than $400,000 and will incur $500,000 in future medical expenses. However, aside from Dr. Doan’s assertions, the application contains no evidence to support these conclusions. In addition, Plaintiff has submitted a declaration from Thomas Winn (“Winn”), who states he is the Chief Human Resources Officer of the Air Force Law Center. The declaration states: “I got personal knowledge and can verify the facts as below . . . .” Winn asserts that Plaintiff’s income before the accident was $15,000 per month and is now $1,000 per month. Winn provides no facts to support his assertion that he has personal knowledge of these facts, however, and Plaintiff presents no other evidence to support Winn’s statements. The Court denies the application.         CONCLUSION The Court DENIES Plaintiff Tony Nguyen’s application for default judgment against Defendant Grant McPheron filed on August 1, 2024. Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
