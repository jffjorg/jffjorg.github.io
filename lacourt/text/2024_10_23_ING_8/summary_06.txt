- "The necessity and financial burden of private enforcement, or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity, are such as to make the award appropriate."
- "In determining whether an award of attorney fees should be granted under California's Private Attorney General Act, the trial court in its discretion must realistically assess the litigation and determine, from a practical perspective, whether or not the action served to vindicate an important right so as to justify an attorney fee award."
- "A prevailing defendant is entitled to attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 only when the plaintiff's claims are 'groundless, without foundation, frivolous, or unreasonable.'"
- "The court would tentatively find in favor of granting a portion of Defendants' asserted attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for attorneys' fees filed by the defendants, Gordon Leon, Michael Barth, Jim Knight, and Colleen Miller, in a case brought by Conjunction Junction, LLC. The defendants argue that they are entitled to attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 because they successfully defended ACLAD, a public entity, against the plaintiff's claims. The judge notes that the defendants have shown that they are the prevailing party and that their defense of ACLAD advanced and protected important public interests. However, the judge is inclined to tentatively grant only a portion of the defendants' asserted attorneys' fees because the defendants have not shown why the fees should not be paid out of their recovery. The judge also notes that the parties will be asked to provide oral argument on the reasonableness of the fees claimed by the defendants.
