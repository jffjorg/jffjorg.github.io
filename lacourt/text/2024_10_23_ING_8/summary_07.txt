The court has issued a tentative ruling on the pending motions. The court finds that the defendants' motion to compel arbitration is continued. The court denies the plaintiff's motion to compel initial responses and deem matters admitted as mooted by the belated service of responses. The court grants the defendants' motion for relief from waiver of objections. The court encourages the parties to stipulate to extend the time to bring a motion to compel further responses and to meet and confer on resolving the objections and claimed insufficient substantive responses.
