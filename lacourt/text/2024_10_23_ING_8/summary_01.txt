Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Westmoreland's Motion to Seal the record in the case of Sebastian Medvei v. Dominique Nikko Westmoreland. The motion was filed without opposition and argued that the parties have jointly agreed to seal the record to protect their professional reputations. However, the Judge found that the moving party failed to carry their burden of showing that the factors weigh in favor of sealing the entire record. The Judge questions the parties on how the sealing of all records present in a matter is narrowly tailored and whether the appellate record would also be sealed. The Judge will allow oral argument addressing these concerns, but the tentative ruling is to deny the motion to seal.
