I. BACKGROUND¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On February
29, 2024, Plaintiff, Furqan Ali (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., and DOES 1 through 10. On April 22,
2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). On August 15, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging causes of action (1)
Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil Code section
1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(a)(3); and (4) Breach of
the Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Civil Code §§ 1791.1, 1794, 1795.5). 
 
On July 16,
2024, this Court previously sustained American Honda Motor Co., Inc.’s (“AHM”)
demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC.  Defendant,
American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“AHM”) now files a demurrer to the SAC. 
 
B. Procedural¿¿ 
¿ 
On September 17, 2024, AHM filed its Demurrer and
Motion to Strike portions of Plaintiff’s SAC. On October 10, 2024, Plaintiff
filed opposition briefs. On October 16, 2024, AHM filed reply briefs. 
 
 
 
 
II. ANALYSIS  
 
A.   
Demurrer
 
                         
i.         
Meet
and Confer
 
The
declaration of Leanna L. H. Vault, Esq., is offered in support of counsel’s
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. Vault declares that on August
22, 2024, she met and conferred telephonically with Plaintiff’s counsel
regarding the demurrer. However, Vault contends that the parties’ respective
counsels were unable to come to an agreement regarding the grounds for which
AHM brings this demurrer. (Declaration of Leanna L. H. Vault (“Vault Decl.”), ¶¶
2-3.) Thus, this Court finds that the meet and confer requirements have been
met. 
 
                       
ii.         
Legal
Standard
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters
outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that
might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For
the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer
admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City
Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
A pleading is uncertain if it is
ambiguous or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer
for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders
the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to
respond to.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed,
even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can
be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of
California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)¿¿ 
 
                     
iii.         
Discussion 
 
As a preliminary matter, the SAC alleges that Plaintiff
purchased the subject Honda Pilot in February of 2018, and that the vehicle
came with a 3-year basic limited warranty plus a 5-year powertrain warranty.  As the Court previously noted on the earlier Demurrer,
the “portions” of the vehicle’s repair history alleged in the SAC do not begin
until March of 2022, beyond the 3-year basic warranty but potentially within the
5-year powertrain period.  But Paragraph
22 of the SAC alleges only a maintenance visit and a recall campaign in March
of 2022, with no allegation that any of the complained-of items fall withing
the ambit of the powertrain warranty. 
Paragraph 23 is amended in the SAC, alleging that on January 9, 2023,
Plaintiff presented the Pilot to a Honda dealer for electrical, engine and/or transmission
issues including “shaking” of the vehicle and the illumination of multiple
dashboard indicator lights when starting in the morning.  This date is within the five-year powertrain period,
and conceivably could be a powertrain issue, but that is not specifically
alleged in the SAC.  Also, illumination
of dashboard indicator lights may be a normal startup operation or it could be
indicative of something else; the SAC lacks any allegation as to which lights, whether
they extinguished, or whether they are for items covered by the 5-year powertrain
warranty which was about to expire by time a few weeks later.  While the SAC adds the allegation that
Plaintiff discovered that the repairs earlier that month did not resolve the
alleged defect, there is no additional presentation for repair alleged.
 He alleges that he continued to
experience symptoms of the alleged defects despite Defendant’s representation
that the various defects were repaired. (SAC, ¶ 25.) 
 
As with the
previous demurrer, the Court does not find any further allegations of defects
from January 30, 2023 to the filing of the original complaint in this case.
Further, the Court questions whether the January 30, 2023 date listed is what
plaintiff considers to be “shortly before [the] filing [of] this complaint” in
2024 for the purposes of that allegation. (SAC, ¶ 29.)  Previously, the Court encouraged
Plaintiff to plead the tolling allegations with greater specificity as well,
and to plead if truthful more than the single presentation mentioned in the
Complaint because the core refund-or-replace contention requires more than a
single presentation. (Silvio v. Ford Motor Co. (2003) 109 CA4th 1205,
1208.)  Without more than the one presentation
for an arguable powertrain complaint, Plaintiff has no viable cause of action
for violation of the repair-or-replace obligation.  
 
AHM argues that the SAC, like the FAC,
contains the same boilerplate allegations offered in support of Plaintiff’s Song-Beverly
claims. The court notes that the actual paragraphs under each of the four
causes of action are the exact same as those in the FAC. (FAC, ¶¶ 41-59; SAC,
¶¶ 41-59.) Plaintiff’s opposition brief does not address the sufficiency of
allegations at all, and instead, focuses only on the statute of limitations
issue. 
 
As such, the Court again notes that
the SAC, like the FAC, is barely one step removed from a lawsuit
that merely recites the elements of a cause of action by quoting CACI.
Plaintiff will be required to provide oral argument indicating to the Court how
it would amend its pleading to comply with the Court’s previous order as well
as its current order since Plaintiff simply pleaded the exact same allegations
found to be insufficient by this court previously. The demurrer is SUSTAINED.
Leave to amend will be based on Plaintiff’s oral argument. 
 
 
B.    Motion to Strike
 
AHM seeks to strike, from paragraph 25, “on January 30, 2023” from
the SAC arguing that this fact is false and contradictory. AHM contends that
the allegation that Plaintiff discovery of AHM’s misconduct in January 2023 –
over one year prior to filing the initial complaint in this case – is not
“shortly before filing that complaint. The court has also requested oral
argument from Plaintiff clarifying this issue. However, in Plaintiff’s
opposition, he asserts that he discovered the wrongful conduct on January 30,
2023, and continued to further review and investigate the engine, transmission,
and/or electrical defects that plagued the subject vehicle, eventually filing
his complaint on February 29, 2024. 
 
Oral argument is requested. 
 
III.
CONCLUSION¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
For the foregoing reasons, AHM’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED. Leave to amend will depend on Plaintiff’s oral argument.
 
Further, AHM’s motion to
strike also depends on Plaintiff’s oral argument. 
 
AHM is ordered to give notice
of the ruling unless notice is waived.¿¿¿¿
