And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court finds that the Plaintiff, Youngkyu Lee, has carried her burden of proof on a motion for summary judgment, seeking to evict the Defendants, Eric Floyd and Wanda Dee, from the Rental Premises located at 31023 Via Rivera, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90275. The Court grants the motion for summary judgment on two independent grounds: (1) expiration of a fixed-term tenancy and (2) non-payment of rent.

Regarding the first ground, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has proven a prima facie case for eviction based on the expiration of the fixed-term tenancy. The Court notes that the Defendants failed to raise a triable issue of fact bearing on the habitability or any other defense.

Regarding the second ground, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has also proven a prima facie case for eviction based on non-payment of rent. The Court notes that the Defendants failed to pay rent as required and that the Plaintiff properly served a three-day notice to pay rent or quit.

The Court also finds that the Defendants' affirmative defenses, including breach of warranty of habitability, retaliatory eviction, repair and deduct, and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, are not supported by evidence and do not raise a triable issue of fact.

The Court grants the motion for summary judgment and orders that the Plaintiff provide notice to the Defendants.
