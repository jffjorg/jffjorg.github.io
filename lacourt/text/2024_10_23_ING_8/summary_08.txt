And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (AHM) in the case of Furqan Ali v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc.

The judge sustains AHM's demurrer, meaning that the complaint filed by the plaintiff is insufficient to state a cause of action. The judge notes that the plaintiff's complaint is barely one step removed from a lawsuit that merely recites the elements of a cause of action by quoting CACI.

The judge also grants AHM's motion to strike, striking the allegation that the plaintiff discovered AHM's misconduct in January 2023, more than a year prior to filing the complaint.

The judge orders the parties to provide oral argument on the issues of leave to amend the complaint and the motion to strike. The judge also orders AHM to give notice of the ruling unless notice is waived.

In summary, the judge's tentative ruling sustains AHM's demurrer and grants AHM's motion to strike, and orders the parties to provide oral argument on the issues of leave to amend and the motion to strike.
