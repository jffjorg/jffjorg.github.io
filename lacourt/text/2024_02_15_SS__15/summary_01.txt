And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying defendant's motion for summary adjudication on the plaintiff's punitive damages claim. The motion was served with insufficient notice, and the defendant did not provide any evidence of an agreement to shorten the notice period after the parties signed a stipulation stating that the standard notice period applies. The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel offered to work with the defendant on the notice period, but the defendant did not request a shorter period. As a result, the judge finds that the motion was served with insufficient notice and is denied. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
