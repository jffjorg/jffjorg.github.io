  Case Number:  21STCV06288    Hearing Date:   February 15, 2024    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE
MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION
On February 17, 2021,
Plaintiff Kenneth Chaney filed this action alleging his father, Walter
Frederick Chaney, developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos from
The W.W. Henry Company, L.P.  Defendant
filed a motion for summary adjudication of Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim. 
Plaintiff argues the
motion is late.  On October 24, 2023,
defense counsel asked if Plaintiffs would agree to shorten the notice
period.  (Plaintiff’s Index, Ex. A at p.
3.)  On October 25, 2023, Plaintiffs’
counsel said, “Sure, no problem.”  (Id.
at pp. 2-3.)  On October 25, defense
counsel asked, “What can you live with? 
30 days before hearing?”  (Id.
at p. 2.)  That same day, Plaintiffs’
counsel responded, “Let’s say 55 days for now . . . but I’m going to circulate
as stip where we just move the MSJ hearings back a month to closer to the
hearing deadline so we can keep the 75 day notice period (I’ll work with you if
you need something else).”  (Ibid.)  Defense counsel replied, “I’ll take 55
days!”  (Id. at p. 1.)  Then, on November 7, 2023, the parties signed
a stipulation stating:  “The parties have
agreed to the following adjusted dates for hearings on summary judgment
motions.  The below date enable the
parties to comply with the standard notice period under Code Civ. Proc. §
437c(a).”  (Plaintiff’s Index, Ex. B at
p. 2.)  The stipulation set Defendant’s
motion to be heard on February 13, 2024, meaning the motion would need to be
filed and served by November 30, 2023 to satisfy the “standard notice period.”
Instead, Defendant filed
its motion on December 20, 2023.
Defendant did not provide
any evidence of an agreement after the November 7, 2023 stipulation to give Defendant
regarding a shortened notice period despite the clear statement in the
stipulation that the standard notice period applies.  While Plaintiffs’ counsel offered to “work
with you if you need something else” besides the standard notice period stated
in the stipulation, Defendant presented no evidence of a request for a shorter
period after signing the stipulation for the standard notice period.
The motion for summary
adjudication on the claim for punitive damages was served with insufficient
notice and is DENIED. 
The moving party is to
give notice.
