  Case Number:  23STCV01424    Hearing Date:   June 14, 2024    Dept:  57 The motion of Defendant Cosentino Group, S.A. ("Defendant") to quash the service of the summons on it is GRANTED.   Although Cosentino Group, S.A. was properly served, the Court has concluded that personal jurisdiction over Cosentino Group, S.A. is lacking.  The Plaintiffs' asserted basis of personal jurisdiction is the doctrine of special jurisdiction.  In the Court's view, however, special jurisdiction is  inapplicable because the evidence before the Court shows that the Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of demonstrating that Cosentino Group, S.A purposefully availed itself of the benefits of the forum state.The Court is making the same ruling on the motion to quash of Cosentino Group, S.A. in Moz-Murcia v. Architectural Surfaces, Inc.
