TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff Elm Terrace
Holdings, LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment against Defendant
Truman Hedding aka Truman Hedding
IV. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount of $69,179.47, comprising $44,028.16 demanded in the Complaint,
$9,434.31 in interest, $1,220.00 in costs, and $14,497.00 in attorney fees. 
The Court notes a number of defects with the submitted default
judgment package.
First, Item 1(d)
of the Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100) and Item 5(a) of the proposed
Judgment (Form JUD-100) indicate that Plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment
against “Truman Hedding aka Truman Hedding IV.” However, the
defendant named in the Complaint is “Truman Hedding.”
Second, Item 8 of the Request for Court Judgment (Declaration of nonmilitary status) is
not signed. Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(5),
a party seeking a default judgment must file “[a] declaration of nonmilitary status
for each defendant against whom judgment is sought.”
Third, Item 2(d)
of the Request for Court Judgment indicates that Plaintiff seeks $1,220.00
in costs. However, Item 7 of the Request (the Memorandum of costs)
indicates that a total of $600 in costs were incurred.  
Fourth, the Declaration of Neil Cadman filed in
support of the request references a lease attached as “Exhibit A” and a
guaranty of the lease attached as “Exhibit B.” (Cadman Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) The
Court notes that no exhibits were attached to the Declaration of Neil Cadman
filed on September 5, 2023.
Fifth, Plaintiff
appears calculate the requested interest based on the amount of the November 9,
2022 Judgment in this action against Defendant Snatch Media, Inc. dba Dealer
Preroll. (See Cadman Decl., ¶ 9, “the additional interest amount
will
be, at 10% interest on the $58,632.91 judgment is the sum of $5,429.56.”)
It is unclear why Plaintiff is seeking interest on the total amount of a
judgment against another defendant in this action herein.   
Sixth, it is
unclear how Plaintiff calculated the requested 14,497.00 in attorney’s fees.
Plaintiff’s counsel states in his declaration that “[a]s Plaintiff is entitled
to attorneys fees, the amount of fees has increased $4,497. I have spent 4.66
hours in time in researching and drafting this particular motion and work done
exclusive of the $2,700 in attorneys fees ordered as sanctions, and request the
sum of $450 as sanctions payable by Truman Hedding. My hourly rate is $450 an
hour.” (Rothman Decl., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff’s counsel thus appears to attest to
either $4,497.00 or $450.00 in attorney’s fees (although it is not entirely
clear). 
Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. The
Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default
judgment package
