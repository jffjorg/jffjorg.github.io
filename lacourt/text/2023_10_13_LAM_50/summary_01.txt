And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants, Keith Bae and James Bae. The plaintiff seeks a total of $340,000.00 in damages, but the Court finds that the evidence submitted is insufficient to support the claim. Specifically, the plaintiff's declaration lacks specificity regarding how they were damaged by the defendants in the amount of $270,000.00. Additionally, the Court notes that the proposed judgments include an error in Section 1(e)(1). As a result, the Court denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice and will discuss with the plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment packages.
