Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Rolf M. Treu regarding the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Galloni Defendants (Luigi F. Galloni, M.D. and Galloni Enterprises Medical Corporation) against the Plaintiff, Joseph Vincent Ruiz. The Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on August 1, 2022, alleging a cause of action for medical negligence. The Galloni Defendants demurred and moved to strike portions of the FAC, and the Plaintiff did not file an opposition. The Court notes that the Galloni Defendants' counsel sent a meet and confer letter to the Plaintiff on June 28, 2023, requesting that he dismiss the FAC with prejudice as to Dr. Galloni and Galloni Enterprises, but the Plaintiff failed to respond. The Court rules that the hearing on the Galloni Defendants' demurrer is overruled and their motion to strike is denied, as the parties did not meet and confer in good faith before filing the demurrer and motion to strike, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.41 and 435.5.
