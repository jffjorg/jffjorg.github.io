TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT (2) 
 



 
Plaintiff Sooyeon Jin (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendants James Bae and Keith Bae. Plaintiff seeks default judgment in
the total amount of $340,000.00 against both James Bae and Keith Bae,
comprising $340,000.00 in damages. 
            The
Court notes a few defects with the submitted default judgment packages.  
First, Plaintiff
seeks $340,000.00 in damages against both James Bae and Keith Bae.
Plaintiff’s declarations in support of the requests state, inter alia,
that “I
have been damaged in the amount of the purchase payment of at least
$270,000.00 as well as additional investments made in
an amount in excess of $70,000.00.” (Jin Decls., ¶ 9.) However, it is
unclear from Plaintiff’s declaration how Plaintiff was damaged by James Bae
and/or Keith Bae in the amount of $270,000.00. Further, Plaintiff
does not specify what the “additional investments” in excess of $70,000.00 she
is referring to. The Court finds that further evidence is necessary to prove up
the requested $340,000.00 in damages. 
Second, Section 1(e)(1) of the
proposed judgments (Forms JUD-100) submitted with both requests should not be
checked.
Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s requests for default
judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for
resubmission of the default judgment packages.
