TENTATIVE RULING
  RE: 
 
DEFENDANTS LUIGI
  F. GALLONI, M.D. AND GALLONI ENTERPRISES MEDICAL CORPORATION’S DEMURRER TO
  PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
 
DEFENDANTS LUIGI
  F. GALLONI, M.D. AND GALLONI ENTERPRISES MEDICAL CORPORATION’S MOTION TO
  STRIKE PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFF’S FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
 



 
Background
            Plaintiff
Joseph Vincent Ruiz, in pro per (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on July
15, 2022 against Defendant Menyoli Michael Malafa, M.D. Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on August 1, 2022 against Defendants
Menyoli Michael Malafa, M.D., Luigi F. Galloni, M.D. (“Galloni”), and Galloni
Enterprises Medical Corporation (“Galloni Enterprises”). The FAC alleges one
cause of action for medical negligence.  
Galloni and Galloni
Enterprises (jointly, the “Galloni Defendants”) now demur to the FAC, and move
to strike portions of the FAC. No opposition to the demurrer or motion to
strike was filed. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter,
the Court notes that the Galloni Defendants’ counsel’s declarations filed in
support of the demurrer and motion to strike indicate, inter alia, that
“[o]n June 28, 2023, counsel for Defendants emailed Plaintiff a meet and
confer letter pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41 regarding
Plaintiff’s deficient First Amended Complaint (‘FAC’), including the fact that
his action was barred by the statute of limitations. Said correspondence
requested that Plaintiff dismiss the FAC with prejudice as to Dr. Galloni and
Galloni Enterprises and indicated that, should he refuse to do so, Defendants
will file a demurrer seeking such relief by July 7, 2023.” (Deane Decl., ¶ 6,
Ex. D; Deane Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B.)
The Galloni Defendants’ counsel
further indicates that “[t]o date, Plaintiff has failed to provide any response
to Defendants’ meet and confer letter, dated June 28, 2023.” (Deane Decl., ¶ 8;
Deane Decl., ¶ 6.) 
The Court notes that the
Galloni Defendants’ counsel’s declarations do not demonstrate that the parties met and
conferred by telephone or in person in advance of the Galloni Defendants filing the instant
demurrer and motion to strike.   
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to
this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or
by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis added.) In addition,
“[b]efore filing a motion to strike…the moving party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading
that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an
agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a), emphasis added.) Such
meeting and conferring must be done in good faith with an effort to try to
resolve the issues subject to the demurrer and motion to strike.
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on the Galloni
Defendants’ demurrer is overruled and motion to strike is denied.  
The Galloni Defendants are
ordered to give notice of this order.
