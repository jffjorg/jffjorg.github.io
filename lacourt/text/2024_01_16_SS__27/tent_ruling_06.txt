[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: 
 
DEFENDANT
  ANTHONY CASTELLANOS’ MOTIONS TO COMPEL ANSWERS TO FORM INTERROGATORIES,
  SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, AND DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS 


Dept.

On June 2, 2022, Plaintiffs Nelly Alvarez and Guadalupe
Hernandez filed this action against Defendant Anthony Castellanos (“Defendant”)
and Does 1 through 25 for injuries allegedly arising out of an auto accident on
August 25, 2020.  On August 23, 2022,
Defendant served Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set
One, and Demand for Production of Documents, Set One on Plaintiff Nelly Alvarez
(“Plaintiff”).  Having received no responses, Defendant proceeded to file the motions to
compel Plaintiff to provide responses.  Defendant also requests monetary sanctions.  No oppositions to the motions have been filed.
Compel
Responses
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may
make an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  A party that fails to
serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones
based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).)  Unlike a motion to compel further responses,
a motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit and the
propounding party has no meet and confer obligations.  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404.)
Here, on August 23, 2022, Defendant’s counsel
served Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set
One, and Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff.  (Declarations
of Paul J. Hahn, ¶2;
Ex. “A”.)  To date, Plaintiff has not provided discovery responses,
despite being granted numerous extensions.  (Id. at ¶
7.)  Therefore, Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses
to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Demand
for Production of Documents, Set One, are GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered
to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories,
Set One, and Demand for Production of Documents, Set One, without objection,
within 30 days of this order.
Monetary
Sanctions
Where the court grants a
motion to compel responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with
substantial justification, or the sanction would otherwise be
unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1348,
subdivision (a), “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in
favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.”
Here, Defendant requests
sanctions in the amount of $1,330.00 for each motion based on 6 hours incurred
at Defendant’s counsel’s hourly rate of $250.00, plus $60.00 filing fees and
$20.00 for parking.  Defendant’s requests for sanctions are GRANTED in a
reduced amount because the motions are straightforward, unopposed, and nearly
identical to one another.  Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
counsel of record, jointly and severally, in the total amount of $2430.00, comprised
of 3 hours of work at $250.00 per hour for each motion plus three $60.00 filing
fees, to be paid within 30 days of the date of this Order.
Moving party to give notice.
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the hearing
and argue the matter.  Unless you receive
a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume that
others might appear at the hearing to argue. 
If the Court does not receive emails from the parties indicating
submission on this tentative ruling and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the tentative as the final
order or place the motion off calendar.
Dated
this 16th day of January 2024
