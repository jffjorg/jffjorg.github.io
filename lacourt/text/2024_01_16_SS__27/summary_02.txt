And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling is a summary of the Judge's thinking based on the information presented before January 16, 2024. The case involves a lawsuit filed by Isidro Patino against National Ready Mixed Concrete Company, alleging general negligence. The Defendant has filed a motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions due to the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the Court's order to respond to discovery requests and pay sanctions. The Judge has granted the motion for terminating sanctions, finding that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the Court's order and his failure to oppose the motion demonstrate his intention to abandon the case. The Judge has denied the request for additional monetary sanctions, finding that the terminating sanctions are sufficient under the circumstances. The case is set for a non-jury trial on September 24, 2024, and a Final Status Conference on September 10, 2024.
