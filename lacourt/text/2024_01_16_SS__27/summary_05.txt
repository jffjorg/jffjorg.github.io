And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to consolidate the case with Case No. 22STCV30105. The Court finds that both cases involve common questions of law and fact, as they arise from the same motor vehicle collision and involve the same defendant. The parties have stipulated to consolidate the cases, and the motion is unopposed. The Court also waives a technical deficiency in the notice of motion to consolidate. The motion also requests to continue the trial date, but this is deemed moot since the trial date has already been continued. The Court orders the moving party to give notice, and advises parties who intend to submit on the tentative to send an email to the Court.
