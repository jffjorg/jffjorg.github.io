And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's deposition. The defendant has failed to appear for four deposition notices, despite being given multiple opportunities to do so. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to appear was unjustified and that the plaintiff is entitled to take the deposition. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,748.35. The defendant is ordered to appear at his deposition within 45 days of this ruling or at a later time agreed to in writing. The judge notes that the defendant's counsel claims he was unable to reach the defendant, but the defendant has not submitted any declaration explaining his failure to appear at the depositions.
