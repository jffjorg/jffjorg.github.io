And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Francisco Morales v. General Motors LLC. The case concerns a dispute over a 2021 Chevrolet Corvette that Morales purchased from General Motors, which allegedly exhibited defects and nonconformities with the warranty.

General Motors demurred to the third and fourth claims in Morales' complaint, which alleged breach of implied warranty of merchantability, breach of express warranty, fraudulent concealment, and violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA). The judge overruled the demurrer to the third and fourth claims, finding that Morales has adequately alleged fraud and has stated a claim for punitive damages.

The judge also denied General Motors' motion to strike the demand for punitive damages, finding that Morales has stated a claim for punitive damages based on General Motors' alleged fraudulent concealment of the transmission defects.

The case will be heard on October 15, 2024, and the judge's final ruling will be issued at that time.
