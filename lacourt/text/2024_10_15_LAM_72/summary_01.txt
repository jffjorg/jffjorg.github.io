```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion to quash service of summons filed by the moving defendants, Com2us Holdings, Com2us Corp., Byung Joon Song, and Jae Joon Song. The moving defendants argue that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over them because they do not have sufficient contacts with California.

The court finds that the moving defendants do not have sufficient contacts with California to justify personal jurisdiction. The court disagrees with the plaintiffs' argument that the entities' retweeting of the Whitepaper purposefully directed conduct at California. The court also finds that the moving defendants' individual visits to California, including meetings with Com2us USA's board, are insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.

The court notes that the plaintiffs have not shown that the moving defendants purposefully directed their conduct at California such that the exercise of personal jurisdiction would comport with principles of fair play and substantial justice. The court also finds that additional jurisdictional discovery would not uncover facts that would warrant the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the moving defendants.

Accordingly, the court grants the motion to quash service of summons and dismisses the case against the moving defendants.
