Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a employment discrimination case brought by Pamela Richardson-Elex against Cedars-Sinai Health Ventures and others. The defendants have moved to compel arbitration of the claims, and the judge has granted the motion. The judge finds that the 2019 Arbitration Agreement, which was executed by Richardson-Elex while she was employed by Cedars-Sinai, is valid and enforceable. The agreement provides for arbitration of all claims related to Richardson-Elex's employment and termination, and the judge concludes that the agreement is not unconscionable. The judge also finds that the non-contracting defendants, including Health Ventures and Health Systems, can enforce the agreement and compel arbitration. The judge has stayed the action pending the outcome of arbitration.
