Case    # 23CHCV01166      LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    MARCH 7, 2024    MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT  ROLLS-ROYCE MOTOR CARS OF BEVERLY HILLS’ RESPONSES TO WRITTEN DISCOVERY, SET  ONE  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV01166    Motion  filed: 10/12/23   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Juan Ayala (“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: none NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order compelling Defendant Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of Beverly Hills to provide verified  responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special  Interrogatories, Set One, within ten (10) days following the hearing on this  motion. Additionally, Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,316.75.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The motion  is GRANTED IN PART.   BACKGROUND   Plaintiff  brought this action under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Lemon Law)  over alleged defects in his 2020 Rolls-Royce Cullinan (the “Vehicle”), which  was manufactured by Defendant BMW of North America, LLC (“BMWNA”). Plaintiff  leased the Vehicle in new condition on June 25, 2020, from Defendant  Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of Beverly Hills (“Defendant” or “RRBH”).   On  April 20, 2023, Plaintiff initiated the present action, alleging against  Defendants BMWNA and RRBH (collectively, “Defendants”), as well as Does 1  through 50 for the following causes of action: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly  Act - Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of Song-Veverly Act – Breach of  Implied Warranty; (3) Violation of Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2(b); and (4)  Negligent Repair. Subsequently, Defendants BMWNA and RRBH filed their Answers  to the Complaint on June 9, and June 26, 2023, respectively.   On  October 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Defendant RRBH’s  responses to Plaintiff’s first set of written discovery, including Form  Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories.    No  opposing papers have been received.    ANALYSIS   Code of Civil Procedure section  2030.260 provides that the party whom interrogatories are propounded shall  serve responses within 30 days of service. Furthermore, the parties are  provided with an additional 5 days if served by mail, and 2 days if served by  electronic mail. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1013.)   Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290  provides, “If a party to whom interrogatories  are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  (a) The party to whom the interrogatories  are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings  under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product....  (b) The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order  compelling response to the interrogatories....” (Underlines added.)   Code of Civil Procedure section  2023.010 subdivision (d) provides that a misuse of the discovery process is  “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”    A court has discretion to “impose a  monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery  process or any attorney advising such conduct” under Code of Civil Procedure  section 2023.030 subdivision (a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of  reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit  Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)    A.    Motion  to Compel   The Court first notes that in situations where no responses are  received, the party propounding the discovery is not required to meet and  confer. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Leach v. Sup. Ct., (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902,  905-906.)    Here, Plaintiff’s counsel states that the first set of Form  Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories were served upon Defendant via  email on August 24, 2023 (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 6), establishing the deadline for Defendants’ responses to both as  September 25, 2023, in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.260  and 1013. However, as of the filing date of the instant Motion, Defendant RRBH  has not provided any responses to either the Form Interrogatories, Set One, or  the Special Interrogatories, Set One. (Saeedian Decl., ¶ 9.)   Consequently, Defendant RRBH has waived any rights to exercise the  option to produce writing under Section 2030.230 as well as any objections to the  interrogatories, including those based on privilege or  on the protection for work product. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)    Furthermore, the  instant Motion is unopposed.    “A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to  the granting of the motion.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.54 (c).)                Accordingly,  the Court GRANTS the Motion to compel Defendant’s verified responses to the Form  Interrogatories, Set One, and the Special Interrogatories, Set One.   B.     Sanctions   Here,  Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,316.75,  calculated based on an hourly rate of $500.00. The amount encompasses 4.5 hours  attorney time, including 2.5 hours for preparing the instant Motion and 2 hours  anticipated for replying to any opposition, in addition to $66.75 in motion  filing fees.    The Court finds the hourly rate of $500.00 to be  reasonable. However, due to the absence of any opposition, the Court adjusts  the total attorney time to a reasonable 2.5 hours.   Consequently, the Court GRANTS IN PART the request for monetary  sanctions in the amount of $1,316.75 ($500.00/hr. x 2.5 hrs. + $66.75).   CONCLUSION   Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant Rolls-Royce Motor  Cars of Beverly Hills to provide verified responses, with all objections  waived, to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special  Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED IN PART.    Defendant Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of Beverly Hills is ordered  to provide verified responses, with all objections waived, to Plaintiff’s Form  Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days  of receipt of this order.   Defendant Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of Beverly Hills and its  counsel of record are ordered, jointly and severally, to pay Plaintiff monetary  sanctions in the amount of $ 1,316.75.   Moving party is ordered to provide notice of this order.
