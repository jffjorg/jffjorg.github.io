And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Defendant and Cross-Complainant Hudson Insurance Company's Motion for Discharge and Dismissal of Surety under License Bond. The Defendant seeks to be discharged and dismissed from the action, arguing that payment of the bond constitutes a full discharge of its liabilities. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the Defendant cannot be discharged because the "relief sought" against the Defendant includes not merely the amount of the bond, but also costs under Code of Civil Procedure § 1032, which includes attorney fees under the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA). The Judge has determined that the Defendant's motion is not barred by laches, and that the Plaintiff has not shown prejudice resulting from the delay in bringing the motion. The Judge has also found that the Defendant's motion is not barred by the statute of limitations, and that the Plaintiff has not shown that the Defendant's delay in bringing the motion was unreasonable or inexcusable.
