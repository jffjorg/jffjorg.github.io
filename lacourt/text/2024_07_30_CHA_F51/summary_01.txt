And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the motion filed by defendants Krikor Barsoumian and Wicked Motor Works, LLC to vacate the default judgment entered against them. The defendants argue that they were not properly served with the complaint and summons, but the judge finds that they have not met their burden to rebut the presumption that service was proper. The judge notes that the defendants have not claimed any "mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect" on their own part or on that of their attorney serving as a basis for relief from their default. The motion is denied, and the defendants are reminded to comply with the technical requirements for electronic filing and to ensure that their documents are text searchable.
