TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is denied.
 
Defendants are reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended
General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing
documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set
forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First
Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly bookmarking
declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Defendants are also reminded
that are reminded that all documents “must be text searchable when technologically
feasible without impairment of the document's image.” (CRC 2.256(b)(3).) Failure
to comply with these requirements in the future may result in papers being
rejected, matters being placed off calendar, matters being continued so
documents can be resubmitted in compliance with these requirements, documents
not being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND
 
On 8/24/23, Plaintiff filed the instant action against
Defendants, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Written
Contract; (2) Open Book Account; (3) Conversion; (4) Fraud; and (5) Money Had
and Received. On 11/22/23, Plaintiff filed proofs of service on defendant Wicked Motor Works, LLC by personal service, and defendant
Krikor Barsoumian by substituted service.
 
On 1/25/24, the Court entered default against Defendants. On
1/29/24, the Court entered a default judgment against Defendants in the amount
of $106,539.59. On 2/20/24, Defendants filed the instant motion. On 6/13/24, Plaintiff
filed his opposition. No reply has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The court may, upon any terms
as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 473, subd. (b).)
 
Here, individual defendant Barsoumian declares under penalty of
perjury that he was never personally served with the Summons and Complaint in
the instant action, and only became aware of the proceeding when he was served
with Plaintiff’s request for default judgment. (Decl. of Krikor Barsoumian ¶¶ 7,
8.) 
 
The 11/22/23 proofs of service state that defendant Wicked Motor Works, LLC was served by personal service, and
that Barsoumian was served by substituted service at his home on 11/16/23. “The return of a [registered]
process server … establishes a presumption, affecting the burden of producing
evidence, of the facts stated in the return.” (Evid. Code § 647.) “The filing
of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was
proper.” (Floveyor International, Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 789, 795.) 
 
With respect to service on
corporate defendant Wicked Motor Works, LLC,
Defendants argue that service was improper because it was not effectuated at
the registered business address nor on the authorized agent for service. (Mot.
3:10–4:6.) However, the Court notes that while a corporate defendant may be personally
served via its designated agent for service of process, it may also be served
via its chief executive officer. (Code Civ. Proc. §
416.10, subd. (b).) Here, the proof of service states that Wicked Motor Works,
LLC was served via personal service by registered process server on Krikor
Barsoumian, its Chief Executive Officer, on 9/17/23. (11/22/23 Proof of
Service.) Defendants do not dispute the validity of the facts stated in the
proof of service. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants have not met
their burden to rebut the presumption that service on Wicked Motor Works, LLC
was proper.
 
With
respect to service on individual defendant Barsoumian, Defendants contend that
the substituted service on co-resident Ellen Doe, on 11/16/23, at 12224
Edgecliff Avenue, Sylmar, CA 91342-5499, was also improper because Barsoumian
has never lived at this address. (Mot. 4:7–17.) Defendants proffer Barsoumian’s
sworn declaration attesting thereto. (Barsoumian Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s attorney declares in opposition
that this address was found after performing a reverse phone search on a public
data records system, based on Barsoumian’s known phone number. (Decl. of Lawrence
A. Strid, ¶ 8.)
Counsel further declares that he was at no time advised that the service of
process at this address was effectuated erroneously or mistakenly. (Id. at
¶ 9.)
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court finds that Defendants have not claimed any “mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
or excusable neglect” on their own part or on that of their attorney serving as
a basis of relief from their default. (Code Civ. Proc. § 473, subd. (b).) To
the extent that Defendants wish to quash service of the complaint and summons,
their deadline to do so has passed. (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10, subd. (a).)
Accordingly, the motion is denied.
 
CONCLUSION

 
The
motion is denied.
