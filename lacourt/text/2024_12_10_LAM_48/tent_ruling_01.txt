  CASE NO.: 22STCV38383
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING APPLICATION
  FOR ADMISSION PRO HAC VICE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 10, 2024



 
On
November 15 and 18, 2024, Evan M. Oshan filed ex parte applications to be admitted
pro hac vice to represent Plaintiffs Yael Sima Wintner and Tova Fagan in this action.
On
November 18, 2024, the Court ordered counsel to file a proper application and to
pay the $500.00 filing fee.  The same day,
counsel filed a verified application for admission pro hac vice.
On
November 19, 2024, the Court reiterated its order to pay the $500.00 filing fee.
The
$500.00 application fee was paid on November 20, 2024.  (Gov. Code, § 70617, subd. (e)(1).)
An
attorney in good standing in another jurisdiction who is not a resident of California,
regularly employed in California, or regularly engaged in substantial business,
professional, or other activities in California may apply to appear as counsel pro
hac vice in California.  (California Rules
of Court, rule 9.40(a).)  The attorney must
a verified application together with proof of service by mail of a copy of the application
and notice of hearing on all parties who have appeared in the case and on the State
Bar of California at its San Francisco office. 
(California Rules of Court, rule 9.40(c).)  The applicant must also pay a $50.00 fee to the
State Bar of California.  (California Rules
of Court, rule 9.40(e).)
The
application must state (1) the applicant’s residence and office addresses; (2) the
courts to which the applicant has been admitted to practice and the dates of admission;
(3) that the applicant is a member in good standing in those courts; (4) that the
applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred in any court; (5) the title of
each court and cause in which the applicant has filed an application to appear as
counsel pro hac vice in this state in the preceding two years, the date of each
application, and whether or not it was granted; and (6) the name, address, and telephone
number of the active member of the State Bar of California who is attorney of record
in the local action.  (California Rules of
Court, rule 9.40(d).)
The
application complies with most requirements. 
However, it does not include the address of counsel’s residence as required.  The supplemental declaration states that counsel
“maintain[s] [his] principal office in Washington,” and the application identifies
only a Washington P.O. Box as counsel’s office address.
The
Hearing on Ex Parte Application of Counsel Evan M. Oshan, Esq. to Appear as Counsel
Pro Hac Vice is CONTINUED to December 19, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Counsel
may file an amended, complete application no later than December 16, 2024.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
