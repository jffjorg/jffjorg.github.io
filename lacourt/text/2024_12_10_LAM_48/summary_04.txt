And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Thomas D. Long on a motion for authority to pay compensation. The motion was filed by Receiver Byron Z. Moldo, seeking to pay compensation to Plaintiff Leonard Schrage, law firm ArentFox Schiff, LLP, and accounting firm Kho, Patel & Co. The Trustee of the Joseph Schrage Revocable Trust, James W. Sullivan, and Alexis Schrage filed oppositions and a joinder, respectively. However, on December 9, 2024, the Trustee filed a Notice of Withdrawal of Opposition, indicating that he would withdraw his opposition if the parties had a written agreement with substantially the same terms that they had already agreed to. The Trustee and Leonard Schrage executed a settlement agreement on December 9, 2024. The Court has decided to continue the hearing and order the filing of an amended motion that includes the terms of the settlement. The Receiver must file the amended motion, and all affected parties must have an opportunity to review the final payment terms. The hearing is continued to a date to be determined.
