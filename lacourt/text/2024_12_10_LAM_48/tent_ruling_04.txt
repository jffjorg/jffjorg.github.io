Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 10, 2024



 
On September 9, 2024, Receiver
Byron Z. Moldo filed a motion for authority to pay compensation to (1) Plaintiff
Leonard Schrage, for the benefits he provided in connection with the sale of the
real properties of the estate in Studio City and West Covina; (2) the law firm of
ArentFox Schiff, LLP; and (3) the accounting firm of Kho, Patel & Co.
On
October 8, 2024, James W. Sullivan as Trustee of the Joseph Schrage Revocable Trust
(“Trustee”) filed an opposition.  On October
9, 2024, Alexis Schrage filed a joinder to Trustee’s opposition.
On
December 4, 2024, Trustee filed a Notice of Anticipated Settlement.  Trustee indicated that he would withdraw his opposition
if the parties had a written agreement with substantially the same terms that the
parties already agreed to.
On
December 9, 2024—the day before the hearing—Trustee filed a Notice of Withdrawal
of Opposition, which included a copy of the settlement agreement between Trustee
and Leonard Schrage.
In
light of the recently executed settlement, the Court will continue the hearing and
order the filing of an amended motion so that all affected parties have an opportunity
to review the final payment terms.
The
Hearing on Motion for Order for Authority to Pay Compensation is CONTINUED to __________________
at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
The
Receiver is ordered to file an Amended Motion that includes the terms of the settlement
between Trustee and Leonard Schrage and the settlement’s impact on any other payment
terms.  The Amended Motion and any oppositions
are to be filed according to normal statutory notice.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 10th day of December 2024
