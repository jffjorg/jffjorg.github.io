And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Catalan Don v. W.I. Simonson, Sonic Santa Monica M, Inc. dba W.I. Simonson, Watkins, Bland and Vides. The defendants have moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's claims of conversion, fraud, breach of contract, and unfair competition are insufficient.

The judge has denied the defendants' motion in part, finding that the plaintiff has adequately alleged a cause of action for conversion. The judge has also denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claims of breach of contract and violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act.

However, the judge has granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and conspiracy to commit fraud, finding that the plaintiff has failed to allege cognizable damages. The judge has also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claim of violation of the Unfair Competition Law, finding that the claim is too vague.

The judge has given the plaintiff 10 days to amend its complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the tentative ruling.
