And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling sets aside the default entered against Lisa Harnett, allowing her to defend against Cathy Walker's lawsuit alleging that Harnett failed to return a pearl necklace. The Court finds that service of the complaint did not result in actual notice to Harnett, who was unaware of the action until receiving a "judgment" document in the mail. Despite the default, Harnett promptly retained counsel and filed a general denial, which the Court finds was the result of excusable neglect. The Court grants Harnett's motion to set aside the default, and orders her to file an answer within 10 court days.
