And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions for summary judgment/adjudication filed by both parties and has reached the following conclusions.

Regarding the motion by Kids Artistic Sense, Inc. (Kids) for summary judgment on the grounds that the notice to pay rent or quit is defective, the court agrees with Kids that the notice is defective if Singleton was "unavailable" to accept rent during the period identified in the notice. However, the court disagrees with Kids that Singleton's deposition statement constitutes an admission of unavailability. The court finds that the language used in the notice is ambiguous and does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that Singleton was unavailable.

Regarding the motion by HW Singleton (HW) for summary judgment on the grounds that Kids failed to pay rent due under the lease, the court finds that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether HW failed to include Kids' $15,000 payment in its three-day notice, and whether that failure rendered its estimate of the amount of rent due unreasonable. The court also finds that there is a triable issue of fact as to the affirmative defense of retaliation.

Regarding the affirmative defenses raised by Kids, the court finds that the following defenses fail:

* New Lease: Kids admitted that no new lease was created, so this defense fails.
* Estoppel: Kids failed to provide evidence that HW promised to maintain the HVAC system, so this defense fails.
* Force Majeure/Frustration of Purpose: The court finds that the COVID-19 pandemic does not constitute a force majeure event or give rise to a defense of impossibility.
* Failure to Mitigate: Kids admitted that HW's claims are not barred due to a failure to mitigate, so this defense fails.
* Waiver: Kids admitted that HW did not waive its right to declare a breach of the lease, so this defense fails.
* Unjust Enrichment: Kids admitted that the amounts demanded in the complaint would not result in unjust enrichment to HW, so this defense fails.
* Laches: Kids admitted that the demands contained in the complaint are not barred by the doctrine of laches, so this defense fails.
* Acquiescence, Ratification, Knowledge: The court finds that Kids failed to provide evidence or argument that HW ratified or acquiesced in Kids' non-payment of rent, so this defense fails.
* Acts of Third Parties: The court finds that Kids failed to provide evidence of acts of third parties that caused the dispute, so this defense fails.
* Commercial Reasonableness: The court finds that there is no affirmative defense for "commercial reasonableness" in an unlawful detainer action.
* Frustration of Purpose and Failure to Take Corrective Action: The court finds that the lease agreement placed responsibility for maintaining the HVAC system on Kids, so this defense fails.

The court GRANTS HW's motion for summary adjudication as to all of Kids' affirmative defenses.
