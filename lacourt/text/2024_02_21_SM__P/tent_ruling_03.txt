Montgomery v. Lisa Harnett, Case No. 23SMCV00264
Hearing Date
February 21, 2024
Lisa Harnett’s
Motion to Set Aside Default (UNOPPOSED) 
 
Plaintiff Cathy Walker
Montgomery sued defendant Lisa Harnett January 23, 2023, alleging Harnett
failed to return a pearl necklace Montgomery gave her to be repaired. On May
18, 2023 Montgomery filed a declaration re: due diligence stating her process
server had been unable to complete service at Harnett’s last known address
despite ten attempts. On June 13, 2023 the court granted leave to serve the
complaint via publication. On August 1 and 2 Montgomery filed proofs of
publication, and on September 12, 2023 the clerk entered default. Defendant
states she was unaware of this case until late October, when she received a
document labeled “judgment” in the mail. On November 27, 2023 Harnett filed a
general denial. 
 
Harnett now moves
for an order setting aside the default on the grounds that service did not
result in actual notice. 
 
Under Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc. §473.5, when service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice
in time to defend an action, a party may move to have a default entered against
them set aside. There is a public policy in favor of resolving matters on the
merits, rather than through default. E.g. Tunis v. Barrow (1986) 184
Cal.App.3d 1069, 1079. 
 
Harnett was
unaware of the action until she received the “judgment” document in the mail,
and promptly retained counsel once she became aware. Harnett declaration ¶¶2,
14. This is credible, especially since the complaint was served by publication.
The record indicates Harnett moved swiftly to respond once she became aware of
the complaint, and her premature filing of a general denial while a default had
been entered was inadvertent, the result of excusable neglect. The motion is
unopposed. Harnett is prepared to defend this action. All the evidence, as well
as the public policy in favor of trial on the merits, weighs in favor of
granting relief. GRANTED. Default set aside, answer to be filed within 10 court
days.
