And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Baker et al. v. Maree, Inc., Case No. 18SMCV00115. The case involves a construction defect dispute, and L.A. Overhead Doors, the cross-defendant, has moved to compel further responses to written discovery. The Bakers have not opposed the motion, and the court has reviewed the Tangonan declaration, which indicates that the defendants provided responses to most categories of written discovery within the time limit set at the IDC. The court will not compel further responses to those categories or deem the requests for admission admitted. However, the court will order responses to the form interrogatories, within 15 days without objection, and will order the Bakers to serve verifications for all responses already produced, within 10 days. The court has also imposed monetary sanctions on the Bakers, due to their violation of the IDC order, in the amount of 10 hours of attorney work at $185 per hour, and a $60 filing fee.
