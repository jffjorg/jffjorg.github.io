BACKGROUND
 
This is a
collections action in which Plaintiff, a non-profit school, alleges that
Defendant failed to pay $35,070.00 of tuition for his child’s enrollment during
the 2015-2016 school year. On 3/16/20, Plaintiff filed its complaint, alleging
against Defendant and his wife the following causes of action: (1) Goods Sold
& Delivered; (2) Account Stated; (3) Open Book Account; (4) Breach of
Contract; and (5) Unjust Enrichment.
 
On 8/11/20, the Court granted Plaintiff default
judgment against both defendants. On 2/1/21, the Court granted defendants’
motion to set aside the default judgment. On 2/22/21, defendants filed their
answer.
 
On 5/23/24, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion for summary judgment. On 6/4/24, the Court entered
a judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants “in the principal sum
of $35,070.00, together with interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum in
the sum of $27,907.44, costs of suit in the sum of $1,867.36, plus attorney’s
fees to be determined pursuant to a noticed motion.” (6/4/24 Judgment 1:22–25.)
 
On 7/26/24, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion. No opposition has been filed to date.

ANALYSIS
 
“In any
action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s
fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded
either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is
determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the
party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
Here,
Plaintiff states that “Plaintiffs complaint requested attorney’s fees pursuant
to the” Student Enrollment Agreements breached by Defendants. (Pl.’s Mot.
3:21.) Specifically, the contract entered into between the parties provides
that “Parents agree to pay any and all costs and expenses, including attorney
fees, incurred by School in the collection of any of the amounts due or in the
enforcement of any of the provisions of this agreement.” (Ex. 1 to Decl. of
Michael D. Frischer, ¶ 6.) Therefore, here, Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable
attorney fees as the prevailing party.
 
1.     
Attorney Fees Incurred
 
In
determining a reasonable fee award, the Court begins with the lodestar method
of calculation, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.¿(Karton v. Ari Design & Construction, Inc.
(2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 734, 744; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095–1096.) Here, Plaintiff seeks to recover $22,100.00 in
attorney fees, encompassing 47.0 total hours of its attorneys’ time. (Frischer Decl.
¶ 9.) 
 
The Court
notes that Defendants have failed to file any opposition to the instant motion,
and therefore do not challenge the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s attorney fees
incurred. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to recover $22,100.00
in reasonable attorney fees.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The unopposed motion is granted. Plaintiff is awarded $22,100.00
in attorney fees.
