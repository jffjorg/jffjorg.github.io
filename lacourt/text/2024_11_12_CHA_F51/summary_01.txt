And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion for attorney fees in the amount of $22,100.00. The motion is based on a contract provision that requires the parties to pay each other's attorney fees in the event of a dispute. The plaintiff incurred these fees in connection with its collection action against the defendant, who failed to pay tuition for his child's enrollment at the plaintiff's non-profit school. The judge has determined that the plaintiff is entitled to recover these fees as the prevailing party. The defendant has failed to file any opposition to the motion, so the judge has granted the motion without opposition.
