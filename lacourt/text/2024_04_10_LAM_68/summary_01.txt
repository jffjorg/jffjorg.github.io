The court has set a new hearing date of June 6, 2024, to allow the petitioner, David Kartch, to seek publication of the petition and present additional evidence in support of the actual substantive request regarding the necessity for relief. The court had previously denied a similar motion due to the petitioner's failure to serve the respondent, DAGUT Group Inc. The court requires the petitioner to demonstrate due process findings and substantive compliance before allowing the submission of the order to the California Secretary of State. The petitioner is not required to provide notice to himself or the unserved respondents.
