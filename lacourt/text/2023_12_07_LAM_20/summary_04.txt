And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the request for a discovery referee for all purposes due to Gohar's alleged obstruction of discovery. The court has reviewed the deposition transcript and finds that some of Gohar's objections lack merit. However, the court believes that Gohar's counsel was entitled to assert some objections, such as those based on attorney-client privilege. The court finds that Gohar's declaration of financial hardship is sufficient to justify her request to avoid the costs of a discovery referee.

The court denies Jila's request for a discovery referee for all purposes, but reserves the right to refer individual discovery motions to a referee as needed. The court also orders the deposition to resume within 30 days. The court encourages counsel to review the tentative ruling and submit any necessary changes by the specified deadline.
