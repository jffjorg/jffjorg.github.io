Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the foreclosure sale of Siboni's property. Siboni claims that the promissory notes and deeds of trust (DOTs) were procured by duress and that the notes were designed by Menlo to recoup money that was never intended to be a loan. The judge finds that while the balance of harms moderately favors Siboni, given the low likelihood of prevailing based on the evidence presented, a preliminary injunction is not warranted. The judge suggests that Siboni may have a stronger case if he presents admissible documentary evidence to support his claims. The judge sustains the objections to a letter from Menlo's mother, which is hearsay and lacks foundation.
