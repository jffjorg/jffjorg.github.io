And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to file a second amended complaint (SAC) that adds new plaintiffs and makes changes to the caption. The plaintiff, Tony Protopappas, is seeking to substitute himself in for his brother and add two new plaintiffs, Abraham Ghorbanian DDS MS and Ghorbanian, Saifee DDS Inc. The new plaintiffs are alleged to be creditors of the defendant, M.S. Namazikhah D.M.D., in a separate lawsuit. The judge found that the delay in seeking leave to amend the complaint would prejudice the defendant and cause additional costs of litigation. The judge also noted that the proposed plaintiffs have known about their claims since October 2023, but have only now chosen to bring them up in this lawsuit, which is set to go to trial in January 2024. The judge ruled that the motion was denied due to the long, unexplained delay.
