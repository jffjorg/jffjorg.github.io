On March 6, 2024, Garcia and Castro  filed an opposition.  Trial  is currently scheduled for July 17, 2024.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Yniquez  asks the Court to set aside the dismissal of case number 22STCV14742.  Garcia  and Castro ask the Court to deny the motion.  LEGAL STANDARD            Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b),  provides in part:  “The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve  a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order,  or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall  be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed  therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made  within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,  dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. . . . Notwithstanding any other  requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an application for  relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper  form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or  her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting  default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result  in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal  entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or  dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence,  surprise, or neglect. The court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an  attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable  compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties. However, this  section shall not lengthen the time within which an action shall be brought to  trial pursuant to Section 583.310.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,  subd. (b).)  DISCUSSION  Yniquez  argues that, “[b]ased upon the surprise, mistake, and/or inadvertence of  Plaintiff’s Counsel, this Action was inadvertently and mistakenly dismissed.”  (Motion p. 4.) Specifically, Yniquez asserts that his counsel “believed that this case  had already been related to and consolidated with [case number 22STCV11379], as  the parties had been in communication about the consolidation and Counsel  believed that it had already been handled by Counsel for Ernest Garcia, et al.,  as they had taken the lead in relating and consolidating the matters. This is  Plaintiff’s Counsel's fault and Plaintiff's Counsel admits to this fault. After  receiving the Court’s order dismissing the matter, Plaintiff's Counsel only  then discovered his inadvertence in the dismissal of the action in order about  November 6, 2023.”  (Motion p. 4.)  The  motion includes a supporting affidavit of fault by Yniquez’s attorney.  In  opposition, Garcia and Castro argue that (1) Yniquez did not file the motion  within a reasonable time after the dismissal and (2) the error by Yniquez’s counsel was not excusable.  “If  the attorney is willing to take the blame – and pay the costs [citation] – the court  must set aside the default judgment [or dismissal] ‘unless the court  finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s  mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect . . . .’ ”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice  Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:294, p. 5-80, quoting  Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b) (Cal. Practice Guide).)  “Where  an ‘attorney affidavit of fault’ is filed, there is no requirement that the  attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, etc. be excusable.  Relief must be granted even where the  default [or dismissal] resulted from inexcusable neglect by [the party’s]  attorney.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra,  ¶ 5:295, p. 5-81.)  The  Court finds that Yniquez filed the motion within a reasonable time after the  dismissal and the dismissal was caused by the mistake, inadvertence, surprise,  or neglect of Yniquez’s attorney.  Therefore,  the Court grants the motion.  The  Court directs Yniquez’s counsel to “pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and  costs to opposing counsel or parties.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  If the  parties cannot agree on who is entitled to receive the compensatory legal fees and costs or the amount of the compensatory fees and costs, they may submit supplemental declarations as set forth below.  CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS the motion to vacate the November 1, 2023 dismissal of case number  22STCV14742 filed by Plaintiff Raymond Yniquez.  The  Court ORDERS counsel for Plaintiff Raymond Yniquez to pay reasonable  compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision  (b).  If the parties cannot agree on who is entitled to receive the compensatory legal fees and costs and/or the amounts of the compensatory legal fees and costs, they may submit supplemental declarations addressing these issues.  The parties and counsel seeking payment of compensatory legal fees and costs may file supplemental declarations by May 2, 2024.  Parties and counsel may file responsive supplemental declarations by May 8, 2024.  The  Court sets an order to show cause re: payment of reasonable compensatory legal  fees and costs on May 14, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring  Street Courthouse.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
