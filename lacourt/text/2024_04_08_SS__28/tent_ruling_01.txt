  Case Number:  21STCV13117    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 6, 2021, Plaintiffs Jazeer Keyes, Tanya Davis, Jae'yon Wagner, and
Tarnila Wagner filed this action against Defendants Lenita Sinna Dee Lewis
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
March 11, 2024, Petitioner Tamila Wagner (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for
approval of the compromise of minor Jae’yon Wagner’s claims, to be heard on
April 8, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Tamila Wagner asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of
Plaintiff Jae’yon Wagner. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
In
Section 2, the petition defines the “Claimant” as Jae’yon Wagner. In Section
10, the petition states that Defendant has offered to pay the “Claimant” (Jae’yon Wagner) $15,000.00 to settle his claims.
Section 11 of the petition, titled “Settlement payments to others,” states that
Defendant has also offered $15,000.00 to “others.” However, instead of listing
the “Other plaintiffs or claimants” who will receive this settlement amount (in
Section 11b(5)), Petitioner lists Claimant Jae’yon Wagner. If the Defendant is
paying an additional $15,000.00 to persons other than Jae’yon Wagner, the
petition should list those persons in Section 11. If the Defendant is not
paying $15,000.00 to persons other than Jae’yon Wagner, the Petitioner should
revise the petition to make this clear. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for
approval of the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Jae’yon Wagner filed
by Petitioner Tamila Wagner on March 11, 2024. 
          Petitioner is ordered to give notice of the ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of the ruling with the Court within
five days.
