 Case Number:  21STCV23933    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as
follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
June 28, 2021, Plaintiff John Tyson Smith filed this action against Defendants Jorge Hernandez (“Hernandez”), All Valley Battery
Service, Inc. dba Ammari Auto Center (“Ammari”), and Does 1-50 for negligence. 
On
August 3, 2022, Hernandez and Ammari (collectively, “Defendants”) filed an
answer. 
On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions to deem
admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set two, numbers 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, and 22 and for issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions.  The motions were set for hearing on March 14,
2024.  The Court continued the hearings
to April 8, 2024.  On March 1, 2024,
Defendants filed an opposition.  On March
7, 2024, Plaintiff filed replies. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for October 1, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission against
Hernandez and Ammari and to order issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions. 
Defendants
ask the Court to deny the motions as moot. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
          Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.290 provides: 
“(a) On receipt of a response to requests for
admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a
further response if that party deems that either or both of the following
apply: 
“(1) An answer to a particular request is evasive or
incomplete. 
“(2) An objection to a particular request is without
merit or too general. 
“(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or any specific later date to which the requesting party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the requesting party waives any right
to compel further response to the requests for admission. 
“(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. 
“(e) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
further response to requests for admission, the court may order that the
matters involved in the requests be deemed admitted. In lieu of, or in addition
to, this order, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010).”  
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.290.)  
DISCUSSION  
On
December 18, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel Hernandez’s and
Ammari’s further responses to requests for admission, set two, numbers 17-22.  The Court ordered Hernandez and Ammari to
provide further verified code-compliant responses by January
17, 2024. 
Hernandez
and Ammari did not provide further responses to the requests for admission by
January 17, 2024 as the Court ordered on December 18, 2023. Therefore, under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290, the Court “may order that the matters
involved in the requests be deemed admitted.  In lieu of, or in addition to,
this order, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (e).) 
Defendants
argue that the Court should deny the motions because Defendants served further
responses to the requests for admission on February 14, 2024, and served
verifications on February 22, 2024. 
According to Defendants, Plaintiff’s motions therefore are moot. 
The
motions are not moot.  Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), allows a party to avoid the
imposition of an order deeming admitted the truth of matters specified in requests
for admission (a “deemed admitted” order) by serving responses “before the hearing
on the motion” to deem the matters admitted. 
The governing statute here, however, is Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.290, which applies when a party fails to comply with an order to provide
further responses to requests for admission. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290.) 
Unlike Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.290 does not include a provision exempting a party from a “deemed
admitted” order if the party serves responses to requests for admission
before the hearing on the motion. 
Defendants also challenge the correctness of the December 18, 2023 order.  The Court will not consider this argument because Defendants did not
file a timely motion for reconsideration of the December 18, 2023 order. 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.290 authorizes the Court to impose monetary
sanctions instead of (or in addition to) a “deemed admitted” order.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (e).)  The parties do not address these alternatives
in their papers.  Plaintiff requests both a “deemed admitted” order and monetary sanctions of $3,723.90 against each Defendant. 
Despite
Defendants’ failure to comply with the December 18, 2023 order by the January
17, 2024 deadline, the Court exercises its discretion to impose only monetary
sanctions on Defendants under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290,
subdivision (e).  Defendants ultimately served belated responses to the requests
for admission after Plaintiff filed these motions. 
Plaintiff’s
request for $3,723.90 in sanctions on each motion is based on eight hours of
attorney time at a rate of $450.00 per hour, a hearing reservation fee of
$61.65, and a filing fee of $62.25. 
Counsel spent three hours drafting the moving papers and anticipated spending
an additional five hours reviewing the opposition, preparing a reply, and
attending the hearing. 
The
Court grants $561.65 in sanctions for each motion based on two hours of
attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour and one $61.65 fee. 
CONCLUSION
          The Court GRANTS in part the motion
of Plaintiff John Tyson
Smith filed on February 14, 2024 and orders Defendant Jorge Hernandez and his
counsel to pay Plaintiff John Tyson Smith $561.65 in sanctions within 30 days
of the hearing on this motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290,
subdivision (e).  In all other respects,
the Court DENIES the motion.
