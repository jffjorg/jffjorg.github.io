The court finds that Defendant did not comply with the meet and confer requirement before bringing the motions. Specifically, Defendant's counsel did not make a serious effort to negotiate and resolve the issues presented by the motions. As a result, the court denies Defendant's motions to compel further and requests for sanctions.
