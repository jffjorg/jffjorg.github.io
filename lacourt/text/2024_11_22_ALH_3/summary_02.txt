And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge William A. Crowfoot regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Christopher Urner on behalf of plaintiff Yulissa Andrea Jimenez. The motion is procedurally deficient because it lacks a completed proposed order, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The hearing is continued to a later date, and Urner must file a completed proposed order no later than 5 court days before the new hearing date. The judge also notes that if parties intend to submit on the tentative, they must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so, and that if they do not appear at the hearing, the opposing party may still argue the matter.
