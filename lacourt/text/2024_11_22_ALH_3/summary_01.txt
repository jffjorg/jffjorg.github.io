And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Plaintiff BE 830 Lake, LLC is seeking an award of $109,459 in attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing its judgment against Defendant East Coast Foods, Inc. The fees are for work performed from August 29, 2023, to October 23, 2024, and include 134.8 hours of work. The Court finds that the fees are reasonable and awards the plaintiff $102,856.50, subject to a $6,602.50 reduction for work performed in preparing the fee motion.

The Court rejects Defendant's argument that its bankruptcy should be considered in determining the fee award. The Court also finds that the work performed by Plaintiff's counsel was not excessive or unreasonable, and that the rates charged by counsel are reasonable.

The Court denies Defendant's request to omit fees incurred in connection with Defendant's appeal of the prior attorneys' fee award, finding that Plaintiff's counsel performed reasonable work in response to the appeal.

The Court reduces the request for fees for preparing the fee motion by $6,602.50, finding that the work performed was excessive. The Court awards Plaintiff $102,856.50 in total, consisting of $109,459 in attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing the judgment, minus $6,602.50 for work performed in preparing the fee motion.
