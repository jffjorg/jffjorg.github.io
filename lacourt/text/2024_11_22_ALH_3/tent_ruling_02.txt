[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
November
   22, 2024



 
Christopher
 Urner seeks to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff
 Yulissa Andrea Jimenez on the grounds that there has been a breakdown of the
 working relationship. This motion is procedurally deficient because it
is not accompanied by a completed proposed order made on mandatory form
MC-053.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1362.) The proposed order filed on August 13, 2024, was rejected because it
was blank. Accordingly, the hearing is CONTINUED to ___________ at 8:30 a.m. in
Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse. A completed proposed order must be
filed no later than 5 court days before the hearing date. 
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 22nd
day of November 2024
