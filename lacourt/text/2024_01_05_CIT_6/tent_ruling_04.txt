   [1] The scope  and interpretation of the Arbitration Agreement appear to have been delegated  to the arbitrator. (Beatty Decl., Ex. A [“Any claim or dispute… (including the  interpretation and scope of this Arbitration Provision, and the arbitrability  of the claim or dispute)…”]); B.D. v. Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (2022)  76 Cal.App.5th 931, 957 [delegation of arbitrability to arbitrator must be  stated “clearly and unmistakably”.]) Thus, whether the Arbitration Agreement  governs Plaintiff’s claims against Longo will be left to the arbitrator to  determine.
