  Order RE:
 
defendants’ demurrer to first amended
  complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:
            Defendants Ryder Integrated
Logistics, Inc., Ryder Systems, Inc., and Jennifer Levenhagen 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Cindy Ramos
Demurrer to First Amended Complaint
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with the
demurrer. 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Cindy Ramos (“Plaintiff”) filed the operative First Amended
Complaint in this action on April 4, 2023 against defendants Ryder Integrated
Logistics, Inc., Ryder Systems, Inc., and Jennifer Levenhagen (“Defendants”).  The First Amended Complaint alleges four
causes of action for (1) whistleblower retaliation (Lab. Code, §§ 1102.5,
1102.6), (2) whistleblower retaliation (Lab. Code, §§ 6310, 6311), (3)
wrongful termination in violation of public policy, and (4) intentional
infliction of emotional distress. 
Defendants now move the court for an order sustaining their demurrer
to the fourth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
DISCUSSION
The court sustains Defendants’ demurrer to the fourth cause of action
for intentional infliction of emotional distress because it does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).)  
First, the court finds that Plaintiff has not alleged facts
establishing that Defendants’ conduct, in denying Plaintiff’s request to work
from home due to her concerns with the lack of safety precautions against
COVID-19 and acting negatively toward Plaintiff (including by falsely accusing
her of not cooperating with another supervisor), was not “so extreme as to
exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community” and
therefore finds that Plaintiff has not alleged the element of extreme and
outrageous conduct by Defendants.  (FAC
¶¶ 31, 35; Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050-1051
[internal quotations omitted] [elements of cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress].)  
Second, the court finds that this cause of action is preempted by the
workers’ compensation scheme because it is based on emotional injuries
sustained at the workplace and in the course of Plaintiff’s employment with
Defendants.  (FAC ¶¶ 31, 35, 75-76; Yau
v. Santa Margarita Ford, Inc. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 144, 161 [“Physical
and emotional injuries sustained in the course of employment are preempted by
the workers’ compensation scheme and generally will not support an independent
cause of action[;]” this rule applies to claims for emotional injuries caused
by workplace discipline and termination]; Brooks v. Corecivic of Tennessee
LLC (S.D. Cal. 2020) 2020 WL 5294614 at pp. *2 [finding that California law
applies], 7 [finding that intentional infliction of emotional distress claim
was barred by workers’ compensation exclusivity rule because it was based on
the employer-defendant’s failure to maintain a safe and healthy workplace,
which “is inextricably part of the compensation bargain”].)
The
burden is on the plaintiff “to articulate how it could amend its pleading to
render it sufficient.”¿ (Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v.
Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290.)¿ To satisfy that burden, a
plaintiff “must show in what manner he can amend his complaint and how that
amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading.”¿ (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) 
Plaintiff requests leave to amend, asserting that she “can add
additional facts that will further bolster her claims.”  (Opp., p. 8:17-18.)  However, Plaintiff has not sufficiently set
forth the facts that she plans to allege that would (1) allege the element of
extreme and outrageous conduct, and (2) remove this cause of action from the
scope of the workers’ compensation exclusivity rule.  Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has not
supported her request for leave to amend and therefore sustains the demurrer
without leave to amend.
ORDER
            The court sustains defendants Ryder
Integrated Logistics, Inc., Ryder Systems, Inc., and Jennifer Levenhagen’s
demurrer to plaintiff Cindy Ramos’s fourth cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress without leave to amend. 
            The court orders defendants Ryder
Integrated Logistics, Inc., Ryder Systems, Inc., and Jennifer Levenhagen to
file an answer to plaintiff Cindy Ramos’s First Amended Complaint no later than
10 days from the date of this order. 
            The court orders defendants Ryder
Integrated Logistics, Inc., Ryder Systems, Inc., and Jennifer Levenhagen to
give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
