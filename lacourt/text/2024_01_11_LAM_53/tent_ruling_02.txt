Alonso  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint

Plaintiff Kelly Daniela Perez
Alonso (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order granting her leave to file a
First Amended Complaint in order to add (1) a cause of action for illegal
collection of rent in violation of Los Angeles Rent Ordinance section 151.05
and (2) related allegations.  (Murphy
Decl., ¶ 9.)
The court finds that (1) it is
in furtherance of justice to allow Plaintiff to amend her complaint to add a
cause of action illegal collection of rent, and (2) defendants Billy C.
Campbell, individually and as trustee of the Billy C. Campbell Revocable Trust created
September 22, 2015, and Greg Campbell will not be misled or unduly prejudiced
by the amendment.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 473, subd. (a); Mac v. Minassian (2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 510, 519
[“‘ “California courts ‘have a policy of great liberality in allowing
amendments at any stage of the proceeding so as to dispose of cases upon their
substantial merits where the authorization does not prejudice the substantial
rights of others’ ” ’”].)  The court
therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion.

Daniela Perez Alonso’s motion for leave to file first amended complaint.
