And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's unopposed motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents without prejudice. The ruling is based on the parties' failure to meet and confer in good faith regarding the outstanding discovery issues. The court notes that the parties are ordered to engage in good faith meet and confer concerning the outstanding discovery in light of the Standing Order Re Discovery (Song-Beverly Litigation) and the Notice to All Counsel Re: Lemon Law Cases for Department D. The court also notes that it will expect verified responses, as required by the Code and by the Order, and will overrule unnecessary objections. The ruling also addresses the parties' failure to enter into a protective order and notes that the court will not consider the untimely opposition filed by the defendant.
