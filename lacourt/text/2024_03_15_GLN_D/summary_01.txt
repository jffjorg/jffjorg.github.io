And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, specifically for the last known address of Ryan Flores, a former employee of the defendant hospital. The court finds that the need for the information outweighs any privacy interest asserted by the defendant, and that the information will be disclosed only subject to a protective order that will prohibit the use of the contact information for the witness outside the context of this litigation and will prohibit counsel for the plaintiff from disclosing the information to the plaintiff or his guardian ad litem.

The court orders that the defendant hospital must serve further verified responses to the special interrogatories, including the contact information of Ryan Flores, without objection, subject to the protective order. The parties are ordered to meet and confer with respect to entering a stipulated protective order, using the Stipulated Confidentiality Order Form provided by the Los Angeles Superior Court as a model.

The court denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, finding that the defendant was substantially justified in asserting the privacy objection on behalf of its former employee.
