And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yuh et al. v. Building Worx, Inc. et al. The defendants, Building Worx, Inc. and Robert Artura, have filed a demurrer to the fourth cause of action for fraud and deceit, arguing that the allegations are not specific enough. The court has ruled that the demurrer is overruled, finding that the allegations of concealment of information are sufficient to support a claim for fraud.

The defendants have also filed a motion to strike references to claims for punitive damages, arguing that the allegations of fraud do not support such claims. The court has denied this motion, finding that a properly pleaded fraud claim will itself support recovery of punitive damages.

The court has also addressed the issue of specificity in pleading fraud and deceit, citing several cases to support its ruling. The court has held that while a plaintiff must plead the elements of fraud with specificity, the requirement of specificity is relaxed in cases of concealment, where the duty to disclose arises from the making of representations that were misleading or false.

The court's tentative ruling will be finalized unless one of the parties files a timely objection.
