And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by plaintiff Steven Hall against defendant Performance Contracting, Inc. The case involves a workplace accident at the Los Angeles International Airport, where Hall was injured when heavy metal plates fell and struck him. The accident occurred on January 26, 2024, and Hall filed a complaint against Performance Contracting, Inc. on January 24, 2024.

On July 17, 2024, the parties stipulated to dismissing the defendant without prejudice, but Hall's attorneys were not aware that the dismissal had occurred until August 8, 2024. The court finds that the dismissal was due to the attorneys' mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, and grants Hall's motion to vacate and set aside the dismissal.

The court sets aside the dismissal of the entire action without prejudice and orders Hall to file the Doe amendments within five days. The defendant is dismissed without prejudice. The court's ruling intends to allow Hall to add unknown parties to the case and have the case tried on its merits.
