```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the motion to compel further responses to plaintiff's request for production of documents. The motion is moot because the parties have informally resolved the remaining issues. The court had previously found that the requests were overbroad and that defendant was interpreting them too broadly. However, the parties have since met and conferred and have agreed to resolve the issues without the need for the court's intervention. Therefore, the motion is denied as moot.
