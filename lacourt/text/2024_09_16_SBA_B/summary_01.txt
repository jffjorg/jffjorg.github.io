Summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has denied both the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint to add a claim for punitive damages and the plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery. The judge found that the plaintiff's motion was procedurally and substantively defective and that the plaintiff had not shown good cause to reopen discovery. The judge also denied the defendant's request for sanctions.

The case involves a slip and fall accident that occurred on December 1, 2020, when the plaintiff, Diana Alexander, slipped and fell on a lifted portion of a black carpet/mat at a store owned by the defendant, Wondergreen, Inc. dba Green Farm Market Gardena. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant was aware of the hazardous condition but did not take steps to correct it, and that the accident was caused by the defendant's negligence. The plaintiff is seeking damages, including punitive damages, for her injuries.

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the court's discretion to allow or deny amendments to pleadings and the court's discretion to grant or deny motions to reopen discovery. The judge found that the plaintiff's motion was defective because it failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(b) and that the plaintiff had not shown good cause to reopen discovery.
