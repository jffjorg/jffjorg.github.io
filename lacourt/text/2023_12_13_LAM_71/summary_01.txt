The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by defendant David Aschkenasy. The demurrer was filed against the second amended complaint of plaintiffs Metro Entertainment, Inc. and Gold Star Hospitality, LLC. The judge sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend as to the 1st and 2nd causes of action for breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The judge sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the 6th cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations. The judge overruled the demurrer as to the 3rd cause of action for fraud.

The judge also denied the motion to strike as moot, as the demurrer has been ruled on and the motion is no longer necessary.
