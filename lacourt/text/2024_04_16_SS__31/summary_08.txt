Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Michael Azizi's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages from the complaint. The plaintiff, Margarita Zuniga, had alleged that Azizi's property was responsible for a dog bite incident that caused her injuries. However, the judge found that the allegations against Azizi did not rise to the level of malice, fraud, or oppression, as defined by California law. The judge also found that the complaint did not contain sufficient factual allegations to support a claim for punitive damages. As a result, the judge granted the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages without leave to amend.
