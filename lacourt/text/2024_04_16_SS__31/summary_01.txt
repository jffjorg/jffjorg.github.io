And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition to confirm a minor's compromise and a motion to seal portions of the petition. The plaintiff, Veronica Joseph, seeks to seal references to the settlement amount in the petition due to a confidential settlement agreement with the defendant, Hathaway Recovery Center. However, the court finds that the proposed redactions are overbroad and not narrowly tailored. The court orders the plaintiff to submit a new petition that is more narrowly tailored and to lodge an electronic copy of the unredacted petition and exhibits. The hearing is continued to allow the court to review the special needs trust instrument.
