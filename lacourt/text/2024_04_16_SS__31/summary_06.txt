And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery to track with the new trial date. The plaintiff, Luisa Sapiens, filed the action on May 9, 2022, alleging injuries arising from a metal gate coming off the rail, causing her to fall backwards on concrete. The defendants, including Hooshang Haghighat, ET AL., contend that they were not served with the instant motion and argue that the motion is defective due to the lack of a signed declaration under penalty of perjury. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to justify the necessity for reopening discovery and did not provide sufficient information regarding diligence in seeking discovery. The court balances the factors set forth in Code of Civil Procedure Section 2024.050 and concludes that reopening discovery is not warranted.
