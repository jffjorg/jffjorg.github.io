Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Southern California Edison Company's (SCE) unopposed motion to continue the trial date in the case of Reyes Valadez vs. City of Norwalk, ET AL. SCE had not previously participated in the case and had not responded to the complaint. As a result, SCE needed time to conduct discovery and participate in the case. The Court ruled that there was good cause to continue the trial date and granted the motion. The new trial date is to be determined.
