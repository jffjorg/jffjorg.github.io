And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a discovery motion filed by the plaintiff, Ashtel Studios, Inc., against defendants Matthew John Sandvig, Oak Sourcing & Logistics, LLC, and Oak Insurance Group, LLC. The motion sought to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The judge has partially sustained the plaintiff's objections to the discovery referee's recommendations.

The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their contract, fraudulently induced the plaintiff, and failed to account for their obligations. The defendants have produced some documents, but the plaintiff claims that they have not fully complied with the discovery requests.

The judge has ordered the defendants to produce further verified responses to the plaintiff's requests for production of documents Nos. 99, 103-106, as modified by the court. The judge has also overruled the plaintiff's request for sanctions.

The discovery referee had recommended that the defendants produce loan documents, but only for amounts over $10,000. The plaintiff objected to this recommendation, arguing that any loans between the defendants and/or their entities are equally relevant, regardless of the threshold. The judge has modified the referee's recommendation, ordering the defendants to produce loan documents for amounts $5,000 or higher.

The judge has also addressed the plaintiff's contention that the defendants' objections were unmeritorious and that they refused to serve further responses or search for responsive documents. The judge has overruled the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the defendants had a good faith discovery dispute.
