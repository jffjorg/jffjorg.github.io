Plaintiff alleges that on or about February 1, 2022, Defendant negligently designed, constructed, maintained, repaired, and/or installed a water heater in Unit 111 which caused a water leak to spread to Plaintiff’s properties to the real and personal properties of the Whitley Bay Condo Association, the owners/lessees of certain real and commercial properties located at 1187 E. 3rd St, Units 110, 111, and 112 in Long Beach, CA 90802. (Compl., ¶¶ 4, 5.) Plaintiff alleges that it paid $104,770.37 to the owners of Whitley Bay Condo Association as a result of damages caused by Defendant OC Professional Team. (Compl., ¶ 4.)The final status conference is scheduled for August 16, 2024 and jury trial is scheduled for August 26, 2024. On June 11, 2024, Defense counsel filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel.Legal StandardAn attorney in an action may be changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (2)). California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires:1. Notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-051));2. A declaration stating in general terms, and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney client relationship, why a motion under CCP §284(2), is brought instead of filing a consent under CCP §284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-052));3. Service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and4. The proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Civil form (MC-053)).The motion should be denied if withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Rules Prof. Conduct, Rule 3-700(A)(2); Weil & Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial, 9:385.2 (2008); 1 Witkin Cal. Pro., Attorneys §72 (2008).) The motion should be denied if it will cause undue delay in the proceedings or cause injustice. (Mandell v. Superior Court, (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.) The determination whether to grant or deny an attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case. (Lempert v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.)AnalysisCounsel indicates that Defendant OC Professional Team has not paid attorney fees for the past three months and expressed an inability to pay those past or future fees. (Fischer Decl., ¶ 2.) Counsel has informed Defendant OC Professional Teams’ representative on multiple occasions that termination of representation would result should payment not be received. (Ibid.) Further, Defense counsel indicates Defendant OC Professional Team’s representative agent agreed to the firm’s withdrawal, but a MC-050 substitution cannot be filed as Defendant is a corporation. (Ibid., Exh. A.) To add, Defendant OC Professional Team informed the law firm that it is seeking new counsel but has not engaged such counsel yet. (Ibid.)Counsel has complied with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a), (c), (d) and (e).RulingAlthough the trial date is approaching, there is no showing that granting the motion to be relieved as counsel would result in prejudice as Defendant OC Professional Team indicated it is seeking new counsel and purportedly agreed to counsel’s withdrawal. The motion is GRANTED. Moving party to give notice
