  Case Number:  21STCV42736    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundPlaintiffs, Todd Bertrang (“Bertrang”) and Ophie Beltran (“Beltran”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) sued Defendants, Lido Sailing Club, Inc. (“Lido”), Ivory Holdings, LLC (“Ivory”), and Scott Vollero (“Vollero”) based on injuries Plaintiffs allege they sustained from Bertrang’s exposure to hazardous chemicals.Plaintiffs filed their original complaint on November 18, 2021, and filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on May 4, 2022. Notably, Plaintiffs did not serve any party prior to filing their FAC, and no party responded to the original complaint. On September 8, 2022, the Court sustained Lido Sailing Club, LLC’s demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend. (September 8, 2022 Minute Order.)On September 30, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”). On October 5, 2022, Lido filed a demurrer to the SAC. Shortly thereafter, the personal injury hub court found the case complicated and transferred it to Long Beach for all further proceedings. On January 12, 2023, Lido re-filed its demurrer to the SAC in Department S27. On June 27, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on the demurrer, finding the parties had not adequately met and conferred prior to filing their papers. On July 27, 2023, the Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. On September 20, 2023, rather than amending the SAC, Plaintiffs dismissed Lido from the case.On December 21, 2023, Defendants Ivory Holdings and Vollero filed a demurrer with the motion to strike portions of the SAC. On January 23, 2024, the Court sustained the demurrer with leave to 20 days amend as to the NIED cause of action and alter ego liability cause of action and overruled the strict liability for ultrahazardous activity cause of action, the violation of Health and Safety Code, § 25359.7, cause of action and the IIED cause of action; the Court also granted the motion to strike without leave to amend as to punitive damages and related allegations. (January 23, 2024 Minute Order.)On April 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) – more than two months after the Court’s January 23 order.Meet and ConferDefendant Vollero’s counsel states that he sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiffs’ counsel on May 17, 2024 detailing issues with the TAC and his availability for a telephonic meet and confer at least 5 days prior to filing the instant motions. (Rasmussen Decl.1, ¶ 5, Exh. “B”.) Defendant Vollero’s counsel states that Plaintiffs’ counsel did not respond to the meet and confer attempt. (Id., at ¶ 6.) In opposition, Plaintiffs’ counsel argues Defendant Vollero’s counsel failed to meet and confer because the issues were not discussed in person or by telephone as required under Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5. Notwithstanding the parties’ conflicting ideas of “meet and confer,” it is very likely an informal attempt to resolve the matter would have been unsuccessful.Analysis1. Delay in Filing of Third Amended ComplaintCode Civ. Proc., § 472b, states that: “[w] hen a demurrer to any pleading is sustained or overruled, and time to amend or answer is given, the time so given runs from the service of notice of the decision or order, unless the notice is waived in open court, and the waiver entered in the minutes.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 7:145; Cano v. Glover (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 326, 329-330.) After expiration of the time in which a pleading can be amended as a matter of course, the pleading can only be amended by obtaining the permission of the court. (Leader v. Health Indus. of Am., Inc. (2001) 89 Cal. App. 4th 603, 613.) While a court has “discretion to require a noticed motion before permitting” a plaintiff to file an amended complaint late, a court also has the discretion to accept a filing without a noticed motion. (Harlan v. Dep't of Transportation (2005) 132 Cal. App. 4th 868, 873.) The Court exercises its discretion and accepts Plaintiff’s untimely filed Third Amended Complaint without a noticed motion.2. Second Amended Complaint Holding (Alter Ego)On January 23, 2024, Judge Mark Kim sustained Defendant Vollero’s Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint with leave to amend. Judge Kim ruled: “All claims against Volero are plead on an alter ego theory. Plaintiffs’ alter ego allegations are found at ¶6 of the SAC, and merely allege that each defendant was acting as the alter ego of each other defendant.” Relying on Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Playa del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App. 221, 236, Judge Kim held: “Plaintiffs herein failed to allege any of the ultimate facts showing alter ego liability. They failed to allege unity of interest, domination and control, inadequate capitalization, etc. Volero’s demurrer is therefore sustained with leave to amend. Plaintiffs must allege ultimate facts showing imposition of liability against Volero would be proper.” (See January 23, 2024 Minute Order, Legal Standard on Demurrer, Alter Ego Liability, 3(h)).3. Demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint (Alter Ego)A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading. It is error for the trial court to sustain a demurrer if the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory, and it is an abuse of discretion for the court to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff has shown there is a reasonable possibility a defect can be cured by amendment. California Logistics, Inc. v. State of California (2008) 161 Cal. App. 4th 242, 247. The burden is on the complainant to show in what manner and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)Plaintiffs’ allegations of alter ego in the TAC are found at ¶ 3 and 6. These allegations are identical to the alter ego allegations found at ¶ 3 and ¶6 of the SAC. No additional facts or allegations have been added by Plaintiffs. As discussed, Judge Kim found those allegations deficient as Plaintiff “failed to allege any of the ultimate facts showing alter ego liability” and “failed to allege unity of interest, domination and control, inadequate capitalization.” (January 23, 2024 Minute Order). In sum, Plaintiffs completely failed to amend or modify their operative pleading in any manner or in compliance with Judge Kim’s ruling.In Plaintiffs’ opposition, Plaintiffs request leave to amend by suggesting three new facts, previously unknown, support the theory of alter ego between Vollero and Ivory Holdings. These facts are: (1) and (2) on August 16, 2016, two separate Deeds of Trust were recorded against the subject premises with Vollero as the Beneficiary and (3) Vollero, as an individual, performed the alleged remediation of the toxic chemicals which are alleged to have harmed Plaintiffs. Assuming the new facts found in Plaintiffs’ Opposition are true, Plaintiffs have not met their burden demonstrating how or in what manner these “new” allegations support of finding that a reasonable possibility exist for Plaintiffs to cure the defects and successfully pled a theory of alter ego. (Reeder v. Specialized Loan Servicing LLC (2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 795, 805.) These additional facts show no connection between Vollero and Ivory Holdings. Even with the inclusion of those three allegations, Plaintiffs’ operative pleading would fail to allege any of the ultimate facts showing an alter ego theory as set forth in Rutherford (e.g. allegations of unity of interest, domination and control, inadequate capitalization).4. RulingThe Court sustains Defendant Vollero’s Demurrer without leave to amend. Defendant Vollero’s motion to strike is now moot.
