And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Defense counsel on behalf of Defendant OC Professional Team, Inc. The motion is granted, allowing Defense counsel to withdraw as counsel for the Defendant. The judge found that the Defendant has not paid attorney fees for the past three months and has expressed an inability to pay future fees. The Defendant has also indicated that it is seeking new counsel and has agreed to the withdrawal of Defense counsel. The judge determined that granting the motion would not result in prejudice to the Defendant, as it is seeking new counsel, and therefore denied the motion.
