And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the pleadings and the parties' attempts to resolve the issues through a meet and confer process. The court has found that the plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint (TAC) is untimely and does not cure the defects in the Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The court has also reviewed the defendant's demurrer to the TAC and has sustained it without leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations of alter ego are still deficient and fails to allege the necessary facts to support a theory of alter ego. The court's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, California Health and Safety Code, and previous court decisions.
