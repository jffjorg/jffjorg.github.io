On December 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint. On June 24, 2023, Defendants filed an answer to Plaintiff’s first amended complaint; that same day, Defendant OSL filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff Ashtel Studios, Inc.

Weinberger as the referee. The Order specifies that the referee was appointed for “All discovery purposes in this action.” (Id., p.2.)On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Defendant Sandvig’s further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. On April 2, 2024, Defendant Sandvig filed an opposition. On April 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. This discovery dispute was to be heard by Referee Weinberger.On April 23, 2024, Referee Weinberger heard the instant discovery motion filed by Plaintiff, seeking to compel further Defendant Sandvig’s further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. On May 15, 2024, Referee Weinberger issued a report and recommendation regarding the instant motion. (May 15, 2024 Report of Referee.)On May 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed an objection to Discovery Referee’s Recommendation re motion to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents,Set Two, from Defendant Sandvig. As of July 3, 2024, Defendant Sandvig has not filed any response to the filed objection.Legal StandardsReviewing Orders of a Discovery Referee“When the parties do not consent, the court may, upon the written motion of any party, or of its own motion, appoint a referee in the following cases pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (b) of Section 640: … When the court in any pending action determines that it is necessary for the court to appoint a referee to hear and determine any and all discovery motions and disputes relevant to discovery in the action and to report findings and make a recommendation thereon.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 639, subd. (a)(5).)A referee must report their decision to the Court within 20 days after the hearing, unless the Court otherwise provides. (Code Civ. Proc., § 643, subd. (a).) Any party may file an objection to the referee’s report or recommendations within 10 days after the referee serves and files the report, or within another time as the court may direct. (Code Civ. Proc., § 643, subd. (c).) Responses to the objections shall be filed with the court and served on the referee and all other parties within 10 days after the objection is served. (Id.) The court shall review any objections to the report and any responses submitted to those objections and shall thereafter enter appropriate orders. (Id.)A discovery referee’s report is advisory, not determinative, and the trial court must independently consider the referee’s findings before acting upon the referee’s recommendations. (Marathon Nat. Bank v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1261.) “[T]he referee's recommendations are entitled to great weight.” (In re Marriage of Petropoulos (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 161, 176.)Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete; (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., 2031.310, subd. (a).)Next, the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).) A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetarysanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.)AnalysisPlaintiff objects to Discovery Referee’s Recommendation as to Request Nos. 84, 85, 87-90, 96-99 and 103-106.Plaintiff argues that it is entitled to the above-mentioned requests as they are relevant to establish alter-ego status between Defendants Sandvig, OSL, Oak Insurance and the Sandvig entities (USIG, LLC, VPayPro, LLC, 454 Deer Road LLC, Oak Capital Company Holdings, LLC, and Oak Processing Group, LLC). (See Ganesan Decl. ISO Motion to Compel Further Responses, ¶ 13, Exh. E [December 1, 2023 Deposition of Defendant Sandvig] at 12:17-24, 13:1-3, 14:8-12, 16:1-10, 17:12-22, 22:1-10, 26:18-12, 33:13-22, 44:11-23, 45:1:10, 52:12-53:22, 54:2-18 [these deposition excerpts refer to the various entities owned by or affiliated with Defendant Sandvig and his wife as well as money transfer between companies that are or are related to Defendant Sandvig’s entities.) Plaintiff counsel further states being prevented from asking Defendant Sandvig about the alter ego relationship with any entity during the December 1, 2023 Defendant Sandvig deposition. (Id. at 23:25-25:24.)Request Nos. 84, 87, 90, 96 seek all documents, including bank statements, relating to USIG, LLC, VPayPro, LLC, 454 Deer Road LLC and Oak Capital Company Holdings LLC’s bank accounts, respectively. The Discovery Referee recommends Defendant Sandvig produce the above-listed entities’ bank statements but allow redaction of the documents from the respective entities for transactions less than $5,000 as well as transactions with anyone other than Sandvig entities or Defendants OSL and/or Oak Insurance. Plaintiff’s objection to the Discovery Referee’s recommendation as to these requests is OVERRULED. Discovery of every transaction of the Sandvig entities unrelated to Defendant Sandvig, OSL and Oak Insurance is overbroad and irrelevant. The Court agrees with the Discovery Referee that a $5,000 threshold is reasonable as Plaintiff has not expressed a specific need to identify transactions below that number.Request Nos. 85, 88, 97 seek all documents sufficient to identify each person having an interest in VPayPro, LLC, 454 Deer Road LLC and Oak Processing Group LLC, respectively. The Discovery Referee recommends Defendant Sandvig produce portions of the operating agreements of the above-listed entities that reflect the members of each entity and the percentage interest of each member. Plaintiff objects, arguing that there is no stated basis, privacy or otherwise, why the operating agreements should not be fully produced. Further, Plaintiff contends redactions create greater burden and expense for Defendant Sandvig. Plaintiff’s objection to the Discovery Referee’s recommendation as to these requests is OVERRULED. Allowing the unredacted operating agreements of the variousentities is overbroad and not reasonably calculated in terms identifying the individuals having an interest in the various entities.Request No. 89 seeks all official corporate records of 454 Deer Road LLC. The Discovery Referee recommends denying without prejudice Plaintiff’s request for the above-listed entities’ corporate documents because Plaintiff has not currently shown the documents to be relevant or could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Plaintiff argues this request is relevant because Defendant Sandvig co-owned 454 Deer Road LLC through one of his entities, Defendant Oak Insurance purportedly transferred $20,000 to 454 Deer Road and 454 Deer Road LLC owned a property that was the Oak Insurance headquarters. (See Ganesan Decl. ISO Motion to Compel Further Responses, ¶ 13, Exh. E at 53:10-22, 54:2-18). Plaintiff’s objection to the Discovery Referee’s recommendation as to this request is OVERRULED. The Court finds that requesting for all official corporate records of 454 Deer Road LLC is overbroad and unduly burdensome.Request No. 98 asks for all official corporate records of Oak Processing Group LLC. The Discovery Referee recommends denying without prejudice Plaintiff’s request without specific justification. Plaintiff argues this request is relevant because Defendant Sandvig co-owned Oak Processing Group LLC through one of his entities. (See id.at 44:11-23.) Plaintiff’s objection to the Discovery Referee’s recommendation as to this request is OVERRULED. The Court finds that requesting for all official corporate records of Oak Processing Group LLC is overbroad, irrelevant and unduly burdensome.Request No. 99 asks for all documents relating to OSL’s deposits or withdrawals at Wells Fargo Bank branches in the form of case or cashier’s checks for amounts greater than $4,000. The Discovery Referee recommends denying without prejudice Plaintiff’s request but does not provide any specific justification. Plaintiff argues this request is relevant because Defendant Sandvig controls the bank account of OSL. (See id. at 22:1-10.) Plaintiff’s objection to the Discovery Referee’s recommendation as to this request is SUSTAINED. The Court finds this request relevant to determining Plaintiff’s alter ego theory (e.g. Plaintiff’s claim that large withdrawals and deposits to/from Defendant OSL and Oak Insurance’s bank accounts and that USIG loaned money to Defendant OSL to pay legal bills). (See Ganesan Decl. ISO Motion to Compel Further Responses, ¶ 8.)Request No. 103 asks for all documents supporting loans made to OSL by any entity Defendant Sandvig has a direct or indirect interest. The Discovery Referee recommends Defendant Sandvig produce the requested loan documents, but only loans for amounts $10,000 or higher. The Discovery Referee also limited the request to the period to November 1, 2020 to the present. Plaintiff objects to the extent that the loan documents must reach a threshold of $10,000 and argues that any loans between Defendants and/or the Sandvig entities are equally relevant, regardless of the $10,000 minimum threshold.Plaintiff’s objection to the Discovery Referee’s recommendation as to this request is OVERRULED, in part. Defendant Sandvig is ordered to produce the requested loan documents, but only loans for amounts $5,000 or higher.Request No. 104 asks for all documents supporting loans made to Oak Insurance by any entity Defendant Sandvig has a direct or indirect interest. The Discovery Referee recommends Defendant Sandvig produce the requested loan documents, but only loans for amounts $10,000 or higher. The Discovery Referee also limited the request to the period to November 1, 2020 to the present. Plaintiff objects to the extent that the loan documents must reach a threshold of $10,000 and argues that any loans between Defendants and/or the Sandvig entities are equally relevant, regardless of the $10,000 minimum threshold. Plaintiff’s objection to the Discovery Referee’s recommendation as to this request is OVERRULED, in part. Defendant Sandvig is ordered to produce the requested loan documents, but only loans for amounts $5,000 or higher.Request No. 105 asks for all documents supporting loans made by OSL to any entity Defendant Sandvig has a direct or indirect interest. The Discovery Referee recommends Defendant Sandvig produce the requested loan documents, but only loans for amounts $10,000 or higher. The Discovery Referee also limited the request to the period to November 1, 2020 to the present. Plaintiff objects to the extent that the loan documents must reach a threshold of $10,000 and argues that any loans between Defendants and/or the Sandvig entities are equally relevant, regardless of the $10,000 minimum threshold. Plaintiff’s objection to the Discovery Referee’s recommendation as to this request is SUSTAINED, in part Defendant Sandvig produce the requested loan documents, but only loans for amounts $5,000 or higher.Request No. 106 asks for all documents supporting loans made by Oak Insurance to any entity Defendant Sandvig has a direct or indirect interest. The Discovery Referee recommends Defendant Sandvig produce the requested loan documents, but only loans for amounts $10,000 or higher. The Discovery Referee also limited the request to the period to November 1, 2020 to the present. Plaintiff objects to the extent that the loan documents must reach a threshold of $10,000 and argues that any loans between Defendants and/or the Sandvig entities are equally relevant, regardless of the $10,000 minimum threshold. Plaintiff’s objection to the Discovery Referee’s recommendation as to this request is SUSTAINED, in part. Defendant Sandvig is ordered to produce the requested loan documents, but only loans for amounts $5,000 or higher.The Discovery Referee recommended that no sanctions be awarded as the parties had a good faith discovery dispute. (See May 15, 2024 Report of Referee, p. 18.) In its objection, Plaintiff requests the Court award monetary sanctions in the amount of $20,060.00, arguing that Defendant Sandvig asserted unmeritorious objections, refused to servefurther responses, and refused to even search for the existence of responsive documents without substantial justification. (See Ganesan Decl. ISO Motion to Compel Further Responses, ¶¶ 20-22 [breakdown of attorney fees and costs incurred for the relevant discovery motion.])RulingPlaintiff’s Objections to the Discovery Referee’s Recommendations are sustained, in part. Defendant Sandvig is ordered to produce further verified responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents Nos. 99, 103-106 as modified by the Court within 20 days of this order. Plaintiff’s sanctions request is overruled.
