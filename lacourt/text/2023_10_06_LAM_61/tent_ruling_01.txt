I.                  
MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES
 
Plaintiff Timed Out, LLC (Timed Out) seeks an award of attorney fees in
the amount of $216,034.50, and expenses in the amount of $2,375.80, resulting
from former Cross-Defendant and Intervenor Chippewa’s (Chippewa) intervention
in this case following trial. (Motion at p. 2.) 
Parties to litigation must generally bear their own attorney’s fees,
unless they otherwise agree. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1021.) But Civil Code § 3344,
the statute that describes an individual’s right to their likeness and remedy
for misappropriation thereof, provides, “The prevailing party in any action
under this section shall also be entitled to attorney's fees and costs.” (Civ.
Code § 3344, subd. (a).)
Timed Out contends that, since Chippewa’s attempts to vacate the
judgment, forestall an award of attorney fees, and appeal of this court’s
rulings on both have proved unsuccessful, Timed Out is the “prevailing party”
against Chippewa under Civil Code § 3344, and therefore entitled to seek
attorney fees incurred in defending its section 3344 judgment against
Chippewa’s attacks. (Motion at pp. 15–17.)
Chippewa in opposition argues that Timed Out cannot be the prevailing
party under Civil Code § 3344 because it has obtained no judgment against
Chippewa, but only against Defendant Prisma Entertainment, LLC (Prisma).
Chippewa contends that the authority that Timed Out relies upon attests only to
the availability of fees and costs against intervenors who intervened prior to
trial and litigated the underlying case on the merits. (Opposition at pp. 2–3,
5–8.)
Chippewa was made party to this case through a cross-complaint for
indemnity filed by Defendant Prisma on August 25, 2017. Chippewa filed an
answer to the cross-complaint, and a special answer to the Timed Out’s
Complaint on October 27, 2017, as provided for under Code of Civil Procedure §
428.70. Prisma dismissed Chippewa as a cross-defendant on January 21, 2020,
prior to the rendering of any verdict in the trial. But after a verdict was
entered against Prisma, and Timed Out moved for attorney fees, Chippewa sought
leave to intervene to challenge the judgment and contest Plaintiff’s motion for
attorney fees, which leave was granted on June 26, 2020. Chippewa’s
complaint-in-intervention, deemed filed on June 26, 2020, stated that Chippewa
had “become the real party in interest,” by virtue of the assignment of
Prisma’s claims against Chippewa to Timed Out. (6/24/2020 Ex Parte Application,
Exh. J.) Chippewa’s motion to vacate the judgment was denied, but its
opposition to Timed Out’s motion for attorney fees yielded a substantial
reduction in the amount awarded. Chippewa appealed both orders, but both were
affirmed on appeal.
Timed
Out cites authority for the proposition that third party intervention is the
means by which “a third person is permitted to become a party to an
action or proceeding between other persons.” (Catello v. I.T.T. General Controls
(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 1009, 1013, italics in original.) As such, upon
intervening, “[t]he intervenor becomes a party to the action, with all of the
same procedural rights and remedies of the original parties.” (Id. at
pp. 1013–1014.) “Upon being permitted to intervene, the intervenor is to be
regarded as a plaintiff or as a defendant in the action (unless he seeks
something adversely to both) according as is the party for whose success he
seeks to intervene.” (Id. at p. 1014.) Thus Timed Out contends that
Chippewa made itself a party to this action, one for relief under Civil Code §
3344, and thus vulnerable to attorney fees under that statute, when it sought
to intervene in this case and vacate the judgment upon which Plaintiff had
obtained relief under that statute. (Motion at pp. 15–16.)
Chippewa in opposition argues that its
complaint-in-intervention was not “an action under this section [3344],” as it
sought no relief, and resulted in no adjudication on the merits against it
under that statute. (Opposition at pp. 5–6.)
Chippewa’s argument is unpersuasive. Judgment has not been
entered against Chippewa under section 3344, but the judgment that Timed Out
obtained, and which Chippewa sought to overturn by posttrial intervention, was
one for relief under that statute. Chippewa is a party to this action by virtue
of its intervention; the action is one brought under section 3344; and
Chippewa’s primary prayer for relief — the vacatur of the judgment for alleged
collusion — has been denied. Chippewa was aware of the nature of the action
when it intervened, and indeed, asserted in its complaint in intervention that
it was the “real party in interest” under the judgment that it challenged.
Indeed, Chippewa sought reimbursement of its own attorney fees in its motion to
vacate the judgment. (8/18/20 Motion at pp. 11–12.)
The fact that Chippewa’s arguments against the judgment
sounded in the procedural facts of the case is of little moment when the object
of the attack was Timed Out’s claim under section 3344, through which it is
entitled to claim fees. Chippewa correctly notes that fees sought by a
prevailing party requires “a disposition on the merits of the claim.” (Varney
Entertainment Group, Inc. v. Avon Plastics, Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 222,
230.) But such a disposition was here made in the judgment that Chippewa sought
to vacate, and Timed Out may seek compensation for fees incurred in
successfully preserving that judgment from collateral attack. The dismissal of
Chippewa’s claims for relief made in its complaint-in-intervention thus renders
Timed Out the prevailing party under the statute. (See Catello v. I.T.T.
General Controls (1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 1009, 1014 [holding that voluntary
dismissal of complaint in intervention created liability for costs under Code
of Civil Procedrue § 1032].) 
Timed Out is thus the prevailing party under Civil Code §
3344, and is entitled to the fees sought in connection with the defense of its
judgment against Chippewa’s complaint in intervention. 
“It is well established that the determination of what constitutes
reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court,
whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of
discretion.”  (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.)  In exercising its discretion, the court
should consider a number of factors, including the nature of the litigation,
its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in handling the matter,
the attention given, the success or failure, and the resulting judgment.  (See id.)  
In determining the proper amount of fees to award, courts use the
lodestar method.  The lodestar figure is
calculated by multiplying the total number of reasonable hours expended by the
reasonable hourly rate.  “Fundamental to
its determination . . . [is] a careful compilation of the time spent and
reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney . . . in the presentation of
the case.”  (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48 (Serrano III).)  A reasonable
hourly rate must reflect the skill and experience of the attorney.  (Id.
at p. 49.)  “Prevailing parties are compensated for hours reasonably spent on
fee-related issues.  A fee request that
appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial
court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.”  (Serrano
v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635 (Serrano
IV).)  The Court in Serrano IV also stated that fees
associated with preparing the motion to recover attorneys’ fees are
recoverable.  (See id. at p. 624.)
Timed Out submits materials corroborating the amount of
fees sought. It states that two attorneys and two paralegals together performed
490.9 hours of work litigating Chippewa’s complaint in intervention and
subsequent appeal, for a total fee lodestar of $216,034.50. (Engel Decl. ¶ 21,
Exhs. A1, A2.) The fees sought range from $150 per hour for a paralegal to $575
for attorney work, and the average hourly charge was $440.08. (Engel Decl. Exh.
A1.) The fees were incurred dating from Chippewa’s initial ex parte application
to intervene in June 2020, and the work performed thereafter relates to
Chippewa’s challenges to the judgment, the prior attorney fee award, and
Chippewa’s subsequent appeals. Chippewa has not submitted any argument as to
the reasonableness of the fees sought here.
Accordingly, the motion for attorney fees is GRANTED in the
amount of $216,034.50 in fees and $2,375.80 in expenses.
