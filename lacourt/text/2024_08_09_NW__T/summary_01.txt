And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for attorneys' fees brought by Karen Dr LLC against Richard Khatibi. The motion was filed in response to a third amended cross-complaint alleging breach of contract and tort claims. The judge has granted the motion in part, reducing the requested fees from $146,545.25 to $117,536.75.

The judge found that Karen Dr LLC is entitled to attorneys' fees based on the oral Joint Venture Agreement, which included a provision for attorneys' fees. The judge also found that Karen Dr LLC prevailed on the breach of contract claim and that Richard Khatibi would have had a right to recover fees had he prevailed.

The judge denied some of the requested fees, including those incurred by Shabnam Akhoundzadeh prior to February 20, 2023. The judge also denied Richard Khatibi's request for judicial notice.

The judge's ruling is based on several legal authorities, including Civil Code section 1717 and cases such as Cano v. Glover and Brown Bark III, L.P. v. Haver. The judge's decision is final unless a party files a written objection within a certain time period.
