 Case Number:  22VECV00081    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV00081 RIF V vs LETS
RESTYLE
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Plaintiff RIF V – Odessa, LLC’s Unopposed
Petition to Confirm the Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
Introduction 
Plaintiff RIF V – Odessa, LLC
(Plaintiff) moved to confirm the arbitration award decided against Defendants
Lets Restyle CA, Inc. and IBeauty Brands Inc. (collectively, Defendants).  The arbitrator awarded Plaintiff $418,482.58
and attorneys’ fees in the amount of $55,191.50 and daily interest of $61.82
per day beginning July 4, 2024.  The
petition also requested $14,317.05 in costs. 
A signed copy of the award is attached as Attachment 8(c).  An opposition was due July 29, 2024 and none
was filed.
Discussion 
Unless a petition or response
seeking to correct or vacate an arbitration award was filed properly based upon
valid grounds, or the proceeding is dismissed, courts are required to enter
judgment in conformity with the award. 
(Code of Civ. Proc. sec. 1286; Valsan Partners Ltd. Partnership v.
Calcor Space Facility (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.)  Because Defendants did not file a separate
petition to correct or vacate and did not file a response/opposition to the
instant Petition despite sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard, the
Petition is persuasive.  
The Petition to Confirm the Award
is GRANTED.
Judgment shall be issued
according to the Arbitration Award.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
