Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied without prejudice Plaintiff Keith Smith's motion to compel the deposition and production of documents of non-party Jonathan Marsand Balter. The motion was unopposed, but the Court is precluded from granting the motion until Plaintiff first resolves the issue of service. The proof of service indicates Balter was served by mail, but there is no evidence that Balter agreed to accept service by mail, and therefore Plaintiff must serve the moving papers by personal service. The Court has ordered Plaintiff to give notice and has encouraged the parties to meet and confer to resolve the issue.
