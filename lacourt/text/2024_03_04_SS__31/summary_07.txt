The judge has ruled on a motion to strike and a demurrer filed by defendants East L.A. Dialysis Center, et al. against plaintiff Jerry Woldum. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were negligent and intentionally inflicted emotional distress when a metal gate fell on him while he was trying to reposition it. The judge sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress without leave to amend, finding that the allegations did not rise to the level of outrageous conduct. The judge also granted the motion to strike allegations of malicious, oppressive, and despicable conduct, and punitive damages, finding that the allegations were conclusory and did not support a claim for punitive damages.
