And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of granting NGL Transportation, LLC and Pedro Millancova's (collectively "Defendants") motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff Jamel Dupree Phillips and Suitable Staffing Solutions, Inc. (Doe 1) ("Suitable Staffing"). The motion was unopposed and the court finds that filing the cross-complaint will not prejudice any party. The proposed cross-complaint arises from the same incident as the original lawsuit and should be litigated together. The court has set a trial date of May 13, 2024, and the defendants are ordered to file a separate copy of the cross-complaint within 10 days.
