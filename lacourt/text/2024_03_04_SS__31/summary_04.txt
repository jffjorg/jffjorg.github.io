And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request to continue the OSC (Order to Show Cause) by 120 days, as the plaintiff's counsel failed to provide an explanation for the request. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment, citing several defects in the plaintiff's submission. Specifically, the plaintiff failed to dismiss all defendants against whom judgment is not sought, did not authenticate the records attached to the declaration, and did not provide details on the "Fair Market Value" and "principal sum" sought. The judge has imposed monetary sanctions of $250 on the plaintiff's counsel for failure to comply with the court's prior orders and for failure to prosecute. The plaintiff is required to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects, and failure to do so may result in further sanctions or dismissal.
