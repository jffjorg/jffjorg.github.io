And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant/cross-complainant Shmuel Erde's demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by the plaintiff/cross-defendant Cartwright Termite & Pest Control, Inc. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff/cross-defendant must file and serve a first amended cross-complaint within 30 days of the ruling, and the defendant/cross-complainant must file and serve a response within 30 days thereafter. The judge has ruled that the third through seventh causes of action are uncertain and fail to state sufficient facts, and are therefore not causes of action. The judge has given the plaintiff/cross-defendant an opportunity to amend the cross-complaint to address these issues.
