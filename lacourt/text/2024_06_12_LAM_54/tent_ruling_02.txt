BACKGROUND
                
This is a lemon law action arising out
of Plaintiff purchase of a 2022 Chevrolet Bolt manufactured and distributed by
Defendant General Motors LLC.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action … without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to
produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  (CCP § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
 
The motion must be accompanied by a
good faith meet and confer declaration under section 2016.040 or, “when the
deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice,
by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to
inquire about the nonappearance.”  (CCP §
2025.450, subd. (b)(2).)  
 
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s
PMK on various categories as well as to produce documents at deposition. The
requests are roughly separated into three categories: the repair and repurchase
of Plaintiff’s vehicle; Defendant’s policies and procedures relating to
Song-Beverly compliance; and Defendant’s knowledge of, and efforts or lack of
efforts to remedy the subject defect. All categories are relevant to
Plaintiff’s claims and discoverable. To the extent that Defendant already has produced
the requested documents, Defendant need not produce them again.
 
The motion to compel deposition is GRANTED.
The Court declines to award sanctions to either party. These are standard lemon
law discovery issues that can be resolved with proper meet and confer; they should
not require Court intervention.
