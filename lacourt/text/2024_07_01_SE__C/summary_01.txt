```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiffs' ex parte application to consolidate the hearings for the defendants' demurrers and motions to strike. The plaintiffs had argued that the hearings should be consolidated because the defendants' arguments are nearly identical and would promote judicial efficiency. However, the court was not persuaded that the plaintiffs would face irreparable harm if the hearings were not heard on the same day. As a result, the court has denied the application and the hearings will proceed as previously scheduled.
