Esmeralda Carbajal, et al. vs The Maria De La Luz Gonzalez Living Trust, et
al., Case No. 23NWCV00407
This is a
wrongful eviction action. 
Plaintiffs
Agustin Gamez and Yadhira Carbajal along with their children Agustin Carbajal
Jr. and Karen Carbajal (collectively “Plaintiffs”) have filed an ex parte
application seeking to consolidate the hearings for Defendants’ Demurrers and
Motions to Strike (the “Hearings”) to be heard on the same day. 
Plaintiff
contends Defendant Juan Gonzalez (“Defendant Gonzalez”) and Defendant Lucero
Vargas (“Defendant Vargas”) individually filed their respective Demurrers and
Motions to Strike the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) and reserved separate
hearings on two separate dates. 
Currently,
Defendant Gonzalez’s hearing is set for July 3, 2024, and Defendant Vargas’s
hearing is set for July 9, 2024. However, Plaintiffs argue that both
Defendants’ Demurrers and Motions to Strike are nearly identical to one another
and allege the same set of arguments against the FAC.
A party may
seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
While the Court
takes note of Plaintiffs’ contention that consolidating the hearings on the
same day may promote judicial efficiency, the Court is not persuaded that
Plaintiffs’ will face irreparable harm if the hearings are not heard on the
same day. 
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Ex Parte application to consolidate the hearings of Defendant
Gonzalez and Defendant Vargas is DENIED. 
Defendant to
give notice.
