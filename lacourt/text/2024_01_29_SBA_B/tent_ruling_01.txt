RULING
            The motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
            On July 24, 2019, plaintiff Ramona
Murillo Gamboa filed a complaint against defendants Los Angeles World Airports,
City of Los Angeles, SAS Services Group, Concesionaria Vuela Compania de
Aviacion S.A.P.I. De C.V., and Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, S.A.B.
De C.V. for (1) premises liability; (2) dangerous condition of public property;
(3) breach of duty of a common carrier; (4) negligence; (5) negligent hiring;
and (6) negligence per se.  Plaintiff
alleges that she slipped and fell causing her to sustain injuries on June 20,
2018. 
On March 22, 2021, plaintiff filed
a First Amended Complaint.  
On March 23, 2023, the court
sustained with leave to amend Buenos Travel Agency (Doe 1)’s demurrer to the
FAC and denied defendant’s motion to dismiss under Barrows.
On April 25, 2023, plaintiff filed
a SAC against defendants Los Angeles World Airports, City of Los Angeles, SAS
Services Group, Concesionaria Vuela Compania de Aviacion S.A.P.I. De C.V., and
Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, S.A.B. De C.V., and Buenos Travel
Agency for (1) premises liability; (2) dangerous condition of public property;
(3) breach of duty of a common carrier; (4) negligence; (5) general negligence;
(6) negligent hiring; and (7) negligence per se.
On May 15, 2023, the court granted
defendant S.A.S. Services Group, Inc.’s application for determination of good
faith settlement.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
The purpose of a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.
“On a motion for summary judgment,
the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing
that there are no triable issues of material fact.”  Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1519.  A defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of
action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.”  CCP §
437c(p)(2).  “Once the defendant . . .
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” CCP § 437c(p)(2).  
“When deciding whether to grant
summary judgment, the court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the
papers (except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection), as well
as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light
most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.” Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal. App.
4th 463, 467; CCP §437c(c).
DISCUSSION
Defendants
Los Angeles World Airports (“LAWA”) and the City of Los Angeles request summary
judgment as to the causes of action asserted against them in the SAC (1st, 2nd,
4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th causes of action).  
In the
SAC, plaintiff alleges that this is a personal injury action arising out of a
slip-and-fall accident which occurred on June 20, 2018 due to defendants’
negligence, including defendants’ failure to provide plaintiff with a
wheelchair as requested and failure to properly maintain the premises in
Terminal 2 at LAX.  SAC, ¶20.  On June 5, 2018, plaintiff booked or caused
to be booked on her behalf with Buenos Travel Agency a non-stop flight for June
20, 2018, departing from Zacatecas, Mexico at 7:46 p.m. arriving in LA at 9:07
p.m.  Id., ¶21.  The booking indicated plaintiff requested or
caused to be requested a wheelchair to tend to her physical needs and/or
disabilities and/or restrictions.  Id.,
¶23.  The booking indicated such
wheelchair was to be part of the accommodations that defendant Buenos was
including in plaintiff’s itinerary and that was to be communicated to
defendants City, LAWA, and/or Volaris. Id., 24. 
On June 20, 2018, between 9:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., plaintiff arrived at
Terminal 2 in LAX.  Id., ¶25.  Upon arriving at the airport, plaintiff
requested wheelchair assistance, consistent with the request already made and
previously indicated to have been included in plaintiff’s travel itinerary.  Id., ¶26. 
Plaintiff waited in the airplane for approximately 30 minutes after
requesting wheelchair assistance.  Id.,
¶27.  Plaintiff was told by a male
employee to exit the plane and start walking. 
Id., ¶28.  Plaintiff exited the
plane with her carry-on luggage and continued toward the baggage claim and
terminal exit.  Id., ¶29.  While proceeding to the baggage claim area,
plaintiff attempted to use the subject escalator, falling on her first step.  Id., ¶30. 
As a direct and proximate result of defendants’ failure to provide
plaintiff with the requisite medical device requested, plaintiff tripped and
fell causing her to fall on her right arm, resulting in a fracture to her right
forearm and pain in her right leg and right arm.  Plaintiff required immediate medical
attention and emergency care.  Id., ¶31.
The
parties do not dispute that both City defendants are governmental
entities.  Defendants’ Separate Statement
of Undisputed Material Facts (“DUMF”) 1. 
The subject escalator was maintained and controlled by defendant Los
Angeles World Airports.  DUMF 3.  A record search performed at LAWA Asset
Management Team and LAWA Facilities Technical Services with respect to the
subject escalator revealed that there were no work orders for the subject
escalator on or around the date of the incident.  DUMF 5. 
The conditions of the premises where the incident occurred were clean,
dry, and well-lit at the time of the incident. 
DUMF 7.
Evidentiary
Objections  
Plaintiff’s
objections to the declarations of Scott Cunningham, Frank Koehler, Phu Tong,
and Vivian D. Howell are OVERRULED.  
Separate
Statement
In the
opposition, plaintiff asserts that defendant’s separate statement does not
comply with CCP §437c(3)(b)(1).  The
court finds that it is sufficient as defendants have listed material facts and
citations to evidence.
Government
Claims Act
Gov. Code
§945.4 provides that “no suit for money or damages may be brought against a
public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required to be
presented in accordance with . . . Section 910 . . . until a written claim
therefor has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon by the
board, or has been deemed to have been rejected by the board . . . .”  Gov. Code §910 requires that the claim states
the “date, place, and other circumstances of the occurrence or transaction
which gave rise to the claim asserted” and provide [a] general description of
the . . . injury, damage or loss incurred so fare as it may be known at the
time of presentation of the claim.”
The
purpose of the Government Claims Act is to “’to provide the public entity sufficient
information to enable it to adequately investigate claims and to settle them,
if appropriate, without the expense of litigation.’” Stockett v. Association
of Cal. Water Agencies Joint Powers Ins. Auth. (2004) 34 Cal. 4th 441, 446
(citation omitted).  “Consequently, a
claim need not contain the detail and specificity required of a pleading, but
need only ‘fairly describe what the entity is alleged to have done.’”  Id. (citation omitted).  “A complaint’s fuller exposition of the
factual basis beyond that given in the claim is not fatal, so long as the
complaint is not based on an ‘entirely different set of facts.’  Only where there has been a ‘complete shift
in allegations . . .’ have courts generally found the complaint barred.  Where the complaint merely elaborates or adds
further detail to a claim, but is predicated on the same fundamental actions or
failures to act by the defendants, courts have generally found the claim fairly
reflects the facts pled in the complaint.” 
Id. at 447 (citations omitted).
In the
SAC, plaintiff alleges that plaintiff has complied with the Tort Claims Act by
timely filing a Tort Claim with defendants City of LA and Los Angeles World
Airports on December 7, 2018.  SAC, ¶2.  Defendants City and LAWA are public entities
upon which plaintiff has timely served a written government claim pursuant to
Gov. Code §§905 and 910.  Id., ¶34. 
Plaintiff’s
claim for damages states:  Under “How did
Damage or Injury occur?” it states, “Ms. Murillo-Gamboa was travelling from
Zacatecas, Mexico to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).  She waited in the airplane on Terminal 2 for
about 30 minutes for the wheelchair she requested in advance.  However, the airport staff did not provide
the requested service.  Instead, one of
the staff members told her and six other passengers who were waiting for
wheelchairs to get off the plane and start walking.  As Ms. Murillo-Gamboa made an effort to
comply with the staff’s request, she tripped and fell while riding the
escalator, resulting in severe injuries in the form of a fracture to her right
forearm.  Two passengers helped her get
up, two airport employees arrived at the scene, and asked her about how she
fell.  They made her sign a document
without explaining the content and without giving her a copy.  She was transported to the hospital.”  Under “What particular ACT or OMISSION do you
claim caused the injury or damage?” it states, “LAX staff failed to provide Ms.
Murillo-Gamboa with a wheelchair despite her advance request for it.  Instead, LAX asked her to start walking to
the escalator, despite the foreseeable risk that she will trip and fall due to
LAX’s staff failure to provide Ms. Murillo-Gamboa with a wheelchair.  LAX negligently hired staff, who negligently
failed to provide a wheelchair to Ms. Murillo-Gamboa, which caused her to trip
and fall.”  Defendants’ compendium of
evidence, Exh. 11.
Defendants
argue that the causes of action based on the alleged dangerous condition of the
escalator (1st, 2nd, and 4th causes of action)
are barred because the claims “premised on an unspecified dangerous condition
of the subject escalator, is a complete ‘shift in allegations’ from the
allegedly negligent failure to provide a wheelchair stated in her government
claim.”  Defendants contend that because
plaintiff did not allege any dangerous condition of the subject escalator in
her government claim, the City defendants had no notice or opportunity to
evaluate any potential liability for a dangerous condition until the filing of
the complaint.  
In
opposition, plaintiff argues that she substantially complied with Gov. Code
§910, but even if she did not, she contends, defendants waived any defects by
virtue of their general denial.
The court
finds that the 1st, 2nd, and 4th causes of
action are barred under the Gov. Claims Act as they are based on allegations
that the escalator itself was in a defective or dangerous condition.  Plaintiff’s government claim does not
attribute the cause of her injuries to the escalator.  The claim does not identify the allegedly
dangerous condition at all.  She only
states that the escalator is the location where she purportedly tripped and
fell.  Thus, the causes of action based
on a defective or dangerous condition are not “fairly reflected” in the
government claim.
 
1st
cause of action for premises liability  
The SAC
alleges that on June 20, 2018, defendants City and LAWA owned, maintained, and
controlled the subject escalator on which plaintiff sustained injuries.  SAC, ¶36. 
On June 20, 2018, defendants, as reasonably prudent owners of the
subject escalator should have foreseen that plaintiff would be exposed to an
unreasonable risk of harm located at the subject escalator.  AS such, they owed plaintiff a duty of
care.  Id., ¶37.  Defendants owed a duty to use reasonable care
to design, construct, maintain, own, operate, occupy, possess, manage, and/or
control the subject escalator in a reasonably safe condition; to inspect the
premises; to discovery any unsafe conditions on the escalator; to repair or
remove any unsafe conditions on the escalator; and/or to provide adequate
warning of any unsafe conditions on the escalator, which could reasonably be
expected to harm others.  Id., ¶38.  Defendants negligently failed to do the
above.  The lack of warning signs near
the escalator constituted a dangerous and unsafe condition for individuals
walking near or on the escalator.  The escalator
was inside a heavy populated terminal in a densely populated airport filled
with food and retail businesses with significant foot traffic, making it highly
foreseeable that pedestrians would use the escalator, including plaintiff.  Defendants’ negligence created a dangerous
and unsafe condition that created a substantial risk of the type of injury when
the property was used with due care in a manner in which it was reasonably
foreseeable that it would be used.  Id., ¶39.  Reasonable diligence would have revealed that
the escalator was not being maintained at suitable levels of cleanliness, with
suitable warning signs and safety precautions, thereby creating a dangerous
condition.  Defendants did not rectify
the dangerous condition.  Thus,
defendants breached their duty of care by creating a dangerous condition, which
exposed lessees and guests, including plaintiff, to an unreasonable risk of
harm.  Id., ¶40.  Defendants had actual and constructive
knowledge of the dangerous condition posed by the lack of warning signs at the
escalator and had notice of it for a long enough time to have protected against
it.  Id., ¶41.
Defendants
argue that this claim is also barred as a matter of law by the Gov. Claims Act because
it is not based on statute.  
Gov. Code
§815 provides that “[e]xept as otherwise provided by statute . . . [a] public
entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or
omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.”  “[D]irect tort liability of public entities
must be based on a specific statute declaring them to be liable, or at least
creating some specific duty of care, and not on the general tort provisions of
Civil Code section 1714.  Otherwise, the
general rule of immunity for public entities would be largely eroded by the
routine application of general tort principles.”  Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection
Authority (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183. 
Since the duty of a governmental agency can only be created by statute
or enactment, the statute or enactment claimed to establish the duty must at
the very least be identified.  Searcy
v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal. App. 3d 792, 802.  “Thus, in California, ‘all government tort
liability must be based on statute.’”  Hoff
v. Vacaville Unified School District (1998) 19 Cal.4th 925, 932 (citation
omitted).
The
opposition does not address this cause of action.
The court
finds that this cause of action is based on common law and not on any statutory
authority and is thus barred as a matter of law against the public entity
defendants.
 
2nd
cause of action for dangerous condition of public property  
The SAC
alleges that the subject escalator was in a dangerous condition at the time of
the incident, as the condition of the escalator created a substantial risk of
injury to members of the general public like plaintiff when used with
reasonable care and in a reasonably foreseeable manner.  SAC, ¶49. 
The dangerous condition of the escalator, including the lack of warning
signs, created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury that
occurred as the result of the failure to warn. 
Id., ¶50.  Defendants had notice
of the dangerous condition of the subject escalator, lack of warning signs, for
a long enough time to have protected against it.  Id., ¶51.
Government
Code §835 “sets out the exclusive conditions under which a public entity is
liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of public property.”  Metcalf v. County of San Joaquin
(2008) 42 Cal.4th 1121, 1129.  
A public
entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if:
1) the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the injury;¿2) the
dangerous condition caused the injury;¿3) the dangerous condition created a
reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred; and 4)
either a negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public
entity within the scope of his employment created the condition, or the entity
had actual or constructive notice of the condition in time to have taken
measures to protect against it.  Gov.
Code § 835.  “‘Dangerous condition’ means
a condition of property that creates a substantial (as distinguished from a
minor, trivial or insignificant) risk of injury when such property or adjacent
property is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably foreseeable
that it will be used.”  Gov. Code §
830(a).  
“‘[A]
claim alleging a dangerous condition may not rely on generalized allegations but
must specify in what manner the condition constituted a dangerous condition.’  A plaintiff’s allegations, and ultimately the
evidence, must establish a physical deficiency in the property itself.  A dangerous condition exists when public
property ‘is physically damaged, deteriorated, or defective in such a way as to
foreseeably endanger those using the property itself,’ or possesses physical
characteristics in its design, location, features or relationship to its
surroundings that endanger users. . . . ‘[P]ublic liability lies under section
835 only when a feature of the public property has ‘increased or intensified’
the danger to users from third party conduct.’” 
Cerna v. City of Oakland (2008) 161 Cal. App. 4th 1340, 1347-1348
(citations omitted).  “[T]o constitute a
dangerous condition under Government Code section 835, public 
property must possess a physical defect which
creates a substantial, as distinguished from a minor, trivial or insignificant,
risk of injury. (Gov. Code § 830(a).)  Harmful
conduct in and of itself cannot form a basis for recovery without a direct
causal connection with the physical defect.” Bartell v. Palos Verdes
Peninsula Sch. Dist. (1978) 83 Cal. App. 3d 492, 497.  “Property is not ‘dangerous’ within the
meaning of the statutory scheme if the property is safe when used with due care
and the risk of harm is created only when foreseeable users fail to exercise
due care.”  Brenner v. City of El
Cajon (2003) 113 Cal. App. 4th 434, 439 (citation omitted).
            The
court construes this claim as one for dangerous condition under Gov. Code §835.
            Defendants
argue that even if plaintiff had complied with the government claims
presentation requirement, plaintiff has not and cannot plead and prove any
physical defect with respect to the subject escalator constituting a “dangerous
condition,” including that the escalator was “physically damaged, deteriorated,
or defective” or that it possessed “physical characteristics in its design,
location, features or relationship to its surroundings” that would create a
substantial risk of injury when caused while exercising due care in a
foreseeable manner.  
In any
event, defendants contend, the subject escalator was in a safe and normal
condition at the time of plaintiff’s accident. 
See DUMF Nos. 5, 7.  Defendants
present evidence explaining that Facilities Technical Services (“FTS”) at LAWA
is responsible for providing maintenance services for conveyance systems, such
as elevators and escalators, at LAX either directly or through its contractors.  James Andrade decl., ¶2.  The FTS is and has been responsible for the
operation, maintenance, control, inspection, and supervision of the subject escalator
located in the Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX.  Id., ¶3. 
The FTS regularly checks the escalators. 
If there is a malfunctioning escalator, a work order will be created
once it is brought to FTS’s attention. 
FTS or its contractors will send a maintenance technician to inspect and
repair a malfunctioning escalator when notified.  Records are kept for any such
maintenance.  Id., ¶4.  Declarant searched the records at FTS with
respect to the subject escalator for any work orders near the date of the
incident.  The search revealed that there
were no work orders for the subject escalator. 
Therefore, FTS’s records show that the subject escalator was operating
properly on the day of the incident. 
Id., ¶5.  Also, declarant reviewed
the CCTV footage of the incident, which “clearly shows the subject escalator
functioning properly with passengers ascending the escalator before Ms. Gamboa
steps on the escalator and falls.  Id.,
¶6.  The escalator stops after a bystander
presses the emergency stop buttons, which is exactly how the escalator is
supposed to function.  Id., ¶7.
Defendants
also contend that to the extent that plaintiff alleges that a lack of warning
signs near the subject escalator constituted a “dangerous condition,” plaintiff
does not allege what signage was missing or what dangers the signage should
have warned.  Further, defendants argue,
a mere lack of additional warning, without some physical damage or unusual
characteristic of the property does not alone amount to a “dangerous
condition.”  
In
opposition, plaintiff contends that there is at least a triable issue of
material fact as to whether plaintiff’s unfamiliarity with the existence of
escalators renders the escalator, without any warning signs or directions to
use, a dangerous condition of public property. 
Plaintiff asserts that defendants “know that people, such as plaintiff,
would be coming to the United States for the first time through its airport,
and it is foreseeable that someone such as plaintiff would be unable to discern
how to utilize the escalators provided absent such a warning.”
The court
finds that defendants have met their burden that plaintiff cannot establish the
elements for dangerous condition of public property, including that defendants
had a duty to provide “warning” signs or instructions as to how to use the
escalator.  Plaintiff has failed to
present substantial evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact.  Rather, plaintiff presents conjecture and
speculation.
 
4th cause
of action for negligence (Gov. Code §§815.2, 815.4, 820(a), Civil Code §1714)
Gov. Code
§815.2 states:  “(a) A public entity is
liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of
the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission
would, apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of action against
that employee or his personal representative.”
The SAC
alleges defendants’ employees, agents, and independent contractors, pursuant to
Gov. Code §§815.2, 815.4, and 820(a) and Civil Code §1714, owed a duty of care
to plaintiff to maintain, operate, patrol, service, facilitate, inspect, and/or
control the subject escalator in a reasonable manner.  SAC, ¶69. 
Defendants carelessly, negligently, and recklessly maintained, operated,
patrolled, serviced, facilitated, inspected, and/or controlled the escalator,
which was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s fall and injuries.  Id., ¶¶70-71. 
 
The SAC
also alleges that as to public employee negligence giving rise to vicarious
liability, defendants, while acting within the scope of their employment,
engaged in wrongful and/or negligent and/or careless and/or reckless and/or
unlawful conduct, namely in failing to provide plaintiff with medical devices
when requested, thereby causing plaintiff to fall on the subject escalator.  Id., ¶79. 
Defendants had a legal duty to maintain, operate, and control the escalator
in a reasonably safe manner.  Defendants
had a legal duty to ensure the safety of the passengers and others, including
plaintiff, using services of defendants. 
Id., ¶80.
Defendants
argue that this claim fails because none of the statutory authorities plaintiff
cites can afford relief.  As defendants
argue under the 2nd cause of action, the conditions of the subject escalator
is exclusively governed by Gov. Code §835. 
Also, Civil Code §1714 is inapplicable because it sets forth a duty of
care under ordinarily negligence only.  See
Eastburn, supra, at 1183. 
Defendants also contend that under Gov. Code §815.2, plaintiff must
establish that an employee of the City defendants “engaged in an act or
omission giving rise to that employees tort liability.”  Koussaya v. City of Stockton (2020) 54
Cal. App. 5th 909, 944. 
Defendants contend that plaintiff cannot meet her burden in establishing
that any employee of the City defendants owed her a duty to provide a
wheelchair.  Defendants present evidence
that LAWA did not and does not provide wheelchair service to passengers at
LAX.  All wheelchair services at LAX are
provided by the airlines directly or through their contracted wheelchair
service agents.  Vivian Howell decl., ¶4.  Thus, defendants argue, no employee of the
City defendants owed plaintiff a duty to provide her a wheelchair, and in the
absence of any negligence by an employee, the City defendants cannot be held
vicariously liable under Gov. Code §815.2 as a matter of law.
In
opposition, plaintiff contends that a triable issue of material fact exists as
to the involvement of City defendants in the wheelchair servicing process
itself, including the extent to which they have control over and otherwise
dictate the availability and means of servicing customers.  Plaintiff asserts that she requested a
wheelchair as part of her airline travels, “as evidenced by her itinerary when
the flight was booked for her.” 
Plaintiff contends that City defendants, in their operation of LAX, provide
guidelines, the ASPA Safety Module, for the ground handlers at LAX, which City
defendants have approved and adopted. 
Plaintiff also asserts that City defendants further provide direct
services related to ground handlers and their servicing of customers, including
those who have requested wheelchairs.  
The court
finds that defendants have met their burden to show that plaintiff cannot
establish the elements for liability under Gov. Code §815.2.  Plaintiff has not provided substantial
evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact, including that an employee
of the City defendants was aware of a wheelchair request for plaintiff or that
City defendants had a duty to provide a wheelchair.
 
5th cause
of action for general negligence  
The SAC
alleges that defendants owed plaintiff a duty of care in their dealings with
plaintiff.  SAC, ¶87.  On the subject date, defendants negligently
and carelessly acted or failed to act when plaintiff requested and never
received a wheelchair following her arrival at the subject premises.  Id., ¶88. 
Defendants were informed by plaintiff in advance of her trip and fall on
the subject escalator that she required wheelchair assistance, to which end no
such wheelchair was ever produced and thereafter approximately 30 minutes
following her request, plaintiff was demanded by defendant to leave the area
she was in despite failing to provide her with the requisite services, namely a
wheelchair for ambulation assistance. 
Id., ¶90. 
Defendants
argue the same as under the 1st cause of action that this claim
fails as a matter of law because it is barred by the Gov. Claims Act because it
is not based on statutory authority.
The
opposition does not address.
The court
finds that this cause of action is based on common law and not on any statutory
authority and is thus barred as a matter of law. 
 
6th cause
of action for negligent hiring (Gov. Code §§815.2, 815.4, 820(a), Civil Code §1714)  
The SAC
alleges that plaintiff was harmed by defendants and that defendants are
responsible for that harm because defendants negligently hired, supervised, or
retained defendants.  SAC, ¶100.  Defendants negligently hired employees as to
cause injuries and damages to plaintiff. 
Id., ¶101.  On June 20, 2018,
defendants’ staff failed to provide plaintiff with a wheelchair despite her
advance request for it.  Defendants’
staff asked plaintiff to start walking to the escalator, despite the
foreseeable risk that she would trip and fall due to defendants’ staff’s
failure to provide a wheelchair to plaintiff, which did cause her to trip and
fall.  Id., ¶102.  Defendants were unfit or incompetent to
perform the work for which they were hired, specifically providing adequate
service and assistance to plaintiff. 
Id., ¶103.  Defendants are
vicariously liable for the acts of their employees under Gov. Code §815.2.  Id., ¶106.
Defendants
argue that this claim fails as a matter of law because plaintiff cannot show
direct or vicarious liability.  As for
direct liability, defendants point out that it is not based on statutory
authority.  As for vicarious liability, defendants
argue that plaintiff cannot show the elements. 
As stated above, defendants provide evidence that LAWA did not and does
not provide wheelchair service to passengers at LAX.  All wheelchair services at LAX are provided
by the airlines directly or through their contracted wheelchair service
agents.  Vivian Howell decl., ¶4.  Further, defendants cite to plaintiff’s
responses to LAWA’s special interrogatories that she “does not have personal
knowledge sufficient to answer” Special Interrogatories Nos. 21, 22, which
requests that plaintiff state all facts to support her contentions in
paragraphs 89 and 90, and to Demand No. 28, she responded that she did not have
any documents to support her contentions in paragraph 90.
The
opposition does not address.
 The court finds that defendants have met their
burden of showing that plaintiff cannot establish the elements for negligent
hiring.  “[T]here is no statutory basis
for declaring a governmental entity liable for negligence in its hiring and
supervision practices.”  de Villers v.
County of San Diego (2007) 156 Cal. App. 4th 238, 253.  Plaintiff has presented no evidence to raise
a triable issue of material fact as to vicarious liability.
 
7th cause
of action for negligence per se 
The SAC
alleges that there were in force statutes, ordinances, and regulations
prohibiting the conduct exhibited by defendants.  SAC, ¶113. 
Plaintiff was a member of the class of persons for whose protection said
statutes, ordinances, and regulations were enacted or promulgated.  Id., ¶114. 
Defendants violated the traffic laws of City of LA and State of
California, which constituted negligence per se, including the Dept. of Motor
Vehicle’s Code.  Id., ¶115.
Defendants
argue the same as under the 1st and 5th causes of action
that plaintiff has not alleged any statutory liability.  
The
opposition does not address.
 The court finds that this claim is based on
common law and not any statutory authority and is thus barred as a matter of
law.  Further, it is not a cause of
action; rather it is an evidentiary presumption.
Request
for continuance
“If it
appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication, or both, that facts essential to justify
opposition may exist but cannot, for reasons stated, be presented, the court
shall deny the motion, order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained
or discovery to be had, or make any other order as may be just.  The application to continue the motion to
obtain necessary discovery may also be made by ex parte motion at any time on
or before the date the opposition response to the motion is due.”  CCP §437c(h). 
 “ ‘The affidavit or declaration in support of
the continuance request must detail the specific facts that would show the
existence of controverting evidence.’”  Granadino
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2015) 236 Cal. App. 4th 411, 420.  “[L]ack of diligence may be a ground for
denying a request for a continuance of a summary judgment motion hearing.”  Cooksey v. Alexakis (2004) 123 Cal. App.
4th 246, 257.
In the
opposition, plaintiff asserts that if the court is inclined to grant the motion
for summary judgment, then plaintiff requests a continuance because of
defendant City’s “failure to sit for her entire deposition and her counsel’s
obstructive conduct” and that plaintiff should be allowed to complete the
depositions of the City defendants’ PMK regarding training/safety, wheelchair
services, and the subject escalator.
The court
finds that plaintiff has not met her burden for a continuance.  There is no declaration from plaintiff’s
counsel.  Further, plaintiff has not
shown diligence in attempting to obtain any such evidence. 
Accordingly,
the motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.

            The motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
            On July 24, 2019, plaintiff Ramona
Murillo Gamboa filed a complaint against defendants Los Angeles World Airports,
City of Los Angeles, SAS Services Group, Concesionaria Vuela Compania de
Aviacion S.A.P.I. De C.V., and Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, S.A.B.
De C.V. for (1) premises liability; (2) dangerous condition of public property;
(3) breach of duty of a common carrier; (4) negligence; (5) negligent hiring;
and (6) negligence per se.  Plaintiff
alleges that she slipped and fell causing her to sustain injuries on June 20,
2018. 
On March 22, 2021, plaintiff filed
a First Amended Complaint.  
On March 23, 2023, the court
sustained with leave to amend Buenos Travel Agency (Doe 1)’s demurrer to the
FAC and denied defendant’s motion to dismiss (Barrows).
On April 25, 2023, plaintiff filed
a SAC against defendants Los Angeles World Airports, City of Los Angeles, SAS
Services Group, Concesionaria Vuela Compania de Aviacion S.A.P.I. De C.V., and
Controladora Vuela Compania de Aviacion, S.A.B. De C.V., and Buenos Travel
Agency for (1) premises liability; (2) dangerous condition of public property;
(3) breach of duty of a common carrier; (4) negligence; (5) general negligence;
(6) negligent hiring; and (7) negligence per se.
On May 15, 2023, the court granted
defendant S.A.S. Services Group, Inc.’s application for determination of good
faith settlement.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
The purpose of a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal. 4th 826, 843.  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal. App. 4th 1110, 1119.
“On a motion for summary judgment,
the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing
that there are no triable issues of material fact.”  Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1519.  A defendant moving for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of
action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.”  CCP §
437c(p)(2).  “Once the defendant . . .
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” CCP § 437c(p)(2).  
“When deciding whether to grant
summary judgment, the court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the
papers (except evidence to which the court has sustained an objection), as well
as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light
most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.” Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal. App.
4th 463, 467; CCP §437c(c).
DISCUSSION
Defendant
Volaris requests summary judgment in its favor and against plaintiff as to the
SAC (3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th
causes of action) on the ground that there is no triable issue of material fact
and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
In the
SAC, plaintiff alleges that this is a personal injury action arising out of a
slip-and-fall accident which occurred on June 20, 2018 due to defendants’
negligence, including defendants’ failure to provide plaintiff with a
wheelchair as requested and failure to properly maintain the premises in
Terminal 2 at LAX.  SAC, ¶20.  On June 5, 2018, plaintiff booked or caused
to be booked on her behalf with Buenos Travel Agency a non-stop flight for June
20, 2018, departing from Zacatecas, Mexico at 7:46 p.m. arriving in LA at 9:07
p.m.  Id., ¶21.  The booking indicated plaintiff requested or
caused to be requested a wheelchair to tend to her physical needs and/or
disabilities and/or restrictions.  Id.,
¶23.  The booking indicated such
wheelchair was to be part of the accommodations that defendant Buenos was
including in plaintiff’s itinerary and that was to be communicated to
defendants City, LAWA, and/or Volaris. Id., 24. 
On June 20, 2018, between 9:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., plaintiff arrived at
Terminal 2 in LAX.  Id., ¶25.  Upon arriving at the airport, plaintiff
requested wheelchair assistance, consistent with the request already made and
previously indicated to have been included in plaintiff’s travel itinerary.  Id., ¶26. 
Plaintiff waited in the airplane for approximately 30 minutes after
requesting wheelchair assistance.  Id.,
¶27.  Plaintiff was told by a male
employee to exit the plane and start walking. 
Id., ¶28.  Plaintiff exited the
plane with her carry-on luggage and continued toward the baggage claim and
terminal exit.  Id., ¶29.  While proceeding to the baggage claim area,
plaintiff attempted to use the subject escalator, falling on her first step.  Id., ¶30. 
As a direct and proximate result of defendants’ failure to provide
plaintiff with the requisite medical device requested, plaintiff tripped and
fell causing her to fall on her right arm, resulting in a fracture to her right
forearm and pain in her right leg and right arm.  Plaintiff required immediate medical
attention and emergency care.  Id., ¶31.
The
parties do not dispute that plaintiff fell after safely exiting the aircraft
and while she was attempting to board an escalator in the terminal on her way
to baggage claim and the terminal exit. 
Defendant’s Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (“DUMF”)
1.  Plaintiff attempted to use the
subject escalator despite never having used one in her life.  DUMF 2. 
The subject escalator was maintained and controlled by defendants City
of LA and Los Angeles World Airports. 
DUMF 3.
 
3rd
cause of action for breach of duty of a common carrier
Civil
Code §2100 states:  “A carrier of persons
for reward must use the utmost care and diligence for their safe carriage, must
provide everything necessary for that purpose, and must exercise to that end a
reasonable degree of skill.”
The SAC
alleges that Volaris operates as a common carrier.  SAC, ¶58. 
Volaris contracts with SAS for the providing of wheelchair services to
Volaris’ passengers.  Id., ¶59.  At the time of the incident, plaintiff was a
passenger on Volaris.  Id., ¶60.  Volaris, as a common carrier, had a duty at
all times to transport plaintiff as a passenger safely and to use the highest
care and vigilance of a very cautious person. 
Id., ¶61.  Volaris breached their
duty to plaintiff in that they did not exercise the highest care and vigilance
of a very cautions person when it failed to provide requested medical devices
to plaintiff, who was still onboard Volaris’ airplane when the request was
made.  Id., ¶63.  Defendants further breached their duty to
plaintiff in that they did not use reasonable care under the circumstances to
avoid causing harm to plaintiff in that it did not exercise due caution when
they told plaintiff to leave the aircraft without assistance, or without the
requested wheelchair, despite having knowledge, constructive or actual, of
plaintiff’s need for assistance.  Id., ¶64.  
Defendant
Volaris argues that this claim fails as a matter of law because it is a “duty
of care,” not a cause of action. 
Defendant contends that Civil Code §2100 provides a heightened standard
of care that arises out of the special relationship between a common carrier
and its passengers.  See Ingham v.
Luxor Cab Co. (2001) 93 Cal. App. 4th 1045, 1050-51 (“As
construed by the courts, Civil Code section 2100 elevates the duty of a common
carrier to its passengers to the higher, affirmative duty.”) (citation
omitted).  Defendant also argues that the
heightened standard of care does not apply because it only applies while the
passenger is in transit, and plaintiff was not in transit as she had exited the
plane safely. 
In
opposition, plaintiff argues that defendant has not cited to any authority that
this claim is not a cause of action.
In reply,
defendant reiterates its arguments.
The court
finds that defendant has met its burden of showing that plaintiff cannot
establish the elements, including a heightened duty, as Civil Code §2100 does
not apply as plaintiff was no longer in transit.  As argued by defendant, plaintiff was
delivered safely off the plane.  See also
DUMF 1, where plaintiff does not dispute that she exited safely from the
aircraft.  Plaintiff fails to meet her
burden of raising a triable issue of material fact.  Plaintiff presents no evidence to support her
allegations that plaintiff was “still onboard” when the request was made for a wheelchair.  Rather the evidence (see below) indicates
that plaintiff did not ask for a wheelchair while on board the plane and before
she exited.  Further, there is no
evidence that a Volaris employee told plaintiff to exit the aircraft without
assistance despite having knowledge of plaintiff’s purported need for
assistance. 
 
4th cause
of action for negligence (Gov. Code §§815.2, 815.4, 820(a), Civil Code §1714)
The SAC
alleges defendants’ employees, agents, and independent contractors, pursuant to
Gov. Code §§815.2, 815.4, and 820(a) and Civil Code §1714, owed a duty of care
to plaintiff to maintain, operate, patrol, service, facilitate, inspect, and/or
control the subject escalator in a reasonable manner.  SAC, ¶69. 
Defendants carelessly, negligently, and recklessly maintained, operated,
patrolled, serviced, facilitated, inspected, and/or controlled the escalator,
which was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s fall and injuries.  Id., ¶¶70-71. 
 
The SAC
also alleges that as to public employee negligence giving rise to vicarious
liability, defendants, while acting within the scope of their employment,
engaged in wrongful and/or negligent and/or careless and/or reckless and/or
unlawful conduct, namely in failing to provide plaintiff with medical devices
when requested, thereby causing plaintiff to fall on the subject escalator.  Id., ¶79. 
Defendants had a legal duty to maintain, operate, and control the escalator
in a reasonably safe manner.  Defendants
had a legal duty to ensure the safety of the passengers and others, including
plaintiff, using services of defendants. 
Id., ¶80.
Defendant
argues that this claim fails because the Government Code does not apply to
Volaris.  As for Civil Code §1714,
defendant contends, plaintiff cannot prove that Volaris maintained, operated,
patrolled, serviced, inspected, and/or controlled the subject escalator.
In
opposition, plaintiff argues that defendant has not met its initial burden.
The court
finds that defendant has met its burden of showing that plaintiff cannot
establish the elements, including any duty as to the escalator.  The SAC frames the issue on summary judgment
and plaintiff alleges that LAWA and the City managed, supervised, controlled,
and/or operated the escalator in Terminal 2. 
SAC, ¶¶14-15.  “’A defendant
moving for summary judgment may rely on the allegations contained in the
plaintiff’s complaint, which constitute judicial admissions.’”  Castillo v. Barrera (2007) 146 Cal.
App. 4th 1317, 1324 (citation omitted).  Also, plaintiff does not dispute that the
subject escalator was maintained and controlled by defendants City of LA and
Los Angeles World Airports.  DUMF 3.  As such, Volaris “’cannot be held liable for
the defective or dangerous condition of property which it [does] not own,
possess, or control.’”  Moses v.
Roger-McKeever (2023) 91 Cal. App. 5th 172, 179 (citation
omitted).  Plaintiff has failed to
present substantial evidence to raise a triable issue of material fact.
 
5th cause
of action for general negligence  
The SAC
alleges that defendants owed plaintiff a duty of care in their dealings with
plaintiff.  SAC, ¶87.  On the subject date, defendants negligently
and carelessly acted or failed to act when plaintiff requested and never
received a wheelchair following her arrival at the subject premises.  Id., ¶88. 
Defendants were informed by plaintiff in advance of her trip and fall on
the subject escalator that she required wheelchair assistance, to which end no
such wheelchair was ever produced and thereafter approximately 30 minutes
following her request, plaintiff was demanded by defendant to leave the area
she was in despite failing to provide her with the requisite services, namely a
wheelchair for ambulation assistance. 
Id., ¶90. 
Defendant
argues that plaintiff cannot meet her burden of proving that Volaris owed a
duty to provide her with a wheelchair because there was never a wheelchair
request made to Volaris for plaintiff.  At
her deposition on October 21, 2021, plaintiff testified that she did not book
her flight and never requested wheelchair service from Volaris.  Scott Cunningham decl., Exh. 3, at 29.  Defendant also presents deposition testimony
of Sonia Castillo (Volaris’ PMQ) who testified that there was no wheelchair
request noted in her Passenger Name Record with Volaris and that no passenger
requested a wheelchair.  She stated:  “I questioned both agents, and I asked them
if the passenger had requested a wheelchair. 
I personally went into the passenger’s PNR to verify whether a
wheelchair had been requested or not, and it was not.  And both agents confirmed that no passenger
requested a wheelchair upon exiting of the aircraft.”  Cunningham decl., Exh. 4, at 73-74.  According to the deposition testimony of
defendant SAS (wheelchair service provider at LAX), James Entsminger (SAS’ PMQ)
testified that there was no wheelchair request for plaintiff.  He stated, “We didn’t have any interaction
with Volaris concerning that passenger because they had no record of her and
neither did we.”  Cunningham decl., Exh.
5.  Defendant notes that plaintiff
alleges that “defendant Buenos either failed to inform . . . Volaris . . . of
the necessity of the subject disability and/or physical restriction
accommodation request, or failed to confirm that such a request had been
appropriately fulfilled . . . .”  SAC, at
¶¶92-93.  Defendant also presents the
deposition testimony of plaintiff where she responded, “no” when asked if she
“normally” used a wheelchair or cane. 
She also testified that she could walk without any assistance and would
walk for exercise and could walk “quite far” before needing to stop or sit
down.  Cunningham decl., Exh. 3.
Defendant
also argues that plaintiff cannot show that defendant’s purported breach to
provide wheelchair services was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s fall because
it was not foreseeable that plaintiff, who had no apparent need for a
wheelchair and is fully capable of walking would fall on a normally operating
escalator and that plaintiff’s decision to exit the aircraft, walk through LAX,
and use the subject escalator are intervening events that broke the chain of
causation.  See Johnson v. Northwest
Airlines (N.D. Cal. May 5, 2010) 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139808, which determined
that, “[a]ssuming for a moment that NWA failed to provide a wheelchair
immediately upon plaintiff’s disembarkment, plaintiff was injured only after
she waited for no more than twelve minutes before making the decisions (i) not
to wait for the wheelchair; (ii) to walk, unassisted; and (iii) to use a moving
walkway, a device she was unfamiliar with. 
In brief, these decisions, made solely by plaintiff, broke the chain of causation
as a matter of law. . . . These decisions . . . are intervening facts that
break the causal chain between defendant’s conduct and plaintiff’s injury.  No reasonable juror could conclude,
therefore, that plaintiff’s subsequent fall was the direct or proximate result of
NWA’s conduct.”  
In
opposition, plaintiff contends that plaintiff’s daughter, Azucena, arranged and
paid for plaintiff’s flight, and when she booked it, she requested a wheelchair
for her mother.  Plaintiff presents
evidence that the reservation receipt from the travel agency states, “Incluye
Silla de Rueda,” meaning “including a wheelchair.”  See Azucena Camacho decl.  Plaintiff argues that Volaris’ PMQ testimony
that there was no wheelchair request on plaintiff’s Passenger Name Record
“doesn’t prove that Azucena didn’t request a wheelchair for her mother; only
that Volaris failed to record the request.” 
Plaintiff also contends that her general [lack of] need for a wheelchair
is irrelevant as to whether one was requested for her on this particular
trip.  Plaintiff further argues that “it
was easily foreseeable that a person for whom a wheelchair was requested, but
not provided, might fall walking without one.” 
Plaintiff also asserts that the cases upon which Volaris relies are
federal cases.
The court
finds that defendant has met its burden of showing that plaintiff cannot
establish the elements of negligence, including as to breach and
causation.  Plaintiff has not presented
substantial evidence to raise a triable issue that Volaris was aware of the
wheelchair request.
 
6th cause
of action for negligent hiring (Gov. Code §§815.2, 815.4, 820(a), Civil Code §1714)  
The SAC
alleges that plaintiff was harmed by defendants and that defendants are
responsible for that harm because defendants negligently hired, supervised, or
retained defendants.  SAC, ¶100.  Defendants negligently hired employees as to
cause injuries and damages to plaintiff. 
Id., ¶101.  On June 20, 2018,
defendants’ staff failed to provide plaintiff with a wheelchair despite her
advance request for it.  Defendants’
staff asked plaintiff to start walking to the escalator, despite the
foreseeable risk that she would trip and fall due to defendants’ staff’s
failure to provide a wheelchair to plaintiff, which did cause her to trip and
fall.  Id., ¶102.  Defendants were unfit or incompetent to
perform the work for which they were hired, specifically providing adequate
service and assistance to plaintiff. 
Id., ¶103.  Defendants are
vicariously liable for the acts of their employees under Gov. Code §815.2.  Id., ¶106.
Defendant
contends that in response to defendant’s special interrogatories, she stated,
“[c]alls for expert opinion” when asked to state all facts that support her
contentions in paragraphs 89 and 90 as to whether Volaris’ supervisory or
administrative employee breached his or her duty or whether she was injured as
a direct legal cause of Volaris’ negligent hiring.  Cunningham decl., Exh. 6 (Response to Special
Interrogatories, Nos. 27, 28).  Defendant
also asserts that plaintiff did not produce any documents to support her
claim.  Cunningham decl., Exh. 7
(Response to Request for Production, No. 32). 
Defendant further points out that during Volaris’ PMK deposition, none
of the designated categories involved Volaris’ hiring or retention policies of
any of its employees.
In
opposition, plaintiff argues that defendant has not met its initial burden.
The court
finds that defendant has met its burden of showing that plaintiff cannot
establish the elements for negligent hiring. 
Plaintiff has not met her burden of raising a triable issue of material
fact.  Plaintiff does not even identify
any Volaris employee that purportedly acted negligently or caused her
injury.  She presents no evidence that
any Volaris employee was aware of a wheelchair request.
 
7th cause
of action for negligence per se 
The SAC
alleges that there were in force statutes, ordinances, and regulations
prohibiting the conduct exhibited by defendants.  SAC, ¶113. 
Plaintiff was a member of the class of persons for whose protection said
statutes, ordinances, and regulations were enacted or promulgated.  Id., ¶114. 
Defendants violated the traffic laws of City of LA and State of
California, which constituted negligence per se, including the Dept. of Motor
Vehicle’s Code.  Id., ¶115.
Defendant
argues that “negligence per se” is an evidentiary presumption and does not
state an independent cause of action.  Defendant
further argues that plaintiff cannot produce any evidence, admissible or
otherwise, of defendant’s violation of “traffic laws” or prove that there is a
substantial probability that plaintiff’s injury was caused by Volaris’
violation of these statutes.
In the
opposition, plaintiff agrees that this claim is not a separate cause of action.
The court
finds that defendant has met its burden of showing that plaintiff cannot
establish the elements as “negligence per se” is not a cause of action.  See Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Ctr. (2006)
140 Cal. App. 4th 1256, 1285 (“[T]o apply negligence per se is not
to state an independent cause of action. 
The doctrine does not provide a private right of action for violation of
a statute.”) (citation omitted); Turner v. Seterus, Inc. (2018) 27 Cal.
App. 5th 516, 534 (“’[T]he doctrine of negligence per se is not a
separate cause of action, but creates an evidentiary presumption that affects
the standard of care in a cause of action for negligence.’”) (citation
omitted).  Further, plaintiff has not
presented any evidence, much less substantial, to raise a triable issue of
material fact.
Accordingly,
the motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.
