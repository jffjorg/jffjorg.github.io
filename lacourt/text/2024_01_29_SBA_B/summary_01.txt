"The motion for summary judgment is GRANTED."
"The court finds that the 1st, 2nd, and 4th causes of action are barred under the Government Claims Act as they are based on allegations that the escalator itself was in a defective or dangerous condition."
"The court construes this claim as one for dangerous condition under Gov. Code §835."
"The court finds that defendants have met their burden that plaintiff cannot establish the elements for dangerous condition of public property, including that defendants had a duty to provide ‘warning’ signs or instructions as to how to use the escalator."
"The court finds that plaintiff cannot establish the elements for liability under Gov. Code §815.2."
