And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants in this case. The defendants' demurrer to the fourth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) is sustained with leave to amend. The demurrer to the fifth cause of action for private nuisance is sustained without leave to amend. The motion to strike the request for punitive damages is granted with leave to amend.

The Judge has given the plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint and has set an order to show cause (OSC) for October 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Case Management Conference has been continued to October 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The defendants are required to give notice of the OSC and the continued Case Management Conference.

The Judge's ruling is based on the legal standards for demurrers and motions to strike, as well as the specific allegations in the complaint. The Judge has determined that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to state a claim for IIED and that the request for punitive damages is conclusory and lacks specific factual allegations.
