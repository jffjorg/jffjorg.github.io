And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's waiver of jury trial was due to mistake, inadvertence, or neglect. The defendants have failed to show that they will be prejudiced by an order granting the plaintiff's motion for relief from the waiver. Therefore, the court grants the motion. The plaintiff's demand for jury trial was filed late, but the defendants had not yet prepared for a jury trial, and the plaintiff's counsel had not yet posted the jury fees. The court finds that the plaintiff's waiver was not intentional and that the defendants will not suffer prejudice from an order granting the motion. The motion is granted, and the plaintiff's jury trial demand is reinstated.
