And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in an expedited petition without a hearing. The petition was filed by Yingran Liu, the attorney for Yiping Liu, who suffered various injuries after hitting his head on the glass wall in a Defendant's inn. The settlement amount is $50,000, and the net balance of the proceeds is $23,600.65. However, the Court needs to deposit the net balance in a financial institution in California, but the Petitioner has not yet provided an address for such an institution. The Court has asked the Petitioner or their counsel to appear in court on February 6, 2024, to provide an address for the deposit.
