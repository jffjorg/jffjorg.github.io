And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition to approve the minor's compromise of Emma Silva's claims. The petition asks for approval of the compromise, but the judge finds that it does not provide sufficient information about the medical expenses incurred by Claimant. Specifically, the petition does not explain what happened to the portion of the medical expenses that Medi-Cal did not pay, and it does not provide documentation of any agreements with medical providers to waive their right to reimbursement. The judge also finds that the petition should explain whether any additional amounts of the total medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. Without this information, the judge cannot approve the petition. The judge orders the petitioner to provide the necessary information and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
