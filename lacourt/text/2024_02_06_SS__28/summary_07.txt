The judge has ruled that the subpoenas served by Arakelian Enterprises, Inc. dba Athens Services on insurance companies are overbroad and violate Plaintiff Randolph Requena's privacy rights. The subpoenas seek a wide range of medical records, including those unrelated to the injuries alleged in the complaint. The judge has granted Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas, finding that they are not reasonably related to the issues in the case and that Plaintiff has not waived his privacy rights. The judge has ordered Arakelian Enterprises, Inc. dba Athens Services to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the court.
