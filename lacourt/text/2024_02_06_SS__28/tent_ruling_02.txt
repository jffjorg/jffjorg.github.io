PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to compel Plaintiff to appear for a deposition and for sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action … without having
served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
A
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (a) shall
comply with both of the following: "(1) The motion shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. (2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the
deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(b).)  
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (g)(1), provides that if a motion
made under 2025.450 is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction in
favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the
party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
DISCUSSION 
On
September 19, 2023, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for October 6,
2023.  Plaintiff did not serve an
objection or inform Defendant that he could not appear.  Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel failed to
appear for the deposition on October 6, 2023 and Defendant’s counsel took a
certificate of non-appearance. Defendant attempted to meet and confer after the
deposition but received no response before filing this motion.

Court grants the motion.

requests sanctions of $1,126.00, consisting of $300.00 in attorney’s fees,
$60.00 in filing fees, $476.00 for the certificate of non-appearance, and $290.00
for the videographer.  Counsel spent two
hours to prepare the motion at a rate of $150.00 per hour. The Court grants the
request.

compel Plaintiff Henry Martinez’s deposition and orders Plaintiff to appear for
a deposition within 30 days of the hearing on this motion.   Defendant Jill
