And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Henry Martinez, filed an action against the defendant, Jill Renner, and others for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The defendant filed an answer and later filed a motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and for sanctions. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion.

The judge has granted the motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and has ordered the plaintiff to appear for a deposition within 30 days of the hearing. The defendant is to make all necessary arrangements to take the plaintiff's deposition by this deadline.

The judge has also granted the defendant's request for sanctions and has ordered the plaintiff and his counsel to pay the defendant $1,126.00 within 30 days of the hearing. The judge has based this decision on the defendant's failure to appear for the deposition and the plaintiff's failure to serve an objection or inform the defendant that he could not appear.
