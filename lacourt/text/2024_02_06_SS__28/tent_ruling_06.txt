PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Elizabeth Silva (“Petitioner”) asks the Court to approve the compromise of the
pending action of Emma Silva (“Claimant”). 
DISCUSSION 
Section
12 of the petition states that Claimant’s total medical expenses were
$127,869.24 and $10,708.96 of that amount was paid.  The petition states that Medi-Cal paid
the $10,708.96 and is requesting reimbursement of $6,886.05. 
However,
the petition does not explain what happened to the portion of the medical expenses
that Medi-Cal did not pay.  Did the
medical providers who provided $117,160.28 in treatment (the difference between
the $127,869.24 in total medical expenses and the $10,708.96 that Medi-Cal
paid) agree to waive their right to reimbursement of that amount or to accept a
reduced amount?  If so, Petitioner needs
to provide documentation of those agreements and include the amount of any
reductions in Section 12a(3) of the petition. 
Section 12a(3) currently states that the total medical expenses were not
subject to any negotiated, statutory, or contractual reductions. 
Section 12a(4) of the petition currently states that none of the medical
expenses will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  Yet at a minimum Section 12a(4) should
include the $6,886.05 which will be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds to
Medi-Cal, as the petition states in Section 12b(4)(c).  The petition also should explain whether
additional amounts of the total medical expenses will be paid or reimbursed
from the settlement proceeds and if not, why not.  
Section
14 of the petition states that Petitioner has paid or become obligated to pay
$6,886.05 in medical expenses, $187,500.00 in attorney’s fees, and $30,070.62 in
costs, and is requesting reimbursement for these amounts.  Petitioner should correct Section 14 or
explain why she paid or became obligated to pay these amounts. 
The
Court cannot approve the petition unless it shows that the minor’s compromise
will reimburse all of Claimant’s medical expenses that have not been reduced or
waived.  Currently, the petition fails to
show that $117,160.28 of the medical expenses have been waived or reduced or
will be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Emma Silva’s
claims filed by Petitioner Elizabeth Silva on January 26, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
