And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the hearing on the defendants' motion for attorney's fees and costs. The defendants are seeking $261,782.50 in attorney's fees and $18,202.80 in costs, but the judge is only allowing fees and costs incurred up to May 11, 2021, the date the court entered judgment for Valenzuela and Taglioli. The judge is requiring the defendants to submit a supplemental brief and declaration detailing the work done after May 11, 2021, excluding any work related to the cross-complaint.

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for attorney's fees and costs related to the Anaya and UHB cross-complaint. The judge ruled that Civil Code Section 1717(b)(2) prohibits an award of fees and costs when an action is voluntarily dismissed, even if the dismissal is allegedly in bad faith. The judge found that Anaya and UHB did not prevail on the cross-complaint when they voluntarily dismissed it on the eve of trial.
