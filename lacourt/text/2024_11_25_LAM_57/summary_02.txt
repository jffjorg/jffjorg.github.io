And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the upcoming court hearing on November 25, 2024. The plaintiff intends to play designated excerpts from the deposition of Mark E. Fleming, D.O., and the court has reviewed the defendant's filing regarding the plaintiff's designations. The defendant did not object to the designations, but instead made counter-designations. The court previously ruled on motions in limine regarding the statements of Carlos Turcios to CHP officer William Keeshan, IV, and excluded those statements. The court also intended to cite the Evidence Code Section 767, which allows leading questions to be asked of expert witnesses, and referenced a previous case, Chavez v. Zapata Ocean Resources, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal. App.3d 115, 124.
