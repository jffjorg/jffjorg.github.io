 Case Number:  20STCV15846    Hearing Date:   November 25, 2024    Dept:  57 Plaintiff stated at the close of the trial proceedings on November 22, 2024 that Plaintiffs intended to play designated excerpts from the deposition of Mark E. Fleming D.O and that therefore the Court should review Defendant's objections, if any, to those designations.  The Court has reviewed the Defendant's filing with respect to the Plaintiff's' designations to the Fleming deposition.  There are no objections in Defendant's filing, just counter-designations.At the close of the trial proceedings on November 22, 2024 the Court discussed with counsel for both sides the motions in limine that  were filed and ruled on regarding the statements of Carlos Turcios to CHP officer William Keeshan, IV on the night of the accident that gives rise to this action.  As a reminder, the Court granted Defendant's motion in limine # 10 to exclude Turcios's statements to Keeshan and denied Plaintiffs' motion in limine #8 to admit those statements. The Court had intended prior to recessing on November 22, 2024 to cite the provision of the Evidence Code that allows leading questions to be asked of expert witnesses.  It is in the Comment to Evidence Code Section 767.  See also Chavez v.
