And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to dismiss the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FAXC) filed by Jui Yuan Cheng, et al. against Cross-Defendant Peizhen Lin. The FAXC was filed over five years ago, and despite the fact that Lin was not served with the summons, cross-complaint, or FAXC, the FAXC was not dismissed. The judge finds that Lin has shown a basis for dismissing the FAXC pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 583.250, which requires that a complaint or cross-complaint be served within three years of the action being commenced. The judge also notes that the motion is unopposed, which leads to an inference that it is meritorious. Therefore, the FAXC is dismissed without prejudice as to Cross-Defendant Peizhen Lin, and Lin is ordered to give notice of the Court's ruling and file proof of service of same within five calendar days of this order.
