And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff's original complaint was filed on February 14, 2023, and the first amended complaint was filed on February 24, 2023. The plaintiff seeks to add causes of action and a defendant to the complaint. The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is well-taken because the first amended complaint fails to include necessary attachments for the causes of action alleged therein. The judge also agrees that there does not appear to be any indication that prejudice would result to any of the parties considering this action was only filed earlier this year. The judge construes the defendant's lack of opposition to the motion as a tacit admission that the motion is meritorious. The judge further finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently complied with the requirements of Rule 3.1324 of the California Rules of Court. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve the second amended complaint by November 21, 2023, and to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
