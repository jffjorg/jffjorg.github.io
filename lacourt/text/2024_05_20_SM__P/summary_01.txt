The Judge finds that it is inequitable for the defendant to pay the cancellation fee, as it was plaintiff's choice to take a job on the day of the IME instead of attending. The plaintiff is ordered to reimburse defense counsel for the cancellation fee within 30 days. Additionally, the Judge grants defendant's request for monetary sanctions of $840, representing the time spent preparing the motion and attending the hearing.
