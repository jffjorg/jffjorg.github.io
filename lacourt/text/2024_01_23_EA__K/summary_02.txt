And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The hearing on Automotive Credit Corporation's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is continued to February 6, 2024. The court notes that the motion is being made on the grounds that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant. The court will continue the hearing on the instant motion to February 6, 2024, as Plaintiffs' counsel has a motion to be relieved set for the same date, which is also the date set for trial. The court believes it is reasonable to continue the hearing until after the issue of representation has been determined. The court will vacate the February 6, 2024 trial date and will continue the hearing on the instant motion another 45-60 days if the motion to be relieved is granted on February 6, 2024.
