 Case Number:  23PSCV01436    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants
Wanda Moving, Inc.’s and 2Cube Global Inc.’s Demurrer to Cross-Complaint is SUSTAINED.
The court will hear from counsel for Plaintiff as to whether leave to amend is
requested, and as to which cause(s) of action, and will require an offer of
proof if so.
Background[1]  
Plaintiffs Wanda Moving, Inc. (“WMI”) and 2Cube Global Inc. (“2Cube”)
(together, “Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
Plaintiffs are in the business of
providing logistics and warehousing services for imports of goods from China to
the United States. 2Cube acts as a “3PL” or third party logistics provider for
WMI by procuring transportation services for delivery orders received by WMI.
Xiaojun Xu (“Xu”) was hired by 2Cube as a truck driver to deliver various goods
to customers. From approximately January 2023 to present, Xu conspired with Pak
Ho Lo (“Lo”), Swap Meet Depot (“SWAP”), MMS Depot (“MMS”) by stealing a portion
of goods belonging to Plaintiffs from each delivery and delivering same to a
warehouse in El Monte where SWAP and MMS are located.
On June 22, 2023, Lo and SWAP filed a cross-complaint,
asserting causes of action against Chaoseng Zhao, Shengdong Zhao (“S. Zhao”),
Liming Wang, 2Cube, Zexing Zhao (“Z. Zhao”), WMI and Does 1-200 for:
 
1.                 
Conversion
2.                 
Tortious Interference with Contractual Relationship
3.                 
Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic
Advantage
4.

5.                 
Unfair Business Practices
6.

7.

On June 28, 2023, MMS’ default was entered on the complaint.
On August 22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint, asserting causes of action against Xu, Lo, SWAP, MMS and Does 1-200
for:
1.

On August 24, 2023, an “Order Re: Defendants’ Contempt for
Defendants’ Failure to Abide by this Court’s May 24, 2023 and July 10, 2023
Orders” was entered.
On September 26, 2023, Intelligent Express Inc. (“Intelligent”)
and Xu filed a cross-complaint, asserting causes of action against WMI, 2Cube,
Derb Inc. and Does 1-50 for:
1.

2.

3.

On November 30, 2023, the court granted WMI’s, 2Cube’s, S.
Zhao’s and Z. Zhao’s Special Motion to Strike Lo’s and SWAP’s cross-complaint.
A Case Management Conference is set for March 11, 2024.
Legal Standard
A
demurrer may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or are uncertain.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).)
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a
plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant
of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer
does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded
therein, or facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which
a court may take judicial knowledge.” (S.
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations
omitted].)
Discussion
WMI and 2Cube demur, per Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10,
subdivisions (e) and (f), to the first through fourth causes of action in Intelligent’s and Xu’s cross-complaint, on the basis
that they fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and are
uncertain.
Meet and Confer
At the outset, the court notes that the instant demurrer was
originally set for hearing on January 2, 2024; on that date, the court
continued the hearing to January 23, 2024 based on counsel’s competing
declarations regarding whether an adequate meet and confer had transpired and
instructed moving party’s counsel to file a declaration in compliance with Code
of Civil Procedure § 430.41 “at least nine court days prior to the continued
hearing date” (i.e., January 9, 2023).
On January 10, 2024, WMI and 2Cube filed the “Declaration of
Heidi M. Cheng in Support of Cross-Defendants Wanda Moving Inc. and 2Cube
Global Inc.’s Demurrer to Cross-Complaint.” Although the declaration is
untimely, the court is satisfied that sufficient meet and confer efforts have
now transpired. The court will proceed to the merits of the demurrer.
First and Fourth Causes of Action (i.e., Breach of
Contract and Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Respectively)
WMI and 2Cube assert that Intelligent and Xu have not
adequately pled the existence of a written contract by alleging either its
terms or legal effect.
Intelligent and
Xu have alleged that Intelligent, a trucking company operated by Xu
(Cross-Complaint, ¶ 14), had an oral contract with WMI and 2Cube (Id., ¶
15); that Intelligent’s and Xu’s oral contract with WMI and 2Cube began in 2022
(Id., ¶ 16), wherein Intelligent would make various trailer deliveries
for WMI and 2Cube (Id., ¶ 17) and that, between January 2023 and
February 2023, WMI and 2Cube failed to pay Intelligent for deliveries that had
already been made (Id., ¶ 19). Intelligent and Xu have also alleged that
WMI and 2Cube entered into “a series of agreements” with Intelligent and Xu to
hire Intelligent and Xu for delivery services (Id., ¶ 60), which were “documented
with invoices and WeChat messages” (Id., ¶ 62); that WMI and 2Cube
timely made multiple deliveries from the period of January 2023 to February
2023 (Id., ¶ 61) and that WMI and 2Cube failed to pay Intelligent and Xu
“in the full amount of the oral contract.” (Id., ¶¶ 65).
The above
allegations indicate that Intelligent and Xu have not, in fact, alleged any written
contract. It is unclear, however, based on the above allegations how many oral
contracts Intelligent and Xu allege existed, the parties to same and the terms
of same.[2]
No translation has been provided for portions of the WeChat messages (which are
in large part illegible) attached as Exhibit D and various Bills of Lading
attached as Exhibit E to the cross-complaint, which is in violation of
California Rules of Court rule 3.1110, subdivision (g) (i.e., “[e]xhibits
written in a foreign language must be accompanied by an English translation,
certified under oath by a qualified interpreter”).
WMI’s and
2Cube’s demurrer to the first and fourth causes of action, then, is sustained.
Second Cause of Action (i.e., Conversion)
“Conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the
property of another. The elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the
plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the
defendant's conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and
(3) damages.” (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240 [internal
quotations and citation omitted]).
Intelligent and Xu have alleged that they had a right to
possess $53,500 “for the service rendered and confiscated trailer.”
(Cross-Complaint, ¶ 68). However, “the simple failure to pay money owed does not constitute
conversion. A cause of action for conversion of money can be stated only where
a defendant interferes with the plaintiff's possessory interest in
a specific, identifiable sum.” (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 284). Intelligent and Xu, moreover, do not seek to recoup
the trailer itself but to be paid monies for it.
WMI’s and
2Cube’s demurrer to the second cause of action is sustained.
Third Cause of Action (i.e., Unfair Business Practices)
WMI and 2Cube
assert that Intelligent’s and Xu’s third cause of action fails because
it is predicated on the same alleged conduct that is the subject of
Intelligent’s and Xu’s other, failed causes of action. The court agrees.
WMI’s and 2Cube’s demurrer
to the third cause of action is sustained.
