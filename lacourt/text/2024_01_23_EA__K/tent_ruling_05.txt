[1]              Petitioner erroneously represents,
in Paragraph 3(a), that Savannah’s claim “[i]s not the subject of a pending
action or proceeding.” Petitioner should have checked Paragraph 3(b) and
completed the information requested therein. The court does not find this error
fatal to its ruling.


[2]              Petitioner has not provided the
court with an Attachment 8, but has appended “Medical Bills & Reports” to
the petition, which is comprised of, inter alia, discharge instructions
from the Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center (“PVHMC”) Emergency Department
and an undated letter to Plaintiff’s counsel from Rosso, wherein Rosso reports
on his July 1, 2021 reconstructive plastic surgery examination of Savannah.
This is sufficient.
