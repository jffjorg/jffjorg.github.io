Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a motion for summary judgment filed by Alan Boudreau, a defendant in a case brought by Meritage Homes of California, Inc. The case involves allegations that Boudreau is an alter ego of Boudreau Pipeline Corporation (BPC), and that BPC is liable for damages caused by its alleged negligence. The Judge denies Boudreau's motion for summary judgment, finding that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to support its alter ego allegations against Boudreau. The Judge notes that the evidence presented by Boudreau is insufficient to establish that he is not an alter ego of BPC, and that the Plaintiff has shown that Boudreau's control over BPC is an important factor in determining whether Boudreau is an alter ego of BPC. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff has presented evidence that Boudreau personally chose to withhold material information from Meritage, and that Boudreau sold his interest in BPC in 2019 but maintained control over the company despite selling his interest.
