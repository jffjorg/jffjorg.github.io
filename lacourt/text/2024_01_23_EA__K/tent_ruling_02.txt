 Case Number:  22PSCV00143    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  K The hearing on Defendant
Automotive Credit Corporation’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is CONTINUED
to February 6, 2024 [see below].
Background[1]  
Plaintiffs Katherine Camacho and Victor Venegas (together, “Plaintiffs”) allege as
follows:
On August 7, 2021, entered into a Retail Installment Sales
Contract (“RISC”) with Sus Amigos Auto Center, Inc. (“Sus Amigos”), wherein Sus
Amigos sold Plaintiffs a 2016 Chevy Silverado, VIN #3GCPCRECXGG126689 (“subject
vehicle”). The RISC was subsequently assigned to Automotive Credit Corporation
(“ACC”). Right after purchasing the subject vehicle, Plaintiffs realized that
the subject vehicle’s transmission was defective. Plaintiffs took the subject
vehicle in for repairs and learned they would cost $5,000.00. Sus Amigos
refused to repair the subject vehicle.
On February 14, 2022,
Plaintiffs filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Sus Amigos,
ACC, American Contractors Indemnity Insurance Company (“ACIIC”) and Does 1-50
for:
1.                 
Violation
of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (v. Sus Amigos and ACC only)
2.                 
Violation
of Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (v. Sus Amigos only)
3.                 
Claim
Against Dealer Bond (v. ACIIC only)
On September 12, 2022,
Plaintiffs dismissed Sus Amigos, with prejudice. On September 14, 2022,
Plaintiffs dismissed ACIIC, with prejudice.
The Final Status
Conference is set for January 23, 2024. Trial is set for February 6, 2024.
Legal Standard
The rules governing demurrers are generally
applicable to a motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999;
Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (d) [“The grounds for motion. . . shall appear on
the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the court is
required to take judicial notice. Where the motion is based on a matter of
which the court may take judicial notice. . ., the matter shall be specified in
the notice of motion, or in the supporting points and authorities, except as
the court may otherwise permit”].)
A motion by a plaintiff may only be
made on the grounds “that the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a
cause or causes of action against the defendant and the answer does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
438, subd. (c)(1)(A).) A motion by a defendant may only be made on the grounds
that (1) “[t]he court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action
alleged in the complaint” or (2) “[t]he complaint does not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
438, subd. (c).)
Although a nonstatutory motion “may be
made at any time either prior to the trial or at the trial itself” (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th
644, 650 [quotation marks and citation omitted]), a statutory motion cannot be
made after entry of a pretrial conference order or 30 days before the initial
trial date, whichever is later, unless the court otherwise permits. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 438, subd. (e).)
Discussion
ACC moves the court,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 438 and the common law, for judgment on
the pleadings.
The court will
continue the hearing on the instant motion to February 6, 2024.
The court notes that
Plaintiffs’ counsel has a motion to be relieved set for February 6, 2024, which
is the same date set for trial. Plaintiffs’ opposition filed January 9, 2024
requests that the hearing on the instant motion be continued until after the
issue of representation has been determined. The court believes this request is
reasonable under the circumstances.
There have been no
prior trial dates set in the instant action, which was filed on February 14,
2022. The court will vacate the February 6, 2024 trial date. In the event the
motion to be relieved is granted on February 6, 2024, the court will continue
the hearing on the instant motion another 45-60 days in order to enable
Plaintiffs to obtain substitute counsel, if desired.
