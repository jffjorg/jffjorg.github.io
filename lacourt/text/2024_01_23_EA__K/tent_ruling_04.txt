372.)  California Rules of Court Rule 7.950 provides that a petition “must be

compromise.”  (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.)  Rule 7.950 states that the Petition must be

Discussion
Petitioner Desiree Delgado (“Petitioner”) seeks court
approval of a settlement between minor claimant Savannah Irene Valdez
(“Savannah”) and Apodaca in the total amount of $102,000.00. (Petition, ¶ 11).
Petitioner is Savannah’s parent. (Id., ¶ 1).[1]
The petition is executed by Petitioner. The petition
explains that on February 6, 2021, Savannah sustained lacerations to her left
chin and left cheek when she was attacked by dogs. (Id., ¶¶ 4-6). She
also sustained 14 scratches on her left arm, shoulder and wrist. (Id., ¶
6). Savannah was taken to Pomona Valley Hospital, where her lacerations were
cleaned, evaluated and sutured. (Id., ¶¶ 6 and 7). Savannah also
consulted with Dr. Ronald F. Rosso (“Rosso”) at Peninsula Plastic Surgery. (Id.,
¶ 7). Savannah has recovered completely from the effects of the aforementioned
injuries and there are no permanent injuries. (Id., ¶ 9).[2]
Apodaca (via Lemonade Insurance Company) has also offered to
pay Savannah $102,000.00. (Id., ¶ 10). Petitioner has failed to check
either Paragraph 11(a) or 11(b) (i.e., regarding “Settlement payments to
others”), though it appears Paragraph 11(a) should have been checked; the court
will request that counsel provide this information at the time of the hearing.
Savannah’s total medical expenses before any reductions are
$7,597.37. (Id., ¶ 12). Medi-Cal has agreed to accept reimbursement in
the amount of $247.87 in full satisfaction of its lien rights. (Id.,
Attachment 12b(4)(c).) Petitioner represents that the total of negotiated,
contractual or statutory reductions, is $6,374.48 and that $1,222.87 of the
total medical expenses will be paid from the proceeds (i.e., which includes
$247.87 to Medi-Cal and $975.00 to Peninsula Plastic Surgery). (Id., ¶
12).
The total amount of attorney’s fees for which court approval
is requested is $25,500.00. (Id., ¶ 13a.). This equates to 25% of the
total recovery. The total amount of expenses is $2,571.76. (Id., ¶
13b.). Petitioner has attached a declaration from Sergio F. Benedetto, as well
as a copy of the retainer agreement. The court has reviewed the declaration of Benedetto
and believes that 25% is an appropriate percentage for attorney’s fees here.
The net balance of proceeds for Savannah after payment of
all requested fees and expenses is $72,705.37, which will be deposited in an
insured blocked account at Wells Fargo Bank in Hesperia. (Id., ¶ 18,
Attachment 18a(3)(a).)
The court finds the settlement is fair and reasonable.
The petition is granted, subject to counsel’s provision of the information
requested above.
