Summary in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by Intelligent Express Inc. and Xiaojun Xu against Wanda Moving, Inc. and 2Cube Global Inc. The Judge finds that the cross-complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action for breach of contract, conversion, and unfair business practices. The Judge also notes that the cross-complaint does not provide an English translation for portions of the WeChat messages and Bills of Lading, which is a violation of California Rules of Court rule 3.1110. The Judge will hear further from counsel for Plaintiff as to whether leave to amend is requested and which causes of action are at issue, and will require an offer of proof if so.
