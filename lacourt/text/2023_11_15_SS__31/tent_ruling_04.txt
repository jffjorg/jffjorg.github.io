 Case Number:  21STCV39719    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  RAUL GOMEZ, Plaintiff(s),  vs.  GAREN AKLYAN, ET AL.,  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 21STCV39719  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTIONS TO COMPEL AND MOTION TO DEEM ADMISSIONS ADMITTED  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  November 15, 2023  I. Motions to Compel Defendant Garen Aklyan (“Defendant”) propounded form interrogatories, set two, on Plaintiff Raul Gomez (“Plaintiff”) on July 26, 2023.  (Mendoza Decl. ¶ 3; Exh. A.) After receiving no response by August 29, 2023, defense counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the outstanding discovery responses on September 5, 2023 and October 15, 2023. (Id. at ¶¶ 3-6.) As of the date of filing, Plaintiff has not served responses. (Id. at ¶ 7.) Defendant therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  Any opposition was due on or before November 1, 2023. No opposition was filed.  For a motion to compel discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)   Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to respond, Defendant’s motions is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendant Garen Aklyan’s form interrogatories, set two, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (CCP § 2030.290(a),(b).)  II. Motion To Deem Admitted Defendant Garen Aklyan (“Defendant”) propounded requests for admissions (“RFAs”), set two, on Plaintiff Raul Gomez (“Plaintiff”) on July 26, 2023. (Mendoza Decl. ¶ 3; Exh. A.) After receiving no response by August 29, 2023, defense counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the outstanding discovery responses on September 5, 2023 and October 15, 2023. (Id. at ¶¶ 3-6.) As of the date of filing, Plaintiff has not served responses. (Id. at ¶ 7.) Defendant therefore seeks an order deeming the RFAs, set two, admitted and imposing sanctions.  As of November 1, 2023, no opposition has been filed. Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission under CCP § 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to Defendant’s motion, nor has Plaintiff otherwise demonstrated that Plaintiff has served, before the hearing on the motion, a response to the RFAs.  Accordingly, Defendant Garen Aklyan’s RFAs, set two, is deemed admitted against Plaintiff. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)     III. Sanctions Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿ Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition is filed pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Further, “It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  (CCP § 2033.280(c).) Defendant requests $600 for each motion.  Defendant is awarded 1 hour to prepare each motion and one hour to appear at the hearing, all at the reasonable rate of $180 per hour, for a total of $540 in attorney fees. Further, Defendant is awarded two motion filing fees of $60, for a total of $120 as costs.      Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally. Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $660, within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 14th day of November 2023      Hon.
