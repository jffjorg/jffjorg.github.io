The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling granting the unopposed motion to deem admissions admitted against Plaintiff Cheuk Ying Lam. Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. propounded requests for admissions on August 10, 2023, and Plaintiff Lam failed to respond. As a result, Uber moved to deem the admissions admitted. The Judge has determined that the motion is granted, as Plaintiff Lam did not serve a substantially compliant response to the requests for admissions. The Judge has ordered the admissions to be deemed admitted against Plaintiff Lam, and has given notice to the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
