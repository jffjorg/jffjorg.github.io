And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the defendant, Garen Aklyan. The motions are to compel the plaintiff, Raul Gomez, to respond to outstanding discovery requests and to deem admitted the plaintiff's failure to respond to requests for admissions.

The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to respond to the defendant's discovery requests and requests for admissions, despite being properly served and receiving multiple emails from the defendant's counsel regarding the outstanding responses. As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion to compel and orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 15 days.

The judge also grants the defendant's motion to deem admitted the plaintiff's failure to respond to the requests for admissions and imposes sanctions on the plaintiff and their counsel for failing to respond. The sanctions include attorney fees, costs, and a monetary penalty of $660.

The judge encourages the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement, and if not, to submit their arguments to the court by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
