And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petition for approval of compromise filed by Petitioner Barak Volner, et al. on behalf of minor Z.V. The Court has also considered the request to seal the petition due to confidential medical and financial information. However, the Court is unable to evaluate the merits of the request to seal and the petition because it is unclear whether the petition filed on September 27, 2023 is the redacted or unredacted version. Therefore, the Court will continue the Hearing to allow for the lodging of the redacted and unredacted versions of the petition. Petitioner must provide both versions to the Court for consideration. The Court will also excuse the personal appearance of Claimant Z.V. and the guardian ad litem, and counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.
