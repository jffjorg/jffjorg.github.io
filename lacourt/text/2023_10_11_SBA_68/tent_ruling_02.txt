et al. vs. ADB Global Trade, LLC, et al.; Case No. 23STCV11602
MOVING PARTY: Defendant M S International,
Inc.
RESPONDING PARTIES: Plaintiffs Wendy
Viridiana Solano-Claustro, et al.
Demurrer to Complaint with Motion to Strike
I.
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiffs are the family members of
Decedent Jose Raul Garcia-Leon (“Decedent”). Plaintiffs have alleged that
Defendant M S International, Inc. (Defendant) and the other Defendants in this
case are fabricators of “toxic” stone products that the Decedent worked with
throughout his career in the construction industry from 1996 to 2022.
Plaintiffs allege that the Decedent developed silicosis and other injuries from
which he died on February 16, 2023, and that the silicosis was a result of
working with the stone products.
            Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding
Defendant are that it is a fabricator of at least 12 stone products that the
Decedent worked with. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendant put out a
misleading Safety Data Sheet about the stone products. There is no indication
whether Defendant made any products that the Decedent actually used in his
construction business.
            Plaintiffs have alleged five causes
of action in their First Amended Complaint (FAC). Defendant demurs to
Plaintiffs’ Fourth Cause of Action for Fraudulent Concealment. Plaintiffs
oppose the demurrer.
II. ANALYSIS 
A. The Demurrer
As a
general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
Where a
demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the
plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC
(2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
1.    Fourth Cause of Action for Fraudulent
Concealment 
Defendant demurs to the Fourth Cause of Action on
the basis that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action and is uncertain.
Causes of action sounding in fraud are subject to
strict pleading requirements. “Every element of a cause of action for fraud
must be alleged both factually and specifically, and the policy of liberal
construction of pleadings will not be invoked to sustain a defective
complaint.” (Cooper v. Equity Gen. Ins. Co. (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1252,
1262.)
A fraud claim based on a failure to disclose
material facts must be alleged with the same particularity as any other fraud
claim. (Weinstock v. Eissler (1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 212, 228. [“[W]here
fraud is the gravamen of the cause of action . . . the same particularity in
pleading is required.”]; Community Cause v. Boatwright (1981) 124
Cal.App.3d 888, 900 [“When a plaintiff alleges the fraudulent concealment of a
cause of action, the same pleading and proof is required as in fraud cases.”].)
To state a cause of action for fraudulent
concealment, the plaintiff must allege that: (1) the defendant concealed or
suppressed a material fact; (2) the defendant was under a duty to disclose the
fact to the plaintiff; (3) the defendant intentionally concealed or suppressed
the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff; (4) the plaintiff was
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the
concealed or suppressed fact; and (5) as a result of the concealment or
suppression of the fact, the plaintiff sustained damage. (Marketing West,
Inc. v. Sanyo Fisher (USA) Corp. (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 603, 612-13.)
In Plaintiffs’ opposition, they cite extensively to Jones
v. ConocoPhillips (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187. They cite this case to support
their argument that a cause of action for fraudulent concealment in a situation
such as this does not need to be as specific as other fraud cases.
While Plaintiffs’ FAC states that Defendant concealed
the danger of the stone products that the Decedent was working with, Plaintiffs
have not pled facts that state that Defendant was under a duty to disclose this
information. Plaintiffs have also not pled facts stating that Defendant
intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the
Decedent. Plaintiffs have also not pled with any specificity when the Decedent was
exposed to Defendant’s products in particular. The only information given in
the FAC about Defendant is quotes from Defendant’s Safety Date Sheet. (FAC, ¶¶ 520-524.)
As currently pled, Plaintiffs’ FAC appears to be
theoretical. Plaintiffs do not point to any instance when the Decedent worked
with Defendant’s products in particular. Without pleading that the Decedent specifically
worked with Defendant’s products, Plaintiffs cannot plead that the decedent was
damaged by Defendant or that Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty.
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Fourth Cause of
Action is sustained with leave to amend.
B. Motion to Strike
Defendant has moved for the Court to strike Paragraphs
458, 479, 562, 459, 480, 563, 460, 564, and 481 from Plaintiffs’ FAC in their
entirety. Defendant has also moved to strike Plaintiffs’ request for punitive
damages in item 6 of Plaintiffs’ Prayer for Relief on p. 234 of the FAC.
If these items applied just to Defendant M S
International, they could be stricken. However, the paragraphs at issue say
“Defendants” and do not name M S International specifically, so these
paragraphs could still apply to the other Defendants. Additionally, the majority
of the paragraphs which Defendant has indicated fall under causes of action to
which Defendant did not demur. Paragraphs 562-564, while they fall under the
Fourth Cause of Action heading, do not name M S International specifically.
There is no reason to strike these paragraphs at this time. The request for
punitive damages may also still apply to other Defendants.
Defendant’s motion to strike is denied.
III. ORDER
1.   
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Fourth
Cause of Action is sustained with leave to amend.
2.   
Defendant’s motion to strike is denied.
3.   
Plaintiffs are given 20 days to amend the
complaint.
