Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a demurrer to a complaint and a motion to strike. The case involves allegations of fraudulent concealment by the defendant, ADB Global Trade, LLC, and its affiliates, including M S International, Inc. The plaintiff, Wendy Viridiana Solano-Claustro, et al., alleges that the defendant concealed the danger of the stone products that the decedent, Jose Raul Garcia-Leon, worked with throughout his career in the construction industry.

The Judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's Fourth Cause of Action for Fraudulent Concealment with leave to amend. The Judge found that the plaintiff's complaint fails to plead facts that state that the defendant was under a duty to disclose the information and that the defendant intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the decedent.

The Judge has also denied the defendant's motion to strike certain paragraphs from the plaintiff's complaint. The Judge found that the paragraphs at issue may still apply to other defendants and that there is no reason to strike them at this time.

The Judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint and has set a hearing date for October 11, 2023.
