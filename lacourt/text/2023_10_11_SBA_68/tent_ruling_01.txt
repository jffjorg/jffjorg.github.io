Motion
            On June 22,
2023, Petitioner Jeffer Mangels Butler & Mitchell LLP (JMBM) entered into a
Stipulation to Enter Arbitration Award with Respondent Coachella Sports &
Entertainment Stadium Authority, LLC (Respondent). In the Stipulation, the
parties agreed to the entry of an arbitration award in favor of JMBM and
against Respondent in the amount of $121,372.99, which is the amount of the
outstanding legal fees and costs plus interest and certain costs of the
arbitration. (Sedor Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. 2.)
            On August
8, pursuant to the Stipulation and a subsequent agreement between the parties,
the Arbitrator entered a Stipulated Arbitration Award in favor of JMBM in the
amount of $121,372.00 plus $1,250.00 in Arbitrator’s fees paid by Petitioner on
Respondent’s behalf, for a total amount of $122,622.99. (Sedor Decl., ¶ 5; Ex.
3.)
            JMBM filed
this motion pursuant to CCP §§ 1286 and 1287.4, which allow the Court to
confirm the arbitration award and enter judgment in conformity with the award. None
of the conditions outlined in CCP § 1286.2 that would require the vacation of
the award are present.
            Therefore,
the Court orders the award confirmed, and judgment is entered in favor of
Petitioner JMBM in the amount of $122,622.99.

party to give notice.
