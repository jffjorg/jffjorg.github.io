And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case, stating that the matter cannot be decided solely on the basis of the new papers filed by the plaintiff. The Judge is concerned that the introduction of new evidence close to the hearing date deprives the defendant of due process and prevents the case from being resolved in a timely manner. The Judge notes that the plaintiff's filing included a lengthy brief and declaration, as well as exhibits, which the defendant objects to. The Judge is inclined to continue the matter and will discuss with the parties a supplemental briefing schedule and the date of the hearing. The Judge suggests that the defendant may file a brief with evidence, and the plaintiff may file a sur-reply without evidence, unless a strong showing can be made that new evidence on reply is necessary and proper.
