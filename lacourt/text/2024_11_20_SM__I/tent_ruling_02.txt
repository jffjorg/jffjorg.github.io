 Case Number:  20SMCV00872    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  I The court had been prepared to rule on this matter, but on
Monday plaintiffs filed new papers.  They
included a nine page brief, a two page attorney declaration, a 12 page
declaration from King, and exhibits. 
Defendants object to the reply.
 
What is clear to this court is that the matter cannot be
decided on ex parte papers.  What
the court had thought was simple has become complex and the court does not
believe it comports with due process to throw papers at the court in this
manner.  Had the reply been one to the
legal arguments made in the opposition, the court would have moved
forward.  The court is and has been
concerned that defendants have been fighting a delaying action and that the
exigency is that every time there is a delay defendants find one more way to
delay a sale that should have taken place a year ago.  
 
New evidence presented in this manner does deprive
defendants of due process.  It is one
thing to have late argument; that happens all the time and lawyers are used to
it.  But it is another to have evidence
thrown at the court and the opposing side that close to a hearing where the
other side has no opportunity to respond to the evidence.  That is the situation here.  But having said that, the papers do suggest,
and not without force, that defendants have acted improperly and unethically in
this case.  The court is making the
statement as to defendants, not their counsel, about which the court makes no
comment at this time, positive or negative.
 
The court will therefore CONTINUE the matter.  The court will discuss with the parties the
supplemental briefing schedule and date of the hearing.  Right now, the court is inclined to allow
defendant to file one brief with evidence and plaintiff to file a sur-reply without
evidence unless a strong showing can be made that new evidence on reply is
necessary and proper.
