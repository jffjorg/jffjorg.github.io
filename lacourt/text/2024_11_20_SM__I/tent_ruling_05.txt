 Case Number:  23SMCV01867    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  I The motion for leave to amend is DENIED.  First, as to the Song-Beverly cause of
action, amendment is futile.  As our
Supreme Court very recently held, the statute does not apply to the purchase of
a used car, even if it is still under warranty. 
(Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (Oct. 31, 2024) ___ Cal.5th ____.)  While the court can forgive plaintiff for not
citing to the Supreme Court’s decision given that it was so recent, the court
has no idea why plaintiff did not at least alert the court to the fact that the
issue was under review by the Supreme Court and that the Court of Appeal had
gone the other way.
 
Plaintiff might also be trying to add a breach of warranty
cause of action.  That might be more
proper were plaintiff to conform to the rules regarding amended complaints
found in the California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324.
