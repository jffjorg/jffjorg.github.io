And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to amend the complaint. The ruling states that the proposed amendment to the Song-Beverly cause of action is futile because the statute does not apply to the purchase of a used car, even if it is still under warranty, as recently held by the California Supreme Court in Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC. The court also notes that the plaintiff failed to alert the court to the fact that the issue was under review by the Supreme Court and that the Court of Appeal had gone the other way. The judge suggests that the plaintiff may be trying to add a breach of warranty cause of action, but notes that the plaintiff must conform to the rules regarding amended complaints found in the California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324.
