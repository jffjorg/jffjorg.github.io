 Case Number:  24SMCV00447    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  I Although the proposed cross-complaint seems a bit over-pled,
the motion is GRANTED.  The proposed
cross-complaint appears to be compulsory. 
As such, leave must be granted unless there is bad faith.  The court sees no bad faith here.  The unopposed motion is therefore
GRANTED.  Cross-defendants will have the
time allowed by law to answer or otherwise respond.
