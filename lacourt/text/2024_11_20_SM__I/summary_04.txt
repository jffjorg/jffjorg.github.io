```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss and award fees brought by cross-defendant Fenske against cross-complainant. The motion is based on the California Civil Code requirement that a party suing a licensed architect for malpractice must file a Certificate of Merit, which certifies that counsel has consulted with a licensed architect and obtained an opinion that there was professional negligence. The judge reminds the parties that there are statutes governing briefing and warns that unauthorized briefs will be stricken and sanctions imposed. The judge agrees that the dismissal would only affect causes of action for professional negligence, but notes that other causes of action may also be affected. The judge will need to determine if the cross-complaint ought to be dismissed in full or only in part before considering the fee motion. Fenske is seeking $10,725 in fees, which would be joint and several liability, but the judge notes that Fenske is not entitled to fees for his own time. The judge will need to consider the scope of the Certificate of Merit and whether certain allegations of fraud are covered by the Certificate.
