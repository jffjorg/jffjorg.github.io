And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's 8 untimely in limine motions, citing the court's rules on notice procedures. The judge notes that the parties cannot stipulate to alternative schedules without court approval. The judge also denies certain motions to exclude evidence, finding that they lack specificity or fail to identify specific evidence.

The judge grants some motions in part, allowing evidence related to settlement offers and mediation discussions to be introduced. The judge also rules that certain documents from mediation are admissible, subject to agreement from all parties involved.

The judge notes that the parties have not produced certain documents and orders the production of those documents. The judge also denies a motion to exclude expert testimony, finding that the witnesses can testify to their preparation for the underlying case.

Finally, the judge declares that the case is not ready for trial, citing incomplete FSC materials, and sets a new trial date for after the holidays.
