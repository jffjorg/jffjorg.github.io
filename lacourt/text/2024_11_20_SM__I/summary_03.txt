And here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively denied the plaintiff's application to schedule an emergency IDC and, if necessary, an emergency motion to compel. The plaintiff claims that the defendants' discovery responses, served on October 28, 2024, were inadequate and that documents that should have been provided were not provided. However, the judge finds that the discovery motion was not filed in a timely manner, as it was filed after the 15-day deadline before the trial date. The judge also expresses uncertainty about why the plaintiff waited until the eve of trial to seek this information and is unwilling to grant an ex parte application on a guess. Additionally, the judge notes that the parties were warned about the importance of compliance with the FSC and trial requirements, but failed to follow the court's advice. The judge expects compliance with the FSC order, which includes the filing of the exhibit list by the scheduled deadline.
