And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendants' motion to strike portions of the first amended complaint (FAC) filed by the plaintiffs. The defendants had moved to strike 16 portions of the FAC, alleging that the plaintiffs did not have sufficient facts to support punitive damages. However, the court found that the allegations in the FAC do not solely relate to punitive damages and that the plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support a demand for punitive damages. The court also found that the defendants' arguments that the plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient because they do not adequately identify which defendant did what are unfounded. The court concluded that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the defendants' actions rise to the level of malice, oppression, or fraud required for punitive damages. The court further found that the plaintiffs have alleged an adequate basis for holding each defendant liable for punitive damages. The defendants are ordered to answer the FAC within 20 days.
