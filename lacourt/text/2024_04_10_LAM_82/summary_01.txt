And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the plaintiffs' ex parte application for a temporary restraining order. The court found that it has no authority to intervene in religious matters relating to the management and operation of a religious institution. The court also found that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate sufficient irreparable harm in the impending or contemplated actions by the board. Finally, the court found that the balancing of the equities did not favor the plaintiffs. The court denied the application and ordered the plaintiffs' counsel to provide notice and file proof of such with the court.
