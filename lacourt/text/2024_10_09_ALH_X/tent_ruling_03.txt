 Case Number:  22AHCV00421    Hearing Date:   October 9, 2024    Dept:  X Plaintiff’s  Motion for Attorney Fees   On June 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint against  Defendant General Motors, LLC which included a claim for Violation of  Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act-Civil Code §1790 et seq.  Plaintiff, having accepted Defendant’s CCP Section  998 Offer to Compromise, now moves for an order that determines the reasonable  attorneys’ fees payable to Plaintiff by Defendant General Motors.  Plaintiff states its attorneys’ fees are in  the amount of $42,091.50, a 1.35 multiplier enhancement on the attorney fees  ($14,732.03), costs in the amount of $3,484.68, and an additional $3,500 for  Plaintiff’s counsel to review the opposition, draft a reply, and attend the  hearing on this motion.   The Court GRANTS the motion in the amount of $29,835.00 and  costs in the amount of $3,484.68.  In  total, Plaintiff is awarded $33,319.68 in attorney fees and costs.   Evidentiary Objections   In  Plaintiff’s reply papers, Plaintiff’s counsel Castro filed evidentiary  objections to the Pappas Declaration.  The  objections are overruled.    Legal Analysis   Generally, each party is responsible for their attorney fees  unless a statute or contract provides otherwise for the prevailing party.  (Eden Township Healthcare Dist. v. Eden  Medical Center (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 418, 425.)  In determining which party is the prevailing  party, trial courts may consider all factors reasonably indicating success in  the litigation but may not abuse their discretion and deny fees arbitrarily.  (Sears v. Baccaglio (1998) 60  Cal.App.4th 1136, 1149, 1155, 1158.)  A  court abuses its discretion by denying fees where the party obtained a  “‘simple, unqualified win,’” and the results were not mixed.  (Pacific Custom Pools, Inc. v. Turner  Construction Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1254, 1268-1271.)   “[T]he starting point of every fee award…must be a  calculation of the attorney’s services in terms of the time he has expended on  the case.  Anchoring the analysis to this  concept is the only way of approaching the problem that can claim objectivity,  a claim which is obviously vital to the prestige of the bar and the courts.”  (In re Vitamin Cases (2003) 110  Cal.App.4th 1041, 1058.)  “[T]he primary  method for establishing the amount of ‘reasonable’ attorney fees is the  lodestar method.  The lodestar (or  touchstone) is produced by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended  by counsel by a reasonable hourly rate.”   (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92Cal.App.4th 819, 833.)  Under this approach, a base amount is  calculated from a compilation of time reasonably spent and reasonable hourly  compensation of each attorney.  (Serrano  v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 639.)   While “a fee request ordinarily should be documented in great detail,”  the absence of time records and billing statements did not deprive the court of  “substantial evidence” to support an award when the attorney provided a  declaration under the penalty of perjury which described the work and permitted  the trial court to make its own evaluation of the reasonableness of the work  done in light of the nature of the case and on the credibility of counsel’s  declaration.  (Weber v. Langholz (1995)  39 Cal.App.4th 1578, 1587.)   Here, it is undisputed that Plaintiff is the prevailing  party.  Further, Section 1794,  subdivision (a) authorizes the recovery of damages and other legal and  equitable relief when the action involves a buyer of consumer goods that is  damaged by an implied or express warranty of a contract.  Section 1794, subdivision (d) further  authorizes the recovery of attorney’s fees “based on actual time expended,  determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in  connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.”  (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)   Plaintiff’s counsel, Payam Shahian, declares the rates of  attorneys at his firm Strategic Legal Practices, APC, are reasonable.  In Shahian’s Declaration, he lists numerous  cases where the courts approved the plaintiff’s requested lodestar and hourly  rates, ranging from $325 to $695 per hour.    The opposition complains the requested fees and costs are  unreasonably excessive and cites three main reasons to significantly reduce  Plaintiff’s counsel’s fee requests:   1.      Counsel’s  repeated use of templated filings shows that this was a routine lemon law case,  and the counsel’s litigation-by-template strategy was evident from the first  filing to the last, which is incongruent with the claimed fees.  2.      Counsel  fails to show that a multiplier is warranted in this straightforward  single-vehicle lemon law case, as fee multipliers are reserved only for truly  exceptional situations.  The counsel  recycled templated discovery, correspondence, and in-limine motions used in  every Song-Beverly Act against GM, despite billing this case as if the work  were original or unique.  3.      Counsel  should not benefit from inefficiencies that resulted from the excessive number  of billing timekeepers.  If the counsel’s  fee motion were granted in full, with the requested enhancement, they would be  awarded a total of $60,323.53, which GM argues is unreasonably excessive for  this case.  The opposition argues a  non-complex lemon law matter such as this, where not a single deposition was  taken, which never went to trial, and settled within statutory limits, does not  command such a fee recovery.    A reasonable hourly rate is determined by the prevailing  rate charged to attorneys of similar skill and experience in the relevant  community.  (See PLCM Group, Inc. v.  Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)   However, the court may also consider the attorney’s skill and expertise,  the nature of the work performed, the relevant area of expertise and the  attorney’s customary billing rates.  (Flannery  v. California Highway Patrol (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 632.)  The court is the best judge of the value of  professional services provided and may use its discretion to apply rates in  line with the market rates for the services provided.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th  1122, 1132.)  Based on the Court’s  knowledge and experience, it determines that $450.00 represents a reasonable  hourly rate.   As to the number of hours expended in prosecuting this  action, Plaintiff attached the billing records to the Shahian Declaration as  Exhibit 20.  Plaintiff’s motion argues  his victory was obtained after two years of litigation which would not have  been possible without the efforts of counsel, which included propounding and  responding to discovery requests, filing and opposing motions, and responding  to Defendant’s demurrers.    A court “must carefully review attorney documentation of  hours expended” to determine whether the time reported was reasonable.  (See Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th  at p. 1132 [quoting Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48].)  Thus, evidence provided by the fee applicant  “should allow the court to consider whether the case was overstaffed, how much  time the attorneys spent on particular claims, and whether the hours were  reasonably expended.”  (Christian  Research Inst. v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320.  The court must exclude “duplicative or  excessive” time from its fee award.  (Graciano  v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 161; see  also Ketchum, supra, at p. 1132 [stating “inefficient or  duplicative efforts [are] not subject to compensation.”].)   The billing records submitted by Plaintiff’s counsel  indicate that the attorneys expended 78.8 hours.  (Shahian Decl., Exh. 20.)  In reply, co-counsel Christian R. Castro  declares he has spent over 9.3 hours preparing the reply brief, evidentiary  objections, his declaration, and the response to Defendant’s time entry  objections; his rate is $475 per hour.  (Castro Decl. (Reply), ¶ 6.)   The opposition argues Plaintiff’s fee demand should be  reduced by at least 44.5 hours ($23,474.14) and reduced further by 20% to  remove the padding caused by overstaffing the case.  Further, Defendant argues the entire amount of  $3,484.68 in claimed costs should be disallowed because Plaintiff’s counsel has  not filed a memorandum of costs nor provided evidence to support the claimed  costs beyond the billing records in Exhibit 20 of the Shahian Declaration.  Thus, Defendant concludes Plaintiff should  only be awarded attorney’s fees in the amount of $14,893.89.   The court has discretion to apply a reduction in hours for  duplicative and or excessive billing. Proper factors to consider in applying a  negative reduction are the lack of complexity, that the matter did not go to  trial, that named partners were doing work that could have been done by  lower-billing attorneys, and that all the attorneys were doing work that could  have been done by paralegals, thus applying a 39% reduction in the lodestar.  (Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019)  41 Cal.App.5th 24, 41.)  The Court finds  that the reasonable hours spent by counsel are 66.3.  In making this determination, the Court finds  that Plaintiff’s counsel billed for some clerical tasks and that certain  billings were excessive.  This includes  excessive billing for telephonic/remote appearances and drafting boilerplate documents.  Attorney fees are awarded in the amount of $29,835.00.     Finally, on the issue of costs, Civil Code section 1794,  subdivision (d) states, “If the buyer prevails in an action under this section,  the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a  sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,…, determined by the  court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the  commencement and prosecution of such action.   The Court awards $3,484.68 for recoverable costs. Moving Party is to give notice.
