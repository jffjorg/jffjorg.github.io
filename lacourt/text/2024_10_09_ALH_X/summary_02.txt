Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admission (RFAs) admitted and an order to show cause hearing re: striking the Defendant's answer and cross-complaint. The Court notes that a substitution of attorney has been filed as to the Defendant Mile High Cure Corp, but not as to the Cross-Complainant Mile High Cure Corp. The Plaintiff's motion to deem RFAs admitted is denied as moot since the Defendant has served objection-free responses prior to the hearing. However, the Court grants the Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $598.50 due to the necessity in having to file the instant motion to secure responses. The sanctions are payable by the Defendant Mile High to the Plaintiff's counsel and are due within 30 days of mailing of a notice of ruling.
