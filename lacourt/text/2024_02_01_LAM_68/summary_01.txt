And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 21STCP00191, a hearing on an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re: Contempt. The case involves a dispute between petitioners Chul Lim Choe, et al. and respondents Pressed Down, LLC, et al. over the renewal of mining claims and payment of annual claim mining fees to the Bureau of Land Management. The respondents have filed an application for OSC re: Contempt and Sanctions, alleging that the petitioners have violated a court order and appellate opinion.

The Judge notes that the court only assumed new assignment approximately two weeks before the instant hearing, and remains unclear on the current state of the action. The Judge prefers the parties to update the court on the state of the settlement and "Plan of Operation" at the time of the hearing, or subsequently ordered written brief(s). The Judge will continue the hearing for 45 to 60 days to allow the parties to update the court.

The Judge also notes that the motion for an order to show cause appears to remain as a request for the setting of a contempt hearing, rather than an actual contempt hearing. The Judge will give notice to the respondents and set a hearing date in the future.
