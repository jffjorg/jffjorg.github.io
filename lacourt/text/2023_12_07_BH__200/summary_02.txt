  - "The Court recognizes that ODS' position is that Lucanish has already waived his right to put on such evidence where he elected to rest instead of putting on the evidence, he had indicated earlier he intended to present."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in anticipation of the next hearing. The court finds that ODS has established its case and that Lucanish has failed to prove his claims of wrongdoing. The court rejects Lucanish's argument that ODS' correction to its financial statements was untimely or prejudicial, and finds that Lucanish waived his right to seek an order disallowing the correction. The court also finds that the FACC was not premised on a mistake, but rather on ODS' intentional reduction of its NOI. The court will consider the parties' competing claims on ODS' complaint and Lucanish's FACC in the jury trial. The court also notes that the parties' trial briefs addressed issues that are no longer at issue, and that the court's ruling may impact ODS' complaint and its allegation that it properly terminated Lucanish based on his having taken more in advances on bonuses than he was entitled to.
