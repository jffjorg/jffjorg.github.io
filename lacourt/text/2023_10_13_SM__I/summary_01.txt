Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion to confirm an arbitration award in favor of Pan. Kapur, the opposing party, argues that the court lacks jurisdiction to confirm the award because Kapur has appealed the denial of the petition to vacate the award. The Judge finds that Kapur's appeal is faulty and that the court has jurisdiction to confirm the award. The Judge notes that Pan could have brought a cross-motion to confirm the award and that Pan's failure to do so may have contributed to the jurisdictional issue. The Judge is inclined to grant Pan's motion to confirm the award, but is seeking further information about the appeal and whether Pan has moved to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.
