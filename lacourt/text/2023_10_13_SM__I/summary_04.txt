And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the application to continue the trial and the partial opposition. The court is satisfied that the matter must be continued, and all parties seem to agree on that much. The question is when the trial should be set and what should happen to cut off dates. The court is inclined to agree with the new date of January 2, 2024, as the 5-year deadline is approaching and no definitive extension has been set forth.

Regarding the referee's report, the court is still not entirely convinced that it is in the nature of a report because there is some question whether the parties agreed that the referee's determinations would be binding. However, the court agrees with the referee's determination and has given some weight to the report, but not the "great weight" that defendants suggest.

The court also ruled that any discovery at this point needs to be approved by the referee and that the court will not issue a blanket continuance of the cut-off dates. If all parties are willing to extend the 5-year rule, the court can consider other dates. However, absent that, January 2, 2024, is the only date that will work.

Additionally, the court approved the referee's recommendation regarding the deposition of an expert witness. The court allowed plaintiffs to have the court reporter and videographer present at the witness's location, but only with the witness's consent. The court also noted that travel costs are generally recoverable by the prevailing party after trial.
