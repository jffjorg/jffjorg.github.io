And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case where the plaintiff is seeking to compel further responses to production requests from the defendant, Mazariat LLC. The plaintiff brought the motion, and the defendant opposes it. The case involves a breach of contract lawsuit regarding the restructuring of a property loan. The plaintiff served document requests, including requests 5 and 6, which sought information about Mazariat's governing instruments and capital contributions, as well as the sources of funds used to purchase, develop, or maintain the property. Mazariat objected to the requests on the basis of relevance. The court finds that the requests are proper and grants the motion to compel further responses, subject to the entry of a protective order. The court also notes that the discovery is relevant to the alter ego allegations made by the plaintiff and that the defendant's objections are not sufficient to block the discovery.
