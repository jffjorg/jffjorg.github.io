And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the motion to compel in part. The plaintiff must conduct a new search of their electronic data, including backup files and emails, using Boolean logic and the search terms determined through the meet and confer process. The search must include Joyce Brandman's personal electronic data, and the plaintiff's counsel must oversee the search to ensure it is properly done. The plaintiff must provide verified responses within 30 days, and any additional documents must be produced within 30 days of the supplemental verified responses. The judge is denying the request for an order requiring Joyce to sit for another deposition at this time, but may reconsider if new documents are discovered. The judge is also urging the parties to meet and confer to discuss the issue and moot it out, and is warning that sanctions may be imposed if the parties do not comply with the order.
