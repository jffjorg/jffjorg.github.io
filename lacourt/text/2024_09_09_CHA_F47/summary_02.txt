And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants (Armen Bahadourian, Park Place Cali-Electro Motors, and Dan Hoogenraad) against the plaintiff's (Feliks Zibelberg and City Wide Printing, Inc.) First Amended Complaint. The demurrer challenges the allegations of breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation/fraud, and negligent misrepresentation.

The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations of breach of contract are defective because they fail to adequately plead the contract at issue, including the parties and terms. The court also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of misrepresentation/fraud and negligent misrepresentation are defective because they fail to plead specific facts and do not adequately allege the elements of these causes of action.

The court sustains the demurrer and gives the plaintiff 30 days to file and serve a Second Amended Complaint to cure the defects in their pleading.
