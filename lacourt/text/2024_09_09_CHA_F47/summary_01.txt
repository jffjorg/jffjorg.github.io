And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for approval of the PAGA settlement. The settlement was reached between the plaintiff, Steven Jenkins, in a representative capacity, and the individual defendants, Niva Labs LLC, Briana B. Chhin, Sokoun Chhin, and Joshua Snyder. The settlement includes a payment of penalties to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and provides for the release of PAGA claims that arose during a specific time period. Each PAGA member will receive a payment of approximately $70.31, which will be paid as penalties on an IRS 1099 form. The total value of the proposed settlement is $10,000.00, which will be allocated as follows: attorneys' fees, costs of litigation, plaintiff's enhancement and release payment, and PAGA penalties. The defendants will self-administer the settlement and bear all costs related to its administration. The court finds the settlement and allocations to be fair and equitable.
