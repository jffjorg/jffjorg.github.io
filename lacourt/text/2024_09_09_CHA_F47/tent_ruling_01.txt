SUMMARY OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 10/3/23, Plaintiff Steven Jenkins (Plaintiff) filed
this wage and hour representative action, under California’s Private Attorneys
General Act of 2004, against Defendants Niva Labs LLC, Briana B. Chhin, Sokoun
Chhin and Joshua Snyder.  Specifically,
the complaint alleges: (1) Meal and Rest Period Violations; (2) Minimum Wage
Violations; (3) Overtime Violations; (4) Wage Statement Violations; (5) Failure
to Reimburse Employment Related Expenses; (6) Failure to Pay Wages Upon
Separation; and (7) Failure to Produce Personnel Records Pursuant to Labor
Code.  
 
Niva Labs LLC is no longer a viable entity, is not a
party to the settlement agreement and will separately be dismissed.  (Yaeckel Decl. ¶3, Ex.1 §I(16)).  The settlement agreement is between
Plaintiff, in a representative capacity only, and on behalf of other members of
the general public similarly situated, and the individual Defendants.   
 
After the formal and informal exchange of discovery, and
analysis of time and wage data, the parties have reached a proposed settlement
that includes a payment of penalties to the Labor and Workforce Development
Agency (LWDA).  (Yaeckel Decl. ¶4, Ex.1).
 
On 7/8/24, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order approving the PAGA settlement with an amended notice and
service of same occurring on 8/7/24.  No
opposition or other response to the motion has been filed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
For purposes of this settlement, the Aggrieved Employees
are defined as “all persons who are alleged to have been employed or have been
employed by Defendants in California as hourly, non-exempt employees from July
26, 2022, through May 10, 2024.”  (Yaeckel
Decl., Ex.1 at ¶I, 2).  This time period
is the covered PAGA Period.  Id.  It is estimated that there are 8 PAGA
Members, including Plaintiff.  (Yaeckel
Decl. ¶3; Ex.1 at §7).
 
The release is limited to PAGA claims only that arose
during the PAGA Period and were, or could have been, asserted in the Operative
Complaint. (See Ex.1,§I.13).  The
settlement agreement only covers PAGA claims. 
 
Each PAGA Member will receive an average payment of
approximately $70.31 which  represents an
average only because the actual amounts paid will vary depending on the amount
of pay periods worked during the PAGA period. 
(See Yaeckel Decl., Ex.1 at III.5). The PAGA Member payments will
be paid 100% as penalties pursuant to a IRS 1099 form. (Ex.1, §III.4.a).
 
The Total Value of the proposed Settlement is $10,000.00,
which is broken down as follows: (1)  $3,000.00 Attorneys’ Fees (30% of total
settlement value); (2) $1,250.00 Costs of Litigation; (3) $3,500.00 Plaintiff’s
Enhancement and §1542 Release Payment; (4) Sub-Total of $2,250 as the Total
PAGA Penalties; (5) 75% ($1,687.50) shall be assigned/paid to the LWDA as
penalties; and (6) The remaining 25% ($562.50) will be disbursed among all
employees based on pay periods worked during the PAGA period.  (See Ex.1, §I.10, Ex.2).  Defendants, through their counsel, will
self-administer the settlement and bear all costs related to the
administration.  (Ex.1, §IV).
 
After the check cashing deadline (which is not less than
180 days after the mailing) any unclaimed funds sent to the Aggrieved Employees
will be sent to the California Controller’s Unclaimed Property Fund in the name
of the Aggrieved Employee.  (Ex.1,
§IV.4).  
 
Based on the facts and circumstances surrounding this
case and the settlement, the Court finds the settlement and allocations to be
fair and equitable.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
