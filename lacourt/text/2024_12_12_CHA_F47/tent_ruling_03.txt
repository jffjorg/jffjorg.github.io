Case #24CHCV00858
 
 MINOR’S COMPROMISE
 
Amended Petition filed on 10/25/24.
 
MINOR: Gael Sebastian Tobar
GAL: Reynaldo I. Tobar (parent)
DEFENDANT: Gary W. Klein
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION: This action arises out of motor
vehicle versus pedestrians accident.  On
4/6/22, plaintiffs, including minor, were walking through an intersection on a
green light when they were hit by a vehicle driven by Defendant Gary W. Klein.
 
Minor, who was just under 1 year old at the time of the
incident, suffered mood changes, restlessness and trouble sleeping.  Minor was treated at Kaiser.  Minor has completely recovered from her
injuries.
 
AMOUNT OF SETTLEMENT: Defendant Klein to pay $32,500.00  
 
MEDICAL EXPENSES: $0
 
ATTORNEY FEES: $8,125.00
 
COSTS: $775.00
 
AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO MINOR: $23,600.00 to be
deposited into an insured account subject to withdrawal only on authorization
of the court.
 
RULING: The hearing will be continued.
 
The petition and proposed order suffer from the following
defects: 
 
(1) Although the petition says the minor was treated at
Kaiser Permanente, no medical records from the accident are attached to the
petition.  (See Petition, Nos.7
and 8).  The records attached in
Attachment 8 seem to be billing records for all services the minor has received
at since birth.  No. 8 in the petition
requires a doctor’s report containing a diagnosis of the minor’s injuries or
prognosis for recovery, and report of minor’s current condition.  If no report exists from the treatment the
minor received, the attorney must explain why.    
 
(2) As noted in the ruling on the prior petition,
No.13.b. in the petition indicates that the costs are continued/itemized in
Attachment 13b; however, there is no Attachment 13b to the petition.  The petition does not itemize each cost.  Rather, it lists several items and then sets
forth the lump sum of $775.00 without indicating how much was charged for each
item or how the costs were apportioned between the adult Plaintiff and the
minors – i.e., are they each being charged 1/3? 
 
(3) The proposed Order approving the settlement has No.13
marked, but does not indicate any additional orders are requested.
 
The hearing will be continued to allow counsel to clarify
the foregoing.  Any additional papers are
due to be filed and served at least 5 court days before the continued hearing
date.
