And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the amended petition and proposed order seeking approval of a settlement between the plaintiffs, the minor Gael Sebastian Tobar and the minor Luna Celeste Tobar, and the defendant Gary W. Klein, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the minors on April 6, 2022. The judge has identified several defects in the petition, including the lack of medical records attached to the petition, incomplete itemization of costs, and incorrect hearing date listed in the petition. The judge has ordered that the hearing will be continued to allow counsel to clarify the defects and provide additional information. Specifically, the judge has requested that the attorney for the minors explain why no medical report exists from the treatment the minors received, and that the parties itemize each cost and explain how the costs were apportioned between the adult plaintiff and the minors. The judge has also noted that the proposed order does not indicate any additional orders requested, and has requested that the parties provide additional papers at least 5 court days before the continued hearing date.
