RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
This action arises out of an automobile accident that
occurred on 11/13/20.  Plaintiffs Brian
Avalos, Eva Sanchez Avalos and Alejandra Jimenez (collectively, Plaintiffs)
allege that Defendant Eddie Camargo caused the accident which resulted in
Plaintiffs suffering personal injuries and property damage to Plaintiff Eva
Sanchez Avalos. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Ruth Pelayo aka Ruth Vazquez
aka Ruth Camargo (Ruth Pelayo) is one of or the only owner of the vehicle
driven by Eddie Camargo and involved in the accident on 11/13/20. 
 
On 11/8/22, Plaintiffs filed this action against Eddie
Camargo and Ruth Pelayo for: (1) General Negligence (against Eddie Camargo),
(2) Motor Vehicle Negligence (against Eddie Camargo), (3) Negligent Infliction
of Emotional Distress (against Eddie Camargo), (4) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress (against Eddie Camargo), (5) Permissive Use Statute Claim
(Vehicle Code Section 17149) (against Ruth Pelayo), and (6) Negligent
Entrustment (against Ruth Pelayo). 
Plaintiffs have since dismissed the 4th cause of action for
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
 
On 12/14/23, Plaintiff Brian Avalos served Defendant
Eddie Camargo with Form Interrogatories, Set 1. 
(O’Hara Decl., Ex.A).  On 1/16/24,  Eddie Camargo served responses and objections
to the discovery requests without verification. 
(Id., Ex.B, C).  Counsel
for the parties met and conferred regarding the discovery responses.  (Id., Ex.C)
 
On 2/26/24, the parties stipulated to continue the then
8/19/24 trial date. Within that stipulation, it was stated that Defendants
intended to serve verifications and further responses to five sets of written
discovery propounded by Plaintiffs.  As a
result, the Court ordered the trial date continued to 2/24/25 and ordered the
discovery deadlines and cut-offs to correspond to the new trial date. (See
2/26/24 Stipulation & Order). 
Despite further meet and confer efforts, neither further responses nor a
verification have been served.  (O’Hara
Decl., Ex.C, F).  Thereafter, pursuant to
Plaintiffs’ motion, the trial date was continued to 8/25/25.  (See 9/11/24 Minute Order).
 
As of the filing of the motion, neither further responses
nor a verification had been served regarding the subject discovery.  (O’Hara Decl.).  Therefore, on 5/20/24, Plaintiff Brian Avalos
filed and served the instant motion seeking an order compelling Defendant Eddie
Camargo to serve a verification and further responses to Plaintiff Brian
Avalos’ Form Interrogatories, Set 1, Form Interrogatories 2.6, 2.7, 12.4, 12.6,
15.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.9, 16.10, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6,
20.7, 20.8, 20.9, 20.10, and 20.11. 
Additionally, Plaintiff Brian Avalos requests sanctions be imposed
against Defendant Eddie Camargo and defense counsel, Khelya M. Okunor, jointly
and severally, in the amount of $2,660.00. 
On 11/27/24, Defendant Eddie Camargo filed and served an opposition to
the motion and on 12/5/24, Plaintiff Brian Avalos filed and served a reply to
the opposition.    
 
ANALYSIS
 
The broad scope of discovery allows a party to “obtain
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject
matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion
made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  CCP 2017.010.
 
CCP 203.300(a) provides:
 
“(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if
the propounding party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
(2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate.
(3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.”
 
Since the subject responses include facts and objections
and no verification has been served, the 45-day limit to bring the motion never
began to run.  See Golf &
Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. (2022) 84 CA5th 127, 134-136; CCP 2030.300(c).  To the extent the responses included facts
which needed a verification which was never provided, they are the equivalent
to no response.  See Appleton
(1988) 206 CA3d 632, 635-636.
 
If a timely motion to compel further responses is filed,
the responding party has the burden of justifying any objection.  Fairmont Insurance Co. (2000) 22 C4th 245,
255; Coy (1962) 58 C2d 210, 220-221; Williams  (2017) 3 C5th 531, 541-542.  The opposition fails to justify the
objections.  Rather, the opposition
contends that the motion should fail for various reasons, none of which have
merit.  
 
The opposition fails to explain how the unverified
responses served on 1/16/24 were proper considering they included some factual
responses which were not verified making them the equivalent to no
response.  See Appleton, supra.  Defendant claims that the responses complied
with CCP 2031 which applies to requests for production of documents, not
interrogatories which are at issue in this motion.  Contrary to Defendant’s assertion,
Plaintiff’s counsel satisfied its meet and confer obligations by engaging in meet
and confer efforts regarding the discovery responses for several months before
filing the instant motion.  Department
F-47 does not conduct Informal Discovery Conferences; therefore, Plaintiff had
no obligation to schedule one before filing the instant motion.  The further responses served on 11/4/24 are
defective in that the verification is dated 10/28/24, before the further
responses were prepared and dated on 11/1/24. 
(Defendant’s Ex.C).  As such, the
further responses are the equivalent to no response.  Appleton, supra.  The opposition concedes receipt of
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declarations dated 11/8/24 which explains the defect in
the verification for the further responses served on 11/14/24.  (Defendant’s Ex.D).  
 
Eddie Camargo has failed to justify any of the objections
made in the initial responses to the interrogatories.  As noted above, the facts interposed in the
initial responses to some of the interrogatories are not verified making them
tantamount to no response.  
 
The interrogatories seek information relevant to the
issues in this case.  Eddie Camargo has
failed to justify the objections included in his initial responses and the
factual information in the initial responses is unverified, inadequate and/or
evasive.  Further, as noted above, Eddie
Camargo has failed to properly verify the further responses to the subject
discovery served on 11/4/24.  As such,
those responses are tantamount to no response. 

 
The imposition of sanctions is also warranted against
Eddie Camargo and his former attorney, Khelya M. Okunor,
for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations.  CCP 2030.300(d).  The Court finds the $2,660.00 requested to be
reasonable under the circumstances.  (See
O’Hara Decl., p.8:7-14).   As such, sanctions in the amount of $2,660.00 are
imposed jointly and severally on Eddie Camargo and his former
attorney, Khelya M. Okunor, in favor of Plaintiffs’ counsel, Colleen O’Hara.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Further verified responses are due within 30 days.  Sanctions are imposed against Defendant Eddie
Camargo and his former attorney, Khelya M. Okunor, in favor of Plaintiffs’
counsel, Colleen O’Hara, in the amount of $2,660.00, payable within 30 days.
 
The Court notes that both Plaintiffs’ and Defendants’ counsel
have failed to electronically bookmark the exhibits submitted in support of the
motion and opposition in violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  Counsel for the parties are warned that
failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in matters being
continued so that papers can be refiled in compliance with the rule, papers not
being considered and/or the imposition of sanctions. 
 
Additionally, the Court notes that the separate statement
filed in support of the motion is not in the proper format.  CRC 3.1345(c) provides in relevant part:
 
“The separate statement must
include--for each discovery request (e.g., each interrogatory, request for
admission, deposition question, or inspection demand) to which a further
response, answer, or production is requested--the following:
(1) The text of the request,
interrogatory, question, or inspection demand;
(2) The text of each response,
answer, or objection, and any further responses or answers;
(3) A statement of the factual and
legal reasons for compelling further responses, answers, or production as to
each matter in dispute;
(4) If necessary, the text of all
definitions, instructions, and other matters required to understand each
discovery request and the responses to it;
(5) If the response to a particular
discovery request is dependent on the response given to another discovery
request, or if the reasons a further response to a particular discovery request
is deemed necessary are based on the response to some other discovery request,
the other request and the response to it must be set forth; and
(6) If the pleadings, other
documents in the file, or other items of discovery are relevant to the motion,
the party relying on them must summarize each relevant document.”
 
Here, the separate statement merely sets forth Eddie
Camargo’s responses to the document requests, verbatim, and then reiterates,
verbatim, the motion’s memorandum and points and authorities.  In the future, counsel must follow the format
set forth in CRC 3.1345(c) by addressing each discovery request individually
and not including extraneous information/arguments (i.e., statement of facts,
sanctions).
