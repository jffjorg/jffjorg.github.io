And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel further responses from the defendant, Eddie Camargo, to the interrogatories served by the plaintiff, Brian Avalos. The judge finds that the defendant's responses were inadequate and failed to verify certain factual information, rendering them equivalent to no response. The judge also finds that the defendant failed to justify his objections to the interrogatories and that the further responses served on 11/4/24 were defective due to an improperly dated verification.

The judge orders the defendant to serve further verified responses within 30 days. Additionally, the judge imposes sanctions of $2,660.00 against the defendant and his former attorney, Khelya M. Okunor, for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations.

The judge notes that both parties' counsel failed to electronically bookmark their exhibits in violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4) and warns that failure to comply with this rule in the future may result in sanctions. The judge also notes that the separate statement filed in support of the motion is not in the proper format and warns that counsel must follow the format set forth in CRC 3.1345(c) in the future.
