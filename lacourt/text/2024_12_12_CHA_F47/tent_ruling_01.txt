SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of trip and fall incident that
occurred on 10/30/20 at San Fernando Mission Cemetery which is owned by
Defendant The Roman Catholic Archdiocese (Defendant).  On 10/30/20, Plaintiff Yvonne Cruz
(Plaintiff) was visiting several of her family members’ graves at the cemetery.  (Separate Statement (SS) 8).  After decorating her family plots, Plaintiff
took 2-3 steps backwards, her heel caught on tree roots which caused Plaintiff
to lose her balance, fall and sustain injuries. 
(SS 10).
 
Prior to the incident on 10/30/20, Plaintiff had visited
the cemetery about 6 times.  (SS 6).  Plaintiff was aware of the tree near her
family’s graves and had previously complained about its unkept nature,
including its roots.  (SS 5, 7).
 
On 10/28/22, Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendant alleging causes of action for: (1) General Negligence and (2)
Premises Liability – Negligence (Defendant negligently owned, maintained,
managed and operated the cemetery).  On
9/25/24, Defendant filed and served the instant motion seeking an order granting
summary judgment as to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action for general
negligence and 2nd cause of action for premises liability.  On 12/2/24, Plaintiff filed and served an
opposition to the motion.  On 12/6/24,
Defendant filed and served a reply to the opposition.  Also, on 12/6/24, Plaintiff filed and served supplemental
declarations in support of the opposition.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Evidentiary Objections  
 
Defendant’s objections, numbers 1, 2 and 7, to the
Kasbekar declaration filed on 12/2/24 are overruled.
 
Defendant’s objections, numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6, to the
Kasbekar declaration filed and served on 12/2/24 are cured by the Kasbekar
declaration filed and served on 12/6/24. 
If Defendant requests a short continuance to address such evidence, as
indicated below, the Court will refrain from ruling on these objections until such
time.  If Defendant decides to proceed
with the hearing at this time, the objections will be overruled.  
 
Defendant’s objections, numbers 8, 10 and 11, to the Cruz
declaration are overruled.
 
Defendant’s objection, number 9, to the Cruz declaration
is sustained as to the portion of the declaration which states “I had not complained
about the tree roots in particular” as being contradicted by Cruz’s deposition
testimony.  (See Defendant’s Ex.A,
p.22:1-6, p.23:10-13).  The objection is
otherwise overruled.  
 
Timeliness of Opposition
 
CCP 437c(b) requires that all opposition papers to a
motion for summary judgment be filed and served at least 14 days before the
hearing date, unless the court shortens the time for good cause shown.  Here, 14 days before the hearing date was
Thursday, 11/28/24, Thanksgiving.  Plaintiff
did not file and serve her opposition papers until Monday, 12/2/24.  
 
Both Plaintiff and Defendant contend that the filing and
service of the opposition papers was untimely. 
Plaintiff contends that the delay was caused by counsel’s computer
crashing on Wednesday, 11/27/24.  Defendant
argues that the opposition should be stricken due to the purported untimely
filing and service.  Despite the
foregoing, the Court finds that the filing and service of the opposition on
12/2/24 to be timely.  
 
If the due date for an opposition to a motion for summary
judgment falls on a holiday, the due date is extended to the next day that is
not a holiday.  See Rowan
(2020) 54 CA5th 289, 294-295; People v. Financial Casualty & Surety,
Inc. (2019) 41 CA5th Supp. 1, 6.  CCP
12a provides that “[i]f the last day for the performance of any act provided or
required by law to be performed within a specified period of time is a holiday,
then that period is hereby extended to and including the next day that is not a
holiday.”  The foregoing rule applies to
all acts required by law, including filing deadlines for court documents.  See Deleon (1983) 33 C3d 456,
457.  Additionally, CCP 12a defines “holiday”
to include all Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays specified in CCP 135, which
includes Thanksgiving and the day after Thanksgiving.  See Parsons (2022) 86 CA5th
1260, 1266-1267.   
 
Even if the opposition was not timely filed, the Court
finds that Plaintiff’s attorney has provided a sufficient excuse for the failure
to file the opposition at least 14 days prior to the hearing date – i.e., the
crashing of counsel’s computer the on the 15th day before the
hearing date (11/27/24), which was the day before Thanksgiving.  Also, there was no way for Plaintiff’s
counsel to request an extension of time to file the opposition before filing
the opposition on the next court day, Monday, 12/2/24.  Further, the Court finds that Defendant was
not unduly prejudiced by the late filing and/or service as Defendant has filed
an opposition on the merits without requesting a continuance.
 
However, there is another issue with the opposition
papers.  Plaintiff’s counsel failed to
attach the exhibits to the Kasbekar declaration filed on 12/2/24 which are
referred to and relied on in the opposition. 
Plaintiff’s counsel explains that upon reviewing the reply, the mistake
was realized and a declaration with the exhibits attached was filed and served
on 12/6/24.  The Court does not believe that
Defendant was not prejudiced by this failure as Defendant should have had
access to all of the exhibits.  (See
Supplemental Kasbekar Decl. filed 12/6/24). 
However, if Defendant would like a brief continuance to solely address such
evidence and its impact on the motion, the Court will discuss same with counsel
at the hearing.  
 
Merits
 
Defendant incorrectly claims that “Plaintiff brings this
action against [Defendant] for general negligence and premises liability under
a single failure to warn theory of liability.” 
(See Motion, p.7:21-22; SS 11, 22).  Plaintiff’s premises liability cause of
action is based on Defendant negligently owning, maintaining, managing and
operating the premises/cemetery.  (See
Complaint, p.5 ¶Prem.L-2).  Defendant
concedes that Plaintiff’s discovery responses expand on the theories set forth
in the complaint.  (Motion, p.8, fn.1).  Since Defendant does not address the
allegations regarding its negligent maintenance of the premises, including the
tree and the roots over which Plaintiff tripped, the request for summary
judgment must be denied.  Plaintiff has
not requested summary adjudication in the alternative to summary judgment.    
 
Even if Plaintiff’s claims were limited to a failure to
warn theory of liability, Defendant has failed to establish that no triable
issues of material fact exist.  
 
The elements of both the negligence and premises
liability causes of action are: (1) Defendant owed Plaintiff a legal duty, (2)
Defendant breached that duty and (3) the breach proximately caused injury to
Plaintiff.  See Kesner
(2016) 1 C5th 1132, 1158, 1160-1161.
 
Generally, a landowner owes a duty to exercise ordinary
care in managing its premises to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk
of harm.  Brooks (1989) 215 CA3d
1611, 1619.  An open and obvious danger
obviates a landowner’s duty to warn of or remedy the condition.  See Krongos (1992) 7 CA4th 387,
393; Blodgett (1935) 4 C2d 511, 513. 
A danger is open and obvious when it is so obvious that a person could
reasonably be expected to see it.  Zuniga
(2021) 61 CA5th 980, 993-994.  Where
reasonable minds could differ on whether a condition is open and obvious or
where the evidence does not conclusively establish the open and obvious nature
of the condition, a triable issue of material fact exists precluding summary
judgment. See Kasparian (2007) 156 CA4th 11, 15.     
 
While the evidence establishes that Plaintiff was aware
of the existence of the tree, its overgrown nature, and had even complained
about its root(s), a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether the
tree root(s) over which Plaintiff tripped were open and obvious on the date of
the incident.  (See SS 7, 9, 18,
20).  The evidence before the Court does
not establish that Plaintiff saw the tree root(s) on the date of the incident.  Rather, Plaintiff’s declaration submitted in
support of the opposition indicates that the tree over which she tripped “was
not very long,” was “the same color as the surrounding soil and dead leaves,”
and was “partially covered by grass.”  (See
Cruz Decl. ¶4).  As such, a triable issue
of material fact exists as to whether the root over which Plaintiff tripped was
open and obvious on the date of the incident and/or whether it was the same
root which Plaintiff had complained about in the past.  
 
Similarly, a triable issue of material fact exists as to
whether the alleged failure to warn caused or contributed to Plaintiff’s
injuries.  If cones or some other warning
devices were placed on or by the specific tree root over which Plaintiff fell,
it would have warned her of the danger on the date of the incident.  From Plaintiff’s deposition testimony, it
cannot be determined whether she was complaining about the tree because it was
unsightly, because it presented a danger, or both.  (See Defendant’s Ex.A, p.22:17-21).
 
CONCLUSION
 
If Defendant wishes to address the exhibits attached to
the declaration of Shivali Kasbekar filed and served on 12/6/24 in support of
the opposition, a short continuance of the hearing will be granted.  Defendant’s supplemental brief limited to 5
pages and to solely addressing such evidence will be due to be filed and served
at least 5 court days before the continued hearing date.  
 
Otherwise, the motion will be denied.
