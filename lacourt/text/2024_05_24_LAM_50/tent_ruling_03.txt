  ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION OF
  PREVAILING DEFENDANT SEVAK AVAKIAN FOR AWARD OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY’S FEES IN
  THE AMOUNT OF $68,015.45
 




 
Background 
Plaintiff Albert Kirakosian (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on
December 11, 2013 against Defendants American Best Engineering, Inc. aka Avakian
Engineering, Inc., Sergik Avakian, and Sevak Avakian. 
On September 6, 2017, Plaintiff filed the operative Third Amended
Complaint (“TAC”) alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2)
fraud, (3) conversion, (4) money due on an open book account, (5) money due on
an account stated, and (6) money had and received. 
In the TAC, Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that “[o]n or about
January 25, 2007, Defendants SERGIK and SEVAK, and each of them, as individuals
and on behalf of ABE and AVAKIAN ENG. (collectively ‘Defendants’), entered into
with Plaintiff a ‘Secured Promissory Note’ with Plaintiff (‘Note’) which was
signed by Defendant SERGIK as ABE’s President…In or around the same time,
Defendants, and each of them, entered into ‘Security Agreement’ (‘Agreement’)
which was signed by Defendant SERGIK as ABE’s President.” (TAC, ¶ 14.) 
Plaintiff alleges that “from January 1, 2007 to July 5, 2007,
Plaintiff individually and through his company loaned to Defendants a total of
$165,000, subject to the terms of the Note and Agreement.” (TAC, ¶ 20.) Plaintiff
alleges that “[o]n or about March 1, 2007, Defendants made a payment to
Plaintiff in the amount of $4,000.00 to Kirako Corp.,” and that “[f]rom 2007 to
March 2013, Defendants made a total of $35,800.00 in payments to Plaintiff as
an individual and $43,015.45 in payments to Kirako Corp.” (TAC, ¶¶ 21-22.)
Plaintiff alleges that “[i]n or about April 2013, Defendants completely ceased
making any payments to Plaintiff and/or Kirako Corp.” (TAC, ¶ 23.)
On August 24, 2023, a Judgment was entered in this matter. The
Judgment indicates, inter alia, that the case was tried on February 15,
2023, and that Judgment is for defendants Avakian Engineering, Inc. and Sevak
Avakian. The Judgment indicates that Plaintiff is to receive nothing from
Avakian Engineering, Inc. and Sevak Avakian. (See Judgment, ¶ 6(b).) In
addition, the Judgment provides that “Defendants were the prevailing
party…Defendants may seek costs and attorney’s fees and, if awarded, file an
amended judgment.” (Judgment, ¶ 7.) 
Sevak Avakian now moves for an order awarding him and against
Plaintiff attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $68,015.45. The motion is
unopposed. 
Discussion
A.    Entitlement to Attorney’s Fees
Civil
Code section 1717, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part that “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract
specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing
on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or
not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other
costs.” 
In
addition, Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10)(A) provides
that attorney’s fees, when
authorized by contract,
are allowable as costs.
As set forth
above, the August 24, 2023 Judgment in this action provides, inter
alia, that “Defendants were the prevailing party…Defendants may seek costs
and attorney’s fees and, if awarded, file an amended judgment.” (Judgment, ¶
7.)
In addition, as discussed, the TAC in this action alleges that “[o]n
or about January 25, 2007, Defendants SERGIK and SEVAK, and each of them, as
individuals and on behalf of ABE and AVAKIAN ENG….entered into with Plaintiff a
‘Secured Promissory Note’ with Plaintiff…which was signed by Defendant SERGIK as
ABE’s President…” (TAC, ¶ 14.) In his declaration in support of the instant
motion, Sevak Avakian states that “[o]n December 11, 2013, Plaintiff Albert
Kirakosian…filed a Complaint against me alleging I entered into a Secured
Promissory Note (hereinafter referred to as ‘Agreement’) with Plaintiff dated
January 25, 2007. A true and correct copy of the Agreement is attached to this
declaration as ‘Exhibit #1.’” (Avakian Decl., ¶ 4, emphasis omitted.) 
The “Secured Promissory Note” attached as Exhibit 1 to Sevak Avakian’s
declaration provides, inter alia, “FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned
(‘Maker’), promises to pay to the order of Albert Kirakosian, or the lawful
holder of this Note (‘Holder’)…the principal sum of One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000.00), together with interest thereon at the rate of Four
Percent (4%) per month.” (Avakian Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 1, p. 1.) The “Secured
Promissory Note” further provides as follows: 
 
“The undersigned
promises to pay all attorneys’ fees and costs and/or other fees and costs
(including, without limitation, trustees’, consultants’, accountants’,
engineers’ and appraisers’ fees and expenses) incurred by the Holder hereof in
connection with the interpretation, collection or enforcement of this Note, the
Security Agreement of even date and the UCC-1 Financing Statement (the ‘Loan
Documents’), (whether or not legal proceedings are brought by Holder), and/or
the protection of the security thereunder, including, without limitation any
such fees and expenses incurred by Holder in connection with, related to, or
arising out of any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings.” (Avakian
Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 1, pp. 1-2.) 
Sevak Avakian appears to assert that he is entitled to attorney’s fees
pursuant to the above-referenced provision and Civil
Code section 1717. Plaintiff does not oppose the instant motion and
accordingly does not dispute that Sevak Avakian is entitled to attorney’s fees
here. 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court finds that Sevak Avakian has demonstrated his entitlement to attorney’s fees here. 
B.    
The Hourly Rate of
Counsel and the Reasonableness of the Requested Fees
“[T]he fee
setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. …
The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work. The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services provided.”
((PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [internal
citations omitted].) In determining
the reasonable hourly rate, the “burden is on the successful party to prove the
appropriate market rate to be used in calculating the lodestar.” ((MBNA America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006) 147 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 13.)
“[T]he
court’s discretion in awarding attorney fees is…to be exercised so as to fully
compensate counsel for the prevailing party for services reasonably provided to
his or her client.” ((Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State
University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 395.) With regard to the number of hours
reasonably expended, “the verified time statements of the attorneys, as
officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous.” ((Id. at p. 396.) The trial court may
reduce the award where the fee request appears unreasonably inflated, such as
where the attorneys’ efforts are unorganized or duplicative. ((Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, fn. 21.) 
In
his supporting declaration, Sevak Avakian states that “[p]rior to being
represented by my current counsel I was represented by Alex Gilanians…and paid
Mr. Gilanians $44,441.49 in attorney’s fees. A true and correct copy of the
Attorney’s fees paid by me to Mr. Gilanians is attached to this declaration as
‘Exhibit #2.’” (Sevak Avakian Decl., ¶ 9, emphasis omitted.)
As an initial matter, the Court notes that it is
unclear what Mr. Gilanians’s requested hourly rate is. Sevak Avakian’s
declaration does not discuss Mr. Gilanians’s rate. In addition, Exhibit 2 to
Sevak Avakian’s declaration appears to reference different rates for different
staff members. (Sevak Avakian Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 2.) Further, Mr. Gilanians did
not file any declaration in support of the motion authenticating the billing
records attached to Sevak Avakian’s declaration. 
Sevak Avakian’s counsel, Sam Zreik, also filed a
declaration in support of the instant motion. Mr. Zreik states that his
“billing rate on this matter was and is $400.00 per hour.” (Zreik Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff does
not oppose the instant motion and does not challenge Mr. Zreik’s 
hourly rate. The Court finds that Mr. Zreik’s
requested hourly billing rate is reasonable. 
Mr. Zreik states that “[o]n July 15, 2021, I
agreed to represent Defendant on this matter, and have continued to represent
Defendant to the date of writing this declaration. From the time my
representation of Defendant to the present, Defendant has accrued, and has
paid, $23,573.96 in legal fees and costs. Thus, from the onset of litigation to
the present Defendant incurred legal fees and costs in the amount of
$68,015.45.” (Zreik Decl., ¶ 11.)[1]
In his supporting declaration, Mr. Zreik states
that “I have prepared invoices for each task performed for Defendant with each
entry being made at or near the time in which the tasks it described were
completed or incurred. The invoices reflect time reasonably expended by me on
the case. I prepared each of my time entries in the invoices in the regular
course of firm’s business.” (Zreik Decl., ¶ 12.) However, the Court notes that
a copy of the referenced invoices do not appear to be provided in connection with
Mr. Zriek’s declaration. Mr. Zreik’s declaration also references a redacted
“Client Billing Statement,” but such a statement does not appear to have been
provided. (Zreik Decl., ¶ 14.) 
In light of the foregoing, the Court will
require additional evidence from Sevak Avakian to address the deficiencies
identified above.
