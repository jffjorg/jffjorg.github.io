And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion filed by Plaintiff J.A. (a minor) to compel the deposition of the person most knowledgeable (PMK) for Anthem Blue Cross and the production of documents. The motion seeks information on Anthem's compensation and bonus plans for employees involved in the handling of Plaintiff's pre-service request for an inpatient admission. The judge grants the motion in part, finding that topics 1 and 2 are relevant only as to the general basis for compensation and potential bonus compensation of Anthem, but not individual information such as W2s or 1099s. The judge also denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Anthem in the amount of $1,000.00, finding that Anthem's objections were not an attempt to obstruct discovery.
