**Significant Statements**

* "When interpreting contracts, the language used controls if it is clear and explicit. We must view the language of a contract as a whole, avoiding a piecemeal, strict construction approach. If possible, we should give effect to every provision and avoid rendering any part of an agreement surplusage." (Segal v. Silberstein (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 627, 633)
* "To be sure, [Plaintiff] would not have sued [Defendant Ford] for the defective condition of the vehicle but for the sale of the vehicle by [the dealership] pursuant to the [Sales Agreement]. And [Defendant Ford] provided an express warranty to the [Plaintiff] as a result of the sale. But that does not mean [Defendant Ford]'s obligation to provide a non-defective vehicle under its separate express warranty is in any way founded on an obligation imposed by the sales contract or is intertwined with those obligations." (Montemayor, supra, 92 Cal.App.5th at 970)
