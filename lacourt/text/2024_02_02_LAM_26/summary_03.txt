And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the upcoming court hearing on February 2, 2024. The judge will sign the proposed order submitted by the parties, which stipulates to continuing the trial to August 26, 2024, and the Final Status Conference to July 31, 2024. The parties do not need to wait for the ex parte application to be called on February 2, 2024. The judge has also set a firm trial date of August 26, 2024, and is requiring the parties to confirm their witnesses' and trial counsel's availability on this date. If a party learns that a witness or trial counsel is unavailable on the new trial date, they must bring an ex parte application to continue or advance the trial to a new date. The judge will rely on the parties' original time estimate for the duration of trial, which is 7-10 days, unless an ex parte application is filed to enlarge the time for trial.
