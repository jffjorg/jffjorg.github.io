MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Dan M.
Forman, CDF Labor Law LLP
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On September 10, 2024, Dan M. Forman, counsel for Defendant Sunpower
Corporation, filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
                         
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
California Rules of Court, rule
3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and
motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in
general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion
and motion and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case;
and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting
Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).¿ 
 
The court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿
            
III.      DISCUSSION
Dan M. Forman seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Defendant
for the following reason: “A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship
occurred as the Represented Party has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of
the United States Bankruptcy Act. (See Notice of August 12, 2024.) See Estate
of Falco v. Decker, 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (1987). Counsel has made every
attempt to avoid foreseeable prejudice to the client and further disclosure of
the breakdown in the relationship is protected by attorney-client confidential
communications. In accordance with the California Rules of Professional
Conduct, my withdrawal is mandatory and I have not been able to obtain a signed
Substitution of Attorney. The Represented Party is protected against prejudice
due to the Automatic Stay.”  (Forms MC-052.)    
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
 
Upon review, the court finds the Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.   
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            The
unopposed motion is granted and effective upon the filing of the proof of
service of this signed order upon Defendant.¿ 
 
            The court
set an OSC re bankruptcy stay and status of counsel for Defendant Sunpower for October
21, 2024 at 9:00 am.  Plaintiff is to
file a status report, five court days before the October 21, 2024 hearing
 
Counsel to give notice to all parties. 
 
 
Dated:   October 10,
2024
