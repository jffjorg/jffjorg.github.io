And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the unopposed motion of Dan M. Forman, counsel for Defendant Sunpower Corporation, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, as Defendant Sunpower Corporation has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Act. The court finds that the motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The court has set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re bankruptcy stay and status of counsel for Defendant Sunpower for October 21, 2024, at 9:00 am, and requires Plaintiff to file a status report five court days before the hearing.
