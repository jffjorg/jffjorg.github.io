And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jesus Sanchez v. Executive Building Solutions, Inc. (Case No. 22STCV11560). The case involves a motion by Plaintiff Sanchez to compel Defendant Executive Building Solutions, Inc. to provide verified responses to Plaintiff's Form Interrogatories, Set One. The Defendant had previously filed a declaration indicating that it intended to prepare, file, and serve verified responses to the interrogatories before the scheduled hearing. Since the Defendant has since taken this action, the judge finds that the motion is moot.

However, the judge also rules on Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendant for not timely serving responses to the interrogatories. The judge finds that the Defendant's conduct warrants sanctions and imposes a monetary sanction of $610, consisting of one hour at Plaintiff's counsel's hourly rate and $60 in filing fees. The judge orders the Defendant to pay the sanctions to the Plaintiff within 30 days of the order.
