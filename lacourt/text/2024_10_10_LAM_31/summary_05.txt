And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case involving allegations that a consultant provided false and fraudulent reports to an insurance company, which the company relied on to deny portions of the plaintiff's insurance claim. The defendant consultant argues that Penal Code section 550, subdivisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) do not apply to a consultant who provides a neutral professional opinion, but the judge finds this argument unpersuasive. The judge also rejects the defendant's citation to Textron Financial Corp. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1061, which the defendant relied on to argue that a UCL claim cannot be brought against an insurer's agent or consultant for allegedly providing false or fraudulent reports concerning an insurance claim. The judge notes that this portion of Textron has been disapproved by the California Supreme Court's decision in Zhang v. Superior Court (2013) 57 Cal.4th 364, 380. The judge is tentatively ruling in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant consultant.
