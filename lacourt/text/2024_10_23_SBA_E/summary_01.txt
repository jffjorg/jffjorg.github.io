And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is vacating their previous order granting the petition for a Special Needs Trust (SNT) due to inconsistencies in the order and defects in the proposed trust instrument. The proposed trust instrument does not meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 7.903(c) and Los Angeles Superior Court, Rule 4.116(b). The Judge is continuing the hearing to allow the Petitioner to make the necessary corrections to the trust instrument. The Petitioner proposes to find $40,000 cash into the SNT and use the remaining $85,000 to purchase an annuity. The Judge notes that bond must be required of the trustee, Mia Ehsani, a private professional fiduciary, in the amount of $46,000.
