PLAINTIFF:             
 
Marz
Holden-Montini
 
PETITIONER:          
 
Beth
Holden (Appointed 12/9/2020)
 
GROSS
AND NET SETTLEMENT (Petition, p. 6, sections 15 and 16f):          
 
Gross $500,000,
Net $125,000 
 
PROPOSED
RECIPIENT OF SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS (Petition, pp. 8-9, sec. 18):
 
Petitioner
proposes to find $40,000 cash into the SNT and use the remain $85,000 to
purchase an annuity that would pay into the SNT at:
 
Commencing
10/19/2030 (age 40), $2,111.47 per month for 5 years, guaranteed; (final
guaranteed payment on 09/19/2035).
 
 
PROPOSED
TRUST INSTRUMENT:
 
Petitioner
provides the proposed trust instrument at Attachment 18b(4), court’s pdf at p.
71.
 
The main
requirements for court created or funded trusts are set forth at California
Rules of Court (CRC) rule 7.903(c) and LASC rule 4.116(b).  The proposed trust instrument does not meet
the following requirements of CRC rule 7.903(c):
 
(c)(6)
Require the trustee to file accounts and reports for court approval in the
manner and frequency required by Probate Code sections 1060 et seq. and 2620 et
seq.;  (Vague requirements stated in
Section 6.04 are not sufficient)
 
The
proposed trust instrument does not contain the following terms as required by
LASC rule 4.116(b):
 
(b)(2)
Any purchase of a personal residence for a beneficiary may be made only if
authorized by the court pursuant to the rules applicable to conservatorships
and guardianships. (See Prob. Code, § 2571);
 
(b)(3)
Any sale of a personal residence of the beneficiary may be made only if
authorized by the court pursuant to the rules applicable to conservatorships
and guardianships. (Prob. Code, § 2540(b).) Such sales must be returned to
court for confirmation. (See Prob. Code, § 10300 et seq.); and
 
(b)(4)
The trustee may not borrow money, lend money, give security, lease, convey, or
exchange any property of the estate without prior authorization of the court.
(Prob. Code, § 2550.)
 
 
 
 
 
TRUSTEE
AND BOND:
 
The proposed initial trustee Mia Ehsani, a private
professional fiduciary (PPF) in El Dorado Hills, California (El Dorado
County).  Normally, bond must be required
of a trustee unless the trustee is a corporate fiduciary.  (California Rules of Court, Rule 7.903(c)(5),
Probate Code section 2320.)  A PPF does
not meet that definition and bond is required in the amount of $46,000.  
 
ORDERS/PROPOSED
ORDER:
 
This
Court’s order of 10/4/24 is vacated.  Inconsistencies
in the order were found by the Court after 10/4/24. Section 1a of the order
states that the matter was eligible for expedited approval per CRC rule
7.950.5, yet subsection (a)(3) of that rule states that a matter is ineligible
for expedited approval of any proceeds will be distributed to a trust, as is
requested in the petition.  Also, as
noted above, there are defects in the trust instrument that should be
corrected.  
 
            The hearing to approve the Special
Needs Trust is continued to allow Petitioner to make the noted corrections.
