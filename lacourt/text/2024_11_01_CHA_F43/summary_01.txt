And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Juan Ayala vs. Pitchess Detention Center, et al. (Case Number 23CHCV01624). The Defendant, County of Los Angeles, has moved to compel Plaintiff Juan Ayala's responses to Form Interrogatories, which were served on February 2, 2024. Although Plaintiff had provided responses to other discovery requests by April 16, 2024, he failed to respond to the Form Interrogatories. Despite a meet and confer letter sent by the Defendant on August 22, 2024, Plaintiff still has not provided any responses.

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion to compel responses to the Form Interrogatories. The Judge also orders Plaintiff to serve responses within 20 days. Additionally, the Judge orders Plaintiff and his counsel to pay sanctions in the amount of $500.00 to the Defendant's counsel, which was based on the Defendant's counsel spending 2 hours preparing the motion and attending the hearing at a rate of $250 an hour.

The Judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.260, 2030.290, 2030.300, 2023.010, and 2023.030, as well as a prior case, Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.
