SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff Medallion
Bank (Plaintiff) was the financier of Defendant Gary Murl Beck, Jr.’s
(Defendant) purchase of a 2022 Hideout 272BH Travel Trailer. In exchanging for
financing the purchase, Defendant agreed to make 144 monthly payments of
$613.87 to Medallion Bank, commencing on March 27, 2023, and continuing on the
same day of each month until the contracted amount was paid in full. The
Contract is in default due to Defendant’s failure to pay. 
 
Plaintiff seeks
possession of the trailer, with Plaintiff having filed the application for writ
of possession on August 20, 2024. Plaintiff filed proof of service on August 20,
2024, indicating that Defendant was served notice of the hearing via personal service
on August 27, 2024. Default judgment was entered against Defendant on September
30, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
Upon a showing
of the probable validity of a plaintiff’s right to possession of the property
claimed, a writ of possession shall be issued, subject to any possible bond or
undertaking. (CCP § 512.060.) The claim has probable validity “where it is more
likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant
on that claim.” (CCP § 511.090.) Once the requirements for issuance of the writ
are met, CCP § 512.070 authorizes an order directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to plaintiff. When necessary, the Court may take
additional oral and documentary evidence at the claim and delivery hearing.
(CCP § 512.050.)
 
Plaintiff has
met the requirements set forth in the CCP for an application for writ of
possession. Plaintiff has obtained a judgment that Defendant is in default on his
payments under the contract. Plaintiff is entitled to possession of the trailer
given Defendant’s failure to pay. Plaintiff’s application for writ of
possession indicates that the trailer is stored at Defendant’s residence at
34718 Agua Duce Canyon Road, Agua Dulce, California 91390.
 
 The Court issues the writ of possession and
directs transfer of the trailer.
