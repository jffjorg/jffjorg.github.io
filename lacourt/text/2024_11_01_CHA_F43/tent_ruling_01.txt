SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On February 2,
2024, Defendant County of Los Angeles (Defendant) served form interrogatories on
Plaintiff Juan Ayala (Plaintiff). While Defendant had received Plaintiff’s
responses to other discovery by April 16, 2024, Plaintiff had not provided any
responses to the form interrogatories. Defendant sent a meet and confer letter
to Plaintiff on August 22, 2024, giving Plaintiff 7 days to provide verified
responses. As of the date of this motion, which was filed on September 10,
2024, Defendant has not received any responses to its form interrogatories.
Defendant also requests sanctions in the amount of $500.00 against Plaintiff
and his counsel.
 
No
opposition has been filed.                               
 
Form
Interrogatories
The propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses and monetary sanctions if a
party to whom the interrogatories are directed fails to respond. (CCP §§ 2030.290,
2030.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) Responses to interrogatories
are due within thirty days from the date of service of the interrogatories. (CCP
§§ 2030.260(a), 2016.050.) The responding party waives any objections to the
interrogatories by failing to serve responses in a timely manner. (CCP § 2030.290(a).)
 
Plaintiff has
failed to respond to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories. Defendant has moved for an
order compelling Plaintiff’s responses to these Interrogatories. The Court
grants Defendant’s motion to compel responses to the Form Interrogatories.
 
Sanctions
CCP § 2023.030
authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to respond to discovery,
evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial justification are
“misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010, subd. (d)-(f).)
 
Defendant has requested
sanctions in the amount of $500.00 against Plaintiff and his counsel. The
amount was based on Defendant’s counsel spending 2 hours preparing this motion and
attending the hearing on the motion at a rate of $250 an hour. (Kadomatsu
Decl., ¶ 7.) The Court will grant sanctions in the requested amount.
 
Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel is granted in
the amount of $500.00.
 
ORDER
1.      Defendant’s
motion to compel responses to the form interrogatories is granted.
2.      Plaintiff
is ordered to serve responses within twenty (20) days.
3.      Plaintiff
and Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions in the total amount of $500.00.
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered to pay these sanctions to Defendant’s
counsel within twenty (20) days.
4.      Moving
party to give notice.
