And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's petition to compel arbitration and stay the action. The case involves a dispute over warranties provided by the defendant, American Honda Motor Company, Inc., as the manufacturer of a vehicle leased by the plaintiff, Nicole Michelle Arrington, from Galpin Honda. The plaintiff alleges five causes of action related to violations of the Song-Beverly Warranty Act, while the defendant argues that it should be able to compel arbitration by virtue of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.

The judge has concluded that the warranty obligations under the Song-Beverly Act are not inextricably intertwined with the arbitration agreement in the Lease Agreement, and therefore, the petition to compel arbitration is denied. The judge has also noted that the arbitration provision in the Lease Agreement does not explicitly give third parties the right to compel arbitration, and that the plaintiff's complaint is based on the warranties given by the defendant as the manufacturer, not on any warranties in the Lease Agreement.
