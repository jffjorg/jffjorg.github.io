And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that the Defendant's motion to strike and demurrer to the Plaintiff's first amended complaint are sustained. The Plaintiff, Lisa Gutierrez, had filed a lawsuit alleging that the Defendant, American Honda Motor Company, Inc., had concealed the existence of sensing defects in the 2016 Honda Accord she purchased. The court has concluded that the Plaintiff's complaint fails to state a valid cause of action and is thus uncertain and ambiguous. As a result, the court has sustained the Defendant's demurrer and has requested that the Plaintiff amend its pleading to provide specific allegations to support its claims.
