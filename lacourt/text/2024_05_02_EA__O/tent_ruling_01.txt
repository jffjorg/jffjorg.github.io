(1)   Defendant
American Honda Motor Company, Inc’s Notice Of Demurrer And Demurrer To
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.

 
(2)   Defendant
American Honda Motor Company, Inc’s Notice Of Motion And Motion To Strike
Portions Of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is MOOT.[1] 
 
 
Background
 
This is a lemon law case arising from Plaintiff’s 2016
purchase of a 2016 Honda
Accord. Plaintiff alleges that the Subject Vehicle has sensing defects,
engine defects, electrical defects, amongst other defects and nonconformities.
(See First Amended Complaint (FAC) ¶12.)
 
On January 12, 2024, Plaintiff Lisa Gutierrez filed suit
against Defendant American Honda Motor Company (“Honda” or “Defendant”).
 
On February 16, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer and a
motion to strike (MTS).
 
On March 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a FAC. 
 
On April 4, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer x
MTS.
 
On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed her opposition to both. 
 
On April 25, 2024, Defendant filed its reply. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant demurs to the 5th COA for fraudulent
concealment on the grounds that fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a
valid cause of action and is uncertain, ambiguous and unintelligible pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.10(e) and 430.10(f), respectively. 
 
Here, the court agrees with Defendant that the FAC fails to
comply with heightened pleading requirement for fraud. Plaintiff attempts to
show that Defendant was aware of the sensing problems based upon complaints
posted on the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. (FAC p.
14.) However, those complaints pertain to a 2017 Honda CR-V; 2017 CRV EX; 2019
Honda CR-V; 2018 Honda Accord; and 2020 Honda Accord. But the subject vehicle
is a 2016 Honda Accord. 
 
Thus, Plaintiff is requested to
amend its pleading to specifically provide what specific
allegations show Defendant had exclusive knowledge of the sensing defect
and what specific allegations show that Honda actively concealed
said sensing defect. (See also
Code of Civ. Proc., §425.10(a),
§ subsection [complaint
“shall contain . . . [a] statement of the facts constituting the cause of
action, in ordinary and concise language.”].) 

 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, as the FAC conclusively alleges
that Defendant was “fully aware of the Sensing Defect affecting the Subject
Vehicle, [but] Defendant and its agents concealed the existence and nature of
the Defect from Plaintiff at the time of purchase” (FAC p. 15), the demurrer is
sustained and the MTS is moot.
