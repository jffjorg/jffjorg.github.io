DEFENDANTS NAVIGATOR REAL ESTATE INC. AND MINGJU ZHANG'S
NOTICE OF DEMURRER AND MOTION TO STRIKE AND DEMUERRER AND MOTION TO STRIKE
(MTS) is SUSTAINED with leave to amend (i.e., the demurrer due to
uncertainty) and the MTS is MOOT.[1] 
 
Background
 
This is a contracts case. 
 
On February 2, 2024, Plaintiff Zhou Chen filed suit against
Defendants NAVIGATORS REAL ESTATE INC., (“Navigators”), MINGJU ZHANG, JING PAN,
QINGFENG CHEN.
 
On February 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the POS as to
Navigators. 
 
On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed the POS as to Jing
Pan. 
 
On March 15, 2024, Navigators filed the instant demurrer. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendants argue that the complaint is uncertain and
ambiguous. 
 
Here, the court fully agrees. 
 
“A
demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the complaint is
so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., he or she cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him or her.” (Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group) § 7:85 (emphasis in original).) The complaint checks that it is
one for breach of contract and that Plaintiff is seeking $18,680 in damages in
addition to ‘mental damages’ of $40,000.[2]
However, the terms of the contract are not provided nor a copy of the contract.
To the extent a contract is attached, it appears to be one for a rental
agreement, and only portions (and not even entire portions) are
provided. Thus, the demurrer is proper because the complaint is so unclear that
that it does not apprise Defendants of the issues which they are to address. (People v. Lim (1941) 18 Cal.2d 872, 882.) With
that, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer with leave to amend. 
 
As for the motion to strike the
‘mental damages,’ that is moot by way of the demurrer. 
 
The court notes that Plaintiff failed to respond to
Defendants’ meet and confer efforts. Should Defendants file a subsequent motion
to an amended complaint, Plaintiff is ordered to meet and confer in good faith.
Though Plaintiff is pro per, he
or she is treated like any other party and is
entitled to the same, but no greater consideration than other litigants and
attorneys. (See, e.g., Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1229,
1246-47.) 
 
 Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is SUSTAINED and the
MTS is moot. Plaintiff is ordered to meet and confer in good faith on any
subsequent motion(s).
