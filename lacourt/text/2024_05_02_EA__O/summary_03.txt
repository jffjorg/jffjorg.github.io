And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained the demurrer filed by the defendants, Navigator Real Estate Inc. and Mingju Zhang, on the grounds that the complaint is unclear and ambiguous. The complaint does not provide sufficient information about the terms of the contract, making it difficult for the defendants to respond to the allegations. The court has also ordered the plaintiff to meet and confer in good faith on any subsequent motions. The motion to strike the "mental damages" is moot due to the sustaining of the demurrer. The court has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to address the unclear nature of the original complaint.
