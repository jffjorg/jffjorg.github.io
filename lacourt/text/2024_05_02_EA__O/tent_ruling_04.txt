[1] Multiple motions
should not be combined into a single filing. (Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure
Before Trial, [8:1140.1] at 8F-60 (The Rutter Group 2011) [“Motions to compel
compliance with separate discovery requests ordinarily should be filed separately.”].)
Here, moving Defendants have filed a demurrer and a motion to strike in one
filing. 


[2] According to CCP section 403.040, a
court, “on its own motion, may reclassify a case at any time.” The court must
give notice and allow the parties an opportunity to contest the
reclassification. (Stern v. Superior Court (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 223,
229-231.) Thus, as on its face the complaint the special damages are less than
$35,000.01 and the mental damages appear to be subject to a meritorious motion
to strike, the case may be
subject to reclassification.
