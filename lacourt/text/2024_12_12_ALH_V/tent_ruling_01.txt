  Case Number:  23GDCV02470    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2024    Dept:  V MOVING PARTIES: Defendant FORD MOTOR COMPANYRESPONDING PARTY: UnopposedThe court considered the moving papers.BACKGROUNDPlaintiff Nancy Lim filed the complaint on November 20, 2023, against defendant Ford Motor Company. Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action: (1) failure to affirmatively repurchase under the act and (2) failure to sell vehicle that would not pass without objection and was not properly packaged.Plaintiff alleges she purchased a 2021 Ford Bronco (subject vehicle) for personal, family, and/or household purposes from an authorized dealer and agent of the warrantor. Plaintiff alleges the subject vehicle exhibited the following nonconformities: oil leak, tire pressure issue, noise in vehicle, and malfunctioning child safety lock. Plaintiff alleges that after defendants were unableto service or repair the subject vehicle after a reasonable number of attempts, defendants failed to affirmatively replace the subject vehicle or make restitution to plaintiff in accordance to the Act. Plaintiff also alleges that at the time defendants sold plaintiff the subject vehicle, it was not merchantable and as a result, plaintiff has sustained damages.Defendant filed the instant motion on October 21, 2024 and the separate statement for the motion on October 22, 2024. No opposition has been received.LEGAL STANDARDWhen a party propounds interrogatories, the responding party may respond with (1) an answer containing the information sought to be discovered; (2) an exercise of the party’s option to produce writings; or (3) an objection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.210(a).)The requesting party may move for an order compelling further responses to request for interrogatories if any of the following apply: (1) an answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) an exercise of the option to produce documents under section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate; or (3) an objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a).)The motion must be filed within 45 days from responses, supplemental responses, or a specific later date agreed to in writing (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(c).) Failure to make motion within the specified period constitutes waiver of right to compel a further response. (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) The time period is mandatory and jurisdictional in the sense that it renders the Court without authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them. (Id.)The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(b)(1).) The purpose of the meet and confer requirement is to encourage the parties to make serious effort to work out differences informally and avoid a need for a formal order. (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal. App. 4th 1006, 1016.)Under Rule of Court 3.1345, the movant must submit a separate statement along with the motion to compel further responses. The movant must include specific facts showing good cause justifying further responses.DISCUSSIONA. TimelinessPlaintiff served responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One on September 5, 2024, with an undated verification. (Cronin Decl. ¶¶ 7-8; Exh. D.) The court finds that the motion was timely because since the verification is undated, the 45-day deadline has not yet begun to run. Even taking the date the responses were served, September 5, 2024, as the date of verification, the 45 day deadline to file the motion was October 22, 2024, thus the motion would still be timely.B. Meet and ConferOn October 18, 2024, defendant’s counsel sent plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letter regarding the responses that are incomplete, evasive, and/or non-responsive. (Cronin Decl., ¶ 9; Exh. E.) On October 18, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel responded via email incorrectly stating that verified responses were served in July. (Cronin Decl., ¶ 10; Exh. F.) The court finds that defendant’s counsel attempted to resolve the issues informally.C. Form InterrogatoriesDefendant requests further responses to Form Interrogatories 2.2, 2.3, 2.5-2.7, 9.1, 9.2, 12.1, 12.4, and 17.1. The court notes that for all these interrogatories, plaintiff provides general and boilerplate objections.Form interrogatories 2.2 and 2.3Plaintiff agreed to supplement her responses. The requested information is relevant to allow defendant to investigate plaintiff’s driving history. The court orders plaintiff to provide the date and place of her birth and the information regarding her driver’s license in response to form interrogatory 2.2 and 2.3.Form interrogatories 2.2 and 2.3Plaintiff agreed to supplement her responses. The requested information is relevant to allow defendant to investigate plaintiff’s driving history. The court orders plaintiff to provide the date and place of her birth and the information regarding her driver’s license in response to form interrogatory 2.2 and 2.3.Form interrogatory 12.1 and 12.4Although plaintiff identifies one witness by name and a few as employees of defendant, plaintiff also refers defendant to documents produced in connection with plaintiff’s responses to defendant’s requests for production of documents, set one. As to form interrogatory 12.4, photographs, films, or videotapes depicting any place, objects, or individual concerning the incident are relevant and plaintiff’s referral to the documents produced as a part of plaintiff’s responses to defendant’s requests for production, set one, is not a sufficient response. As discussed above, this is not a sufficient response because plaintiff must specify which response or which documents are responsive to this interrogatory. Accordingly, the court orders plaintiff to provide further responses to form interrogatories 12.1 and 12.4.Form interrogatory 17.1Plaintiff provides a partial response to the request, but also makes a general reference to plaintiff’s responses and documents to defendant’s requests for production, set one, which is not sufficient. Accordingly, the court orders plaintiff to provide further responses to form interrogatory 17.1.D. SanctionsDefendant requests the court award monetary sanctions against plaintiff and her counsel of record in the amount of $1,820.00. The court finds that because plaintiff’s objections were generally unmeritorious, boilerplate, and inapplicable, monetary sanctions are warranted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300(d). The court reduces the amount requested and orders sanctions in the amount of $885.00 (3 hours at $275/hour plus $60 for the filing fee) payable by plaintiff Nancy Lim and her attorney of record.Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 9.1, 9.2, 12.1, 12.4, and 17.1.The court DENIES the motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory 2.7.Plaintiff Nancy Lim is ordered to produce further responses to the form interrogatories within 20 days of this order.The court awards sanctions against plaintiff and her counsel of record, in the amount of $885.00, payable to defendant within 20 days of this order.Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
