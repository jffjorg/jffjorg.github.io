And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant the plaintiffs' motions to approve the PAGA settlement and for attorney's fees, costs, and service awards. The settlement agreement is reasonable and fair, and the distribution of the PAGA settlement amount complies with Labor Code section 2699. The settlement amount of $2,460,000 will be distributed as follows: $820,000 for attorney's fees, $41,000 for litigation costs, and the remaining amount will be distributed to the PAGA settlement group members, with 25% going to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and 75% going to the group members. The service awards of $20,000 per plaintiff are also reasonable and approved. The Judge finds that the motions are unopposed and that the settlement agreement is fair and adequate in view of the purposes and policies of the statute.
