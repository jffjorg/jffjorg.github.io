Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to plaintiff's request for production of documents, set one. The motion is deemed MOOT as to requests 1-5, 7, 8, 10-15, 16-28, 31, and 34-35, as defendant has purportedly produced responsive documents after the protective order was entered.

The court grants the motion as to requests 33, 36, and 37, and denies it as to requests 6, 9, 29, 30, and 32.

The court finds that defendant's responses to requests 6, 9, 29, 30, and 32 are insufficient and orders defendant to produce responsive documents within 20 days.

The court orders defendant to produce responsive documents as to requests 33, 36, and 37.

The court notes that defendant's objections to requests 32, 33, 36, and 37 lack merit, and that plaintiff has shown good cause for the requests.

The court finds that defendant's responses to requests 32, 33, 36, and 37 are sufficient and orders defendant to produce responsive documents.

The court orders plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
