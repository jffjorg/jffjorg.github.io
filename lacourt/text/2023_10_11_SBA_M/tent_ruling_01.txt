RULING
The motion is GRANTED.  The court orders that the attorney is relieved
as counsel of record for defendant Village Pointe, Inc., effective upon the
filing of the proof of service of the signed “Order Granting Attorney’s Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” (Judicial Council form MC-053) upon the
client.
BACKGROUND
On July 8, 2019, Dierdre Ann Jones
filed a complaint against Village Pointe Apartments for (1) breach of warranty
of habitability, (2) negligent maintenance of premises, (3) negligent per se,
(4) nuisance, (5) breach of quiet enjoyment, and (6) IIED.
On November 19, 2019, the court
denied defendant’s motion to compel arbitration.
On November 25, 2019, defendant
filed an appeal.
On November 18, 2020, a remittitur
issued stating that on September 3, 2020, the appeal was dismissed pursuant to
appellant’s request.
On March 16, 2021, the court
scheduled a jury trial for March 9, 2022.
On March 1, 2022, pursuant to a
stipulation and order, the trial was continued to July 6, 2022.  On June 29, 2022, at the FSC, the trial was
continued to August 10, 2022.  At an ex
parte hearing on August 3, 2022, the trial was continued to November 9, 2022.  On November 9, 2022, counsel announced ready
for trial and the trial was continued to November 15, 2022.
On November 15, 2022, due to the
unavailability of court, the trial was continued to February 22, 2023.
On January 12, 2023, defendant
filed a substitution of attorney identifying new counsel as Thomas H. Citron,
at Citron & Citron.
On February 22, 2023, counsel
announced ready for trial and the court noted that the estimate for a jury
trial was ten days.  The trial was
continued to September 12, 2023.
On September 1, 2023, pursuant to a
stipulation and order, the trial was continued to November 15, 2023, based on
defense counsel’s engagement in other trials.
Trial is set for November 15, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
The court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice.  See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal. App. 2d
398.
CRC Rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and
without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship
why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)).
DISCUSSION
            Defendant’s attorney of record, Thomas
Harvey Citron, seeks to be relieved as counsel.
Counsel states in his declaration that,
recently, “there has been a complete breakdown of all communication between”
defendant and defense counsel, which “makes it impossible” for defense counsel
to effectively represent defendant in this action, including trial.
In opposition, defendant disputes
that there has been a breakdown in communication and argues that it will be
prejudiced if the motion is granted as trial is set for November 15, 2023.
According to defendant’s in-house attorney’s declaration, there has been
“continued communications” between defendant and defense counsel and that he is
aware of “dozens of email correspondence” from Citron & Citron requesting
information and “our responses to those requests, providing information and
documents.”  He is aware of many phone
calls to discuss cases and information for cases.  He also states that defense counsel has
prepared the case and has represented that the case is ready for trial and that
there is no reason for attorney Citron not to represent defendant.  He further states that defendant is not aware
of any outstanding issues in this matter that affect attorney Citron’s ability
to represent defendant at trial.  He also
contends that defendant will be unfairly prejudiced in locating replacement
counsel that will have adequate time to prepare for the trial.
In reply, moving counsel Citron
contends that he has satisfied the requirements of Cal. Rules of Court and has
shown good cause for requesting relief. 
He reiterates that there has been a complete breakdown of all communications,
which makes it impossible to effectively represent defendant in this action and
at trial.  He also argues that defendant
will not be prejudiced because defendant has had sufficient time to obtain new
counsel.  He further states in his
declaration that defendant has also failed and refused to comply with the terms
of their agreement to retain defense counsel by failing to pay attorney’s fees
and the costs of experts they agreed to retain.
 The court finds that the attorney submitted a
declaration establishing that the service requirements of California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, have been satisfied. 
The court also finds that the attorney has shown sufficient reasons why
the motion to be relieved as counsel should be granted and that defendant will
not be prejudiced as it has adequate time to obtain new counsel.
The motion is GRANTED.
 
The Court
will set an OSC re: Defendant Village Pointed, Inc to appear through new
counsel of record or Answer may be stricken and default entered for failure of
Corporate Defendant to appear through counsel on October 25, 2023, at 8:30 AM.
A Case Management Conference and Mandatory Settlement Conference will also be
held on this date.
 
All
parties and counsel are ordered to appear. Moving counsel is to prepare a
proposed order to include all future dates as well as to serve a copy of the
minute order on all parties.
 
Moving counsel is ordered to give
notice of this ruling.
