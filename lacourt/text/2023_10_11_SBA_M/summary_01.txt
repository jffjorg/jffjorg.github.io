And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant's attorney, Thomas Harvey Citron, relief as counsel in the case of Dierdre Ann Jones vs. Village Pointe Apartments. The motion was filed due to a breakdown of communication between the defendant and defense counsel, making it impossible for Citron to effectively represent the defendant in the case, including trial. The court finds that Citron has shown sufficient reasons for requesting relief and that the defendant will not be prejudiced as it has had sufficient time to obtain new counsel. The ruling orders that Citron be relieved as counsel, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed "Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel â€“ Civil" (Judicial Council form MC-053) upon the client. The court also sets a new hearing for October 25, 2023, at 8:30 AM, for the defendant to appear through new counsel or answer may be stricken and default entered for failure of the corporate defendant to appear through counsel.
