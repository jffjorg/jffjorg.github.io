And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a premises liability case, denying the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's employee, Banuelos. The plaintiff had sought to complete the deposition of Banuelos, but the defendant's employee failed to appear for the deposition on June 28, 2024. The defendant subsequently filed a substitution of attorney, replacing the original attorney with a new one, on July 9, 2024. The plaintiff filed the motion to compel the deposition on July 10, 2024. The judge found that the plaintiff did not provide evidence of meet and confer efforts with the new counsel to resolve the issue after the nonappearance, which is required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition and also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions.
