 Case Number:  23AHCP00074    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  X Demurrers and Motion to Strike   Real Parties (Defendants: Raising  Cane’s Restaurants, L.L.C., Raising Cane’s USA, L.L.C., and Chapman W. Lew) and City Defendants  separately demurred to the first cause of action in the Third Amended Complaint  (“TAC”).  Defendants move to strike  portions of the TAC.    The Demurrers  are OVERRULED as moot considering the August 23, 2024 Request for Dismissal  filed by Plaintiff.  The motion to strike  is also denied as moot.   This case arises out  of Plaintiff Atlantic Square, LLC’s (“Plaintiff”) claim that Raising Cane’s  Restaurant, L.L.C.’s (“Raising Cane’s”) operation of the drive-through causes  dangerous conditions on the road and blocks access to Plaintiff’s own parking  lot.  Plaintiff filed a TAC on November  29, 2023, alleging 5 causes of action for (1) writ of mandate, (2) public  nuisance, (3) private nuisance, (4) nuisance per se, (5) violation of  California Business and Professions Code section 17200, et seq. (“UCL”), and  (6) declaratory relief.   On August 23, 2024,  Plaintiff filed a Request for Dismissal.  Plaintiff requested the following be dismissed  with prejudice: 1) First Cause of Action against all parties.2) The following City Defendants (but no other parties) from all remaining causes of action: a. CITY OF MONTEREY PARK; b. CITY COUNCIL OF CITY OF MONTEREY PARK; c. PLANNING COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF MONTEREY PARK; d. RON BOW, an individual, in his capacity as CITY MANAGER OF THE CITY OF MONTEREY PARK; e. JESSICA SERRANO, an individual, in her capacity as INTERIM DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OF THE  CITY OF MONTEREY PARK, and f. DOES 1-5  Real Parties and  Defendants separately demur to the first cause of action for Writ of Mandate.  However, as that cause of action was dismissed on August 23, 2024, the  demurrers are overruled as moot.   Defendants also moved  to strike several portions of the TAC.  Real  Parties filed a joinder on Defendants’ motion to strike.  However, as the  Defendants who filed the motion to strike have been dismissed from all causes  of action as of August 23, 2024, the motion to strike is denied as moot, as is Real Parties’  joinder.  (See, e.g., Barak v.  Quisenberry Law Firm (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 654, 661 [joinder in co-defendant’s  special motion to strike was effective because it established requisite factual  foundation and requested affirmative relief]; Commonwealth Energy Corp. v.  Investor Data Exch., Inc. (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 26, 31 n.3 [defendant’s joinder  in co-defendant’s motion to dismiss was effective because it requested relief  for defendant himself].)   Real Parties are to answer the TAC within 10 days.   Trial Setting Conference   The Court sets the following dates:   Trial  is scheduled for September 30, 2025  at 9:00 a.m. in Department X of the Alhambra Courthouse.   Final  Status Conference is scheduled for September 18, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. in Department X of the Alhambra  Courthouse.  Trial counsel are to appear  in person for the FSC and are to lodge hard copies of their trial binders to  the Court at least five days prior to the FSC.   The parties are to otherwise comply with the Court’s orders concerning  preparation for trial.Plaintiff is to give notice.
