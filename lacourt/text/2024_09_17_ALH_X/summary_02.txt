And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a case between Atlantic Square, LLC (Plaintiff) and Raising Cane's Restaurants, L.L.C., Raising Cane's USA, L.L.C., Chapman W. Lew, City of Monterey Park, City Council of City of Monterey Park, Planning Commission of the City of Monterey Park, Ron Bow, Jessica Serrano, and Does 1-5 (Defendants). The Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint (TAC) alleging six causes of action, including writ of mandate, public nuisance, private nuisance, nuisance per se, violation of California Business and Professions Code section 17200, et seq. (UCL), and declaratory relief. The Defendants filed demurrers to the first cause of action and a motion to strike portions of the TAC. However, the Plaintiff subsequently filed a Request for Dismissal, which included the dismissal of the first cause of action and certain City Defendants from all remaining causes of action. As a result, the judge has overruled the demurrers as moot and denied the motion to strike as moot. The judge has also scheduled the trial for September 30, 2025, and a Final Status Conference for September 18, 2025.
