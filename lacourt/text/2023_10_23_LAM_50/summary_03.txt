```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to compel Philip Richard Powers to provide responses to deposition questions. The motion was filed over 60 days after the completion of the deposition record and did not include a meet and confer declaration as required by the code. Additionally, the proof of service indicates that Powers was served with the motion by mail, but the judge does not find that this meets the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346. The judge notes that the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the requirements for filing a motion to compel have been satisfied.
