And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a first amended cross-complaint and a motion to strike. The demurrer was filed by the cross-defendants, Lat Long Infrastructure, LLC, Cavallo Capital Partners, LLC, Urban Tech Consulting, LLC, Jeffery Anon, and Daniel Urban, against the cross-complainants, Trafero Technologies, LLC and Sahil Chaudhary Singh.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the first and second causes of action for securities fraud, finding that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge has also overruled the demurrer to the third, fourth, and fifth causes of action for fraud, finding that the allegations are sufficiently specific to state a cause of action.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action for negligence, constructive trust, and accounting, finding that the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action.

The judge has sustained the demurrer as to Cross-Defendants Jeff Anon and Cavallo, finding that the allegations do not sufficiently allege alter ego against these parties.

The judge has denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations of fraudulent activities are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The judge has ordered the cross-complainants to file and serve a second amended cross-complaint within 30 days of the ruling, and the cross-defendants to file and serve a response within 30 days thereafter.
