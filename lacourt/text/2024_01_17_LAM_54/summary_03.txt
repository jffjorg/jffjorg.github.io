And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration based on the Dispute Resolution Agreement (DRA) executed by the plaintiff on January 3, 2017, and updated and acknowledged by the plaintiff on August 1, 2019. The plaintiff had challenged the validity of the agreement, arguing that she did not recall receiving or acknowledging it. However, the defendant presented evidence that the plaintiff had acknowledged and accepted the agreement through the ULTIPRO application used by the defendant to distribute online documents. The judge found that the defendant had met its burden to establish the existence of an agreement to arbitrate, and the burden shifted to the plaintiff to establish any defenses to enforcement. The plaintiff failed to establish any defenses, and the judge granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The action is stayed pending arbitration.
