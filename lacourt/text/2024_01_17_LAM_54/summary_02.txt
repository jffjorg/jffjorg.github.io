And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike allegations of Labor Code violations that occurred during the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant violated the Labor Code by failing to pay all meal period wages and rest break wages, failing to properly calculate and pay all minimum and overtime wages, failing to provide accurate wage statements, failing to pay all wages due and owing during employment and upon termination of employment, failing to reimburse all necessary business expenses, and failing to timely provide employee records upon request. However, the judge has ruled that the claims are barred by the one-year statute of limitations, except for the claim for failure to provide employee records, which the defendant is not seeking to strike. The judge has ordered the defendant to take notice and has invited the parties to submit any further comments on the tentative ruling.
