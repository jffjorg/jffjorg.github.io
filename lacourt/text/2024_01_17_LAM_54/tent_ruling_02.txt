Department 54, Judge Maurice Leiter
Motion to Strike 
Moving Party: Defendant Neotech Products, LLC
Responding Party: Plaintiff Gloria Jurado
 
T/R:      DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STRIKE IS GRANTED.
 
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
 
“Any party, within the time allowed to response to a pleading, may serve
and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part" of that
pleading. (CCP § 435(b)(1).) “The Court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section
435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a)
Strike out any irrelevant, false or improper matter asserted in any
pleading; (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
Court." (CCP § 436.)
 
This is a PAGA action. Defendant moves to strike allegations of Labor
Code violations that occurred during Plaintiff’s employment on the ground that
they are barred by the one-year statute of limitations. (CCP § 340(a); Brown v. Ralphs Grocery Co.
(2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 824, 839.)
 
Plaintiff alleges she was employed by Defendant from February 15, 2015
to August 31, 2020. (Compl. 16.) Plaintiff filed the notice letter with the
LWDA on January 13, 2023 and filed this suit on July 24, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges Defendant violated the Labor Code by (1) failing to pay all meal period wages and rest break wages, (2)
failing to properly calculate and pay all minimum and overtime wages, (3)
failing to provide accurate wage statements, (4) failing to pay all wages due
and owing during employment and upon termination of employment, (5) failing to
reimburse all necessary business expenses, and (6) failing to timely provide
employee records upon request.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff
asserts the claim for failure to provide employee records is not barred because
Plaintiff requested the records on December 10, 2022. In reply, Defendant
emphasizes that it is not seeking to strike that allegation. Plaintiff has not
shown the other allegations are timely.
 
Defendant’s motion to strike
is GRANTED.
