And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the defendants from denying the plaintiff access to the subject property, interfering with the plaintiff's quiet enjoyment and use of the premises, or changing locks or otherwise obstructing access to the premises pending the conclusion of the action.

The plaintiff alleged that it subleased a commercial property from the defendants, but the property had serious structural and habitability defects that the defendants did not disclose or remedy. The plaintiff claims that the defendants breached the assignment agreement and wrongfully evicted the plaintiff.

The judge found that the plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its breach of contract claim, as the evidence shows that the defendants did not lawfully terminate the sublease. The judge also found that the balance of harms weighs in favor of the plaintiff, as the plaintiff is the only party with the right to possession of the property.

The judge's ruling is based on the following legal standards: (1) whether the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim, and (2) whether the balance of harms weighs in favor of granting the injunction. The judge applied these standards to the facts of the case and concluded that the plaintiff has met its burden.
