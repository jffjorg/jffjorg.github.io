And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Robert Ware's motion for reconsideration of the Court's ruling on the Motion for Summary Judgment, which was entered on September 13, 2023. The motion was filed late, both in terms of time and after the entry of judgment. The judge notes that the Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 provides that a motion for reconsideration must be made within 10 days after service of notice of the order, and that a motion may not be heard after entry of judgment. The judge rules that the motion is therefore doubly untimely and that the Court is without jurisdiction to hear it.
