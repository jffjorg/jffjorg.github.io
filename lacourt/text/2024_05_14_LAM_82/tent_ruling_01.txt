[Tentative]
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
            Petitioner
Ismael Tamayo (“Petitioner”) was a police officer with the Los Angeles Police
Department (the “Department” or the “LAPD”). 
Petitioner went camping with two other LAPD officers and shot one of
them after he had been drinking heavily. 
Petitioner maintained that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress
disorder (“PTSD”) stemming from his military service.  The Chief of Police (the “Chief”) ordered a
Board of Rights (the “Board”) hearing on three charges.  The Board found Petitioner guilty and recommended
a penalty of termination, which the Chief imposed.  Now, Petitioner petitions for a writ of
administrative mandate directing the City of Los Angeles and the Chief (collectively,
“Respondents”) to set aside the final administrative decision to terminate him.  The writ is denied, as the weight of the
evidence supports the Board’s findings of guilt, and Petitioner does not
demonstrate any abuse of discretion in the penalty.  Petitioner also moves to augment the record,
which is denied. 
 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND  
 
            A.        Petitioner’s Military and Employment
Background 
 
Petitioner was hired by the Department
as a police officer in 2006.  (AR
1347.)  Prior to his employment with the
Department, Petitioner served on active duty in the United States Army between
1994 and 1998.  (AR 1350-1351.)  Petitioner was deployed to Kuwait during this
time period.  (AR 1351-1352.)  Afterwards, Petitioner served with the
California National Guard.  (AR 1352.)  Petitioner was recalled to active duty in
2001, 2004, and 2007, and experienced combat. 
(AR 839-840, 1347-1354, 1365.) 
Petitioner worked as a police officer for Department for about 12 years
prior to the incident leading to his discharge. 
(AR 1347-38, 3593.)  At the
administrative hearing, Petitioner testified that Veterans Affairs diagnosed
him with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”) in 2013 and assigned a rating
of 30% “service-connected.”  (AR
1366-67.)  
 
            B.        The Incident 
 
On May 2, 2020, Petitioner, Officer
Mark Mascareno, and Sergeant Javier Vega went to Apple Valley to camp and do
some target shooting.  (AR 353,
1368-39.)  The three officers were
friends and worked together.  (AR
350-351.)  They parked their two trucks
in an “L” formation and set up camp between the trucks.  (AR 67, 3055, 1371.)  
 
Starting around 6:30 p.m., the officers
set up targets and shot various firearms. 
(AR 534-36, 1369-73.)   Around
7:30 p.m., the officers ate dinner, shared stories, and consumed alcoholic
beverages.  (AR 536-37, 1374-76.)  Petitioner later estimated that he had a
12-ounce beer with dinner, followed by four to six more beers, and then sipped
whiskey poured in a small Styrofoam cup. 
(AR 1374-78, 1631-32.)  Petitioner
estimated he drank about six ounces of whiskey total.  (AR 1376.) 
For several hours, Petitioner, Officer Mascareno, and Sergeant Vega
“were just chatting, normal conversation, … laughing and just having a good old
time.”  (AR 1379; see also AR 363.)
 
On May 3, 2020, around 12:30 a.m. to
1:00 a.m., the officers started getting ready for bed.  (AR 364, 540, 660.)  Petitioner stated he needed to urinate and
walked into the desert behind the truck. 
(AR 364-65.)  Officer Mascareno
later testified that the area was moonlit; there was a lantern; and he could
see clearly.  (AR 486.)  Officer Mascareno saw Petitioner hunched over
by the truck “like if he had passed out standing up.”  (AR 368.) 
Officer Mascareno said, “Why you being so creepy over there?”  (Ibid.) 
Officer Mascareno then saw Petitioner holding his pistol in a
double-handed, “low ready position” as if Petitioner was “ready for a serious
threat to present itself.”  (AR
370.)   Petitioner repeatedly said, “Get
back. Stay back.” (AR 369.) Officer Mascareno said, “Hey man, put your gun
away.” (AR 373.) Subsequently, Petitioner shot at Officer Mascareno three
times, hitting him once in the left shoulder area. (AR 377-380, 581.)[1] 
 
Petitioner
eventually lost consciousness.  He was
later taken into custody by deputies from the San Bernardino Sheriff’s
Department that responded to the scene. 
(AR 1391, 1395, 417-421, 287-288, 321.) 
Approximately nine hours after the shooting, Petitioner’s blood was
drawn.  (AR 1161, 3184.)  The blood alcohol concentration (“BAC”) was
0.085 percent. (AR 1161, 3184.)  
 
C.        Petitioner’s
Account 
 
Petitioner testified that he went to
his truck, which was 30 or 40 feet away, to urinate.  Petitioner testified that after he urinated,
the following events occurred: 
 
And
then at that point, I hear like a voice. Something was said. Something foreign
to me, either a foreign language or something I couldn't understand. I didn't
recognize the voice. But to me it sounded like it was a threatening gesture. So
I was just standing there trying to – ‘cause it was so dark, I was kind of
squinting, like trying to focus and like ‘who is that?’ and I’m like -- I
didn't know what was going on. So I was like -- I looked over to where the
fireplace was at where I saw [Mascareno] standing the last time before I went
to urinate. I didn't see him there. I looked around, you know, the truck. I
didn't see Vega. I'm like ‘what the heck is going on here?’ So at that point I
looked back towards where that voice came from. And then I heard what to me
appeared to be a gunshot -- a silent gunshot. So I was like in shock. I
immediately got down on a knee, and I unholstered my pistol from my hip and I
fired three rounds into that direction of that gunshot and voice….
 
(AR
1379-80.)  
 
            Petitioner further testified, “So
there was this voice coming from in front of me in the darkness. I didn't
recognize the voice as far as being [Mascareno’s] or Vega'’. I didn't
understand the language. I know it wasn't English or Spanish or French. I go,
maybe it's Arabic.”  (AR 1381.)  Petitioner testified that, after he shot the
rounds, he reverted to his military training and moved out of the “target zone…
so the enemy wouldn’t know where I was at.” 
(AR 1386-87.)
 
            D.        Criminal Proceedings 
 
The San Bernardino County District
Attorney’s Office filed criminal charges (assault with a deadly weapon) against
Petitioner for his conduct on May 3, 2020. 
(AR 3414.)  On August 6, 2020,
Petitioner’s attorney filed an “application for diversion of individual with
mental disorder.” (AR 3419-3420.) The application was supported by a
psychological evaluation of Petitioner by Dr. Nadim Karim.  (AR 3421-3434.)  Based on his evaluation of Petitioner, Dr.
Karim opined that Petitioner’s PTSD, dissociative disorder, and alcohol use
disorder significantly contributed to the commission of the criminal conduct
for which he was charged.  (AR 3432-34.)  On April 22, 2022, the Court dismissed all
charges against Petitioner upon his successful completion of diversion. (AR
3582-3583.)
 
E.         Use
of Force Review Board 
 
Department’s Use of Force Review Board
(“UOFRB”) and the Chief of Police both reviewed evidence collected regarding
the incident.  The UOFRB and Chief of
Police both concluded that Petitioner’s “actions were a substantial deviation,
without justification, from approved Department tactical training.”  (AR 3319.) 
In his report to the Police Commission, the Chief of Police
administratively disapproved of Petitioner’s tactics, drawing/exhibiting of a
weapon, and lethal use of force during the incident.  (AR 3315.)
 
Detective Alex Soria provided the UOFRB
with a power point presentation regarding the incident.  As directed by his supervisors, Detective Soria
did not provide the UOFRB with the statement of Officer Mark Mascareno
expressing his belief that Petitioner was suffering with PTSD and that
Petitioner was acting as if he was in Afghanistan.  (AR 2076-2077.)  However, Soria’s presentation to the UOFRB
did reference the mental disorder diversion Petitioner completed in response to
the criminal charges.  (Ibid.)  
 
F.         Administrative
Proceedings 
 
On April 30, 2021, the Chief of Police
ordered Petitioner to face the following charges before a Board of Rights
(“Board”):
 
Count 1: On or about May 3, 2020, you,
while off-duty, utilized tactics that were found to be a substantial deviation,
without justification, from approved Department tactical training, that reached
a finding of Administrative Disapproval. 
 
Count 2: On or about May 3, 2020, you,
while off-duty, exhibited your firearm that resulted in a finding of Out of
Policy, Administrative Disapproval. 
 
Count 3: On or about May 3, 2020, you,
while off-duty, used Lethal Force that resulted in a finding of Out of Policy,
Administrative Disapproval. 
 
(See AR 1, 4-5.)  
 
An administrative hearing was held
before on multiple dates starting in May 2021. 
(AR 2, 2685.)  The Board heard
testimony from Petitioner, Officer Mascareno, Sergeant Vega, Dr. Karim, and
multiple other witnesses.  (See
Ibid.)  The Board also admitted
documentary evidence into the record, including an expert report of Dr.
Karim.  (See e.g. AR 3419-3434.)
 
The Board found Petitioner guilty on all counts. (AR
2693-2705.)  In its findings of guilt,
the Board relied on Department’s policies regarding tactics, use of firearms,
and use of lethal force.  The Board also
discussed the
objectively reasonable officer standard of Graham v. Connor (1989) 490
US 386, which is incorporated in the Department’s use of force policies,
including with respect to off-duty use of force.  (See AR 2693-2705, 3332-33, 1282, 1304.)   Among other findings, the Board concluded
that Petitioner’s “planning was deficient” with respect to his decision to
carry a firearm because he “consumed extremely large amounts of alcohol.”  (AR 2694.) 
Moreover, Petitioner admitted that he “did not, and could not, identify
what he was shooting at.”  (AR
2696.)  The evidence also showed that
Petitioner “was not taking fire” and “had ample time … to de-escalate the
situation and failed to do so.”  (Ibid.)
 
Based on the totality of the
circumstances, the Board recommended a penalty of termination. (AR 3042.)  The Chief adopted the recommendation.  (AR 3710.) 
This
writ action followed.
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the
respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial;
and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law; the decision is not
supported by the findings; or the findings are not supported by the
evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).)
 
Because
the termination of Petitioner’s employment with the Department concerns a
fundamental vested right, the court exercises its independent judgment on the
administrative findings.  (See Wences v. City of Los Angeles (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 305, 314; Bixby v. Pierno
(1971) 4 Cal. 3d 130, 143.)  Under the
independent judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the
administrative record for errors of law, but also exercises its independent
judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”  (Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal. 3d 130,
143.)  The court may draw its own
reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its determinations as to the
credibility of witnesses.  (Morrison v. Housing Authority of the City of
Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003) 107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  “In exercising its independent judgment, a
trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the
administrative findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision
bears the burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are
contrary to the weight of the evidence.” 
(Fukuda v. City of Angels
(1999) 20 Cal. 4th 805, 817.)
 
Petitioner
bears the burden of proof to demonstrate, by citation to the administrative
record, that the weight of the evidence does not support the administrative
findings.  (Strumsky v. San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. (1974) 11
Cal.3d 28, 32; Steele v. Los Angeles County Civil
Service Commission (1958) 166 Cal. App. 2d 129, 137.)  A
reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either party to an appeal and will
not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a search of the record for
any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.”  (Fox v.
Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) 

 
“The propriety of a penalty imposed by an administrative
agency is a matter vested in the discretion of the agency, and its decision may
not be disturbed unless there has been a manifest abuse of discretion.”  (Williamson
v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1343,
1347.)   
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        The Weight of the Evidence Supports the
Administrative Findings of Guilt 
 
In
the petition, Petitioner alleges that “[t]he decision to discharge Petitioner
constitutes an abuse of discretion in that the ‘guilty’ findings are not
supported by the weight of the evidence.” 
(Petition for Writ of Mandate, ¶ 12.) 
In his opening brief, however, Petitioner does not discuss the
administrative findings of guilt made by the Board, identify which findings he
challenges (if any), or demonstrate with citation to the record that the
Board’s findings were against the weight of the evidence.  (See Opening Brief (“OB”) 16-18.)  Although he does not fully develop the points,
Petitioner suggests that he should not be found guilty of misconduct for the
incident on May 3, 2020, because he “was off-duty and not acting in his
capacity as a police officer” and “fell into a dissociative state due to PTSD,
a condition caused by trauma he experienced during his combat
deployments.”  (OB 17.)  
 
The District Court
of Appeal has made clear that the petitioner in an administrative mandate
proceeding “cannot simply present the court with the administrative record and
assert, without analysis or specific citations to the record, that the board’s
orders were against the weight of the evidence.”  (Shenouda
v. Veterinary Medical Bd. (2018)
27 Cal.App.5th 500, 513.) 
“Instead, the challenger must identify (with citations to the record)
the factual findings made by the board that he or she is challenging and
demonstrate (with citations to the record) why those factual findings were
against the weight of the evidence.”  (Ibid.)  Petitioner does not satisfy this standard with
respect to the Board’s detailed findings of guilt.  (See AR 2693-2705.)  Nevertheless, the court will address each of
Petitioner’s unsupported arguments.  
 
            1.         Petitioner
is subject to discipline for off-duty conduct 

 
It is well established
that police officers may be disciplined for off-duty misconduct that has a
reasonable nexus to their public employment. 
(See Anderson v. State Personnel Bd. (1987) 194 Cal.App.3d 761,
768-769; Cranston v. City of Richmond (1985) 40 Cal.3d 755; Blake v. State of
Personnel Board (1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 541, 550-551; Yancey v. State Personnel Bd. (1985) 167
Cal.App.3d 478, 481-483.)  Police officers
“are the guardians of the peace and security of the community, and the
efficiency of our whole system, designed for the purpose of maintaining law and
order, depends upon the extent to which such officers perform their duties and
are faithful to the trust reposed in them.”  (Hankla v. Long Beach
Civil Service Comm. (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1224.)  Further, “[t]here is ample precedent
for terminating the employment of law enforcement personnel who use their
weaponry under dubious circumstances,” including while off duty.  (Id. at 1223-24 [summarizing cases].) 
 
            2.         Petitioner’s
PTSD was not the exclusive cause of this incident 
 
Petitioner argues that his “PTSD-related dissociation, which was the
cause of his irrational state when he discharged his gun, was and is
uncontroverted.”  (Reply 4:27-28.)  That is not accurate, to the extent
Petitioner argues that his PTSD-related dissociation was the exclusive
cause of this incident.  In fact,
Petitioner’s own expert, Dr. Nadim Karim, opined that Petitioner’s alcohol use
“contributed to the commission of the instant offense conduct.”  (AR 3432.) 
Specifically, Dr, Karim found that Petitioner’s “consumption of alcohol
also impaired his decision making and his judgement [sic].”  (AR 3433.) 
Among
other findings, the Board concluded that Petitioner’s “planning was deficient”
with respect to his decision to carry a firearm because he “consumed extremely
large amounts of alcohol.”  (AR 2694.)      
 
            3.         The Department and Board applied the
correct standard 
 
When
reviewing a use-of-force incident, the Department uses the objectively
reasonable officer standard of Graham v. Connor (1989) 490 US 386. (AR
1282, 1304.)  In Graham, the
Supreme Court held that the use of force is “properly analyzed under the Fourth
Amendment’s ‘objective reasonableness’ standard.” (Id. at 388.)  “The ‘reasonableness’ of a particular use of
force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the
scene.” (Id. at 396.)   “[T]he ‘reasonableness’ inquiry in an
excessive force case is an objective one: the question is whether the officers’
actions are ‘objectively reasonable’ in light of facts and circumstances
confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.”
(Id. at 397.)  A current training
bulletin addresses off-duty actions and states that “officers taking police
action or that get involved in a use of force while off-duty are subject to the
same objectively reasonable standards used to adjudicate on-duty uses of
force.”  (AR 3332.)  
 
            Petitioner does not seriously
dispute that his actions on May 3, 2020—after a heavy night of drinking—did not
satisfy the Department’s policies with respect to tactics, drawing/exhibiting a
firearm, or use of lethal force. 
Petitioner also does not seriously dispute that his use of lethal force
on May 3, 2020, did not satisfy the objective reasonableness standard of Graham.  (See OB 17; Reply 4-6.)  Rather, Petitioner argues that the Graham
standard does not apply to him.  In his
reply brief, Petitioner argues: “The Department Use of Force policy
based on the Graham ‘reasonable officer’ standard does not contemplate
an officer who is incapable of acting rationally.”  (Reply 4.) 
Petitioner further argues that “an officer with Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder (‘PTSD’) may not always be capable of adhering to the ‘reasonable
officer’ standard.”  (Ibid.)  Petitioner cites no legal or LAPD authority in
support of his argument that the Graham standard does not apply to an
officer with a mental disorder (especially one who had been drinking heavily
shortly before the incident).[2]

 
                        4.         Conclusion  
            
            Based upon the foregoing, the court
finds that the weight of the evidence supports the Board’s findings that
Petitioner was guilty on all counts. 
(See AR 2693-2705.)  Petitioner
has not shown a prejudicial abuse of discretion in those findings.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5, subd. (b).) 
 
            B.        The
Penalty Does Not Reflect an Abuse of Discretion 
 
Petitioner
challenges the decision to terminate his employment.  “‘[T]he propriety of a penalty imposed by an
administrative agency is a matter vested in the discretion of the agency and
its decision may not be disturbed unless there has been a manifest abuse of
discretion.’ [Citations.]  ‘[I]n
reviewing the penalty imposed by an administrative body which is duly
constituted to announce and enforce such penalties, neither a trial court nor
an appellate court is free to substitute its own discretion as to the matter;
nor can the reviewing court interfere with the imposition of a penalty by an
administrative tribunal because in the court’s own evaluation of the
circumstances the penalty appears to be too harsh…. Such interference, in
the light of the foregoing authorities, will only be sanctioned when there is
an arbitrary, capricious or patently abusive exercise of discretion.’ [Citation.].”  (Cadilla v. Board of Medical Examiners (1972)
26 Cal.App.3d 961, 966.)  
 
In considering whether an abuse of discretion occurred, the
“overriding consideration … is the extent to which the employee’s conduct
resulted in, or if repeated is likely to result in, ‘[h]arm to the public
service.’ [Citations.] Other relevant factors include the circumstances
surrounding the misconduct and the likelihood of its recurrence.”  (Skelly
v. State Personnel Bd. (1975)
15 Cal.3d 194, 218.)  “If reasonable
minds may differ with regard to the appropriate disciplinary action, there is
no abuse of discretion.” (County of Los
Angeles v. Civil Service Commission (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 620, 634.)  
 
In the instant case, the Board considered several mitigating
factors, including that Petitioner has one major commendation and 60 minor
commendations; Petitioner had no prior disciplinary history; and Petitioner
served in three combat deployments in the armed forces.  (AR 3035-36.) 
The Board also considered testimony from Richard Stabile, a retired LAPD
captain, that the Department can accommodate officers who are not permitted to
carry guns by reassigning them to other positions within the City.  (AR 3037-38.) 
The Board also considered aggravating factors.  Captain Robin Petillo, who had until recently
served as the Department’s commanding officer for risk management and legal
affairs, testified that Petitioner’s off-duty misconduct was unique in that “no
other officer-involved shooting occurred in a situation … where the officer was
arrested for shooting another officer under a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon.”  (AR 3038-39.)  Petillo testified that there is no position
available to Petitioner to return to work and that there are no positions for a
police officer to not have a firearm. 
(AR 3039.)  
 
The Board also noted that Petitioner’s own expert, Dr.
Karim, “testified during the case in chief that he would not recommend
[Petitioner] carry a firearm if he returns to work given the nature of his
P.T.S.D. history.”  (AR 3039; see AR
1032, 1088.)  In light of this testimony from Dr. Karim, as
well as testimony of Dr. Edrick Dorian about PTSD, the Board did not credit Dr.
Karim’s testimony that there was “no risk” Petitioner would recidivate.  (AR 3039-40.) 
Petitioner has not challenged that credibility determination.  In any event, exercising its independent
judgment on the record, the court agrees with the Board that Dr. Karim’s
opinion that there was “no risk” of recidivism was exaggerated and lacking in
credibility. 
 
Further, the Board found that the “magnitude of the
misconduct” justified a severe penalty, regardless of whether Petitioner should
be armed or could serve in an unarmed capacity. 
(AR 3040.)  Board reasoned that
the incident on May 3, 2020, was “egregious” in that Petitioner “shot another
officer while off duty and as a result be charged with assault with a deadly
weapon” and Petitioner’s conduct “was in reckless disregard to his training and
experience.”  (AR 3041.)  Based on the totality of the circumstances—which
included his decision to carry a firearm after he “consumed extremely large
amounts of alcohol,” a factor unrelated to Petitioner’s mental health issues—the
Board concluded that termination was the appropriate penalty.  (Ibid.)
 
Petitioner
argues that the decision to terminate Petitioner constituted an abuse of
discretion because there were alternative remedies, such as a disability
retirement or reclassification to a civilian position.  The court disagrees.  Petitioner failed to comply with the
Department’s policies regarding use of a firearm, which apply to police
officers while off-duty.  Petitioner
exhibited poor judgment in carrying a firearm after consuming large amounts of
alcohol, which played a role in him shooting another officer.  There is credible evidence that Petitioner
should not be permitted to carry a gun and that no unarmed police officer
positions were available for Petitioner. 
It was reasonable under these circumstances for the Board and the Chief
to conclude that “any discipline less than termination would not be sufficient
in light of the facts and circumstances of this case.”  (AR 3041-3042.)  
 
Petitioner
argues that the Chief “should have applied, on Petitioner’s behalf, for a
disability pension, pursuant to Los Angeles City Charter Section 1312.”  (OB 17:21-23; Reply 6-7.)  As an initial matter, Petitioner does not
show (by citation to the record) that he raised this issue before the
Board.  (See OB 17:27-28, citing AR
3031-3034.)  Moreover, section 1312 applies
to employees hired “on or before January 28, 1967,” who are known as “Tier 1
Members.”  (See Los Angeles City Charter
§ 1300.)  Petitioner was hired by Department
in 2006.  (AR 1347.)  Regardless, according to his motion to
augment the record, Petitioner himself applied for and received a disability pension.  
 
Petitioner also argues: “Pursuant to the Americans With Disabilities Act and the
State FEHA law, the City recognizes its obligation to accommodate an employee’s
limitations where possible.”  (OB
18:12-14.)  Because Petitioner provides
no legal argument in connection with this statement, he waived the
contention.  (Nelson
v. Avondale HOA (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 857, 862-863 [“When an appellant
fails to raise a point, or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned
argument and citations to authority, we treat the point as waived.”].)  Regardless, the Board considered evidence
that no alternative position was available for a police officer who could not
carry a firearm.
 
In
sum, the Board considered both the aggravating and mitigating factors and
concluded that termination was an appropriate remedy based upon the “magnitude
of the misconduct.”  Petitioner has not
demonstrated a manifest abuse of discretion in reaching this decision.   
 
C.        The Motion to Augment is Denied 
 
On March 18, 2024, after Respondents’
opposition brief had been filed, Petitioner filed a motion to augment the
administrative record with two documents: (1) Petitioner’s application for
disability pension benefits dated October 13, 2020; and (2) Findings of Fact
adopted by the Board of Fire and Police Pension Commissioners on March 7, 2024,
and dated March 8, 2024, regarding Petitioner’s application for a disability
pension.  On March 29, 2024, Respondents
filed and served an objection to the motion, which responded to the merits. 
 
“As a general rule, a hearing on
a writ of administrative mandamus is conducted solely on the record of the
proceeding before the administrative agency.” 
(Richardson v. City and County of San Francisco (2013) 214
Cal.App.4th 671, 702.)  Relevant evidence
may be admitted if, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, it could not have
been produced or was improperly excluded at the administrative hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(e).)  “If the moving party fails to make the
required showing, it is an abuse of the court’s discretion to [augment the
record].”  (Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 55
Cal.App.4th 93, 102.)
 
            Putting
aside the untimeliness of this motion, Petitioner’s disability pension benefits
application dated October 13, 2020, predates the Board of Rights hearings,
which commenced in May 2021.  (See AR
2.)  Petitioner could have, with the
exercise of reasonable diligence, submitted this application as evidence in the
Board of Rights proceedings.  
 
To
the extent Petitioner seeks to rely on the findings of the Board of Fire and
Police Pension Commissioners (the “Pension Board”) that he suffers from PTSD,
that is not relevant.  These findings
were made on March 7, 2024, approximately one year before the Board of Rights
hearing and the Chief’s decision to terminate Petitioner.  Because the Pension Board’s findings did not
exist in March 2023, they are not relevant to the decision to terminate
Petitioner.  Regardless, the findings are
not relevant because it was undisputed that he suffers from PTSD.  Therefore, Petitioner’s motion to augment the
record is denied.
