 Case Number:  24STCV05088    Hearing Date:   October 18, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Hearing on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Sydney Eilbacher brings this action against Defendants
Spex Sea Bird Ltd. and Lindbald Expeditions, LLC (“Defendants”), alleging violations
of the Jones Act and general maritime law. 

The motion now before the Court is Defendants’ Motion
to Dismiss
 
LEGAL STANDARD

“In California, the procedure for enforcing a forum selection clause is a
motion to stay or dismiss for forum non conveniens pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure sections 410.30 and 418.10.” Berg v. MTC Electronics Technologies
(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 349, 358 (Berg).) “[A] motion based on a forum selection
clause is a special type of forum non conveniens motion. The factors that apply
generally to a forum non conveniens motion do not control in a case involving a
mandatory forum selection clause.” Ibid.
On a motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens
pursuant to a mandatory forum selection clause, the only issues for the court's
consideration are (1) whether the forum selection clause is indeed mandatory,
as opposed to permissive; (2) whether the forum selection clause covers the
claims in the case; and (3) whether the forum selection clause is “unreasonable.”
Id. at pp. 358-359.)
Regarding reasonableness, “[m]ere inconvenience or
additional expense is not the test.” Smith, Valentino & Smith, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1976) 17 Cal.3d 491, 496. Instead, a forum selection
clause is unreasonable if “the forum selected would be unavailable or unable to
accomplish substantial justice.” CQL Original Products, Inc. v. National
Hockey League Players' Assn. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1347, 1354. In making
this determination, the choice of forum “must have some rational basis in light
of the facts underlying the transaction.” Ibid.
Under federal law, “When parties have contracted in
advance to litigate disputes in a particular forum, courts should not
unnecessarily disrupt the parties’ settled expectations…. In all but the most
unusual cases, therefore, ‘the interest of justice’ is served by holding
parties to their bargain.” Atl. Marine Constr. Co. v. United States Dist.
Court (2013) 571 U.S. 49, 66. (Atl. Marine).
 
ANALYSIS
It is undisputed that Plaintiff’s employment agreement
with Defendants includes a forum selection clause stating, “The exclusive venue
for any disagreement relating to your employment or this Agreement shall be in
the federal or state courts in King County, Washington. This Agreement and the
employment relationship shall be interpreted and enforced according to the general
and statutory Maritime Law of the United States as interpreted in the Western
District of Washington which shall not be supplemented by state or local law.”
Declaration of Bille McCaslin, Ex. A.  
 
Applicable law 
As an initial matter, the Court must determine whether
the forum selection clause's enforceability is governed by state or federal
law.  
“State and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction
in Jones Act, … and general maritime law cases. State courts apply federal
substantive law in deciding such cases.” Gault v. Modern Continental/Roadway
Constr. Co. (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 991, 997. 
“Article III of the United States Constitution gives
federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over all admiralty and maritime matters,
but 28 United States Code section 1333(1) grants state courts concurrent
jurisdiction under the so-called ‘saving to suitors clause.’ This clause
provides for in personam remedies which ‘means that an injured party may have
claims arising from a single accident under both federal maritime and state
common or statutory law. State remedies under the savings to suitors clause may
be pursued in state court or, if there is a basis for federal jurisdiction, in
federal court. A maritime claim brought in the common law state courts is
governed by federal maritime law, however.’ This is sometimes referred to as
the reverse-Erie doctrine.” Price v. Connolly-Pacific Co. (2008) 162
Cal.App.4th 1210, 1213-1214 (quoting Barber v. Marina Sailing, Inc.
(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 558, 563. 
Federal law governs the enforceability of a
forum-selection clause in cases at admiralty. Carnival Cruise Lines v. Shute
(1991) 499 U.S. 585, 590. 
“The Erie doctrine (Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins
(1938) 304 U.S. 64) requires that a federal court sitting in diversity
jurisdiction over a state law claim must apply state substantive law in
resolving a dispute. However, the extent to which state law may be used to
remedy maritime injuries is constrained by a so-called reverse-Erie
doctrine which requires that substantive remedies afforded by the states
conform to governing federal maritime standards.” Id. at 1214, fn. 1.
(citing Hutchins v. Juneau Tanker Corp. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 493, 499.)

The Court finds persuasive the reasoning of the Erie
analysis in Manetti-Farrow, Inc. v. Gucci America, Inc. (9th Cir.
1988) 858 F.2d 509, 513, which held “the federal procedural issues raised by
forum selection clauses significantly outweigh the state interests, and the
federal rule … controls enforcement of forum clauses in diversity cases.” This
decision is further supported by the Supreme Court’s subsequent decisions clarifying
the strong federal preference for enforcing forum selection clauses, which
increases the risk of forum shopping. See, e.g., Atl. Marine, supra, 571
U.S. at p. 66. 
Jones Act
Plaintiff argues that the forum selection clause is unenforceable
because the Jones Act incorporates the special venue provision of the Federal Employer’s
Liability Act (FELA), which preempts contractual forum selection clauses.  
The Jones Act provides “a seaman injured in the course
of employment or, if the seaman dies from the injury, the personal
representative of the seaman may elect to bring a civil action at law, with the
right of trial by jury, against the employer. Laws of the United States regulating
recovery for personal injury to, or death of, a railway employee apply to an
action under this section.” Courts interpreting FELA, which governs “recovery
for personal injury to, or death of, a railway employee” have held it prohibits
forum selection clauses in employment contracts between railway workers and
their employers. See Boyd v. Grand T. W. R. Co., (1949) 338 U.S. 263,
266. This interpretation is based on section five of FELA, which provides that “[a]ny
contract, rule, regulation, or device whatsoever, the purpose or intent of
which shall be to enable any common carrier to exempt itself from any liability
created by [FELA], shall to that extent be void . . .” and section six, a venue
provision, provides that “an action may be brought in a district court of the
United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which
the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at
the time of commencing such action.” 45 U.S.C. §§ 55, 56. 
While the Jones Act incorporates some FELA provisions,
the Supreme Court cautions “[the] “provision providing that a seaman should
have the same right of action as would a railroad employee does not mean that
the very words of the FELA must be lifted bodily from their context and
applied mechanically to the specific facts of maritime events.” Cox v. Roth
(1955) 348 U.S. 207, 209. Though there is no binding authority on this issue,
the overwhelming consensus among federal district courts is that the Jones Act
does not incorporate the FELA venue provision. See, e.g., Matthews v.
Tidewater Crewing, Ltd. (E.D.La. Apr. 25, 2023, No. 21-1530) 2023
U.S.Dist.LEXIS 238526, at *9; Brister v. ACBL River Operations LLC
(E.D.La. Feb. 7, 2018, No. 17-6035) 2018 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 19719.; Riley v.
Trident Seafoods Corp. (D.Minn. Jan. 9, 2012, No. 11-2500 (MJD/AJB)) 2012
U.S.Dist.LEXIS 9002.; Utoafili v. Trident Seafoods Corp. (N.D.Cal. Oct.
19, 2009, No. 09-2575 SC) 2009 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 127109. Moreover, Plaintiff cites
no case holding that the Jones Act incorporates FELA’s special venue provision.
Before 2008, the Jones Act had its own venue
provision.  However, in January 2008,
Congress deleted the venue provision from the Jones Act. See National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, 110 P.L. 181, § 3521, 122 Stat.
3, 596 (2008) (“2008 Amendment”). Plaintiff argues that by deleting the Jones
Act venue provision, Congress intended to incorporate the FELA venue provision
and related case law.  However, the Court
finds persuasive the discussion of legislative history in Utoafili,
which explains that the deletion was simply a codification of existing case law
not intended to make any substantive change. Utoafili v. Trident Seafoods
Corp. (N.D.Cal. Oct. 19, 2009, No. 09-2575 SC) 2009 U.S.Dist.LEXIS 127109,
at *15; see also H. Rept. 110-437 - UPDATE AND IMPROVE THE CODIFICATION
OF TITLE 46, UNITED STATES CODE (House of Representatives Committee on the
Judiciary report explaining the intent of the 2008 amendment). Considering this
legislative history, the Court agrees with the federal district court consensus
that the FELA’s venue provisions do not apply to Jones Act cases.  
The Court finds that a mandatory forum selection
clause governs these claims. Because Plaintiff has not provided any
evidence that this is a “most unusual case[]” warranting departure from the
strong federal policy of enforcing forum selection clauses, the motion to
dismiss is granted. Atl. Marine, supra, 571 U.S. at p. 66. 
Moreover, the Court would reach the same
conclusion applying California’s law on forum selection clause enforceability
because there is no evidence that the clause is unreasonable or that the
selected forum is unavailable. On the contrary, the Court takes judicial notice
of the fact that Plaintiff filed a parallel complaint in the Superior Court of
the State of Washington for the County of King. Declaration of Nathan J. Beard,
Ex. G.

Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is granted.
