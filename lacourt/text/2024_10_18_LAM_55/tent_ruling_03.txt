 Case Number:  24STCV11590    Hearing Date:   October 18, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS: Hearing on Salvador Munoz's Hearing on Motion to Quash
 
Salvador Munoz's Motion to Quash Service of Summons is denied. 
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs, Daniel Onofre, Maria
Mazariegos Marquez, and Daniel Onofre Jr., Angie Delilah Onofre, and Zachary
Marquez, brought this habitability action against Defendants Salvador Munoz, Ana
M. Hernandez, as trustee of the Ana Maria Hernandez Trust, and Doe Defendants
1-50. 
On August 23, 2024, default was entered as to Salvador Munoz
and Ana M. Hernandez.  
 
The motion now before the Court is Salvador Munoz's Motion to Quash
Service of Summons.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Entry of default deprives the Court of jurisdiction to
consider any motion other than a motion from relief from default. W.A. Rose
Co. v. Municipal Court for Oakland-Piedmont Judicial Dist., Alameda County (1959)
176 Cal.App.2d 67, 72. 
 
ANALYSIS
Here, Munoz’s motion to quash was filed on August 28, 2024,
while he was in default. Moreover, Munoz has yet to successfully set aside or
vacate the entry of default against him. Accordingly, the Court is without
jurisdiction to consider the instant motion.
For that reason, Munoz’s motion to quash is denied.  
 
CONCLUSION
Salvador Munoz's Hearing on Motion to Quash summons is denied.
