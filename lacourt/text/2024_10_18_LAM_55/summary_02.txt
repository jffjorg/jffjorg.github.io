And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants, Spex Sea Bird Ltd. and Lindbald Expeditions, LLC, in a lawsuit brought by the plaintiff, Sydney Eilbacher. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants violated the Jones Act and general maritime law. The defendants argue that the forum selection clause in the plaintiff's employment agreement, which requires disputes to be resolved in federal or state courts in King County, Washington, should be enforced.

The judge finds that the forum selection clause is mandatory and covers the claims in the case. The judge further finds that the clause is reasonable and that the selected forum is not unavailable or unable to accomplish substantial justice. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not provided any evidence that this is a "most unusual case" warranting departure from the strong federal policy of enforcing forum selection clauses.

Therefore, the judge grants the defendants' motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiff's claims must be litigated in King County, Washington, as required by the forum selection clause.
