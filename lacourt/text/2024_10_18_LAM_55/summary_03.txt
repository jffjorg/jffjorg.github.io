And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Salvador Munoz's motion to quash service of summons. Munoz filed the motion on August 28, 2024, while he was in default. Moreover, he has not yet successfully set aside or vacated the entry of default against him. As a result, the court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motion. The judge relies on the legal standard set forth in W.A. Rose Co. v. Municipal Court for Oakland-Piedmont Judicial Dist., Alameda County (1959), which holds that entry of default deprives the court of jurisdiction to consider any motion other than a motion from relief from default. Therefore, Munoz's motion to quash is denied.
