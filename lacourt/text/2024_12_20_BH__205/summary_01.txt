Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendants' motion to continue the trial date. The motion seeks a four-month continuance from January 21, 2025 to May 19, 2025. The Court has decided to grant a shorter continuance of two months, moving the trial date to March 24, 2025.

The Court's decision is based on the fact that Plaintiff's deposition was not taken until October 30, 2024, despite Defendants' diligent efforts to schedule it earlier. Additionally, Plaintiff testified to additional damages not previously disclosed in her discovery responses, and Defendants need additional time to obtain discovery relating to these damages.

The Court has considered the legal standard for granting continuances, which requires a showing of good cause. The Court has also considered relevant factors, including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem.

The Court has concluded that a short two-month continuance is warranted to allow Defendants to obtain the additional records they seek. The parties are directed to file a new motion to continue if additional time is needed.
