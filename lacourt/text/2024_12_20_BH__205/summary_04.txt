And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying defendant Zeynep Atesoglu's motion to set aside a default judgment entered against her in an unlawful detainer action. The court found that defendant's counsel failed to meet the burden of demonstrating that the default was entered through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The court cited evidence that counsel was served with notice of the trial setting and that there was a certificate of mailing showing that the notice was mailed to his office, but counsel claimed that he did not receive the notice and failed to check the court system. The court did not credit these claims and concluded that defendant failed to meet her burden of proof. The court also denied defendant's request for a stay of the lockout, finding that defendant has not stated a basis to justify the stay and that a stay would prejudice plaintiff.
