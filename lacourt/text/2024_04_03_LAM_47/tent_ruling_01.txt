DISCUSSION:
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admissions
(Set Two)
 
            Defendant
moves to compel further responses to requests for admissions Nos. 28 through
30. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.290(a) provides that “[o]n receipt of a response
to requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an
order compelling a further response if that party deems that either or both of
the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular request is evasive or
incomplete; (2) An objection to a particular request is without merit or too
general.” (Code Civ. Proc § 2033.290(a).)
 
The burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure
to fully answer the requests. (See Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
Meet and Confer
 
A party making a motion to compel further
responses must also include a declaration stating facts showing a “reasonable
and good faith attempt” to resolve informally the issues presented by the
motion before filing the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2033.290(b).)
 
The Declaration of Eliot
Cartwright attached to this motion states that the parties met and conferred
via email concerning the operative responses to Defendant’s discovery between January
16, 2024 and February 13, 2024, without success. (Declaration of Eliot L.
Cartwright ISO Mot. ¶¶ 5-8, Exhs. D-E.) Defendant has therefore complied with
its statutory meet-and-confer obligation. 
 
Timing
 
            A motion to
compel further responses to requests for admission must be served “within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.290(c).) The 45-day requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton
v. Superior Court¿(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
            Here,
Defendant’s responses were served on December 4, 2023. (Cartwright Decl. ¶ 4,
Exh. C.) The parties agreed in writing to extend the time to file this motion
to February 21, 2024, the date this motion was filed. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. E.)
The motion is therefore timely.
Analysis
 
            Defendant moves
to compel further responses to Requests for Admissions Nos. 28 through 30
propounded to Plaintiff. Defendant propounded its second set of Requests for
Admissions on October 27, 2023. (Cartwright Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Plaintiff
served responses on December 4, 2023. (Id. ¶ 4, Exh. C.) 
 
            Each of the
Requests for Admission at issue demands that Plaintiff admit that an agreement
between Plaintiff and Pro-Com Products established certain rights and
obligations for each party with respect to the disposition of Plaintiff’s
products stored at the subject property. Plaintiff responded to each request
with a partial admission that recited portions of the agreement, followed by a denial
to the extent that the admission is sought as to all products at the property,
because the agreement was not applicable to all products at the property. 
 
            Specifically,
Request No. 28 states: 
 
Admit that Section 1, “Sale By
Consignment,” of the CONSIGNMENT AGREEMENT permitted PRO-COM, as the consignee,
to place orders for the sale of YOUR products located at the LOSS LOCATION,
subject to YOUR right to refuse to fill such orders.
 
(Defendant’s Exh. A. No. 28.) 
 
            Plaintiff
responded:
 
Admit in part that the Consignment
Agreement section 1 states, “The Consignee will, from time to time, place
orders for the Products from the Consignor. The Consignor may, at its sole
discretion, accept such orders and ship such Products on consignment to the
Consignee, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The Consignee shall take delivery and make payment as required
hereunder for all Products ordered by it, but nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed to obligate the Consignor to fill any or all of the Consignee's
orders for Products.” Denied to the extent the Consignment Agreement defines
“Products” as “certain products” which Consignor wishes to sell on consignment,
not all of 3BTech’s products at a certain location and the agreement predated
later memorandum of understanding between Pro-Com and 3BTech regarding 3BTech’s
inventory at the 1250 Bixby warehouse as of 12/4/2020, and therefore the
Consignment Agreement is not applicable to all of 3BTech’s products at the 1250
Bixby warehouse as of 12/4/2020.
 
(Defendant’s Exh. C. No. 28.) The responses to Requests Nos.
29 and 30 are similar. These requests state:
 
            [No. 29]:
 
Admit that Section 2, "Ownership
of Products," of the CONSIGNMENT AGREEMENT permitted PRO-COM, as the
consignee, to transfer title, property, and ownership of YOUR products located
at the LOSS LOCATION "by bona fide sale by or to the Consignee
[PROCOM]."
 
[No. 30]:
 
Admit that Section 6, “Property
Insurance,” of the CONSIGNMENT AGREEMENT obligated PRO-COM to “procure and
maintain All Risk property insurance coverage [for] at least $3,000,000” with
YOU “named a loss payee on such policy pertaining to the Consignor’s Products
stored and maintained at Consignee’s location(s) in accordance with this
Agreement, as applicable, to the extent of Consignor insurable interest.”
 
(Exh. A. Nos 29-30.) Plaintiff
responded:
 
            [No.
29]:
 
Admit in part that the Consignment
Agreement section 2 states, “Title to, and property and ownership in, all
Products shall remain with the Consignor until such time as their removal may
be directed in writing by the Consignor or until such time as they may be
disposed of by bona fide sale by or to the Consignee or as may otherwise be
hereinafter provided.” Denied to the extent the Consignment Agreement defines
“Products” as “certain products” which Consignor wishes to sell on consignment,
not all of 3BTech’s products at a certain location and the agreement predated
later memorandum of understanding between Pro-Com and 3BTech regarding 3BTech’s
inventory at the 1250 Bixby warehouse as of 12/4/2020, and therefore the
Consignment Agreement is not applicable to all of 3BTech’s products at the 1250
Bixby warehouse as of 12/4/2020.
 
[No. 30]:
 
Admit in part that the Consignment
Agreement section 6 states, “The parties expressly agree that the Consignee
shall procure and maintain All Risk property insurance coverage at least
$3,000,000, including flood and earthquake coverage, for Consignor's property
that is in their care, custody or control. Consignor shall be named a loss
payee on such policy pertaining to the Consignor's Products stored and
maintained at Consignee's location(s) in accordance with this Agreement, as
applicable, to the extent of Consignor insurable interest.” Denied to the
extent the Consignment Agreement defines “Products” as “certain products” which
Consignor wishes to sell on consignment, not all of 3BTech’s products at a
certain location and the agreement predated later Memorandum of Understanding
between Pro-Com and 3BTech regarding 3BTech’s inventory at the 1250 Bixby
warehouse as of 12/4/2020, and therefore the Consignment Agreement is not
applicable to all of 3BTech’s products at the 1250 Bixby warehouse as of
12/4/2020.
 
(Defendant’s Exh. C. Nos. 29-30.)
 
            Defendant
contends that these responses are evasive and unintelligible, and that further
responses should be compelled. The Court does not agree. Although the responses
are verbose, they can be summarized as admissions of the truth of the
statements of Plaintiff and Pro-Com’s rights and obligations with respect to
Plaintiff’s products governed by the agreement, with the qualifier that not all
products at the subject property were within the scope of the agreement. These
are straightforward responses, and an order compelling further responses is not
required. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admissions (Set
Two) is DENIED. 
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set Two)
 
            Defendant
moves to compel further responses to form interrogatories propounded to
Plaintiff. 
 
Legal Standards
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the
court finds that: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete[;] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate[; or] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”
 
The burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure
to fully answer the interrogatories. Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.
 
Meet and
Confer
 
A party making a
motion to compel further responses must include a declaration stating facts
showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve informally the issues
presented by the motion before filing the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2016.040, 2030.310(b).) 
 
The Declaration of Eliot
Cartwright attached to this motion states that the parties met and conferred
via email concerning the operative responses to Defendant’s discovery between January
16, 2024 and February 13, 2024, without success. (Declaration of Eliot L.
Cartwright ISO Mot. ¶¶ 5-8, Exhs. D-E.) Defendant has therefore complied with
its statutory meet-and-confer obligation. 
 
Timeliness
 
A
motion to compel a further response must be noticed within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental response, or on or before
any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party
have agreed in writing.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(c),
2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.) Otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel further responses. (Id.) The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.
App. 4th 1403, 1410.)
 
            Here,
Defendant’s responses were served on December 4, 2023. (Cartwright Decl. ¶ 4,
Exh. C.) The parties agreed in writing to extend the time to file this motion
to February 21, 2024, the date this motion was filed. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. E.)
The motion is therefore timely.
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
moves to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 with respect
to Requests for Admissions Nos. 28-30, 56, 57, 60-63, 66, and 67 propounded to
Plaintiff. Defendant propounded its second set of Requests for Admissions and
Form Interrogatories on October 27, 2023. (Cartwright Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.)
Plaintiff served responses on December 4, 2023. (Id. ¶ 4, Exh. C.) 
 
            Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 asks,
for each response to the accompanying requests for admission that is not an
unqualified admission, for the respondent to state (a) the number of the
request, (b) all facts upon which the response is based, (c) the contact
information of all persons with knowledge of those facts, and (d) identify all
documents and other tangible things supporting the response and the contact
information of each person who has them. (See Defendant’s Exh. A. No. 17.1) 
 
            With respect to Requests for
Admissions Nos. 28-30, Defendant’s motion is based on the alleged inadequacy of
Plaintiff’s responses to the Requests for Admissions. As the Court has rejected
Defendant’s challenge for the reasons stated above, a further response with
respect to these requests is not required. 
 
            The balance of the requests at issue
asked Plaintiff to admit that certain items listed on the inventory lists
described as the “3BTech Inventory” and “Pro-Com Inventory” were not listed on
the FDA’s White List as
personal protective equipment authorized to be sold in the United States (Nos. 56,
62), were not certified by any regulatory body (Nos. 57, 63), did not satisfy
N95 requirements, (Nos. 60, 66), and could not legally be sold in the United
States at the time of the fire. (Nos. 61, 67.) 
 
            Plaintiff,
in response to each request for admission at issue, objected to the key terms
in the request as “ambiguous” and objected to the identification of the Pro-Com
Inventory list as belonging solely to Pro-Com, (Defendant’s Exh. F. Nos. 56-57,
60-63, 66-67.) Plaintiff also responded to each request to a categorical denial
subject to those objections. (Id.) 
 
            Turning now
to Plaintiff’s response to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1, Plaintiff responded
with respect to Requests 56, 57, 60, 62, 63, and 66 with responses that are
substantively identical to responses to analogous requests in Defendant’s first
set of requests for admissions and form interrogatories. (Compare Defendant’s
Exh. G. with Exh. K ISO Mot. filed February 16, 2024.) These responses were
addressed in Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One) heard on March 15, 2024.) The Court finds here that
Plaintiff has failed to respond straight-forwardly as to the denial of Request No.
56 because the answer provides no specific information about whether “the
eleventh item from the bottom of page two” of the referenced inventory was
“listed” on the Whitelist.  Plaintiff’s
response with respect to Request No. 62 suffers from the same problem.  Plaintiff’s responses regarding Requests Nos.
57 and 63 are confusing.  If Plaintiff’s
position is that the referenced masks met the specifications for certification
but were not awarded that status, it should say so.  Although not particularly clear, Plaintiff’s
responses to Requests Nos. 60 and 66 appear to convey that the products on the
list constituted eligible alternatives to the N95 masks because they satisfied
the requirements at that time.  If that
is Plaintiff’s position, it could be stated more clearly, but does not require
another supplemental response.  Accordingly,
Defendant is entitled to further responses as to Requests Nos. 56, 57, 62 and
63, but not to Requests 60 or 66. 
 
            As to
requests Nos. 61 and 67, Plaintiff responded: 
 
[No. 61]
 
(b) Exhibit “C” to the Request For
Admissions Set Two is an inventory list which comprises 3BTech’s inventory at
1250 Bixby, a subset of Exhibit “A” provided by Greenspan Public Adjusters to
both Great Northern and Liberty Mutual insurance adjusters on 12/10/2020, after
the 12/4/2020 fire under the file name “Bixby Inventory as of 20201205.pdf,”
that listed all stock at the facility at the time of the 12/4/2020 fire,
including both 3BTech and Pro-Com inventories. This request is ambiguous as to
the reference to “could not be legally sold in the United States of America.”
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, government agencies issued emergency
authorizations for use and other waivers and eligibility criteria modifying the
qualified manufacturers and product equivalencies, among other requirements.
The referenced masks owned by 3BTech on the subject inventory are believed to
have been “KN95” compliant masks and, as of the date of the fire, are believed
to have complied with all KN95 requirements. 
 
(c) Johnny Zhu – current President of
3BTech, to be contacted through counsel; Brett Barbour – former President of
3BTech, to be contacted through counsel; 
 
(d) Those documents relevant to the
testing and certification that survived the fire and 3BTECH presently possesses
were disclosed and produced as 3BTECH 1728-1795; also GREENSPAN316-0328. 
 
Discovery Continues
 
[No. 67]:
 
(b) Exhibit “C” to the Request For
Admissions Set Two is an inventory list which comprises 3BTech’s inventory at
1250 Bixby, a subset of Exhibit “A” provided by Greenspan Public Adjusters to
both Great Northern and Liberty Mutual insurance adjusters on 12/10/2020, after
the 12/4/2020 fire under the file name “Bixby Inventory as of 20201205.pdf,”
that listed all stock at the facility at the time of the 12/4/2020 fire,
including both 3BTech and Pro-Com inventories. This request is ambiguous as to
the reference to “could not be legally sold in the United States of America.”
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, government agencies issued emergency
authorizations for use and other waivers and eligibility criteria modifying the
qualified manufacturers and product equivalencies, among other requirements.
The referenced masks owned by 3BTech on the subject inventory are believed to

to have complied with all KN95 requirements. 
 
(c) Johnny Zhu – current President of
3BTech, to be contacted through counsel; Brett Barbour – former President of

(d) Those documents relevant to the
testing and certification that survived the fire and 3BTECH presently possesses
were disclosed and produced as 3BTECH 1728-1795; also GREENSPAN316-0328.
 
 Discovery Continues
 
(Defendant’s Exh. G. Nos. 61, 67.) Plaintiff contends that
these responses are sufficient because the items at issue were subject to
emergency authorizations by governmental agencies, and therefore could be sold
in the United States, notwithstanding the ordinary certification process.
(Opposition p. 7:1-5.) This statement would be sufficient if it were included
in the response provided to Defendant. It was not. The responses actually
served merely state that there were emergency use authorizations, without explaining
the applicability of those authorizations to the items at issue. The responses
served are inadequate and must be supplemented. 
 
Conclusion:
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories is GRANTED IN PART with respect to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1
and Requests for Admissions Nos. Requests Nos. 56, 57, 61, 62, 63, and 67 only.

 
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Admissions (Set Two) is DENIED.
