And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted in part the plaintiff's motion to quash the deposition subpoenas for production of business records. The subpoenas, which were served on various medical providers, sought a broad range of documents and medical records. The plaintiff argued that the subpoenas violated her right to privacy in her medical records, violated the physician-patient privilege, and violated her right to privacy in her financial information. The court found that while a plaintiff suing for personal injuries waives the physician-patient privilege to some extent, this does not make discoverable all of a plaintiff's lifetime medical history. The court modified and restricted the subpoenas to seek only those medical records and billing information relevant to the plaintiff's injuries or issues with her neck, shoulders, left wrist, lower back, right knee, and right ankle, for the period of May 28, 2017 (5 years prior to the accident) to the present.
