The application shall be filed in the court that entered the prefiling order, either in the action in which the prefiling order was entered or in conjunction with a request to the presiding justice or presiding judge to file new litigation under Section 391.7. The application shall be made before the justice or judge who entered the order, if that justice or judge is available. If that justice or judge who entered the order is not available, the application shall be made before the presiding justice or presiding judge, or his or her designee.(b) A vexatious litigant whose application under subdivision (a) was denied shall not be permitted to file another application on or before 12 months has elapsed after the date of the denial of the previous application.(c) A court may vacate a prefiling order and order removal of a vexatious litigant's name from the Judicial Council's list of vexatious litigants subject to prefiling orders upon a showing of a material change in the facts upon which the order was granted and that the ends of justice would be served by vacating the order.(CCP § 391.8.)             Erasure of the vexatious litigant designation “requires substantial evidence that the vexatious litigant has mended ‘his ways or conduct.’”  (Luckett v. Panos (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 77, 83.)  Some factors that bear on whether a vexatious litigant has “mended his ways” include:First, it goes without saying the applicant must show a propensity for honesty in his or her application. That means an accurate confrontation with the facts on which the prior vexatious litigant finding was made, as well as intervening facts that might not put the application in a favorable light.…Second, the applicant should show some genuine remorse for the costs of litigation inflicted on the defendants who were the object of previous lawsuits.…Third, in the same vein as section 68511.3, subdivision (d)(1)'s requirement that in forma pauperis litigants notify the court within five days of any changed financial circumstances allowing them to pay part or all of their filing fees, an applicant to erase vexatious litigant status should, consistent with his or her financial situation, show some genuine effort at restitution toward the previous victims of his litigation, including actual payment of cost orders made by the courts in that litigation.…Fourth, the applicant must actually give up the habit of suing people as a way of life. It is not some success in litigation, even after a person is adjudged to be a vexatious litigant, that shows a change of circumstances. Just the opposite is the case. Even some interim procedural success may simply encourage the habit of litigation as a way of spending one's free time.(Luckett, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at 93-94.)DISCUSSIONA.   Prefiling Order and Relevant Background in This ActionOn February 11, 2019, in this action, Case No. BC626405 Antranik Kevorkian v. Lisa Hastings (“Hastings Action”), the Court granted in part and denied in part defendant Lisa Hastings’ motion to declare Plaintiff a vexatious litigant.  The Court found that Ms. Hastings had established that Plaintiff was a “vexatious litigant” within the meaning of CCP § 391 and thereby entered a prefiling order pursuant to CCP § 391.7, prohibiting Plaintiff from filing any new litigation in the courts of this state in propia persona without first obtaining leave of the presiding justice or presiding judge of the court where litigation was proposed to be filed.  The Court denied without prejudice the relief requested under sections 391.1 and 391.3 (i.e., requiring Plaintiff to furnish security prior to filing new litigation and not allowing him to proceed in forma pauperis).  That same day, the Court entered a Prefiling Order – Vexatious Litigant (Form VL-100) against Plaintiff. On March 22, 2019, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration (CCP § 1008(a)) of the February 11, 2019 ruling declaring him a vexatious litigant. On April 8, 2019, the Court denied Plaintiff’s “Order on Application to Vacate Prefiling Order and Remove Plaintiff/Petitioner from Judicial Council Vexatious Litigant List” (Form VL-125). On June 14, 2019, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the orders entered on February 11, 2019, March 22, 2019, and April 8, 2019. Plaintiff appealed.  On April 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal issued a Remittitur, attaching a decision dated January 23, 2020.  The Court of Appeal affirmed this Court’s June 14, 2019 order denying Plaintiff’s CCP § 473(d) motion to set aside the prefiling order.[1]On October 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion under CCP § 391.8 for an order vacating the prefiling order and removing Plaintiff from the vexatious litigant list issued pursuant to CCP § 391.7(a) in this action.  On December 3, 2021, the Court denied the motion to vacate. Plaintiff appealed this Court’s December 3, 2021 order.  On September 15, 2022, the Court of Appeal issued a remittitur, which attached the Court of Appeal’s May 19, 2022 order.  The Court of Appeal found that because Plaintiff was subject to a prefiling order, he was required to obtain leave of the administrative presiding justice of the court before filing his notice of appeal, which he failed to do.  The Court of Appeal further stated that it sent notice to Plaintiff to demonstrate that his appeal has merit and was not taken for purposes of harassment or delay pursuant to CCP § 391.7(b)-(c).  The Court of Appeal declined to issue a prefiling order allowing the appeal to proceed and thus dismissed the appeal. On March 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for an order vacating the prefiling order and removing from the vexatious litigant list.  On April 14, 2023, the Court denied the motion.B.    TimelinessPursuant to CCP § 391.8(b), a vexatious litigant whose application was denied shall not be permitted to file another application on or before 12 months has elapsed after the date of the denial of the prior application. This Court entered its last order on Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the prefiling order on April 14, 2023.  Plaintiff filed this instant motion on March 13, 2024, which is set to be heard on April 19, 2024.  Thus, Plaintiff’s motion was filed on the 11th month after the Court entered its April 14, 2023 order.  As such, Plaintiff’s motion is not timely as he is not allowed to file another application until after 12 months has elapsed.  In other words, Plaintiff was required to file his motion on April 15, 2024 or after. As the motion was filed a month in advance, the motion was not timely filed.  The motion is denied on procedural grounds.CONCLUSION AND ORDER            Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the prefiling order and remove him from the vexatious litigant list is denied.
