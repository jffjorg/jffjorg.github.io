And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a case brought by Antranik Kevorkian against the County of Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. The Plaintiff filed a lawsuit in 2016 and subsequently filed a motion to vacate a prefiling order and remove himself from the vexatious litigant list. The Court denied this motion in 2021, finding that the motion was improperly filed in the wrong case and should have been filed in the Hastings Action.
