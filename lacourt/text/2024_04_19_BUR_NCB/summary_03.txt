English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement is denied. The parties have not signed a written settlement agreement, and the terms of the settlement have not been provided in writing or orally stipulated before the court. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer to finalize the terms of the settlement and execute a written agreement. The plaintiff's request for reasonable attorney's fees is also denied as the plaintiff has not stated the basis for the award of fees.
