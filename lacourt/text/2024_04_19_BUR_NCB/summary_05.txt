And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a proposed decision on two motions to compel the deposition of plaintiffs Yamile Colque and Wilson Colque. The defendant, Ford Motor Company, filed these motions on March 22, 2024. Before making a decision, the court makes a disclosure about the background of Judge John Kralik, who worked at Hughes Hubbard & Reed from 1979-1987 and 1988-1993, and represented Ford Motor Company during that time. The court acknowledges that this may create an appearance of bias, but does not believe it has been biased. The court orders the parties to attend the hearing and discuss whether to proceed in the current department. If the parties object to the court's handling of the case, they should raise these objections at the hearing. The court may transfer the case if necessary.
