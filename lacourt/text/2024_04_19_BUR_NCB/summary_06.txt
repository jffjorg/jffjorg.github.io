And here is the English-text summary:

The tentatively ruling judge dismisses the demurrer filed by Defendants Eau Di Nil Marketing & Events, Inc. and Landra Deloach, stating that no First Amended Complaint (FAC) was filed by the Plaintiff, making the demurrer moot. The operative pleading in this action remains the initial complaint filed on March 22, 2023. The court notes that while the Plaintiff is serving the Defendants with documents, the Plaintiff is not concurrently filing the documents with the court, which may lead to further issues.
