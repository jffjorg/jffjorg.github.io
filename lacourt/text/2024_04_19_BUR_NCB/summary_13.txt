Here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Antranik Kevorkian's motion to vacate the prefiling order and remove himself from the vexatious litigant list. The motion was filed on March 13, 2024, which is not timely as Plaintiff is not allowed to file another application until after 12 months have elapsed since the previous denial. The Court finds that Plaintiff's motion is denied on procedural grounds.
