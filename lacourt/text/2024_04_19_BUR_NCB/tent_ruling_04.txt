[1] For example, according to the Rutter Guide:d. [12:961] Oral stipulation before court: An oral stipulation for settlement “before the court” is also enforceable under CCP § 664.6. The parties themselves (as opposed to counsel) must state that agreement; see ¶ 12:962 ff.…It is enough that the parties were present when the settlement terms were recited by the court and made no objection when the court asked, “(I)s there anybody who disagrees or has any addendums to the court's stated settlement?” [Fiege v. Cooke, supra, 125 CA4th at 1355, 23 CR3d at 499—insurers' representatives and counsel had discussions with court before going on record with counsel stating their appearances and relating settlement terms: “No more was necessary”](The Rutter Guide Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial (June 2023 Update), Ch. 12(II)-G, § 12.961.)
