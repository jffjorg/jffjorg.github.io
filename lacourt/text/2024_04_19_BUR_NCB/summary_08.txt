And here is the summary in English text:

The plaintiff, Ramon Enriquez Marquez Mendez, alleges that he was injured at a Walgreens store in North Hollywood on February 2, 2022, when falling boxes struck him. The defendants, Walgreen Co., Walgreen National Corporation, Walgreen Boot Alliance, Inc., and Stephanie Martinez, deny liability. The court has denied the defendants' motions for summary judgment.

The plaintiff claims that the defendants were negligent in failing to ensure store safety, and that the accident was caused by the defendants' failure to prevent the falling boxes. The defendants argue that they did not have a duty to protect the plaintiff from the criminal act of a third party, and that there is no evidence that the defendants knew of any prior incidents of assault or battery at the store.

The plaintiff has presented evidence that the store had a policy to ensure that aisles were not blocked, but that the policy was not followed on the day of the incident. The plaintiff's expert, John Peterson, opines that the defendants failed to comply with industry standards and policies, and that the defendants' negligence created a dangerous condition that caused the plaintiff's injuries.

The court has denied the defendants' motions for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the defendants' liability for the plaintiff's injuries. The case will proceed to trial.
