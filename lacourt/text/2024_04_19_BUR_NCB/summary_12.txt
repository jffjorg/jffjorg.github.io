And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the complaint and has sustained the demurrer to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th causes of action with leave to amend. The court has also granted the motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages, but with leave to amend.

The court finds that the allegations in the complaint fail to rise to the level of negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, or gross negligence. The court also finds that the allegations for punitive damages are conclusory and lack the requisite specificity required to seek such damages.

The court intends to allow the parties to amend their pleadings to address the deficiencies in the original complaint. The court will not strike the allegations of the 2nd and 3rd causes of action.
