Despite numerous extensions, Plaintiff has yet to provide any responses to the discovery.As Defendant properly served the request for discovery, and Plaintiff has failed to provide responses, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to a court order directing Plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery request served on Plaintiff. Therefore, the motion is granted.Defendant also requests sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(c) mandates sanctions when the motion is unsuccessfully opposed.
