And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which aimed to cut off the need for a trial in this case. The defendant argued that there was no dangerous condition on the premises, that it did not have notice of the condition, and that it did not breach any duty to the plaintiff. However, the judge found that the defendant failed to meet its burden of proof on each of these points.

The judge noted that the defendant did not present sufficient evidence to show that it did not have notice of the alleged dangerous condition, and that it presented no evidence to show that it did not create the condition. The judge also found that the defendant's evidence of regular inspections was conclusory and insufficient to meet its burden.

As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, allowing the case to proceed to trial.
