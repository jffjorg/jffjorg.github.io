And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to compel an additional independent medical examination (IME) with neurosurgeon Dr. Scott Lederhaus is granted. The plaintiff had previously undergone an IME with neurologist Dr. Ludwig, but the defendant believes that additional examination is necessary to fully evaluate the plaintiff's neurological and spinal condition, which the plaintiff has placed in controversy through his pleadings and medical records. The judge found that there is good cause to compel the plaintiff to undergo the additional IME, as it is relevant to the subject matter of the action and may lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also noted that the two examinations are different in nature, and that the plaintiff has already undergone an examination with a neurologist, but a neurologist cannot make recommendations regarding surgery. The judge concluded that the defendant's motion is granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to submit to an additional IME with Dr. Lederhaus.
