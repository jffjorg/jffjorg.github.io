And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court is issuing a tentative ruling in the case of Andrew Trevino vs. Uber Technologies, et al. Uber Technologies has moved to compel arbitration, and since the plaintiff does not oppose the motion, the court grants the motion.

The court finds that Uber has met its initial burden of producing evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy. The evidence presented by Uber's data scientist, Chenshan Yu, shows that Andrew Trevino registered for an Uber account and agreed to the Terms of Use, which included an arbitration agreement.

The court notes that the arbitration agreement is clear and provides for the exclusive authority of the arbitrator to resolve any disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of the arbitration agreement. Therefore, the court orders the arbitrator to decide the issue of arbitrability and proceed accordingly.

The case against Uber Technologies is stayed pending arbitration.
