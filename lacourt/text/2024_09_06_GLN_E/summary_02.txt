And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to adopt the proposed statement of decision submitted by the plaintiff. However, the judge still has concerns about the transfer of property to Volart LLC and the request to amend the complaint after trial. The judge will hear from the parties on September 6, 2024, to determine whether the amendment should be allowed. The parties will need to address three specific questions: whether there was a reasonable excuse for the delay in seeking leave to amend, whether the requested amendment relates to facts or only legal theories, and whether the defendant would be prejudiced by the amendment and if so, how.
