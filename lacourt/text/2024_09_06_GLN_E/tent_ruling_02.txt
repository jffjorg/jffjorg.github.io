 Case Number:  23GDCV00376    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  E The Court is inclined to adopt the
proposed statement of decision submitted by the plaintiff.  The Court
continues to have concerns regarding the transfer of the property to Volart LLC
and the request to amend the complaint after trial.  Without repeating all
of the argument previously had on this issue, especially at the 7/9/24 hearing,
the Court will hear from the parties as to whether the amendment should be
allowed.  The parties will be asked to address to following questions:
 

Whether the was
     reasonable excuse for the delay in seeking leave to amend;

 

Whether the requested
     amendment relates to the facts or only legal theories, and

 

Whether defendant would
     be prejudiced by the amendment, and if so, how.
