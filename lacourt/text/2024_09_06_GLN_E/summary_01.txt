And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the defendant, 1001 Las Lomas LLC, to dismiss the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Jose Blanco and Jacinta Blanco. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the court's order to respond to discovery requests and seeks terminating sanctions against Jose Blanco. The judge notes that the plaintiffs' previous counsel withdrew on November 17, 2023, and that the defendant served the instant motion on July 26, 2024. The judge will hear argument on whether Jose Blanco was properly served and on the merits of the motion. The judge will consider the legal standards for terminating sanctions, including the importance of tailoring the sanction to the harm caused by the withheld discovery. The judge will review the case law and statutes cited by the parties and will make a decision at the hearing.
