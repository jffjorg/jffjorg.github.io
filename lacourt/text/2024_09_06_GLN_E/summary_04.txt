Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to the defendant's requests for production of documents. The plaintiff, Guillermo Sandoval, has filed a motion to compel further responses to the defendant's requests, alleging that the defendant has failed to provide adequate responses to the requests. The defendant, Hyundai Motor America, has objected to the requests, claiming that they are overly broad and not justified.

The judge has granted the motion to compel further responses to certain requests, but denied it to others. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant, citing that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate good cause for many of the requests and that many of the defendant's objections were sustained.

The judge has scheduled a hearing to hear argument on the motion and the request for sanctions. The judge has also indicated that the motion is not moot, even though the defendant has provided some supplemental responses to certain requests, because the defendant has not provided responses to all of the requests that were at issue in the motion.
