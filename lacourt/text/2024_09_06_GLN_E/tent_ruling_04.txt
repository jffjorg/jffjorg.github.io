TENTATIVE
RULING ON MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff,
Guillermo Sandoval, filed this action on 10/31/2023. The Complaint alleges four
causes of action. On June 11, 2018, Plaintiff alleges he entered into a
warranty contract with Defendant regarding a 2018 Hyundai Elantra. Plaintiff
alleges that defects and nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves
within the applicable express warranty period, including but not limited to,
engine defects and electrical defects, among other defects and
non-conformities.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
“Plaintiff
GUILLERMO SANDOVAL (“Plaintiff”) will, and hereby does, move for an order to
strike Defendant’s meritless objections and compel further responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents to Defendant, Set One Nos. 1,
2, 3, 7, 15, 16, 23, 24, 27, 28, 37, 38, 49, 50, 59, 60, 65, 66, 69, 70, 71,
72, 78, 79, 86, 88, 90, 99, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 130, 132, 138, 140,
143, 144 (collectively, the “Requests”) and production of all responsive
documents corresponding to those Requests; and direct Defendant to pay monetary
sanctions for its unjustifiable abuses of the discovery process.
This Motion is made pursuant to California Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2031.310, 128(a)(4), and 2023.030(a), on the grounds
that Defendant has failed to provide adequate responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests, which seek documents directly relevant to their Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act claims, and failed to meet and confer with Plaintiff in good
faith.
…
Plaintiff seeks an order striking Defendant’s
responses and compelling Defendant to produce adequate further verified
responses and documents (including emails and ESI, to which Defendant has
waived any and all objections pursuant to section 2031.210(d)) within ten (10)
calendar days of the Court’s order; and direct Defendant to pay monetary
sanctions for its unjustifiable abuses of the discovery process.
The Motion is based upon this Notice, Plaintiff’s
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in support thereof, Plaintiff’s Separate
Statement, the Declaration of Rosario Stoliker, the pleadings and papers on
file herein, and upon any other matters that may be presented to the Court at
the hearing.

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL FURTHER – REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter
involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  The Section
specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or defense of
the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,” and that discovery
“may be obtained of the identity and location of persons having knowledge of
any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence, description, nature,
custody, condition and location of any document, electronically stored
information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”

 
CCP § 2031.310(a) provides that a party demanding a document
inspection may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if
the demanding party deems that:
 
“(1)   A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.
  (2)   A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
  (3)  
An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”  

 
Under CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1), “The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.”  
 
“In the more specific context of a demand for production of
a tangible thing, the party who asks the trial court to compel production must
show “good cause” for the request—but unless there is a legitimate privilege
issue or claim of attorney work product, that burden is met simply by a
fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior
Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)

PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS
45-Day Requirement
Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to
the demand. (CCP § 2031.310(c).) 
Here, the motion is appears to be untimely.  The Court will hear argument. 
Meet and Confer
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” (CCP § 2031.310(b)(2).)
Here, Plaintiff met and conferred.
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses to RFP, Set One, Numbers 1, 2, 3, 7, 86, 88, 90, and
 99 is GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses to RFP, Set One, Numbers 15, 16, 23, 24, 27, 28, 37,
38, 49, 50, 59, 60, 65, 66, 69, 70, 71, 72, 78, 79, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117,
118, 130, 132, 138, 140, 143, and 144 is DENIED. Under CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1),
“The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.” (Ibid.) “In the more specific context
of a demand for production of a tangible thing, the party who asks the trial
court to compel production must show “good cause” for the request—but unless
there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney work product, that
burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins.
Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) Here, the
Court fails to see how Plaintiff demonstrated good cause. Defendant’s “overly
broad” objections are sustained. Many of these requests include Hyundai Elantra
vehicles of entirely different years than the subject vehicle, and many of
these requests are not limited at all in scope with respect to a specific time
frame.
 
Sanctions
Except
as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2031.310(h).)
 
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel requests sanctions in the amount
of $3,160.00. Plaintiff’s counsel bases this request on an hourly rate of $395 for
eight hours of work preparing this motion. (Stoliker Decl. ¶ 54.)
Defendant argues that to the extent Plaintiff has
demonstrated the amount of sanctions, Plaintiff’s request must fail because the
amount is unreasonable. Defendant points out that most of the motion was copy/pasted.
Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer. Defendant argues
that the motion is moot because responses have been provided. 
The Court will hear argument. 
Although Defendant’s opposition indicated that it
provided supplemental responses to 1, 2, 3, 7, 86, 88, and 99 and that this
motion is thus moot, the separate statement indicated that Defendant will
provide supplemental responses to those RFPs before the hearing; thus, it is
unclear if supplemental responses were provided to those responses to render
them moot. Further, even if Defendant provided further responses to 1, 2, 3, 7,
86, 88, and 99, Defendant does not allege it provided supplemental responses to
all the other RFPs that were at issue in this motion; therefore, overall, the
entire motion would not be moot. The Court is inclined to not grant sanctions
because a substantial amount of Plaintiff’s motion was denied because the Court
failed to understand how Plaintiff demonstrated good cause for many of the
requests, and many of Defendant’s objections on the RFPs being overly broad
were sustained.
