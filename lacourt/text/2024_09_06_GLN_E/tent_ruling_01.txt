TENTATIVE RULING
Service
16/21
Day Lapse (§ 1005(b)): Ok
Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC, Rule 3.1300): Ok
Correct Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a): Uncertain
In
the 11/17/2023 Minute Order, the Court heard two hearings on motions to be
relieved as counsel as to Plaintiffs Jose Blanco and Jacinta Blanco. These two
motions to be relieved as counsel, filed by Maria Giragossian on 9/5/2023, were
granted. The instant motion was filed on 7/26/2024, and allegedly served via
first class mail on 7/26/2024. The date of 7/26/2024 is after 11/17/2023;
therefore, Plaintiffs Jacinta and Jose would not have been represented by
counsel at the time this motion was filed and allegedly served.
The
proof of service for this motion lists the parties served as “Attorney for
Plaintiffs, in pro per,” and then it indicates that Plaintiffs Jose Blanco and
Jacinta Blanco are the "Attorney for Plaintiffs, in pro per.” Both Jose
and Jacinta were allegedly served by first class mail at 15964 Hawthorne
Avenue, Fontana, CA 92335.
On
eCourt, there is no address listed for Jose and Jacinta; therefore, it is
unclear as to what address Jose and Jacinta were supposed to be served at. On
the two 9/5/2023 motions to be relieved as counsel, it appears as if Jacinta
and Jose’s address is listed as 15964 Hawthorne Avenue, Fontana, CA 92335,
which matches the address that Defendant served the instant motion.
The
Court will hear argument as to if Jose was properly served this motion.
Defendant should be prepared to come forward with any case law, statutes, or
rules of court to support whatever argument it may have as to what is
considered proper service in the instant scenario when Plaintiff’s previous
counsel withdrew.
Substantive
Analysis
Defendant
seeks an order dismissing Plaintiff, Jose Blanco, from the Complaint. 
[The
Court notes that although Defendant wants an order dismissing Plaintiff, Jose
Blanco, from the “Complaint,” it appears that the operative complaint is the
FAC.]
Defendant
seeks the instant order because on May 24, 2024, this Court granted Defendant’s
motion to compel responses to request for production of documents, set one, and
Defendant’s request for sanctions. [The Court notes that the 5/24/2024 Minute
Order does not indicate when the responses had to be served by. The Court notes
that the 5/24/2024 Minute Order only indicated that the sanctions against
Plaintiffs were to be paid by 6/24/2024.]
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court’s order. Defendant argues
that it is prejudiced by Plaintiff’s failure to respond to discovery because it
cannot adequately prepare for trial since Plaintiff failed to respond to
discovery that would have defined their damages and causes of action. 
Thus,
Defendant seeks terminating sanctions against Plaintiff, Jose Blanco, for
Plaintiff failing to abide by the prior court order. 
The
case of Van Sickle v. Gilbert helps explain the legal standard for when
terminating sanctions are appropriate:
Failing
to respond to an authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery
process. (§ 2023.010, subd. (d).) So is disobeying a court order to provide
discovery. (Id., subd. (g).) If a party fails to obey an order
compelling answers to special interrogatories and/or an order compelling a
response to a demand for production of documents, the court may impose a
terminating sanction by striking out the pleading of that party and/or
rendering a judgment by default against that party. (§§ 2023.030, subd. (d)(1)
& (3), 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
“The
trial court should consider both the conduct being sanctioned and its effect on
the party seeking discovery and, in choosing a sanction, should ‘ “attempt[ ]
to tailor the sanction to the harm caused by the withheld discovery.” ’
[Citation.] The trial court cannot impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery
process as a punishment.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992, 94 Cal.Rptr.3d 802.) “ ‘Discovery sanctions
“should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is
required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.” ’ [Citation.] If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater
sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant
incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will cure the
abuse. ‘A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.
But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the
evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.’ ” (Ibid.)
“Imposition
of sanctions for misuse of discovery lies within the trial court's discretion,
and is reviewed only for abuse.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.,
supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 991, 94 Cal.Rptr.3d 802.) “Sanction
orders are ‘subject to reversal only for arbitrary, capricious or whimsical
action.’ ” (Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Administrators, Inc. (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1102, 78 Cal.Rptr.3d 200.)
(Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)
Here,
the Court will hear argument.
