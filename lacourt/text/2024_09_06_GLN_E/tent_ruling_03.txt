TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff,
City National Bank, filed a Complaint on 9/28/2023 alleging five causes of
action: (1) Breach of Revolving Note, (2) Breach of Commercial Card Agreement,
(3) Breach of Guaranty (Revolving Note), (4) Breach of Continuing Guaranty
(Commercial Card Agreement), and (5) Foreclosure of Security Interest.
On 5/31/2024 the fifth cause of action for foreclosure
of security interest was dismissed.
Plaintiff moves the Court for an order granting
summary judgment against Defendants Comming Good, Inc., a California
corporation, and Jong Rae No, an individual.
It appears based on the signed “Stipulation To
Judgment” filed on 8/23/2024, and the “Judgment” filed on 8/23/2024, that this
motion is moot.
