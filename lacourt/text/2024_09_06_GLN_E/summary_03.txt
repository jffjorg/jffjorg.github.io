And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling states that the plaintiff, City National Bank, has filed a motion for summary judgment against the defendants, Coming Good, Inc. and Jong Rae Noh. However, it appears that this motion is now moot due to the filing of a "Stipulation To Judgment" and a "Judgment" on August 23, 2024. The judge is not granting the motion for summary judgment and will likely dismiss it at the upcoming hearing on September 6, 2024.
