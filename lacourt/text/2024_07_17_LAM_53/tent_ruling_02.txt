Specifically, the court granted Plaintiff’s motion as follows: (1) on the
second cause of action in the amount of $10,000 in civil penalties; (2) on the
third cause of action in the amount of $10,000 in civil penalties; (3) on the
fourth cause of action in the amount of $43,800 in unpaid wages; (4) on the
fifth cause of action in the amount of $54,190, consisting of $28,340 in unpaid
minimum wages and $25,850 in civil penalties; (5) on the sixth cause of action
in the amount of $78,990, consisting of $68,640 in unpaid overtime wages and $10,350
in civil penalties;     (6) on the seventh cause of action in the
amount of $107,250, consisting of $4,000 in penalties and an additional
statutory penalty of $103,250; (7) on the eighth cause of action in the amount
of $6,300 in waiting time penalties; and (8) on the 10th cause of action in the
amount of $10,950 for rest periods that Orange Trim failed to provide to
Plaintiff.  (Oct. 31, 2022 Order, pp. 5:9-11,
5:16-17, 6:10-12, 6:17-18, 7:10-13, 7:18-19, 8:5-6, 9:2-3, 9:9-10, 10:10-11,
10:28, 12:4-5, 12:6-7, 13:11-12, 14:22-25, 15:8-24, 15:27-28.) 


[2] The
court notes two apparent errors in Plaintiff’s supporting case summary.  First, Plaintiff requests $94,320 in past
lost earnings, but has only described $91,720 in lost wages in the papers.  (Pl. Summary, pp. 5:26, 6:14, 6:19, 6:25.)  Second, although the case summary states that
Plaintiff’s “job change [from Flor de Izucar to Love Trim, Inc.] did not affect
Plaintiff’s weekly or monthly income[,]” Plaintiff’s declaration states that he
received different monthly wages from each of those jobs.  (Mendoza Decl., ¶ 10 [“I then worked for
Panaderia la Flor de Izuca from 2019-2021, and made approximately $1,280
monthly.  Next, I worked for Love Trim,
Inc. from 2021-2022, and made approximately $1,040 monthly”].)  The court has calculated the lost wages based
on the statements made in Plaintiff’s declaration. 


[3]
The court notes that, although Elihu states that paralegals Amanda Headworth, Diana
Casarrubias, and Jasmin Rueda billed at $175 per hour, the billing entries show
that they billed at the rate of $125 per hour. 
(Elihu Decl., ¶ 16; Moorhead Decl., Ex. D, pp. 1, 2.)  The court therefore uses the $125 hourly rate
for those paralegals. 


[4]
Plaintiff did not appear (1) to submit the declarations of paralegals Daniel
Lopez, Edward Ramirez, Jennifer Toc, Mark Rojas, and Neida Garcia, or (2) to
include their hourly rates in the declarations submitted.  The court finds that $175 is a reasonable
hourly rate for paralegals Daniel Lopez, Edward Ramirez, Mark Rojas, and Neida
Garcia.  The court finds that the $125
hourly rate charged by Jennifer Toc is reasonable.
