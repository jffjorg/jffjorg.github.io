plaintiff’s request for court judgment by
  default
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Ivan Mendoza           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Request for Court Judgment by Default
Plaintiff Ivan Mendoza
(“Plaintiff”) requests that the court enter default judgment in his favor and
against defendant Soon Pill Kim (“Defendant”) in the total amount of
$1,286,468.89, consisting of (1) $934,547.30 in damages, (2) $138,5551.04 in
interest, (3) $5,425.55 in costs, and (4) $207,935 in attorney’s fees.
First, the court finds that
Plaintiff prayed for damages in the total amount of $691,966.20, such that the
court may not award damages in excess of that amount.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a).)  
Specifically, in the Prayer of
Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff prayed for the following: $500,000
in compensatory damages, $10,000 in civil penalties pursuant to Labor Code
section 1102.5, subdivision (f), $10,000 in civil penalties pursuant to Labor
Code section 98.6, subdivision (b)(3), $11,379.25 in underpaid minimum wage
compensation, $11,379.25 in liquidated damages pursuant to Labor Code section
1194.2, $16,772.75 in unpaid overtime compensation, $10,350 in statutory
penalties pursuant to Labor Code section 558, subdivision (a), $4,000 in
damages pursuant to Labor Code section 226, $103,250 in statutory penalties and
damages pursuant to Labor Code section 226.3, $10,920 for rest period
compensation pursuant to Labor Code section 226.7, and $3,914.95 in waiting
time penalties pursuant to Labor Code sections 201-203.  (SAC, Prayer, ¶¶ 1, 4-13.)  Together, the Prayer requests damages in the
total amount of $691,966.20.  Thus, the
court finds that it may not enter default judgment in excess of
$691,966.20.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 580; Sass
v. Cohen (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 1032, 1041 [“A default judgment that awards
relief beyond the type and amount sought in the operative pleadings is void”].)

Second, the court finds that
Plaintiff has shown that he is entitled to damages in the total amount of $489,760.
Plaintiff has alleged, and
therefore Defendant has confessed, that there exists such a unity of interest
and ownership between Defendant and defendant Orange Trim, Inc. (“Orange Trim”)
that the individuality and separateness between them have ceased to exist, and
that it would not promote justice to separate the existence of Defendant and
Orange Trim, such that Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant and Orange Trim are
the alter egos of the other.  (SAC ¶¶ 7,
9-12; Cam-Carson, LLC v. Carson Reclamation Authority (2022) 82
Cal.App.5th 535, 549 [elements of alter ego doctrine]; Kim v. Westmoore
Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 281 [judgment by default
confesses material facts alleged by the plaintiff].)  Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has shown
that he is entitled to an award of damages against Defendant, as the alter ego
of Orange Trim, in the amount of $321,480 based on the court’s October 31, 2022
order granting Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication on the second
through eighth and 10th causes of action against defendant Orange Trim in that
amount.[1]  (Oct. 31, 2022 Order, p. 15:8-24, 15:27-28.)  
The court further finds that, in connection with the first cause of
action for wrongful termination, Plaintiff has proven that he is entitled to lost
future wages in the amount of $93,280. 
Plaintiff has presented evidence establishing that, while working for
Orange Trim, his monthly salary was $2,600. 
(Mendoza Decl., ¶ 10.)  Following
his termination, and from May 2017 to May 2019, Plaintiff worked solely for J1
Trim and received $13 an hour, or $520 monthly. 
(Mendoza Decl., ¶ 10; Pl. Summary, p. 6:8-14.)  Thus, for the 24-month period following his
termination, Plaintiff lost future wages in the amount of $49,920 (($2,600 –
$520 = $2,080 in lost wages) x 24 months). 
(Smith v. Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d
503, 518 [“The general rule is that the measure of recovery by a wrongfully
discharged employee is the amount of salary agreed upon for the period of
service, less the amount which the employer affirmatively proves the employee
has earned or with reasonable effort might have earned from other employment”].)  
From May 2019 to April of 2020, Plaintiff worked for J1 Trim and
supplemented his income by obtaining a second job at Panaderia la Flor de
Izucar, for which Plaintiff received monthly wages of $1,280.  (Mendoza Decl., ¶ 10; Pl. Summary, p. 6:15-19.)
 Thus, for this 11-month period,
Plaintiff lost wages in the amount of $8,800 (($2,600 – $520 (monthly wages
from J1 Trim) – $1,280 (monthly wages from Panaderia) = $800 in lost wages) x
11 months).  (Smith, supra,
196 Cal.App.3d at p. 518.)  From April
2020 through May 2021, Plaintiff worked solely for Panaderia la Flor de Izucar,
receiving a monthly wage of $1,280. 
(Mendoza Decl., ¶ 10; Pl. Summary, p. 6:21-22.)  Thus, for this 12-month period, Plaintiff
lost $15,840 in wages (($2,600 – $1,280 = $1,320 in lost wages) x 12 months).  (Smith, supra, 196 Cal.App.3d
at p. 518.)  From May 2021 through May
2022, Plaintiff worked for Love Trim, Inc., from which he received $1,040 in
monthly wages.  (Mendoza Decl., ¶ 10.)  Thus, for the 12-month period, Plaintiff lost
$18,720 in wages (($2,600 – $1,040 = $1,560 in lost wages) x 12 months).[2]
 (Smith, supra, 196
Cal.App.3d at p. 518.)
The court also finds, based on the evidence presented, that Plaintiff
has shown that he is entitled to an award of noneconomic damages resulting from
his wrongful termination in the amount of $75,000.  (Mendoza Decl., ¶¶ 8-9; Rubio v. CIA Wheel
Group (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 82, 93 [“Noneconomic damages are recoverable in
many actions, including wrongful termination actions”].) 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has proven $489,760 in damages. 
Third, the court finds that Plaintiff has shown that he is entitled to
prejudgment interest in the total amount of $117,927.68.
As to the damages for Defendant’s nonpayment of his wages, Plaintiff
has shown that he is entitled to interest in the total amount of $117,927.68 ($176,980
($43,800 unpaid wages + $54,190 unpaid minimum wages + $78,990 in unpaid
overtime wages) x 10 percent per annum = $17,698 / 365 = $48.49 in daily
interest x 2,432 days (April 18, 2017 to December 15, 2023)).  (Lab. Code, § 218.6 [“In any action brought
for the nonpayment of wages, the court shall award interest on all due and
unpaid wages at the rate of interest specified in subdivision (b) of Section
3289 of the Civil Code, which shall accrue from the date that the wages were
due and payable” as provided in Labor Code section 200]; Civ. Code, § 3289,
subd. (b) [setting rate of interest to be 10 percent per annum]; SAC ¶ 20
[Plaintiff was terminated on April 18, 2017].) 
Plaintiff has also argued that he is entitled to interest on his lost
future earnings at the rate of 10 percent per annum.  However, Plaintiff did not cite authority in
support of that assertion.  Specifically,
although Labor Code section 218.6 provides for interest on claims for due and
unpaid wages, Plaintiff did not cite authority interpreting that statute to
extend to lost future earnings recovered in connection with a cause of action
for wrongful termination.  (Lab. Code, §
218.6.)  The portion of Deocampo v.
Ahn (2002) 101 Cap.App.4th 758, 771, to which Plaintiff cites, does not
appear to discuss applying the 10 percent annual rate of interest to such
damages, and instead discusses the calculation of damages in the purview of Code
of Civil Procedure section 667.7, which governs actions against a healthcare
provider. 
The court acknowledges, as Plaintiff appears to note, that Plaintiff
may seek to recover prejudgment interest on his lost future earnings in the
amount of 7 percent per annum pursuant to Civil Code section 3288.  (Pl. Summary, pp. 7:26-8:1; Civ. Code, § 3288
[“In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, and
in every case of oppression, fraud, or malice, interest may be given, in the
discretion of the jury”].)  However,
Plaintiff has not provided the court with (1) interest calculations using the
correct rate of interest, (2) evidence or argument establishing the specific
dates on which Plaintiff incurred each loss of future earnings and the dates on
which interest on these wages began to accrue, such that the court cannot
calculate the award of interest itself, or (3) other evidence or calculations
of prejudgment interest.  (Cal. Rules of
Ct., rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(3); Michelson v. Hamada (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1566, 1588 [the award of interest “‘should run from the date when
the money was paid or the property lost, because the duty to compensate
plaintiff for her losses arose then, and no demand was necessary’”].)  The court therefore denies that request for
prejudgment interest.  
            Fourth, the court finds that
Plaintiff has proven he is entitled to costs in the total amount of $4,415.75.
The court (1) grants Plaintiff’s request for $1,412.88 in costs for
filing and motion fees, but (2) denies the accompanying request for $100 in
copies and postage charges.  (Moorhead
Decl., Ex. C, pp. MC-011 and Attachment 1g; Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subds.
(a)(1) [filing and motion fees are allowable as costs], (b)(3) [postage and
photocopying charges, except for exhibits, are not allowable as costs].)  
The court grants Plaintiff’s requests for jury fees, deposition costs,
and service of process costs.  (Moorhead
Decl., Ex. C, MC-010, p. 1, ¶¶ 2, 4-5; Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subds. (a)(1),
(a)(3), (a)(4).)  The court denies
Plaintiff’s request for $895 in court reporter fees because Plaintiff did not
cite a statute entitling him to recover those costs.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(11)
[“Cort reporter fees as established by statute” are allowable as costs]
[emphasis added]; Moorhead Decl., Ex. C, Attachment 12c.)  The court denies Plaintiff’s request for
$24.80 in “other” costs because, although Plaintiff has produced evidence
establishing that those costs were incurred to download documents, Plaintiff
did not establish that those costs are permitted pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5.  (Moorhead
Decl., Ex. C, Attachment 16a [listing three entries for “LASC Document
download”].) 
            Fifth, the court finds that
Plaintiff has shown that Labor Code sections 218.5, 1194, and 226 permit him to
recover attorney’s fees.  (Lab. Code, §§
218.5, subd. (a) [in any action for nonpayment of wages, “the court shall award
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party”], 1194, subd. (a)
[any employee receiving less than the legal minimum wage or overtime
compensation is entitled to recover “reasonable attorney’s fees, and costs of
suit”], 226, subd. (e)(1) [employee suffering injury as a result of the
employer’s failure to furnish an accurate wage statement is entitled to
“reasonable attorney’s fees”].)
            Sixth, the court finds that
Plaintiff has established a lodestar figure of $184,697.50 and therefore is entitled to
attorney’s fees in that amount.
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. . . . .¿ The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community
for similar work.¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted); Reck v. FCA US
LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 682, 691 [“To determine a reasonable attorney fee
award, the trial court applies the lodestar method”].)  “[T]he verified
time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.”¿ (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359,
396.)¿¿¿ 
The court
finds that (1) a reasonable hourly rate for attorney Samuel Moorhead is $600;
(2) a reasonable hourly rate for Luis Guardado while working as support staff
is $275 and is $350 for work performed as an attorney; (3) a reasonable hourly
rate for attorney Matias N. Castro is $600; (4) a reasonable hourly rate for
attorney Sylvia Panosian is $600; (5) a reasonable hourly rate for attorney
Daniel Friedman is $600; (6) a reasonable hourly rate for attorney Melad N.
Haddad is $350; (7) a reasonable hourly rate for attorney Kaven S. Elihu is
$750; (8) a reasonable hourly rate for attorney Rhett Francisco is $600; (9) a
reasonable hourly rate for attorney Carina Miller is $350; (10) the requested
$200 hourly rate for attorney Keteryna Mukhina is reasonable; (11) a reasonable
hourly rate for attorney Christopher Declue is $400; (12) a reasonable hourly
rate for attorney Victor Ujkic is $350; (13) a reasonable hourly rate for
paralegal Rene Gonzalez-Pacheco is $250; (14) a reasonable hourly rate for
paralegal / case manager Leslie Castillo is $200; and (15) the $175 hourly
rates requested for paralegals no longer employed by Plaintiff’s counsel’s firm
are reasonable.[3]  (Moorhead
Decl., ¶¶ 19-20; Gonzalez-Pacheco Decl., ¶¶ 6-7; Guardado Decl., ¶¶ 3-8; Castro
Decl., ¶¶ 3-5; Panosian Decl., ¶¶ 3-5; Friedman Decl., ¶¶ 4-5; Castillo Decl.,
¶ 1; Haddad Decl., ¶ 5; Elihu Decl., ¶¶4-15, and Ex. 1, Francisco Decl., ¶¶
9-12; Elihu Decl., ¶ 15 [listing hourly rates for attorneys Mr. Francisco, Ms.
Miller, Ms. Mukhina, Mr. Declue, Mr. Ujkic].) 
The court
has reviewed the work and time entries submitted by Plaintiff’s counsel, which
establish that Plaintiff’s attorneys and legal staff expended a total of 405.7
hours in bringing this action.  The court
finds, in light of the complexities of this action and motion practice before
Defendant’s default was entered, that 399.8 of those hours were reasonably
expended.  The court finds that the hours
expended by the unidentified “OZY,” accountant Rebecca Betchel, and
administrative assistants Stephanie Franco and Stephanie Nunez were not
reasonably expended.  (Moorhead Decl.,
Ex. D, pp. 10, 20.) 
Thus, the
court finds that Plaintiff has established a lodestar figure of $184,697.50 as
follows: (1) 0.6 hours at paralegal Smith’s $175 hourly rate; (2) 0.6 hours at
paralegal Headworth’s $125 hourly rate; (3) 6.4 hours at paralegal Gosnell’s
$175 hourly rate; (4) 2.3 hours at attorney Declue’s $400 hourly rate; (5) 0.2
hours at attorney Miller’s $350 hourly rate; (6) 0.2 hours at law clerk Connie
(CNN)’s $125 hourly rate; (7) 0.7 hours at paralegal Casarrubias’s $125 hourly
rate; (8) 1.3 hours at paralegal Lopez’s $175 hourly rate;[4] (9) 2.4 hours at attorney Friedman’s $600
hourly rate; (10) 0.2 hours at paralegal Ramirez’s $175 hourly rate; (11) 0.2
hours at paralegal Gomez’s $175 hourly rate; (12) 6.5 hours at paralegal
Rueda’s $125 hourly rate; (13) 12.3 hours at paralegal Toc’s $125 hourly rate;
(14) 0.2 hours at paralegal Ayala’s $125 hourly rate; (15) 5.1 hours at law
clerk Mukhina’s $200 hourly rate; (16) 7.9 hours at attorney Elihu’s $750
hourly rate; (17) 1.7 hours at attorney Guardado’s $275 hourly rate; (18) 81.1
hours at paralegal Castillo’s $200 hourly rate; (19) 6.4 hours at attorney
Haddad’s $350 hourly rate; (20) 1.5 hours at attorney Castro’s $600 hourly
rate; (21) 0.7 hours at paralegal Rojas’s $175 hourly rate; (22) 1 hour at
paralegal Garcia’s $175 hourly rate; (23) 9.6 hours at Rene Gonzalez’s $250
hourly rate; (24) 8 hours at attorney Francisco’s $600 hourly rate; (25) 232.4
hours at Moorhead’s $600 hourly rate; (26) 3.9 hours at law clerk Flores’s $175
hourly rate; (27) 5.8 hours at attorney Panosian’s $600 hourly rate; and (28)
0.6 hours at attorney Ujkic’s $350 hourly rate. 
(Moorhead Decl., Ex. D.) 
The court
notes that the declaration of Kaveh S. Elihu appears to request a lodestar
multiplier of 2.0.  (Elihu Decl., ¶ 26 [“With
the addition of a lodestar multiplier of 2.0, the attorneys’ fees would total
$415,870”].)  However, Plaintiff did not
support this request for a multiplier in his supporting memorandum of points
and authorities.  Thus, to the extent
that Plaintiff requests a lodestar enhancement, the court denies that request. 
ORDER 
The court grants in part plaintiff Ivan Mendoza’s request for default
judgment as follows. 
The court finds that plaintiff Ivan Mendoza is entitled to default
judgment against defendant Soon Pill Kim in the total amount of $796,800.93
consisting of (1) $489,760 in
damages, (2) $117,927.68 in prejudgment interest, (3) $4,415.75 in costs, and
(4) $184,697.50 in
attorney’s fees. 
            The court will modify, sign, and
file the Judgment by Court by Default (Judicial Council form JUD-100) consistent
with this order. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
