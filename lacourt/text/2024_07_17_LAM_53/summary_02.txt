Summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the case. The court granted Plaintiff's motion as follows: (1) $10,000 in civil penalties, (2) $10,000 in civil penalties, (3) $43,800 in unpaid wages, (4) $54,190 in unpaid minimum wages and civil penalties, (5) $78,990 in unpaid overtime wages and civil penalties, (6) $107,250 in penalties and statutory penalties, (7) $6,300 in waiting time penalties, and (8) $10,950 for rest periods. The court notes two errors in Plaintiff's supporting case summary: (1) Plaintiff requested $94,320 in past lost earnings but only described $91,720 in lost wages, and (2) Plaintiff's declaration states that he received different monthly wages from each job, contrary to the case summary. The court has calculated the lost wages based on Plaintiff's declaration. The court also notes that paralegals billed at $125 per hour, not $175 per hour, and that Plaintiff did not submit declarations from certain paralegals.
