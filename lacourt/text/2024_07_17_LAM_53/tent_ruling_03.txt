plaintiff’s motion to compel further
  responses to interrogatories
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff J Cellars
Investments, LLC, d/b/a Joseph Cellars Winery           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant HDI Global Insurance Company
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Interrogatories 
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff J Cellars Investments, LLC, d/b/a Joseph Cellars Winery
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant HDI Global
Insurance Company (“Defendant”) to serve further responses to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories, numbers 1, 7-12, 28-33, 38-44, 53-56, 62, 64-68, and
74-80, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant in the amount of $14,420.
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
further responses to Special Interrogatories, numbers 1, 7-8, and 10-11 because
the objections to those interrogatories are without merit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
further response to Special Interrogatory number 9 because Defendant has not
met its burden to establish that the information requested is protected from
disclosure by Insurance Code section 791.13 since it appears that section
791.13 limits the disclosure of personal or privileged information about an
individual, and this interrogatory does not ask for such information.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3);
Ins. Code, §§ 791.13 [“An insurance institution, agent, or insurance-support
organization shall not disclose any personal or privileged information about
an individual”] [emphasis added], 791.02, subd. (i) [“‘Individual’ means any
natural person who is any of the following . . . .”] [emphasis added].) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Special Interrogatories, numbers 12, 42-43, 53-54, 62-63, 66, 73-75,
and 78 because Defendant’s answers to those interrogatories are not evasive or
incomplete.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (a)(1).)
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
further responses to Special Interrogatories, numbers 28-33, 38-41, 44, 55-56,
64-65, 67-68, 76-77, and 79-80 because Defendant’s answers to those
interrogatories are evasive and incomplete. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).)
            The court grants Plaintiff’s request
for monetary sanctions against Defendant. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)  The court finds that $8,470 ((12 hours x $700
hourly rate) + $70 motion filing fee) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to
impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Rogari Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.) 
            The court denies Defendant’s request
for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).) 
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiff J
Cellars Investments, LLC d/b/a Joseph Cellars Winery’s motion to compel further
responses to interrogatories as follows.
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, the court orders defendant HDI Global Insurance Company to
serve further, full and complete answers to plaintiff J Cellars Investments,
LLC d/b/a Joseph Cellars Winery’s Special Interrogatories, numbers 1, 7-11,
28-33, 38-41, 44, 55-56, 64-65, 67-68, 76-77, and 79-80, which comply with Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210-2030.250, within 20 days of the date of
this order. 
            The court orders defendant HDI
Global Insurance Company to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff J Cellars
Investments, LLC d/b/a Joseph Cellars Winery in the amount of $8,470 within 30
days of the date of this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff J Cellars
Investments, LLC d/b/a Joseph Cellars Winery to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
