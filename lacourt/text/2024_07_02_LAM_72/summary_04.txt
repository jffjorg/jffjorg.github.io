Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the plaintiff's anti-SLAPP motion to strike the second and twelfth claims of the Cross-Complaint, and denied the defendants' request for attorney's fees. The judge also overruled the plaintiff's demurrer to the Cross-Complaint.

The judge found that the claims in the Cross-Complaint were not protected speech under the anti-SLAPP statute, as they were based on the plaintiff's own negligence in entering payroll data, rather than protected activity such as filing a lawsuit.

The judge also rejected the plaintiff's arguments that indemnification would violate public policy and Labor Code section 2802, finding that the issues were properly plead and required further factual development.
