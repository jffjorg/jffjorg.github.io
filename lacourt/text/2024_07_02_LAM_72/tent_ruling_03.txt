a further response to FROG No. 15.1; (3) produce documents responsive to Plaintiff’s

days of the issuance of this order.
 
Background
 
This action concerns a number of business loans (the
“Secured Loans”) from Plaintiff to BeautyCon Media ABC (“BeautyCon”) which were
secured by BeautyCon’s assets. In 2021, BeautyCon allegedly defaulted on its
loans. BeautyCon Media ABC Trust (the “Trust”) currently administers
BeautyCon’s estate on behalf of BeautyCon’s creditors. Plaintiff and its
assignee, NGM1, LLC (“NGM1”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) foreclosed on the
loans and acquired title to BeautyCon’s assets but have allegedly been unable
to take possession of some of the assets. They seek possession of those assets
in this action.
 
On April 26, 2021, BeautyCon and Sacullo Business
Consulting, LLC (“Trustee”) entered into a Trust Agreement and Assignment for
the Benefit of Creditors (the “ABC Agreement”) whereby BeautyCon’s assets were
transferred to the Trust to be managed by Trustee.
 
On April 28, 2021, the Trustee filed a petition (the “ABC Action”)
in the Delaware Court of Chancery to administer the Trust.
 
On June 4, 2021, Plaintiff notified BeautyCon and Trust that
Plaintiff intended to exercise its rights under the Secured Loans and that a
foreclosure auction of BeautyCon’s assets had been scheduled for July 1, 2021. 
 
On June 9, 2021, the Delaware Court of Chancery asserted
jurisdiction over the ABC Action for Trustee to administrate the Trust.
 
On July 1, 2021, the foreclosure was held. NGM1, as assignee
of Plaintiff’s interest in the Secured Loans, was the successful bidder and
became the legal owner of all of BeautyCon’s assets.
 
Plaintiffs then attempted to obtain possession of
BeautyCon’s assets. While they were mostly successful, Defendants Moj Mahdara
and the Trust allegedly have not turned over the entirety of the assets.
 
On October 1, 2021, in the ABC Action, NGM1 filed a Motion
to Compel Turnover of Assets and For Order to Show Cause (the “Motion to
Compel”) in the ABC Action. NGM1 sought an order directing Trustee to turn over
the BeautyCon assets in Trustee’s custody. The Trustee filed an opposition on
November 4, 2021. On November 10, 2021, NGM1 filed a Notice of Withdrawal of
Motion as to the Motion to Compel. Plaintiffs did not further prosecute the
Motion to Compel in Delaware court.
 
Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendants the Trust,
Moj Mahdara, and Elastic Ventures, Inc. (“Elastic”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) on December 6, 2022, raising claims for (1) declaratory judgment;
(2) declaratory judgment; (3) declaratory judgment; (4) constructive fraud; (5)
conversion; (6) trespass to chattels; (7) unjust enrichment; and (8) violation
of the Computer Data Access and Fraud Act.
 
On December 13, 2022, the Trust filed a complaint against Plaintiff
in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Action”), raising
claims for, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty; aiding and abetting
breach of fiduciary duty; fraud in the inducement; and breach of contract. These
causes of action arose out of the agreements for the Secured Loans. Plaintiffs’
declaratory relief causes of action sought declaratory judgment to the effect
that Trust’s foregoing causes of action were unfounded.
 
On May 9, 2023, the Court sustained the Trust’s demurrer to
the three causes of action for declaratory judgment, granting leave to amend.
Plaintiffs did not re-file their causes of action for declaratory judgment.
 
The operative complaint is now the First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) which raises claims for (1) conversion; (2) constructive fraudulent
conveyance, (3) conversion; (4) trespass to chattels; (5) unjust enrichment;
(6) violations of the Computer Data Access and Fraud Act; and (6) unfair
business practices.
 
On August 11, 2023, the court in the Delaware Action
dismissed the Trust’s claims against Plaintiff for breach of fiduciary duty;
aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; fraud in the inducement; and
breach of contract with the exception of a claim by the Trust for failure to
negotiate certain provisions in good faith. (BeautyCon Media ABC Trust
Through Saccullo Business Consulting, LLC v. New General Market Partners, LLC
(Del. Super. Ct., Aug. 11, 2023, No. N22C-12-143 MAA CCLD) 2023 WL 5164148, at
*1 fn. 1, *19.)
 
On April 12, 2023, Plaintiff served on Mahdara Plaintiff’s
First Set of Form Interrogatories – General (the “Madara FROGs”) and First Set
of Requests for Production of Documents (the “Mahdara RFPs”). Mahdara
subsequently served responses and supplemental responses. Mahdara did not
verify the FROG responses or produce a privilege log. (Colwell Decl. ¶¶ 8-10.) Although
Mahdara provided some responsive documents, Plaintiff contends that they are
inadequate. The parties met and conferred over the adequacy of the responses.
 
On April 20, 2023, Plaintiff served on Elastic Plaintiff’s
First Set of Form Interrogatories – General (the “Elastic FROGs”) and First Set
of Requests for Production of Documents (the “Elastic RFPs”). Elastic failed to
respond to the RFPs by the May 23, 2023 deadline. (Colwell Decl. ¶ 21.) Elastic
eventually provided responses, but did not verify the FROG responses or produce
a privilege log. (Colwell Decl. ¶¶ 24-28.) Although Elastic provided some
responsive documents, Plaintiff contends that they are inadequate. Elastic
later provided supplemental responses and the parties met and conferred.
 
Plaintiff filed this motion on May 31, 2024. Although
Plaintiff files a reply referencing an opposition separate statement from
Responding Defendants, Responding Defendants have not filed such a statement with
the Court.
 
Legal Standard
 
Interrogatories
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.220, subdivision (a) requires that “[e]ach
answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as complete and
straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party
permits.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, a party may
move to compel further responses to a form interrogatory if the other party’s
answer is “evasive or incomplete.” The responding party has the burden of
justifying the objections to the form and special interrogatories. (Coy v.
Super. Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.) 
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290.
 
Requests for Production
 
“A statement that the party to whom a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling has been directed will comply with the particular
demand shall state that the production, inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling, and related activity demanded, will be allowed either in whole or in
part, and that all documents or things in the demanded category that are in the
possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no objection is
being made will be included in the production.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.220.)
 
“A representation of inability to comply with the particular
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a
diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply
with that demand. This statement shall also specify whether the inability to
comply is because the particular item or category has never existed, has been
destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no
longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The
statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or
organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or
control of that item or category of item.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)
 
“(a) On receipt of a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply:
            (1)
A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete.
(2) A representation
of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
            (3)
An objection in the response is without merit or too general.
 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with each of the following:
(1) The motion shall
set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by
the demand.
(2) The motion shall
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
(3) In lieu of a
separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court may
allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and
each response in dispute.
 
(c) Unless notice of
this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or
any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to the demand.
 
… (h) Except as
provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310.)
 
            The
burden is on the moving party to show both relevance to the subject matter and
specific facts justifying discovery. (Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Superior
Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.) Once good cause is established by
the moving party, the burden then shifts to the responding party to justify any
objections made to document disclosure. (Hartbrodt v. Burke (1996) 42
Cal.App.4th 168, 172-174.)
 
Discussion
 
Verification of Interrogatory Responses
 
Interrogatory responses must be verified under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. 2030.210.) The Court therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel
verification of the FROG responses by both Responding Defendants.
 
Form Interrogatory 15.1
 
Responding Defendants shall each provide complete answers to
each of the subparts of this interrogatory.
 
Requests for Production
 
Elastic has waived its objections by failing to timely
respond to the Elastic RFPs. Elastic never filed a motion to seek relief from
waiver. (Colwell Decl. ¶¶ 29-30.) It must therefore serve complete responses
without objections and produce any responsive documents.
 
The Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s arguments in its separate
statement and Mahdara’s objections. Mahdara shall produce complete responses to
the following RFPs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21,
23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45,
46, 47, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71,
72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85, 
 
The Court denies the motion as to the following RFPs: 14, 64,
65, 66.
 
The Court sets the following restrictions on the responses
it compels:
 
RFP 13: Mahdara need only produce documents concerning
BeautyCon’s assignment and transfer of its assets.
 
RFP 56: Mahdara need only produce documents concerning
BeautyCon’s assignment and transfer of its assets.
 
RFP 71: Mahdara need only produce documents concerning
BeautyCon’s assignment and transfer of its assets.
 
RFP 84: Mahdara need only produce documents concerning
BeautyCon’s assignment and transfer of its assets.
 
Privilege Log
 
Elastic has waived its objections, including based on
privilege.
 
If Mahdara is withholding documents on the basis of
privilege, she must produce a privilege log.
 
Sanctions
 
Because the Court grants the motion to compel, it also
grants attorney’s fees.
 
Plaintiff requests an hourly rate of $865.00 for Gabriel
Colwell. The Court finds this rate to be reasonable based on Colwell’s
experience.
 
Plaintiff requests a total of 10 hours for Colwell – 6 to
prepare the motion, and 4 to prepare a reply and appear at the hearing. The
Court reduces this time to 4 hours for the motion and 2 hours for the reply and
hearing, in accordance with what the Court views as reasonable.
 
The Court grants a total of $5,190.00 in attorney’s fees in
total. Elastic and Mahdara shall each pay $2,595.00 to Plaintiff’s counsel
within 30 days.
