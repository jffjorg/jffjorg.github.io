And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court awards attorney's fees to Plaintiff Jamar Bryant in the amount of $22,131, which includes 71.3 hours of work by Plaintiff's counsel at an average hourly rate of $312.50. The Court also awards costs to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,600.93, including $1,830.14 in litigation expenses. The Court rejects some of the hours billed by Plaintiff's counsel and reduces the attorney's fees accordingly. The Court also disallows certain costs, including $4,315 for time spent attending order to show cause hearings. The Court finds that some of the time spent by Plaintiff's counsel was excessive or unnecessary, and therefore reduces the attorney's fees.
