Bryant v.
General Motors, LLC, et. al., Case
No. 22STCV11876
 
Tentative Ruling
re:  Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees 
 
            Plaintiff Jamar
Bryant moves for an award of attorney’s fees and costs against Defendant GM.
The motion is granted. Attorney’s fees and costs are awarded to Plaintiff in
the amount of $23,631.93.
 
“[A]s a general rule, attorney fees
are not recoverable as costs unless they are authorized by statute or
agreement.” (People ex rel. Dept. of
Corporations v. Speedee Oil Change Systems, Inc. (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
424, 429.)  
In a lemon law action, costs, and expenses,
including attorney fees, may be recovered by a prevailing buyer under the
Song-Beverly Act. (See Civ. Code, §§ 1790, et seq.) Civ. Code § 1794,
subd. (d) provides,
If the buyer prevails
in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to
recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.
The
attorney bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).) This burden requires competent evidence as
to the nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) “Testimony of an
attorney as to the number of hours worked on a particular case is sufficient
evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed
time records.” (Ibid.)  
A
plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs,
expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred. (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d
677, 682.) “In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of
work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the
specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier
Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) 
 
            In determining whether the requested
attorney’s fees are “reasonable,” the Court’s “first step involves the lodestar
figure—a calculation based on the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the lawyer’s hourly rate. The lodestar figure may then be
adjusted, based on consideration of facts specific to the case, in order to fix
the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp.
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774 [internal citations omitted].) In determining
whether to adjust the lodestar figure, the Court may consider the nature and
difficulty of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required
and employed to handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure,
and other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm
LLC v. Teitler (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)
“‘The reasonable market value of the
attorney's services is the measure of a reasonable hourly rate. [Citations.]
This standard applies regardless of whether the attorneys claiming fees charge
nothing for their services, charge at below-market or discounted rates,
represent the client on a straight contingent fee basis, or are in-house
counsel. [Citations.]’”
(Center For Biological Diversity v. County of
San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 619.)
 
            Plaintiff moves for an award of
costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees, as the prevailing party pursuant
to GM’s Offer of Compromise. (Ex. 6, ¶1.) Plaintiff requests fees in the amount
of $31,027.50, litigation expenses in the amount of $1,830.14, for a total
award of $32,857.64. The fees are broken down as follows:

(Plaintiff’s Motion

Timeliness of
Motion
“A notice of motion to claim
attorney's fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in
the trial court--including attorney's fees on an appeal before the rendition of
judgment in the trial court--must be served and filed within the time for
filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited civil
case or under rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited civil case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1702, subd. (b).) 
Pursuant to CRC rule 3.104, (a)(1)
“Unless a statute or rules 8.108, 8.702, or 8.712 provide otherwise, a notice
of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of: (A) 60 days after the
superior court clerk serves on the party filing the notice of appeal a document
entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the
judgment, showing the date either was served; (B) 60 days after the party
filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document
entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the
judgment, accompanied by proof of service; or (C) 180 days after entry of
judgment.”

            
Defendant GM states that Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees is
untimely because Plaintiff filed this motion on February 14, 2024, which is 323
days after the parties signed the settlement agreement. (Opposition, p. 4.) Defendant
GM cites Kaufman v. Diskeeper Corp. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1, 8, which states
that the “deadline ordinarily falls 60 days after notice of entry of judgment,
or 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first.” (Opposition, p. 4.)
Plaintiff responds by stating that the Offer to Compromise was not filed with
this Court, the matter has not been dismissed and judgment has not been
entered. (Plaintiff’s Reply, Line 11-16, p.3.) 
 
The Court agrees with the Plaintiff and finds that the motion is
timely. 
 
Reasonableness
of Hours and Rates
Requested rates are reasonable if
they are “within the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially
awarded comparable attorneys for comparable work.” (Children’s Hospital
& Medical Center v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.) In
calculating the lodestar rate, “the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity
with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the
attorney requesting fees [Citation], the difficulty or complexity of the
litigation to which that skill was applied [Citations], and affidavits from
other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate
determinations in other cases. [Citation.]” (569
East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437.)
The Court
finds Plaintiff’s counsels’ rates reasonable.
 
Defendant GM contends that the Plaintiff
is seeking compensation for unsubstantiated or unreasonable hours and fees.
(GM’s Opposition, p. 6.) GM has challenged the following hours submitted by the
Plaintiff. (Id., pp. 6-9.) The Court discusses each contention as
follows.
 
1.     
Pre-Engagement Research—March 16, 2022: Defendant
contends that Plaintiff’s counsel cannot be awarded fees for work done before
counsel was retained. Plaintiff responds by stating that time that an attorney
spends on a case before the action is filed may be compensable as per the
holding in Webb v. Board of Educ. (1985) 4 71 US 234. The Court agrees
with the Plaintiff and finds the fee charged reasonable.  
 
2.     
Communications with Plaintiff Regarding “Case Status”
Before Case Filed—April 4, 2022: Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s counsel
should not be compensated for communicating with the Plaintiff before Counsel
drafted a complaint. The Court disagrees and finds the fee charged
reasonable.  
 
3.     
TPUSA Claim—June 3, 2022: Defendant GM contends that
Plaintiff’s counsel should not be compensated for time spent reviewing
co-defendant TPUSA’s counsel’s response to Plaintiff’s complaint. Defendant GM
cites  the Barry Declaration to support
their position. However, this declaration does not support their claim, nor
does it mention reviewing the response of GM’s co-defendant. However, the
Activities Export, Ex. 6. p.2, does support their assertion because it states
that Plaintiff billed to “Review Declaration of R. Salaam in Response to
Plaintiffs Complaint”. Therefore, the Court agrees with Defendant’s finding
that Defendant GM cannot be billed for this activity and reduces attorney’s
fees by $125 (0.2 hours).    
 
4.     
Templated Discovery Requests to GM—August 2, 3 & 4,
2022: Defendant GM argues that Plaintiff used templates to draft discovery
requests and that drafting the discovery requests did not take as long as
Defendant GM stated. Plaintiff responds by stating that templates allow them to
take less time overall, but templates still have to be tailored to fit the
current case therefore their costs are reasonable. The Court agrees with the Plaintiff
and finds the fees reasonable. 
 
5.     
Reviewing GM’s Discovery Responses and Objections to
Deposition Notices— September 23, 28, & 29 and October 10, 2022: Defendant
GM states that none of the responses were novel and it should not have taken 4
hours to review the discovery responses. Instead, it should have only taken an
hour. Plaintiffs respond by stating that a tailored review of discovery
requests was conducted because the discovery is unique to each case. The Court
agrees with the Plaintiff and find the fees reasonable. 
 
6.     
Excessive Time Drafting Canned Meet-and-Confer
Correspondence, Review of GM’s Meet-and-Confer Emails and related File
Review—September 30, October 10, 14, 21 & 26, November 1, 2022: Defendant
GM states that Plaintiff’s hours should be reduced because Plaintiff used
recycled meet and confer letters and emails. Plaintiff only needed to change
the case name and number. Plaintiff responds by stating that time was spent
preparing for litigation thus it is compensable (See Serrano v Unruh
(1982) 32 Cal.App 3d 621.) The Court agrees with the Plaintiff and finds the
fees reasonable. 
 
7.     
Redundant and Excessive Communication with Plaintiff –
June 3, 7, September 16, November 23 & 28, 2022; February 2, March 10 &
19, June 2, 5 & 7, 2023: Defendant states that Plaintiff’s counsel had
redundant and excessive communication with Plaintiff. Communication in
preparation for litigation is compensable. The Court agrees with the Plaintiff
and finds the fees reasonable.
 
8.     
Recycled Discovery Motions– January 4, 6, & 9,
February 6 & 8, March 3, 6, 7, 8 & 13, 2023: Defendant GM states that
Plaintiff spent “a staggering 16.5 hours” preparing and reviewing briefs that
are based on templates. Plaintiffs respond by stating billable work must be
performed to tailor the discovery to the specific facts of each case.
Therefore, the time billed is not excessive merely because templates were used.
The Court finds that these fees are reasonable. 
 
9.     
Reviewing (and only reviewing) GM’s Discovery
Requests—March 9-10, 2023: Defendant GM contends that it is unreasonable for
Plaintiff to spend 1.5 hours reading a discovery request because this time does
not include answering the request. Defendant GM states that the firm
representing Plaintiff currently has 200 pending cases against GM. These cases
are not novel and do not significantly vary. The Court agrees and grants a
reduction for 1 hour ($445).
 
10.  General
Case Management & Memo to and Reviews of File – April 14, June 13,
September 12, October 20, November 13 & 14, 2022; March 14, August 31,
November 1, 2023. Defendant GM contends that they should not be billed for
clerical tasks that pertain to the management of case files. The Court agrees
and grants a reduction for 2.6 hours ($1,076.50).
 
11.  Travel
Time – September 13 and November 14, 2022; August 31, November 1, 2023;
February 1, 2024, and May 3, 2024. Defendant GM states that GM should not have
to pay for travel time to hearings because the cost could have been avoided if
the Plaintiff had exercised due diligence. As a result of lack of diligence,
multiple hearing to show cause were held. Except as set forth below, the Court disagrees
as time spent traveling to hearings is a cost incurred during the course of
litigation. 
 
12.  Order
to Show Cause Hearings and related declarations – August 18 & 31, October
25, November 1, 2023; January 31, February 1 & 5, 2024.  Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s 998 offer,
with the exception of the offer of $10,000 in attorney’s fees, on March 28,
2023.  Thereafter, no activity was
recorded on the file until June 2, 2023. 
Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement on June 21, 2023.  The Court set an order to show cause
regarding dismissal for August 31, 2023. 
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration prior to the hearing explaining
that more time was needed to negotiate the attorney’s fees issue before the
dismissal could be filed.  An order to
show cause regarding dismissal was set for November 1, 2023 and again for
February 1, 2024.  Notably, the billing
records do not reflect any entry for meeting and conferring with Defendant’s
counsel regarding the fees and Defendant’s counsel declares that there was no
meet and confer.  Between June 2, 2023
and February 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel billed over $4,000 to attend the
orders to show cause, in person, before finally filing the instant fee
motion.  This time was not reasonably and
necessarily incurred and seems to have been designed simply to increase the fee
award.  The Court will disallow fees in
the amount of $4,315 for these activities.
 
13.  Attorneys’
Fees Demand—January 22, 23, & 31, May 2-3, 2024, and TBD: Defendant GM
contends that Plaintiff should not be compensated for reviewing and revising
their personal declarations because these are not fact specific and do not
change from case to case, except for the caption. Additionally, their fee
motion is virtually identical to a fee motion that Plaintiff’s Counsel recently
filed against GM in another case. Lastly, this one activity accounts for over
15% of all of Counsel’s billed fees. Defendant GM is asking for a reduction
from 10 hours to 4 hours. The Court agrees that the time claimed for this
straightforward motion is excessive and will deduct $2,935
            
Accordingly, the Court awards attorney’s fees in the amount of $22,131.
 
Costs
Plaintiff also seeks reimbursement
for $1,830.14 in costs and expenses. The Song-Beverly Act allows a prevailing
buyer to recover reasonably incurred costs and expenses. (See Civ. Code, §
1794, subd. (d).) 
 
Defendant argues that the requested
costs should be taxed in the amount of  $44.95 for delivery of courtesy copies.  “Costs for courier or messenger fees are not specifically enumerated as allowable costs in Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a), neither are they prohibited
in subdivision (b). Thus, messenger fees
may be recoverable in the trial court's discretion if ‘reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation.’ ” (Foothill-De Anza Community College Dist.
v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 30.)
This Court does not require courtesy copies and
therefore $44.95 will be disallowed.
Defendant objects to parking and mileage fees
for in person appearances at certain hearings, including the three hearings re
the order to show cause regarding dismissal after settlement.  None of these hearings involved motions or
other complicated issues so Plaintiff could easily have attended remotely.  Certainly, as the Court has indicated, the
hearings regarding the long awaited dismissal were entirely unnecessary.  The Court will disallow $184.26
The Court awards Plaintiff costs in
the amount of $1,600.93.
