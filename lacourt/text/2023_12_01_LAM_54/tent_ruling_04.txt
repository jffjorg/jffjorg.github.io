IS GRANTED. 
 
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.

The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
CCP § 36(a) provides, “[a] party to a
civil action who is over 70 years of age may petition the court for a
preference, which the court shall grant if the court makes both of the
following findings: (1) The party has a substantial interest in the action as a
whole; and (2) the health of the party is such that a preference is necessary
to prevent prejudicing the party's interest in the litigation.” 
 
Plaintiff moves for trial preference under
the mandatory provision of CCP § 36. Plaintiff is 82 years old and suffers from
a complex cardiac medical condition. Plaintiff asserts that her health is
declining, making preference necessary to prevent prejudice to Plaintiff. This
is sufficient to establish entitlement to trial preference. Defendants do not
oppose this motion.
 
Plaintiff’s motion for trial preference is
GRANTED.
