And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendant, Local Initiative Health Authority for Los Angeles County dba L.A. Care Health Plan, to the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Doctors Medical Center of Modesto, Inc., Lakewood Regional Medical Center, Inc., and Los Alamitos Medical Center, Inc.

The plaintiffs allege that the defendant failed to pay the reasonable value of medical services provided to its health plan enrollees, and they assert causes of action for breach of implied-in-law contract, quantum meruit, negligence, and breach of written contract.

The defendant argues that the plaintiffs may only plead a claim for quantum meruit against the defendant under County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1034, and that the other claims are duplicative. However, the court finds that the holding in County of Santa Clara does not limit permissible claims to quantum meruit, and that the plaintiffs may allege alternative theories of liability.

Therefore, the court overrules the defendant's demurrer to the first through third causes of action for breach of implied-in-law contract and breach of implied-in-fact contract.

Additionally, the court overrules the defendant's demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action for failure to discharge a mandatory duty under Gov. Code ยง 815.6, finding that the plaintiffs may allege alternative theories of liability even if they "conflict" in some ways.

The defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
