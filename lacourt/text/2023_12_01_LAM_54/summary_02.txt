* "The complaint is to be construed liberally to determine whether a cause of action has been stated."
* "Fraud, including negligent misrepresentation, must be pled with specificity."
* "The particularity demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the first through third, sixth, and seventh causes of action in the plaintiff's complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The demurrer to the fourth cause of action is overruled. The judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's prayers for punitive damages and attorney's fees. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve a second amended complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling, and the defendants are ordered to file and serve a response within 30 days thereafter.
