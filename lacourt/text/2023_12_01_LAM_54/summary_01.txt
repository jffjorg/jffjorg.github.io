And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to bifurcate and expedite review in a case involving the City of Los Angeles and the Crane Boulevard Safety Coalition. The City is seeking to bifurcate the trial into two separate phases: one for the first four causes of action, which relate to the City's compliance with CEQA and other statutory obligations with respect to a specific property, and the fifth cause of action, which addresses the City's broader pattern and practice of statutory compliance. The City argues that bifurcation will promote judicial economy and reduce the need for extensive discovery. The Coalition, however, disputes this, arguing that the issues are not as separate as the City claims and that discovery is necessary to address the overlapping issues. The Judge requires additional information from the parties and has asked them to address certain questions at the hearing, including whether the administrative record has been completed, whether discovery is permitted for certain causes of action, and what discovery is necessary for the fifth cause of action.
