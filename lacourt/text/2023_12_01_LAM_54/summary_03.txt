Summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and motion to strike filed by the defendants, David Notowitz, et al. The plaintiff, Aleksandr Gruzman, alleges that the defendants, who advertise as audiovisual experts, misrepresented their ability to enhance audio and visual recordings. The plaintiff has alleged causes of action for fraud, unfair competition, professional negligence, and declaratory and injunctive relief.

The court has found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged fraud, and therefore, the demurrer to the first through third causes of action is overruled. The court has also found that the plaintiff's causes of action for unfair competition and declaratory relief are derivative of the fraud claims and are therefore also overruled.

The court has denied the motion to strike the prayers for punitive damages and attorney's fees. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff's causes of action for fraud were not pled with the requisite specificity, but the court found that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support his claims.

The court has ordered the defendants to file and serve an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling. The court has also ordered the defendants to file a notice of ruling.
