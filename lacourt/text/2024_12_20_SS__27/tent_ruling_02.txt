I.           
INTRODUCTION
On
January 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the present negligence action arising from a motor
vehicle collision. On August 30, 2024, Defendant Steven Linson (“Defendant”)
served Supplemental Interrogatories and Supplemental Requests for Production of
Documents on Plaintiff. (Miller Decls., ¶ 2.) On October 25, 2024, Defense counsel
sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff requesting discovery responses. (Miller
Decls., ¶ 4, Ex. B.) As of the date of filing the instant motions, Plaintiff
has failed to respond to the Supplemental Interrogatories or Supplemental
Requests for Production of Documents. (Miller Decls., ¶ 5.) Consequently, on November
18, 2024, Defendant brought the instant motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses
and requests for monetary sanctions. Plaintiff does not oppose either of the instant
motions.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
A party must respond to interrogatories
and requests for production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).) If
a party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of documents are
directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for
an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also waives the
right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or work-product
protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel responses
to interrogatories or production of documents other than the cut-off on hearing
discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd.
(a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) No meet and confer efforts are
required before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.)

DISCUSSION
1.  
Motion
to Compel Responses
On
August 30, 2024, Defendant served Supplemental Interrogatories and Supplemental
Requests for Production of Documents on Plaintiff. (Miller Decls., ¶ 2.) On
October 25, 2024, Defense counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff
requesting discovery responses. (Miller Decls., ¶ 4, Ex. B.) As of the date of
filing the instant motions, Plaintiff has failed to respond to the Supplemental
Interrogatories or Supplemental Requests for Production of Documents. (Miller
Decls., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff did
not oppose either motion. Thus, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling
Plaintiff’s responses to the Supplemental Interrogatories and
Supplemental Requests for Production of Documents, without objections.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s
motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Supplemental
Interrogatories and Supplemental Requests for Production of Documents.  
2.  
Request
for Monetary Sanctions
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent
part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of
the discovery process includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)  
The
Court finds Plaintiff’s failure to respond to Defendant’s Supplemental
Interrogatories and Supplemental Requests for Production of Documents a misuse
of the discovery process. Plaintiff has not opposed either motion and has
provided no substantial justification or other circumstances to make the
imposition of a sanction unjust. Thus, the Court imposes a monetary sanction on
Plaintiff for their failure to respond to Defendant’s discovery requests.  
For
each motion, Defendant has requested $860.00 in attorney fees based on the
following: two (2) hours spent on review of the file, writing the letter and
preparing the motion; one (1) hour to be spent on review and analysis of
anticipated opposition, and preparation of a reply brief; and one (1) hour to
be spent driving to and attending the hearings on the instant motions. (Miller Decls.,
¶ 6.) The hourly rate is $200 per hour. (Id.) In addition, the filing of
each motion was subject to a $60.00 filing fee. (Id.) 
Considering
the simplicity of the issues involved and the lack of opposition or reply, the
Court hereby reduces the sanctions awarded from what was requested to $650. Consequently,
the Court hereby orders Plaintiff and her counsel, jointly and severally, to
pay sanctions in the amount of $650.00 to Defendant, payable within 30 days of
today.
IV.        
CONCLUSION
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to
compel Plaintiff’s responses to Supplemental
Interrogatories.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to
compel Plaintiff’s responses to Supplemental
Requests for Production of Documents.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s Requests
for Monetary Sanctions in the amount of $650.00. 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
