And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted Defendant City National Bank's motion for attorney fees in the reduced amount of $27,200. The Court found that Defendant had not sufficiently set forth the basis for its fees request, and the hours worked were excessive. The Court ordered Defendant to file a supplemental declaration describing the work performed with billing sheets and sufficient detail to allow the Court to determine whether the work was reasonable and necessary to the litigation of the anti-SLAPP motion. The Court has reviewed the billing sheets and rules that the average rate for the work performed is reasonable at $500 per hour. The Court finds it reasonable to award Defendant $38 in attorney fees, which represents 76 hours of work at an average rate of $500.
