And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained, with 20 days' leave to amend. The plaintiff, Laguna del Rey, LLC, may amend its complaint only as authorized by the court's order and may not amend the complaint to add a new party or cause of action without permission. The action is reclassified to unlimited civil jurisdiction. The judge found that the plaintiff's complaint is defective in several ways, including an unclear statement of service of process and an inconsistent claim of forfeiture. The judge also found that the plaintiff's private nuisance claim is insufficient. The defendant, John Chickanis, is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
