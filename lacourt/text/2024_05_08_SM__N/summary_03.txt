Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages. The plaintiff failed to file an opposition to the motion, which can be considered a concession that the motion is meritorious. The court notes that the plaintiff's complaint contains irrelevant, false, or improper matter, specifically the prayer for punitive damages, which is not allowed under California law. The court also finds that the plaintiff's complaint does not conform to the laws of the state, as it prays for punitive damages, which is prohibited. The court has granted the defendant's motion without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff cannot refile the complaint to seek punitive damages.
