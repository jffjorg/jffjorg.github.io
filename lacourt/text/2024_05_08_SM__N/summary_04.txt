And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted in part Plaintiff Ocean Sunrise LLC's motion to deem requests for admission admitted against Defendant Enedelia Leal Powers. The court has ordered Defendant to provide verifications to her responses within 10 days of the entry of this order. The court has also granted in part Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $600.00, payable by Defendant and defense counsel to Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of the entry of this order.

The court has denied Plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admission admitted against Defendants Bonnie B. Flores and Christopher J. Flores, as the verifications were provided before the motion was filed. The court has granted in part Defendants' request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $600.00, payable by Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel to Defendants and defense counsel within 30 days of the entry of this order.

The court notes that this is the beginning of an excessive number of planned discovery motions, and the parties are advised to resolve their disputes informally to avoid the costs of a discovery referee.
