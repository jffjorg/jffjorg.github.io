Significant Statements:
  - The Court finds that the FAC is not uncertain because it is not so unclear that Defendants are not apprised of the issues that must be met.
  - The Court finds that the second cause of action for assault is insufficiently alleged against the Lalezary Defendants as Plaintiff has failed to allege that Defendant Lalezary intended to cause a harmful or offensive contact with Plaintiff.
  - The Court finds that the third cause of action states sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for sexual battery against the Lalezary Defendants.
  - The Court finds that the fourth cause of action for IIED is insufficiently alleged as it is much too conclusory.

And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses demurrers filed by the Lalezary Defendants and Defendant Regal to the Second Amended Complaint. The Court finds that the FAC is not uncertain and that the Second Cause of Action for Assault is insufficiently alleged against the Lalezary Defendants. The Court also finds that the Third Cause of Action for Sexual Battery states sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against the Lalezary Defendants, but that the Fourth Cause of Action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress is insufficiently alleged. The Court sustains the demurrers to the Second and Fourth Causes of Action with leave to amend, overrules the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action, and sustains the demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action with leave to amend.
