And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants, Achieve Home Care and Yanjun Pan, due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the requirements for a default judgment. The plaintiff has completed the necessary forms and submitted a supporting declaration, but has not provided sufficient evidence to support the amount of attorney's fees sought. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's declaration references an attached Exhibit 12, which is supposed to be an invoice from the plaintiff's attorney, but the exhibit is not attached to the declaration. The judge has continued the status conference re entry of default judgment to February 5, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.
