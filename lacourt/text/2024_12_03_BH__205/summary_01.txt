And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's request for default judgment in the amount of $28,873,506.00. The plaintiff's default judgment package is still deficient and fails to meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 585. The package lacks a CIV-100 request for court judgment form, a declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant, and complete interest computations. Additionally, the exhibits attached to the plaintiff's declaration do not substantiate the claimed damages. The judge is continuing the Order to Show Cause re Entry of Default Judgment to February 25, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., with no further continuances.
