Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the hearing on the Petition to Confirm Partial Final Arbitration Award is continued to March 12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. The judge notes that the petition was filed after the 100-day period allowed by law to request that the arbitration award be vacated or confirmed, and that the defendant failed to rescind the conveyance of easements to the defendant Spectrum Development, Inc. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's argument that their 139-day filing was timely is not supported by the law. The judge has concluded that the plain language of the statutes governing arbitration awards requires that the petition to confirm be filed within 100 days of the award's service, and that the response to the petition to confirm must be filed within 10 days after service of the petition to confirm. The judge has emphasized the importance of following the plain language of the statutes and has noted that the dispute over ownership and rights to finance a portion of the property will be continued to March 12, 2024.
