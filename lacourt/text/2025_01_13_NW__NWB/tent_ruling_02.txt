(“JSN”) and Mainor  Neftaly Escalante (“Escalante”)(collectively “Defendants”) filed the instant  motion for leave to conduct an independent medical examination (“IME”) of  Plaintiff Karla Sical (“Plaintiff.”) Plaintiff  has not filed an opposition.   II.           LEGAL STANDARD “Unless otherwise limited by order of the  court . . . any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not  privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending  action . . . if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears  reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Cal.  Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) Where any party seeks to obtain discovery by  a physical examination, the party shall obtain leave of the court. (CCP §  2032.310(a).) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration  under CCP § 2016.040. (CCP § 2032.310(b).) The Court shall grant the motion  only for good cause shown. (CCP§ 2032.320(a).)  “If a defendant who has demanded a physical  examination under this article, on receipt of the plaintiff’s response to that  demand, deems that any modification of the demand, or any refusal to submit to  the physical examination is unwarranted, that defendant may move for an order  compelling compliance with the demand.” (CCP § 2032.250(a).) A motion for  “medical examination over objection” must be accompanied by a separate  statement. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(a).)   III.        DISCUSSION  Meet and Confer Requirement On November 8, 2024, Defendants served Plaintiff  with a demand for an independent medical examination of plaintiff. (Park Decl.  ¶ 6; Exh. B [demand].) The exam was to be conducted by Mark Spoonamore, M.D. (“Dr.  Spoonamore”), on December 16, 2024. (Ibid.) Plaintiff served her  objection on December 12, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 8; Exh. C [objection].) Thereafter,  Defendants sent a meet and confer correspondence, informing Plaintiff that due  to her untimely objection, she had waived any objections. (Ibid. at ¶ 8;  Exh. D [meet and confer correspondence].) Plaintiff still did not appear for  her IME. (Ibid.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants satisfy  the meet and confer requirement.   Separate Statement Here, Plaintiff objected to the noticed IME  on December 12, 2024. (Park Decl. ¶ 7; Exh. C [objection].) However, all timely  objections were due by November 28, 2024. (CCP § 2032.230(b).) By failing to  serve a timely objection, Plaintiff waived all rights to object. (CCP §  2032.240(a).) Therefore, Defendants are not required to provide a separate  statement regarding the logistics of the proposed IME pursuant to CRC Rule  3.1345(a). Nonetheless, the Court notes that Defendants still did so on  December 23, 2024.   Good Cause Defendants contend that  there is good cause to compel Plaintiff’s IME because Plaintiff has placed  alleged physical injuries in controversy; specifically, Plaintiff alleges  injuries to her back, head, and neck. (Park Decl. ¶ 5; Exh. A [Plaintiff’s  discovery responses].)  Generally, courts find good  cause to compel any independent medical examination relating to injuries which  a plaintiff has put in controversy. Without an IME, Defendants cannot fully  evaluate Plaintiff’s injuries and prepare a defense for trial. Accordingly, the  Court finds that Defendants have shown good cause to compel Plaintiff’s IME.   Required Specifications of the Proposed IME A motion for an examination  must specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the  examination, as well as the identity and specialty, if any, of the person or  persons who will perform the examination. (CCP § 2032.310(b).) The IME is to be conducted  by orthopedic surgeon Mark Spoonamore, M.D. (See  Separate Statement.) The IME will be scheduled for the  first date and time that Dr. Spoonamore is available. (Ibid.) Defendants  state that the examination will determine the “skeletal, muscular, soft tissue,  or nerve damages or injuries to, or abnormality of Plaintiff’s neck, cervical  spine, upper extremities, shoulders, forearms, wrists, hands, back, lumbar  spine, lower extremities, legs, hips, knees, ankles, and feet.” (Ibid.)  The examination may consist of questions about Plaintiff’s medications and  medical history. (Ibid.) It will not include any diagnostic test or  procedure that is “painful, protracted, or intrusive.” (Ibid.)  Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants provide the required  specifications of the proposed IME pursuant to CCP § 2032.310(b).   Sanctions Here,  sanctions are appropriate since Plaintiff’s untimely objection and failure to  appear at the December 16, 2024, IME constitutes a misuse of the discovery  process pursuant to CCP § 2023.010. Defendant moves to impose monetary  sanctions in the amount of $675.00, comprised of three hours of work at an  hourly rate of $205.00 and a $60.00 filing fee. (Park Decl. ¶ 9.) However, considering  that Plaintiff did not oppose this motion, the Court imposes sanctions against  Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, in the reduced amount  of $470.00.   IV.     CONCLUSION Defendants’  motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to appear for Defendants’ independent  medical examination conducted by Mark Spoonamore, M.D., as prescribed in  Defendants’ separate statement. Additionally,  the Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly  and severally, in the amount of $470.00, payable to defense counsel within 20  days of this hearing. Moving  party is ordered to give notice. Court to sign proposed order.          Dated:  January 10, 2025                                 __________________________________ Hon.

Re:                   21STCV42015,
Sical, MTC Plaintiff’s Depo.

 

BACKGROUND

 

On December 3, 2024, Defendants JSN General
Contractors Inc. (“JSN”) and Mainor Neftaly Escalante (“Escalante”)(collectively
“Defendants”) initially noticed the deposition of Plaintiff Karla Sical (“Plaintiff”),
for December 17, 2024. (Park Decl. ¶ 6; Exh. A [notice].) Plaintiff did not
object to the deposition. (Ibid. at ¶ 7.) However, Plaintiff failed to
appear for the noticed December 17, 2024, deposition. (Ibid. at ¶ 8;
Exh. B [certificate of non-appearance].)

 

On December 23, 2024, Defendants filed the
instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition.

 

Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.

 

LEGAL
STANDARD

 

Any party may obtain any discovery of
information, documents, land, property, or electronically stored information so
long as the discoverable matter is not privileged, is relevant to the subject
matter, and can lead one to admissible evidence. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc.
§ 2017.010.)

 

CCP § 2025.450 provides in
pertinent part the following:

 

“(a) If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, 

managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that

is a party under Section 2025.230,
without having served a valid objection under 

Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce 

for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing 

described in the deposition notice,
the party giving the notice may move for an order 

compelling the deponent's attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection             of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the          deposition notice.

 

(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with both of the following:

  

(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.

 

(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016.040 or, when the deponent fails
to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.

 

DISCUSSION

 

On December 3, 2024, Defendants
properly served Plaintiff’s notice of deposition for December 17. (Park
Decl. ¶ 6; Exh. A [notice].) Plaintiff did not object to the deposition. (Ibid.
at ¶ 7.) However, Plaintiff failed to appear for the noticed December 17,
2024, deposition. (Ibid. at ¶ 8; Exh. B [certificate of
non-appearance].)

 

Therefore, pursuant to
CCP §§ 2025.010 and 2025.450, the Court grants Defendants’ motion to compel
Plaintiff’s deposition. Plaintiff is ordered to appear for oral deposition
within 15 days of this hearing.

 

Defendants request
sanctions in the amount of $675.00,
representing three hours of work at an hourly rate of $205.00 and a $60.00
filing fee. (Park Decl. ¶ 9.) The Court awards sanctions in the reduced amount
of $470.00, considering that no opposition was filed.

 

CONCLUSION

 

For the foregoing
reasons, Defendants’ motion is GRANTED.

 

Plaintiff is ordered to
appear for oral deposition within 15 days of this hearing.

 

Moving party to give notice.
