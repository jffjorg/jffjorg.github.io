And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion by defendants JSN General Contractors Inc. and Mainor Neftaly Escalante to compel a deposition and an independent medical examination (IME) of plaintiff Karla Sical. The plaintiff has alleged physical injuries and the defendants seek to conduct an IME to evaluate these injuries. However, the plaintiff failed to appear for a previously noticed deposition and IME. The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel the deposition and IME, and also imposes sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $470.00. The judge finds that the defendants have shown good cause to compel the IME, and that the plaintiff's failure to appear for the deposition and IME constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.
