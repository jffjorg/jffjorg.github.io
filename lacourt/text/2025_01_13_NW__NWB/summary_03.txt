Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier LLC, and Rasier-CA LLC (collectively "Defendants") to conduct an additional independent medical examination (IME) of Plaintiff Tomas Cruz. The Defendants had sought to conduct the IME to examine Cruz's ocular injuries, which they claimed were relevant to Cruz's claims for injuries and damages. However, the judge found that the Defendants had failed to comply with the meet and confer requirement and had not provided a separate statement regarding the logistics of the proposed IME. The judge also found that, although Cruz had put ocular injuries in controversy, the Defendants had yet to conduct an IME related to those injuries and that the motion must still be denied for procedural deficiencies.
