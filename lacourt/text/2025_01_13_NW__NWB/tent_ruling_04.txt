  OF WORKERS’ COMPENSATION LIEN

I.      
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff
Ralph Chiappone (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center (“Cedars-Sinai”) and Does 1 to 50 on April 14, 2022, for injuries
arising from a May 17, 2021, incident, when Plaintiff fell through a covered
grate on Cedars-Sinai's premises while performing work as an employee of Grady
Electric. The issue before the Court today is the determination of Plaintiff’s
worker’s compensation lien.
Before
mediation, Plaintiff’s counsel contacted Grady Electric’s worker’s compensation
carrier, AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (“AmTrust”), to obtain Plaintiff’s
most current worker’s compensation lien amount. (Popka Decl. ¶ 5.) At this
time, Plaintiff’s counsel also requested for an AmTrust representative to
attend the mediation. (Ibid.) On November 29, 2023, AmTrust provided
Plaintiff’s counsel with a lien amount of $40,741.26. (Ibid.; Exh. A
[worker’s compensation lien notice].) Despite assuring the availability of a
representative for this action’s February 21, 2024, mediation, AmTrust failed
to send a representative for mediation. (Ibid.) They also failed to
answer the phone during mediation. (Ibid.) As a result, Plaintiff’s
counsel was allegedly forced to rely on the lien amount of $40,741.26 when
settling with Cedars-Sinai during mediation. (Ibid. at ¶ 6.)
During
litigation and mediation, Cedars-Sinai asserted substantial employer
negligence. (Ibid. at ¶ 7.) Therefore, after obtaining a settlement,
Plaintiff’s counsel contacted AmTrust to negotiate a lien reduction due to the
employer negligence issue. (Ibid.; Exh. B [Plaintiff’s March 6, 2024,
email communications with AmTrust].) At this time, Plaintiff was informed that
the lien had more than doubled from $40,741.26 to $90,741.26. (Ibid. at
¶ 7.) Plaintiff asserts this amount is a material change which would have impacted
Plaintiff’s settlement agreement and negotiations with Cedars-Sinai. (Ibid.)
As
a result, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for determination of worker’s
compensation lien on September 18, 2024, seeking to reduce the right of
reimbursement by attorney’s fees and costs and 75% employer negligence to
$5,764.82. (Notice of Motion p. 2.) Plaintiff asserts AmTrust is equitably
estopped from recovering a lien greater than $40,741.26.
On
October 28, 2024, Security National Insurance Company (“Security”), a non-party
and of which AmTrust is an authorized agent, filed their opposition.
On
October 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed their reply.
On
November 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed an additional brief in support of their
motion.
On
November 13, 2024, a hearing was held on the instant motion. The Court ordered
that there would be no further briefing by the Plaintiff and that a sur reply,
if any, was to be filed by December 6, 2024. (See November 13, 2024,
Minute Order.)
On
November 19, 2024, Security filed a reply to Plaintiff’s November 4, 2024,
supplemental briefing.
 
II.    LEGAL
STANDARDS
Equitable Estoppel
“To prove equitable estoppel, one must show
(1) a representation or concealment of material facts; (2) made with knowledge,
actual or virtual, of the facts; (3) to a party ignorant, actually and
permissibly, of the truth; (4) with the intention, actual or virtual, that the
ignorant party act on it; and (5) the ignorant party relied on it. (Oldcastle
Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 554,
571.)
 
Worker’s Compensation
Liens
            Cal. Lab. Code § 3856 allows a
worker’s compensation carrier to recover the total amount of its expenditures
for compensation paid out to an injured employee if the employee obtains a
settlement from a third-party defendant. (Cal. Lab. Code § 3856.) The purpose
of this statute is to prevent double recovery of damages by the employee. However,
if the action is prosecuted by the employee alone, the court must first set
aside “reasonable litigation expenses incurred in preparation and prosecution
of such action, together with a reasonable attorney’s fee which shall be based
solely upon the services rendered by the employee’s attorney in effecting
recovery both for the benefit of the employee and the employer.” (Lab. Code §
3856(a).) After setting such expenses and attorneys’ fees, the court shall
allow as a first lien for the employer against the judgment for damages,
expenditure for compensation, and special damages. (Ibid.) An employer
is entitled to be reimbursed for “compensation,” which is defined as “every
benefit or payment conferred upon an injured employee” and includes
medical-legal expenses, vocational rehabilitation expenses, disability
indemnity payments, death benefits, and interest. (Lab. Code §§ 3207,
4600-4608, 4635-4647, 4650-4663, and 4700-4709.)  
Lab.
Code § 3860 provides for the reduction of the settlement available for the
employer’s reimbursement by mandating the deduction of reasonable expenses,
costs of suit, and a reasonable attorney’s fee. (Lab. Code § 3860.) The common
fund doctrine is incorporated in Lab. Code § 3856 and requires a passive
beneficiary to contribute expenses of litigation. (Quinn v. State of
California (1975) 15 Cal.3d 162, 167.) 
Furthermore, the principle of equitable apportionment is applicable
where both employee and employer retain separate attorneys so long as the
resulting fund is procured through the efforts of only one of them. (Kaplan
v. Industrial Indem. Co. (1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 700, 709.)  
 
III.
DISCUSSION
Equitable Estoppel
First, the Court will discuss if Security is
estopped from claiming a lien amount of $90,741.26. 
Here, it’s undisputed that, on November 29,
2023, Security represented to Plaintiff that the lien amount was $40,741.26. (See
Popka Decl. ¶ 5; Opposition p. 2:19-22.) In Plaintiff’s counsel’s November 28,
2023, email to Security, Plaintiff’s counsel stated: “We need to know if the
workers’ comp carrier will be asserting any lien in this matter. If so, please
provide us with the amount of the lien. The defendant is interested in
resolving the case, but in order to have meaningful discussions, we need to
know the amount of the workers’ compensation lien if one is being asserted.”
(Popka Decl. Exh. B [November 28, 2023 correspondence].) In response, Security
provided a letter with a current payment ledger showing a total lien of
$40,741.26. (Ibid.) The letter also states: “Please note the workers’
compensation claim remains open and the lien amount may increase. Please do
not enter into a settlement or settlement negotiations without our approval.”
(Ibid.)(emphasis in original.)
Here, the first, second, and third elements
of equitable estoppel are met. Security represented the lien amount, which is a
material fact related to the settlement, made with actual knowledge of the
accrued lien amount to Plaintiff, who was ignorant of the true lien amount.
However, Security noted that the lien amount could increase and emphasized that
Plaintiff should not enter into a settlement or settlement negotiations without
Security’s approval. (See Popka Decl. Exh. B [November 28, 2023
correspondence].) Therefore, the fourth element of intent is not met. Clearly,
Security did not intend for Plaintiff to rely on the amount of $40,741.26 when
entering into settlement. 
Additionally, the fifth element of reliance
is not met. Although Plaintiff relied on the November 29, 2023, lien amount, such
reliance was not reasonable. Detrimental reliance, for the purpose of equitable
estoppel, must be reasonable. (Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. (1995)
11 Cal.4th 1, 35.) Security claims that, on December 15, 2023, Plaintiff
settled his worker’s compensation claim by Compromise and Release. (Opposition
p. 2:23-27.) Security represents that they attached the Compromise and Release
as Exhibit 4, however, Exhibit 4 appears to be the Compromise and Release of an
unrelated individual attached by error. Therefore, the Court does not consider
this assertion by Security. However, the Court does consider the undisputed
fact that, on March 6, 2024, Security informed Plaintiff of the final lien
amount of $90,741.26. (Popka Decl. ¶ 7; Exh. B [March 6, 2024 email
communications].) While Plaintiff might have agreed on a settlement amount during
the February 21, 2024, mediation, such settlement was not final. Security
asserts that the settlement was finalized on March 25, 2024, and attaches the settlement
agreement as Exhibit 5. Plaintiff argues that the settlement agreement is
inadmissible pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code § 1152. However, § 1152 does not
protect actual settlement agreements – it only protects statements made during
settlement negotiations which are offered to prove liability. (Simandle v.
Vista de Santa Barbara Associates, LP (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1317, 1323.) Regardless,
Plaintiff does not dispute that they entered a final settlement agreement on
March 25, 2024, after Security provided the final lien amount. Until signing
the final settlement agreement, Plaintiff still had an opportunity to negotiate
its terms. Therefore, Plaintiff’s reliance on Security’s November 29, 2023,
lien amount of $40,741.26 was unreasonable, especially in light of Security’s advising
that Plaintiff should not enter into a settlement agreement without their
approval. (See Popka Decl. Exh. B [November 28, 2023 correspondence].)
Additionally, while Plaintiff’s supplemental briefing provides a November 30,
2023, email in which Security stated that the “total amount of Lien [sic] is $40,741.26
and the settlement for WC [sic] will not be added”, that same email states that
the worker’s compensation claim was “still . . . open on [Security’s end” and
that they were uncertain if there were more bills to be paid. (Plaintiff’s
November 4, 2024, Supplemental Brief Exh. 1 [November 30, 2023,
correspondence].) Ultimately, this email is vague and does not change the fact
that Security provided the final lien amount of $90,741.26 before Plaintiff
entered into a binding settlement agreement. Therefore, Plaintiff’s reliance
remains unreasonable.
Accordingly, Security is not estopped from
claiming the final lien amount of $90,741.26.
 
Reduction of Lien Amount
Plaintiff also asserts that the lien amount
should be reduced by 75% due to employer negligence, claiming that a
“reasonable inspection” of the premises would have revealed the concealed
hazard. However, this duty is imputed upon Cedars-Sinai, the property owner of
the premises where the hazard existed. (Acosta v. MAS Realty, LLC (2023)
96 Cal.App.5th 635, 639.) It’s well-established law that, generally, an
employer of an independent contractor is not liable for hazards created by
third party property owners. (Ibid.) Therefore, a reduction of the lien
amount based on employer negligence would be contrary to settled law.
Security does not dispute that a reduction of
the lien amount in accounting for attorney’s fees and costs is proper. Plaintiff’s
incurred fees and costs amount to 43.4007% of the total recovery. (Motion p. 5:20-24.)
The final settlement amount is $110,000.00. Therefore, a reduction of the final
lien amount for attorney’s fees and costs of $47,740.77 is appropriate.
(.434007 x 110,000). This entitles Security to reimbursement of $43,000.49. ($90,741.26
- $47,740.77.)
 
IV.
CONCLUSION
            Security is entitled
to a final lien amount of $43,000.49.
            Moving party to give
notice.
