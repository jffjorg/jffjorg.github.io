TRIAL
  DATE: MARCH 17, 2025



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
On
December 30, 2021, Plaintiff Brittany Moore (“Moore”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Tomas Cruz (“Cruz”), Alvaro Alacon (“Alacon”), Uber Technologies,
Inc. (“Uber”), Rasier LLC (“Rasier”), Rasier-CA LLC (“Rasier-CA”), and Does 1
through 50 alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence.
On
January 11, 2022, Cruz filed a complaint against Defendants Alacon, Uber,
Rasier, Rasier-CA, and Does 1 through 25 alleging one cause of action for
negligence.
On
May 21, 2023, a joint stipulation was filed and granted to consolidate Moore
and Cruz’s complaints in the instant action.
On
October 3, 2024, Defendants Uber, Rasier, and Rasier-CA (collectively
“Defendants”) filed the instant motion for leave to conduct an additional
independent medical examination (“IME”) of Plaintiff Cruz.
On
December 30, 2024, Cruz filed their oppositions.
On
January 3, 2025, Defendants filed their reply.
 
II.         
LEGAL STANDARD
“Unless otherwise limited by order of the
court . . . any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action . . . if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Cal.
Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)
Where any party seeks to obtain discovery by
a physical examination, the party shall obtain leave of the court. (CCP § 2032.310(a).)
The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under CCP §
2016.040. (CCP § 2032.310(b).) The Court shall grant the motion only for good
cause shown. (CCP§ 2032.320(a).) 
“If a defendant who has demanded a physical
examination under this article, on receipt of the plaintiff’s response to that
demand, deems that any modification of the demand, or any refusal to submit to
the physical examination is unwarranted, that defendant may move for an order
compelling compliance with the demand.” (CCP § 2032.250(a).) A motion for
“medical examination over objection” must be accompanied by a separate
statement. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(a).)
 
III.      
DISCUSSION

Meet and Confer Requirement
On July 26, 2024, Defendants served Cruz with
a demand for an independent medical examination of plaintiff. (Bonoli Decl. ¶
6; Exh. C [demand].) The exam was to be conducted by ophthalmologist Alfredo
Sadun, M.D. (“Dr. Sadun”), on September 3, 2024. (Ibid.) The exam would
pertain to Cruz’s alleged ocular injuries. (Ibid.) On July 30, 2024, Cruz
served an objection to Defendants’ IME demand. (Ibid. at ¶ 7; Exh. D
[objection].) On August 5, 2024, defense counsel sent Cruz’s counsel a meet and
confer letter setting forth grounds for the proposed IME. (Ibid. at ¶ 8;
Exh. E [August 5, 2024, correspondence].) Cruz’s counsel still refused to make Cruz
available for the IME. (Ibid.)
On August 26, 2024, the parties attended an
informal discovery conference (“IDC”) regarding this matter. (Bonoli Decl. ¶ 9;
Exh. F [IDC order].) The parties were unable to resolve their dispute. (Ibid.)
At this time, the Court ordered the parties to further meet and confer
regarding this issue. (Ibid.) Accordingly, defense counsel sent a
comprehensive five-page email analyzing their grounds for the proposed IME. (Ibid.
at ¶ 10; Exh. G [Defendants’ further meet and confer correspondence].) Cruz’s
counsel still refused to submit to the IME. (Ibid. at 11; Exh. H
[refusal].) Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendants satisfy the meet and
confer requirement.
 
Separate Statement
Here, Cruz objected to the noticed IME.
Therefore, Defendants are required to provide a separate statement regarding
the logistics of the proposed IME pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1345(a). Defendants
failed to file a separate statement. Accordingly, the Court must deny
Defendants’ motion.
This procedural issue noted, for both
parties’ benefit, the Court now discusses the merits of Defendants’ motion.
 
Good Cause
Defendants contend that
there is good cause to compel Cruz’s ophthalmology IME because Cruz has placed
alleged ocular injuries in controversy. (Bonoli Decl. ¶ 6.) Plaintiff opposes
on the grounds that Defendants have already conducted three separate IMEs of
Cruz relating to his “claims for orthopedic injuries and traumatic brain injury
at issue in this case.” (Opposition p. 1 at ¶ 1.) Cruz points to the IMEs
conducted by Defendants’ retained expert neurologist, expert neurosurgeon, and
expert neuropsychologist. (Ibid.) Further, Cruz argues that the irritant
in his eyes from the airbag deployment has resolved, so no ophthalmological
examination is necessary. (Ibid. p. 2 at ¶ 2.) Cruz notes that
Defendants’ motion is based on one medical visit that Cruz had with an
ophthalmologist nearly five years ago, on February 11, 2020. (Ibid. at ¶
3.) In the time that has elapsed since, Cruz has not sought any additional
medical treatment for his eye injury because it was resolved. (Ibid. at
¶ 4.) Therefore, Cruz argues, there is no eye injury for Defendants to examine.
(Ibid. at ¶ 5.) Cruz even states that they are willing to waive any
claim for eye injuries if the Court feels inclined to grant Defendants’ motion.
(Opposition p. 6:27-28 and 7:1-5.)
In their reply, Defendants
argue that Cruz received further ophthalmological treatment than what Cruz
claims in his opposition. Defendants argue that, on October 14, 2020, February
2, 2021, and April 7, 2022, Cruz saw ophthalmologist Eric Ikeda, O.D. (“Dr.
Ikeda”) for complaints of blurred vision, light sensitivity, eye fatigue, and
other ocular symptoms. (Reply p. 5:3-16.) Defendants also argue that Cruz is
attempting to conceal the fact that, at the time of the underlying accident,
Cruz was legally blind. (Ibid. at p. 4:13-20.) Therefore, Defendants
argue, Cruz’s vision is not only relevant as to Cruz’s claims for injuries and
damages, but also as to liability.
Generally, courts find good
cause to compel any independent medical examination relating to injuries which
a plaintiff has put in controversy. The purpose of discovery statutes are “to
educate the parties concerning their claims and defenses so as to encourage
settlements and to expedite and facilitate trial.” (Emerson Electric Co. V.
Superior Court (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1101, 1107.) “Discovery statutes in particular
are to be construed liberally in favor of disclosure.” (Reuter v. Superior
Court (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 332, 337.) “As a general matter, a defendant may
obtain a physical or mental examination of the plaintiff, in accordance with
those provisions, if the plaintiff has placed his or her physical or mental
condition in controversy.” (Carpenter v. Superior Court (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 249, 258.)
Here, Cruz has put ocular
injuries in controversy. Defendants have yet to conduct an IME related to those
injuries as they are entitled to do. Without Cruz's formal stipulation waiving
all claims and damages arising from ocular injuries, the Court would be
inclined to find good cause to compel the proposed ophthalmological IME.
Nonetheless, the instant motion must still be denied for the procedural
deficiencies discussed supra.
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
Based
on procedural deficiencies, Defendants’ motion is DENIED.
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
