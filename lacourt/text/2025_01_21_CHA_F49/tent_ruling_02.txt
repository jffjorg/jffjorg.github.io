BACKGROUND
This action arises from a

On July 20, 2022, Plaintiff,

action against Defendants City of Los Angeles (“City”) and Does 1 through 20.
The Complaint alleges the following causes of action: (1) dangerous condition
of public property, (2) negligence, and (3) strict liability. Subsequently, on September 16, 2022, Defendant City filed

Disposition 


REVIEW/CONTINUE 


 



Upon reviewing the Petition, the Court has identified the
following deficiencies:
 
(1)  
Balancing of
Amounts in Paragraph 12a:
 
The “total medical expenses before any
reductions” is reported as $69,733.88 (MC-350 ¶ 12(a)(1)). 
 
The “total medical expenses paid (include
payments by private insurance, Medi-Cal, or Medicare)” is $5,130.00 (id.
¶ 12(a)(2).) 
 
The $5,130.00 in paid medical expenses was covered
by Medi-Cal, which has agreed to accept reimbursement in the amount of
$2,216.49 in full satisfaction of its lien rights, resulting in a reduction of
$2,913.51. (MC-350, 12b(4).) 
 
However, after deducting the $2,216.49 for
Medi-Cal reimbursement from the proceeds, there remains an unexplained unpaid balance
of $64,603.88 ($69,733.88-$2,913.51 -$2,216.49 = $64,603.88). 
 
This description is not addressed in the
Petition and requires clarification.
 
(2)  
Incorrect Amount
on the Proposed Order (MC-351)
 
Under paragraph 8a of the MC-351 form, Petitioner
appears to have entered an incorrect amount for “Total
allowance for fees and expenses from the settlement.” (MC-351 ¶ 8a(5).)
 
Accordingly, the
Court requires supplemental information and amended petition papers to address
these deficiencies. A ruling will be issued after Petitioner has had an
opportunity to correct the issues identified above.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Petitioner
You Sun Jang’s Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim for Minor Krystal Shin is CONTINUED
to allow for the submission of additional information or corrections.
 
Moving
party to give notice.
