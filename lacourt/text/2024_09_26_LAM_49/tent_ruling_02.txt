Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)¿The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)B. AnalysisCounsel filed Civil forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 for each Defendant.  Counsel served the moving papers on the clients by mail on August 13, 2024. (See 08/13/24 Proof of Service.)  Counsel confirmed that the address is current within the last 30-days by telephone. (Forms MC-052, ¶ 3(b).)Counsel attests there has been a “breakdown of the working relationship…making it unreasonably difficult to carry out the employment effectively.” (See Forms MC-052, ¶ 2.)There are no oppositions to the motions. “Good cause” has been adequately demonstrated by Counsel.  In addition, there is no obvious prejudice to Defendants if counsel is relieved at this time.Dated:   September 26, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
