And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Amrezi, LLC's motion for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint. The amended pleading will add Clayton Thom as a Cross-Complainant and assert two additional causes of action for Declaratory Relief and Contractual Indemnity. The court finds that the motion complies with the relevant rules and that there is no risk of undue prejudice to the opposing party. The judge also notes that the proposed causes of action may be premature and can be tested in other proceedings. Therefore, the court grants the motion for leave to amend, allowing Amrezi, LLC to file the First Amended Cross-Complaint.
