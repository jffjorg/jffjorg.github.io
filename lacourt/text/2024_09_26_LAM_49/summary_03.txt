And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion to vacate an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment filed by Rafael Naranjo, a non-party to the case. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement had brought an action against Parsons Environment & Infrastructure Group, Inc. and Bayside Engineering Construction, Inc. for a total judgment of $137,390.93. In November 2023, the plaintiff filed an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment indicating that it had accepted payment or performance in full satisfaction of the judgment. Naranjo moved to vacate the Acknowledgment, claiming that the judgment was entered in his favor and that the plaintiff had entered into the satisfaction without his consent. The judge ruled that Naranjo is not a judgment creditor or assignee and has no standing to vacate the Acknowledgment. The Division is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
