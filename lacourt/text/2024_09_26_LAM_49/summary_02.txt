And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motions to be relieved as counsel for defendants Michael Vizcarrondo and Evimeria El Aztecano, Inc. are granted. The motions were unopposed and the court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw. The judge notes that there has been a breakdown in the working relationship between counsel and the clients, making it unreasonably difficult for counsel to carry out their employment effectively. The court orders counsel to give notice of this ruling to all interested parties and to submit a new order indicating the next hearing date and time. If the defendant does not have a new attorney of record by the next hearing date, its answer may be struck.
