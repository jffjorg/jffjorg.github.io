And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by Judge Maurice A. Leiter in the case of Cheryl Neff vs. Procare Hospice LLC (Case No. 22STCV34514) grants the plaintiff's motion to quash a subpoena for employment records. The subpoena, requested by the defendant, sought a wide range of employment records from the plaintiff's current employer. The plaintiff argued that the subpoena was overbroad and infringed on her right to privacy, and that she had already produced her personnel file and pay information, making the subpoena largely moot. The court agreed, finding that there was no indication that the plaintiff had withheld any information or documents, and granted the motion to quash the subpoena.
