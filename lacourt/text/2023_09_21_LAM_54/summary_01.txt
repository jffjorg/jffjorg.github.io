The defendant served the RFAs on May 19, 2023, and the responding party failed to respond by the deadline of June 19, 2023. As a result, the defendant's RFAs are conclusively established against the plaintiff. The judge notes that if a party fails to respond to a request for admission, they waive any objection to the requests, and the requesting party may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted. The defendant is ordered to notify the parties.

## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant Skid Row Housing Trust. The motion asks the court to deem certain Requests for Admission (RFAs) served by Defendant as conclusively established against Plaintiff Juan Aispuro.  

The judge rules in favor of Defendant because Plaintiff failed to respond to the RFAs within the required time frame.  California law states that a party who fails to respond to RFAs waives any objections to them. 

The judge's ruling means that the matters contained in the RFAs are now considered admitted by Plaintiff, and Defendant can rely on them as true for purposes of the case.
