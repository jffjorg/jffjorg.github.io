And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to deem requests for admission (RFAs) admitted against the plaintiff. The defendant served the RFAs on May 19, 2023, and the responding party failed to respond by the deadline of June 19, 2023. As a result, the defendant's RFAs are conclusively established against the plaintiff. The judge notes that if a party fails to respond to a request for admission, they waive any objection to the requests, and the requesting party may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted. The defendant is ordered to notify the parties.
