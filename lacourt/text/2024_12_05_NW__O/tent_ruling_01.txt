     CASE NO.: 20VECV00455
 
 
ORDER
  GRANTING IN PART DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES  
 



I.             
INTRODUCTION
This case
arises out of a legal malpractice suit between Plaintiff Kelly Thomas
(“Plaintiff”) and Defendants Koorosh Shahokh (“Shahrokh”) and Law Offices of
Koorosh Shahrokh (collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiff retained Defendants from
April to July 2017 in connection with a personal injury she allegedly suffered
while visiting a friend at a public entity hospital. In July 2017, Plaintiff replaced
Defendants as her counsel with her current counsel, Joseph Farzam (“Farzam”).
Plaintiff filed suit against the public entity hospital on May 15, 2018. The
court in that action granted summary judgment on July 16, 2019, ruling
Plaintiff failed to adequately and timely present her claim under Gov’t Code §
915, and thus was unable to bring a tort claim against defendant public entity.
(See Thomas v. Alameda Health System Foundation, et al., (Super.
Ct. Alameda County, 2019, No. HG18905026) (“Underlying Action”).) 
On July 9,
2024, this Court granted Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court
entered judgment in favor of Defendants on August 21, 2024. 
Defendants
now move for an award of attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 2033.420.[1]

III.       
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.420 provides:
“(a) If a party fails to admit the genuineness of
any document or the truth of any matter when requested to do so under this
chapter, and if the party requesting that admission thereafter proves the
genuineness of that document or the truth of that matter, the party requesting
the admission may move the court for an order requiring the party to whom the
request was directed to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that
proof, including reasonable attorney's fees.
(b) The court shall make this order unless it finds
any of the following:
(1) An objection to the request was sustained or a
response to it was waived under Section 2033.290.
(2) The admission sought was of no substantial
importance.
(3) The party failing to make the admission had
reasonable ground to believe that that party would prevail on the matter.
(4) There was other good reason for the failure to
admit.”
Any fees awarded pursuant to this section “can be
awarded only for the period after [the losing party] denied the
requests for admission.” (Yoon v. Cam IX Trust (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th
388, 395 (emphasis added)(citing Garcia v. Hyster Co. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th
724, 736).) 
A party seeking to avail itself of the exceptions
set forth in subdivision (b) has the burden of proving such exception(s) apply
because, among other reasons, “as a practical matter, the denying party is in
the best position to explain the reasons for the denial.” (Samsky v. State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 517, 524.)
“An RFA has ‘substantial importance’ if it is ‘central
to disposition of the case.’… In evaluating whether a ‘good reason’ exists for
denying a request to admit, ‘a court may properly consider whether at the time
the denial was made the party making the denial held a reasonably entertained
good faith belief that the party would prevail on the issue at trial.’” (Doe
v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Fam. Servs. (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 675, 690 (quoting Brooks v. American Broadcasting Co. (1986)
179 Cal.App.3d 500, 509 & 511).) “Where it becomes clear from evidence
introduced by either party at trial that the party who denied for lack of
information or belief had access to the information at the time requests for
admissions were propounded, sanctions are justified because that party has a
duty to investigate.” (Bloxham v. Saldinger (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 729,
752 (cleaned up).) 
Statutory attorney fees are ordinarily determined by
the court pursuant to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” method. Under this
approach, a base amount is calculated from a compilation of time reasonably
spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney. (See,
e.g., Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 639.) The base amount is then
adjusted in light of various factors. The Supreme Court has
not mandated “a blanket ‘lodestar only’ approach; every fee-shifting statute
must be construed on its own merits.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1136.) 
Normally, a “reasonable” hourly rate is the
prevailing rate charged by attorneys of similar skill and experience in the
relevant community. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.) However, the court may consider various other factors when
determining a reasonable hourly rate—e.g., the attorney's skill and experience,
the nature of the work performed, the relevant area of expertise and the
attorney's customary billing rates. (See Flannery v. California Highway
Patrol (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 632-33.) 
The purpose of a lodestar multiplier is “primarily
to compensate the attorney for the prevailing party at a rate reflecting the
risk of nonpayment in contingency cases as a class.” (Ketchum, 24
Cal.4th at 1138.) The party seeking the fee enhancement bears the burden of
proof. (See id.) The lodestar amount may be adjusted based on various
factors specific to the case in order to fix the attorney fees at fair market
value for the services provided. (See PLCM Group, 22 Cal.4th at 1095-96;
see also Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1329.)
The factors include “‘(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,
(2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature
of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, and (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award.’” (Holguin, 229 Cal.App.4th at
1332-33 (quoting Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at 1132).) However, the multiplier
may not be imposed merely as a sanction to punish the losing party nor may the
court consider factors it already considered when arriving at the lodestar
amount. (See Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at 1139.) 
IV.        
ANALYSIS 
A.           
Defendants’ Fees and Costs Are
Granted in Part
1.       Defendants Have Met Their Initial Burden
of Proof Under Section 2033.420(a)
The Court must first examine whether Plaintiff’s
responses to Defendants’ requests for admission (“RFAs”) trigger Code of Civil
Procedure § 2033420(a). Defendants’ counsel declares Defendants served
Plaintiff with RFAs on February 25, 2021. (See Declaration of Robin Diem
filed November 4, 2024 (“Diem Decl.”), ¶ 3.) “Plaintiff’s denials to RFAs
14-15, 18-20, 23-24 are the subject of Defendants’” Motion. (Id.) The
RFAs at issue are as follows:
“RFA 14: Admit that you could have filed an
application for leave to file a late claim with the government entity
controlling San Leandro Hospital, per Government Code section 911.4. 
RFA 15: Admit that you had until November 15, 2017,
to file an application for leave to file a late claim with the government
entity controlling San Leandro Hospital, per Government Code section 911.4. 
RFA 18: Admit that Joseph Farzam, Esq., could have
filed an application on your behalf for leave to file a late claim with the
government entity controlling San Leandro Hospital, per Government Code section
911.4. 
RFA 19: Admit that Joseph Farzam, Esq., failed to
file an application on your behalf for leave to file a late claim with the
government entity controlling San Leandro Hospital, per Government Code section
911.4. 
RFA 20: Admit that, if Joseph Farzam, Esq., had
filed an application on your behalf for leave to file a late claim with the
government entity controlling San Leandro Hospital, per Government Code section
911.4, you would have had an opportunity to present your claim. 
RFA 23: Admit that you did not incur any damages as
a result of Defendant’s alleged negligence. 
RFA 24: Admit that you did not incur any damages as
a result of Defendant’s alleged breach of fiduciary duty.”
(See Diem Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. C., pp. 9-13.) 
Defendants argue the above RFAs “sought admission of
issues that were central to the litigation, as Plaintiff’s action for
malpractice against Defendants was based on the allegation that Defendants
failed to present a timely government claim against the Hospital on Plaintiff’s
behalf.” (Motion, pg. 12.) Defendants also argue Plaintiff did not have a
reasonable basis for denying the RFAs as Plaintiff knew their attorney could
and should have filed a late claim on Plaintiff’s behalf at the time Plaintiff
denied the subject RFAs. (See id. at 13.) 
In opposition, Plaintiff makes a conclusory argument
the criteria for presenting a late claim pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
911.6(c) were not met, thus any application to file a late claim would have been
made in bad faith, without stating why. (See Opposition, pp. 3-4.)
Plaintiff contends Defendants’ Motion is based on the premise that presenting a
late claim “would have led to that application being approved and Plaintiff’s
case moving forward,” when in reality no such basis exists. (Id. at 3.)
In reply, Defendants rightly argue whether or not
Plaintiff had reasonable grounds to file the late claim is “beside the point.
The fact remains Plaintiff did not file an application for late government
claim by November 15, 2017. She knew that she did not file one in 2017, and she
knew that in 2021 when she was responding to Defendants’ requests for
admission.” (Reply, pg. 3.) 
The Court agrees and finds Defendants have met their
burden of proof under Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.420(a). The Court also
finds Plaintiff has failed to meet her burden of proof that any of the
exceptions contained in § 2033.420(b) apply. 
Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to an award of reasonable
attorney’s fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.420(a).
2.       Defendants’ Counsels’ and Paralegals’
Rates are Reasonable
Having determined Defendants are entitled to fees
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.420(a), the Court next will address
the reasonableness of Defendants’ counsels’ and paralegals’ billing rates. Defendants’
lead attorney, Robin Diem (“RD”) declares she has over 24 years of experience
and bills at an hourly rate of $265. (See Diem Decl., ¶ 5.) RD declares
three other associates worked on this case, Tsolik Kazandjian (“TRK”), Milan
Foston (“MF”), and Chassen Palmer (“CBP”), all billing at a rate of $250/hr. (See
id.) RD also declares two paralegals worked on this case, Luis Magallanes (“LM”)
and Myshanda Upton (“MU”), both billing at a rate of $125/hr. (See id.) 
The Court finds all of Defendants’ counsels’ and
paralegals’ billing rates reasonable given the prevailing rates for attorneys
and paralegals in the Greater Los Angeles Area practicing in the subject area
of legal malpractice with their experience. 
3.       Not
All of Defendants’ Counsels’ Hours are Reasonable
Defendants request an award of $71,909 in fees,
accounting for 288.7 hours of legal work. (See Diem Decl., ¶ 4.) The
Court finds all of Defendants’ paralegals’ requested hours reasonable, but not
all of Defendants’ counsels’ requested hours reasonable. The Court finds some
of Defendants’ counsels’ requested hours to be duplicative, unnecessary, or
excessive, given the number of attorneys who worked on this case and their
collective experience. The Court has reduced Defendants’ counsels’ hours
accordingly, as set forth below.
