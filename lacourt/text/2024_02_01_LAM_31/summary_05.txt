Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to stay the action pending the outcome of the related underlying appeal. The case involves a legal malpractice action brought by Plaintiff William Smith against Defendants Thomas Maclean, Jr., and Maclean Chung Law Firm. The Defendants argue that if the Court of Appeal reverses the probate court's order granting summary judgment, the legal malpractice action would be rendered unnecessary. The Judge finds that a stay of proceedings is the most proper and expedient use of resources, and that Plaintiff's arguments regarding delay are unsubstantiated and speculative. The Judge sets a Status Conference re: Appeal for April 12, 2024, and grants the motion to stay.
