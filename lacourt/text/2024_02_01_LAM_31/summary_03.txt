And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Cultivare Group LLC v. 640 South Lake Ownerâ€™s Association, et al. (Case No. 22STCV30065). The case concerns the purchase of a condominium unit for repair and profit, but the defendants breached their fiduciary duty and CC&Rs by failing to timely process the plaintiff's application for renovations and approving the installation of flooring. The plaintiff installed the flooring without approval and was sued by the owner of the adjoining unit. The delay also caused the plaintiff to lose a prospective purchaser and receive a lower purchase price.

Defendant South Lake served a deposition subpoena on nonparty Cardinal Real Estate, Inc. (CRE), seeking production of business records. CRE failed to respond or file opposition to the motion, and the Judge has granted the motion to compel CRE's compliance with the subpoena. The Judge also imposed sanctions on CRE in the sum of $761.65, consisting of two hours of defense counsel's hourly rate and $61.65 in filing fees. The Judge ordered CRE to provide the requested documents within 15 days and to pay the sanctions within 30 days.
