And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Plaintiffs Anthony Aldave and Teresa Aldave for leave to amend their complaint to add additional defendants and supplement the allegations. The Plaintiffs recently discovered new information about the project and have been conducting an investigation to determine the origin of the fourth landslide. The judge has determined that the newly-added defendants will not be prejudiced by the amended complaint and that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that there was no unreasonable delay in requesting to amend/supplement the complaint. The Court has ordered Plaintiffs to file and serve the proposed amended/supplemental complaint on or before July 22, 2024, and to file the proofs of service.
