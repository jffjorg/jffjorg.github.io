And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the issue of justiciability. The concept of justiciability involves the criteria of ripeness and standing. Standing requires that a party have an actual and substantial interest in the outcome of the case, and that they present their arguments with vigor and intensity. Ripeness, on the other hand, refers to the requirement that there be a current controversy between the parties. The Judge notes that an action not founded on an actual controversy between the parties, and brought solely for the purpose of securing a determination of a point of law, will not be entertained. Instead, the controversy must reach the point where the facts have sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision to be made. The Judge cites City of Santa Monica v. Stewart (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 43, 59 in support of this ruling.
