MOTION


Withdraw Answer




MOVING PARTY


Defendant Chanda Zaveri aka Chanda C. Bhuwalka




OPPOSING PARTY


Plaintiff California Lawyers Group, LLP



 
 
Robert Schachter of Hitchcock, Bowan & Schachter (“Counsel”), former
counsel for Defendant Chanda Zaveri aka Chanda C. Bhuwalka (“Defendant”) moves
to withdraw the answer Counsel filed on behalf of Defendant.  Counsel contends that due to a
miscommunication between Counsel and Defendant, Counsel did not have
Defendant’s authorization to represent Defendant or file the Answer on
Defendant’s behalf.
 
Plaintiff California Lawyers Group, LLP (“Plaintiff”) opposes the
motion on the grounds that the factual recitations in Counsel’s declaration
demonstrate that Counsel did have the Defendant’s authority to represent
Defendant and file the Answer on Defendant’s behalf.  Therefore, Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s
remedies are limited to amending the answer and seeking a substitution of
attorney.
 
Here, the Court finds that a substitution of attorney was filed on May
30, 2024, substituting the Law Office of Joseph Bakhos as counsel for
Defendant.  
 
Consequently, the Court determines that Counsel’s representation of
Defendant has been discharged and therefore Counsel lacks standing to prosecute
the instant motion.  (See 1 Witkin, Cal.
Proc. (6th ed. 2021) Attorneys, § 76, p. 112 [“The representation by an
attorney in pending litigation may terminate by operation of law, withdrawal,
or discharge”]; see also In re Marriage of Read (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
476, 480 [the attorney-client relationship terminated upon the discharge of the
attorneys “for all purposes except the winding-up of the relationship”],
emphasis added.) [1]  On that basis, the Court denies Counsel’s
motion as procedurally defective. 
 
The Clerk of the Court shall provide notice of the Court’s
ruling.
