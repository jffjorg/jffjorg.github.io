And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Aziz Rasooli's motion to continue the trial date in this medical malpractice suit. The motion is unopposed, and Plaintiff Rosalina Ruiz has stipulated to the continuance. The Judge finds that Defendant has demonstrated good cause to continue the trial due to the ongoing underlying trip and fall case, which was continued to December 2024. However, the Judge is unable to accommodate a 60-day continuance and instead sets a Trial Readiness Conference for January 16, 2025. The parties are directed to file a Joint Trial Readiness Conference Report and meet and confer to complete all non-expert discovery and prepare for expert discovery.
