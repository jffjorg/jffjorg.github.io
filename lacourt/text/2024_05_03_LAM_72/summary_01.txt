English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the motions in limine filed by the defendant, Global Win Capital Corporation, and the plaintiff, Jeffrey Qiuhong Yang. The court denies most of the defendant's motions, including those seeking to exclude testimony, evidence, and argument concerning the plaintiff's subjective opinions. The court also denies the plaintiff's motion to exclude evidence and arguments relating to the court's previous ruling and the plaintiff's whistleblower allegations. The court grants the defendant's motion in part to exclude irrelevant, inadmissible, and highly prejudicial character evidence. The court will deal with objections to the evidence on a case-by-case basis and expects all parties to comply with California law and evidentiary rules. The court also issues a warning to all parties not to seek testimony from witnesses as to matters about which the witness lacks foundation.
