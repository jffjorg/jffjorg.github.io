The judge has granted the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories filed by Big Bus Tours Los Angeles, Inc. (BBTLA) against Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (Starline). The motion seeks to compel Starline to provide further responses to certain special interrogatories (SROGs) that were previously filed by BBTLA. The judge found that Starline's responses to the SROGs were evasive and failed to provide adequate answers to the questions. The judge ordered Starline to provide further responses to the SROGs at issue within 10 days of the issuance of this order.
