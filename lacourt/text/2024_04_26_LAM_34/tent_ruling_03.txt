 Case Number:  23STCV18039    Hearing Date:   April 26, 2024    Dept:  34 SUBJECT:        Motion to Compel Further Responses,  Without Objections, to Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Request for Order  Awarding Monetary Sanctions Against Defendant and His Counsel Herein   Moving Party: Plaintiff  Edwin Haratonians Resp. Party:    Defendant Maurice Maalouf            The Further SROGs Motion is GRANTED.           Defendant shall provide  further responses to the SROGs at issue within 14 days of the issuance of this  Order.            Plaintiff’s Request for  Sanctions is GRANTED in part. Monetary sanctions are AWARDED in favor of  Plaintiff and against Defendant and Defense Counsel, jointly and severally, in  the total amount of $2,1600.00.   BACKGROUND:   On August 1, 2023, Plaintiffs Edwin Haratonians and  Wellness Care Residence, LLC filed their Complaint against Maurice Maalouf on  the following causes of action: (1) declaratory relief; (2) breach of fiduciary  duty (two counts); (3) accounting; and (4) dissociation of member.    On September 26, 2023, Defendant filed his Answer to the  Complaint.    On October 11, 2023, the Court found related cases  23STCV12206 and 23STCV18039, and designated 23STCV12206 as the lead case.    On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff Edwin Haratonians  (“Plaintiff”) filed his Motion to Compel Further Responses, Without Objections,  to Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Request for Order Awarding Monetary  Sanctions Against Defendant and His Counsel Herein (“Further SROGs Motion”). In  support of his Further SROGs Motion, Plaintiff concurrently filed: (1) Separate  Statement; and (2) Exhibits to Declaration of Burton Mark Senkfor.    On April 15, 2024, Defendant filed his Opposition to the  Further SROGs Motion.    On April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Reply in support  of the Further SROGs Motion.     ANALYSIS:   I.           Legal  Standard   On receipt of a response  to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and/or demand requests, the  propounding and/or demanding party “may move for an order compelling further  response” if: (1) the response is evasive or incomplete; (2) the representation  of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) the  objection is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd.  (a), 2031.310, subd. (a).)   The court shall  impose monetary sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully  makes or opposes a motion to compel further interrogatories and/or a motion to  compel further production of documents, unless the Court finds that the one  subject to sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§  2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h).)   II.        Discussion   A.      The  Parties’ Arguments   Plaintiff moves the Court to compel further  responses to: (1) certain special interrogatories (“SROGs”); and (2) award  monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant and Defense  Counsel. (Further SROGs Motion, p. 8:8–9.)   Defendant opposes the Further SROGs Motion,  arguing: (1) that Plaintiff had a late meet and confer; (2) that Plaintiff has  not met the good faith element for granting this motion; (3) that the motion is  defective; (4) that the objections are well-taken; and (5) that Defendant has  substantially responded to all subject interrogatories. (Opposition, pp.  3:23–25, 5:20, 6:1–4.)   Plaintiff focuses most of his Reply on the  meet and confer. (Reply, pp. 5–9.)   B.      The  Meet and Confer   1.      Legal  Standard   “On receipt of a  response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order  compelling a further response . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.  (a).)   “A motion under  subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under  Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).)   “A meet and  confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a  reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue  presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., 2016.040.)   2.      Discussion   Here, Plaintiff’s Counsel declared that they  “personally verbally ‘met and conferred’ with [Defense Counsel] during a break  in Haratonians all-day, in person deposition on March 29, 2024, regarding the  insufficient Maalouf discovery responses.” (Further SROGs Motion, Decl. Senkfor,  ¶ 2.)    The meet and confer standard has been met  here.    Furthermore, the Court has not been presented  with any reason for why (much less evidence that would indicate that) Plaintiff  and/or Plaintiff’s Counsel are acting in bad faith by bringing the Further  SROGs Motion.    C.      The  SROGs at Issue   The following are the SROGs at issue:   Special Interrogatory No. 1:

limited to construction and maintenance) at the WELLNESS PROPERTY.   The SROGs request information that is  relevant to this matter and are sufficiently narrow in scope.    D.      Further  Responses to the SROGs   Defendant’s responses to the SROGs have been  evasive.   The initial responses were boilerplate  objections, which the Court finds to be unmeritorious.     The subsequent responses also consist mostly  of boilerplate objections, which the Court does not find to be meritorious.  Specifically, objections that point to spreadsheets and other sources but then  tell Plaintiff to find the information himself are not sufficient answers to  the SROGs. Rather, those are evasive responses that do not actually answer the  SROGs. Defendant must answer the SROGs himself, even if Plaintiff has access to  the same information.    The Court GRANTS the Further SROGs Motion.    E.      Sanctions   Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the  amount of $5,310.00 against Defendant and Defense Counsel. (Further SROGs  Motion, p. 8:1–4.)   The Court does not have evidence before it  that would indicate there is substantial justification or other circumstances  that would make the imposition of a sanction unjust. Thus, the Court must  impose a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd.  (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)   Plaintiff’s Counsel declares: (1) that they charge  $525.00 per hour in this matter; (2) that they worked ten hours on the motion  and (3) that they incurred $60.00 in filing costs for the motion. (Further  SROGs Motion, Decl. Senkfor, ¶ 3.)           The hourly rate and costs  claimed are reasonable, but the number of hours claimed is not. The Court  AWARDS four hours of work at the requested hourly rate, plus all of the  requested costs.    III.     Conclusion   The Further SROGs Motion is GRANTED.           Defendant shall provide  further responses to the SROGs at issue within 14 days of the issuance of this  Order.            Plaintiff’s Request for  Sanctions is GRANTED in part. Monetary sanctions are AWARDED in favor of  Plaintiff and against Defendant and Defense Counsel, jointly and severally, in  the total amount of $2,160.00.
