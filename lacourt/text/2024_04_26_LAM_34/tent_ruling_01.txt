ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Motion
for Attorney’s Fees
 
A. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(b).)
 
Attorneys’ fees are allowed as costs
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10)(B).)
 
B. 
    Discussion
 
1. 
    The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to award $480,606.00 in attorney’s fees,
which would consist of:
 
(1)      
$334,918.00
in merits lodestar attorney’s fees;
 
(2)      
$8,372.00
in post-trial lodestar attorney’s fees; and
 
(3)      
a
multiplier of 1.4 on the total lodestar. 
 
(Reply re: Motion
for Attorney’s Fees, p. 14:2–8.)
 
        Plaintiff argues: (1) that they are
entitled to attorney’s fees under FEHA; (2) that attorney’s fees should be
calculated using the lodestar method; and (3) that a multiplier is appropriate
(and that specifically a multiplier of 1.4 is appropriate, for a variety of
factors). (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, pp. 6:6–7, 7:7–8, 11:24, 12:20, 15:16–17,
17:21, 18:8.)
 
        Defendant requests that the Court deny
the Motion for Attorney’s Fees, or in the alternative: (1) reduce lodestar fees
by $80,781.00; and (2) deny any multiplier. (Opposition to Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, pp. 10:28–11:23.) Defendant agrees that the fee requests should
be judged under the lodestar method but argues: (1) that Plaintiff’s Counsel’s
hourly rates are unsupported and should be reduced; (2) that Plaintiff’s
requested hours are unreasonable; and (3) that Plaintiff’s lodestar multiplier
request is improper and unreasonable. (Id. at pp. 3:2, 4:1, 4:27, 9:16.)
 
        Plaintiff reiterates his arguments in
his Reply. 
 
2. 
    Authority
for Fees & Prevailing Party 
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“It is an unlawful employment practice . . . [f]or an employer,
because of the race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry,
physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information,
marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual
orientation, or veteran or military status of any person, to refuse to hire or
employ the person or to refuse to select the person for a training program
leading to employment, or to bar or to discharge the person from employment or
from a training program leading to employment, or to discriminate against the
person in compensation or in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.”
(Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (a).)
 
“In civil actions
brought under this section, the court, in its discretion, may award to the
prevailing party, including the department, reasonable attorney’s fees and
costs, including expert witness fees, except that, notwithstanding Section 998
of the Code of Civil Procedure, a prevailing defendant shall not be awarded
fees and costs unless the court finds the action was frivolous, unreasonable,
or groundless when brought, or the plaintiff continued to litigate after it
clearly became so.” (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd. (c)(6).) 
 
The relevant section of FEHA “grants the trial court discretion to
award attorney fees to a prevailing party.” (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010)
47 Cal.4th 970, 976.) “This statute has been interpreted to mean that in a FEHA
action a trial court should ordinarily award attorney fees to a prevailing
plaintiff unless special circumstances would render a fee award unjust. (Ibid.)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
Attorneys’ fees pursuant to FEHA are applicable here. Defendant does
not dispute this. 
 
Plaintiff is indisputably the prevailing party here. The Jury found in
favor of him and against Defendant on the Plaintiff’s only cause of action. 
 
        The Court exercises its discretion here
to award Plaintiffs attorneys’ fees. (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd. (c)(6).)
 
3. 
    Method
of Calculation
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“An attorney fee
award under the FEHA is designed to incentivize and reward a plaintiff's
attorney in a civil rights case. Trial courts first determine a lodestar
amount: the hours spent times a reasonable hourly rate. Courts may then
increase the amount, usually by applying a multiplier to the lodestar. The
multiplier is to compensate for extrinsic factors such as the risk of
nonpayment (the contingency factor), the public interest advanced by the case,
the difficulty of the issues involved, and the skill of the attorneys.” (Caldera
v. Dep’t of Corr. & Rehab. (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 601, 604, citing Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1135.)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
The Parties agree that the lodestar adjustment method is appropriate
here, although Defendant argues that a multiplier is not appropriate here. 
 
The Court uses
the lodestar adjustment method here and considers whether a multiplier is
appropriate.  
 
4. 
    Reasonableness
of the Attorneys’ Fees Claimed
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“Under the lodestar adjustment
methodology, the trial court must initially determine the actual time expended
and then ascertain whether under all the circumstances¿of the case the amount
of actual time expended and
the monetary charge being made for the time expended are reasonable. Factors to
be considered include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the case and
procedural demands, the attorney skill exhibited and the results achieved. The
prevailing party and fee applicant bears the burden of showing that the fees
incurred were reasonably necessary to¿the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount. It
follows that if the prevailing party fails to meet this burden, and the court
finds the time expended or amount charged is not reasonable under the
circumstances, then the court must take this into account and award attorney
fees in a lesser amount.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am., LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240, 247 [cleaned up].)
 
b.  
    Reasonableness
of the Hourly Rates
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel claim the following hourly rates:
 
(1)      
$1,000.00
per hour for Counsel Gregory W. Smith;
 
(2)      
$700.00
per hour for Counsel Kelley Bond;
 
(3)      
$700.00
per hour for Counsel Diana Wang Wells; and
 
(4)      
$650.00
per hour for Counsel Leila Al Faiz.
 
(Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, p. 11:10–16.)
 
        The Court has considered the
declarations of each member of Plaintiff’s Counsel. The Court determines that
the hourly rates requested are all reasonable. 
 
c.  
    Reasonableness
of the Number of Hours
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel claim that 425.06 hours of work were incurred on
the merits of this matter, which is comprised of:
 
(1)      
139.6
hours by Counsel Gregory W. Smith;
 
(2)      
151.8
hours by Counsel Kelley Bond; 
 
(3)      
43.58
hours by Counsel Diana Wang Wells; and
 
(4)      
90.08
hours by Counsel Leila Al Faiz.
 
(Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, p. 11:10–16.)
 
        (The hours spent on the fee motion will
be discussed separately infra.)
 
        The Court considered the same
declarations as for the hourly rates. The Court also considered the various
invoices submitted in connection with these declarations. The Court further
considered what has occurred in this litigation. 
 
        During the first year of this matter
(approximately September 2021 through November 2022), the main issue was
discovery and the litigation of a Pitchess motion. During the second
year of this matter (2023), little occurred that involved the Court.
 
        From January 23 to 29, 2024, the Court
held a jury trial in this matter. The Jury found in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendant on the sole cause of action for discrimination. The Jury
found $700,000.00 in damages. The Court then denied Defendant’s motions for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict and for new trial. 
 
(Although Plaintiff’s Counsel requests a separate post-trial lodestar
that will be considered infra, the Court considered these post-judgment
motions here because the separate post-trial lodestar is only for work done
after April 2, 2024 [i.e., after the Court ruled on the motions for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict and for new trial].)
 
        Based on all these considerations, it
appears to the Court that 425.06 hours is a reasonable amount of time to have
spent on this matter. 
 
        Although this issue was
not raised in Defendant’s opposition, the Court questions the calculation of hours
billed for attorneys Wells and Al Faiz.  Wells
stated that she incurred 43.58 hours; Al Faiz stated that she incurred 90.08
hours.  The Court understands billing in tenths
of an hour (i.e., 6-minute increments).  However, billing in hundredths of an hour
means billing in 36-second increments. The Court simply does not understand how
an attorney can account for her time so accurately.  However, as this issue was not raised by
Defendants, the Court will not consider it in its award of a lodestar.  (See, e.g., (Lunada Biomedical v.
Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)
 
        The Court therefore awards Plaintiff’s
Counsel its requested merits lodestar of $334,918.00. 
 
d.  
    Lodestar
for the Motion for Attorney’s Fees
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel requests an additional $8,372.00 for the work done
since April 2, 2024 (i.e., the lodestar for the Motion for Attorney’s Fees) —
as well as a 1.4 multiplier on that amount. (Reply re: Motion for Attorney’s
Fees, p. 14:2–8.)
 
        This is an unreasonable amount of money
to request for a relatively simple copy-and-paste motion that Defendant opposed
with a copy-and-paste opposition. There was no special skill required for this
fee motion. Although the Court understands the importance of an attorney’s fees
motion for an attorney working on a FEHA case, an associate could have written this
motion.
 
        The Court will allow $5,000.00 in total
fees for the work incurred on the Motion for Attorney’s Fees. The Court does
not award a multiplier on this separate lodestar because the motion itself was
not taken on a contingent basis; i.e., by the time the attorney’s fees motion
was written, Plaintiff already won his trial and attorney’s fees were an
all-but-certain outcome. (The multiplier enhancement on the merits lodestar
will be discussed infra.)
 
5. 
    Multiplier
to the Merits Lodestar
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“The purpose of the multiplier is to reward the prevailing
attorney with an increased fee in light of the extrinsic Ketchum factors: the importance and difficulty of the litigation;
the novelty of the issues involved; the risk of nonpayment for the attorney's
services (the contingency factor); the skill of the attorney in presenting the
case; and the magnitude of the results obtained.” (Caldera, supra,
48 Cal.App.5th at p. 607, citing Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at
pp. 1132–1134.)
 
“Of course, the
trial court is not required to
include a fee enhancement to the basic lodestar figure for contingent risk,
exceptional skill, or other factors, although it retains discretion to do so in
the appropriate case; moreover, the party seeking a fee enhancement bears the
burden of proof.” (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1138, emphasis
omitted.)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel requests a multiplier enhancement of 1.4. (Reply
re: Motion for Attorney’s Fees, p. 13:2.)
 
        Defendant argues that no multiplier
should be awarded because (1) the hourly rates were already double or triple a
reasonable rate; (2) these issues were not novel or complicated; and (3)
COVID-19 did not have any effect on this case. (Opposition to Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, pp. 9:28–10:26.)
 
        The Court finds that a multiplier is
appropriate in this case.
 
i.           
Time
Delay of Litigation
 
“The adjustment to the lodestar figure, e.g., to provide a
fee enhancement reflecting the risk that the attorney will not receive payment
if the suit does not succeed, constitutes earned compensation; unlike a
windfall, it is neither unexpected nor fortuitous. Rather, it is intended to
approximate market-level compensation for such services, which typically
includes a premium for the risk of nonpayment or delay in payment of attorney
fees.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138; accord Amaral
v. Cintas Corp. No. 2 (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1157, 1217–1218 and Taylor
v. Nabors Drilling USA, LP (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1252.)
 
In contrast to
Defense Counsel, who presumably gets paid monthly, Plaintiff’s Counsel have not
been paid for the more than two years that this action has been pending. 
 
        FEHA
cases are based on statutes that are designed to protect against
discrimination, and there is a significant chance that FEHA plaintiffs will not
win their cases. If a plaintiff’s attorney is paid no
more than the lodestar for a FEHA case, “competent counsel will be reluctant to
accept fee award cases.” (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1133,
cleaned up.)
 
The normal interest rate in California is 10%, which is the
equivalent of a 1.10 multiplier. However, not all of an attorney’s work occurs
at the beginning of any given year; therefore, giving a multiplier of 1.1 for
each year of work would overcompensate Plaintiff’s Counsel. For ease of calculation,
the Court assumes that the work was performed more-or-less evenly throughout
the course of any given year. This means a 1.05 multiplier per year is
appropriate to compensate Plaintiff’s Counsel for the time-value of the money
that they would have been paid monthly had the case not been contingent. 
 
        Plaintiff’s
Counsel litigated this case from September 2021 to April 2024 without payment.
In consideration of this delay and that the statutes under which Plaintiff sued
were designed to protect the consumer, the Court awards a 1.15 multiplier to
the merits lodestar. This multiplier compensates Plaintiff’s Counsel for the
time value of the money they would have been paid monthly had the case not been
contingent. 
 
ii.         
Substantive Factors
 
This case involved military-status discrimination by the Los Angeles
Police Department against one of its officers. Specifically, Plaintiff
submitted evidence to the Jury for the proposition that Plaintiff was
differentially treated and demoted based on his concurrent military status. The
Jury considered this evidence and found in favor of Plaintiff. 
 
The importance of deterring military-status discrimination by the Los
Angeles Police Department cannot be overstated. While it might be surprising,
it is not a novel claim. But it did require — and had — highly-skilled
attorneys representing Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel exhibited a high degree of skill throughout the
litigation. Plaintiff’s Counsel did well in obtaining evidence during
discovery, which can be particularly difficult considering the privileges of
the City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Police Department. Plaintiff’s
Counsel also did an excellent job in presenting their case to the Jury,
prevailing on the sole cause of action tried. Plaintiff’s Counsel also
prevailed on the post-judgment motions. 
 
After taking all of this into account, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s
Counsel should be awarded a 1.25 multiplier based on the difficulty of the case
and the importance of FEHA cases.
 
Thus, the Court will award the requested 1.4 multiplier. 
 
C.

The Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in part. Attorneys’ fees are

II.      
Motion
to Tax Costs
 
A. 
    Legal
Standard
 
“Except as otherwise expressly
provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(b).)
 
Prevailing
parties seeking to claim costs must comply with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(a), and parties seeking to contest costs must comply with California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b). 
 
The Court separately considers each category of contested costs,
including: (1) whether they are specifically allowable or specifically
prohibited; (2) whether they were incurred (irrespective of whether or not
paid); (3) whether they were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation; and
(4) whether they are reasonable in amount. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1033.5, subds.
(a), (b), and (c)(1)–(3).
 
“Items not mentioned in this section and items assessed upon
application may be allowed or denied in the court’s discretion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(4); see also Foothill-De Anza Cmty. Coll.
Dist. v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 30.)
 
B. 
    Discussion
 
1. 
    The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Plaintiff claims $26,495.97 in costs, which
are comprised of:
 
(1)      
$812.81
in filing and motion fees;
 
(2)      
$1,047.34
in jury fees;
 
(3)      
$11,652.13
in deposition costs;
 
(4)      
$473.25
in service costs;
 
(5)      
$550.00
in witness fees;
 
(6)      
$950.00
in court reporter fees;
 
(7)      
$2,917.70
in models, enlargements, and photocopies;
 
(8)      
$567.69
in electronic filing or service fees; and 
 
(9)      
$7,525.05
in “other” costs.
 
(MC-010, p. 1.)
 
        Defendant moves the Court to tax
$11,392.75 in costs, which would comprise of: 
 
(1)      
$950.00
in court reporter fees; 
 
(2)      
nearly
$3,000.00 in models, enlargements, and photocopies; 
 
(3)      
$322.14
for medical records obtained during litigation;
 
(4)      
$847.32
for Internal Affairs investigation transcriptions;  
 
(5)      
$138.28
in FedEx charges for delivery of a trial binder;  
 
(6)      
$1,587.50
for equipment and trial technician; 
 
(7)      
$1,739.81
for trial transcripts; and
 
(8)      
$2,890.00
for consultant costs.
 
(Motion to Tax
Costs, pp. 3:4, 3:19, 4:10, 5:4, 5:14, 6:5, 6:14, 6:20.)
 
        Plaintiff withdraws the request for
$2,890.00 in consultant costs and is open to withdrawing the request for
$1,739.81 in trial transcript costs. (Opposition to Motion to Tax Costs, p.
6:3–6.) Plaintiff opposes the other portions of the motion. (Id. at pp.
3:16, 3:24, 4:15, 4:24, 5:6–7, 5:15.)
 
2. 
    Court
Reporter Fees
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“Court reporter fees as established by statute” are allowable as costs.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(11).) 
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
The Court did not order court reporting.
 
        Plaintiff points to People
v. Mooc (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216 for the proposition that court reporter fees
for a Pitchess motion are specifically recoverable. 
 
        The Court has not been
presented with sufficient authority for this proposition. 
 
        First, Mooc is
inapposite. Mooc (and Pitchess) involved criminal matters. It is
not immediately clear based on the Parties’ filings that a Pitchess motion
in a civil matter would require recording by a court reporter, much less
require that such costs be borne by the losing party. Furthermore, neither Mooc
nor Pitchess involved any discussion of who bore the cost of such
court recording — again, this was likely because they are inapposite, criminal
cases. 
 
        Second, Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(11) states that “Court reporter fees
as established by statute” are allowable as costs. (Emphasis added.) The
relevant section of the Code does not state that the judiciary — even the
California Supreme Court — can establish new avenues for court reporter fees by
common law. 
 
        To the extent the Court
does have the discretion to award these costs here, the Court declines to
exercise it. 
 
        The Court TAXES the
$950.00 in court reporter fees. 
 
 
3. 
    Models,
Enlargements, and Photocopies
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
        “Postage, telephone, and photocopying
charges, except for exhibits” are specifically not allowable as costs, except
when expressly authorized by law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(3).)
 
“Models, the enlargements of exhibits and photocopies of exhibits, and the
electronic presentation of exhibits, including costs of rental equipment and
electronic formatting, may be allowed if they were reasonably helpful to aid
the trier of fact.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(13).
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
        Here, many exhibits were admitted at
trial, and Plaintiff’s Counsel chose to use multiple trial exhibits, trial
boards, and so on. These various items, including the trial exhibit binders,
reasonably aided the Jury. 
 
The Court allows all of the costs claimed for models, enlargements, and
photocopies. 
 
4. 
    Records
Obtained During Investigation
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
        “The following items are not allowable
as costs, except when expressly authorized by law: . . . (2) Investigation
expenses in preparing the case for trial.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(b)(2).)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff admits that the costs associated with the medical
records and Internal Affairs interviews came from discovery (in other words,
investigation) in preparation for trial. (Opposition to Motion to Tax Costs,
pp. 4:15–5:5.) 
 
These items are specifically prohibited from recovery as costs. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (b)(2).)
 
        The Court TAXES the $322.14 in medical
records and $847.32 for Internal Affairs investigation transcriptions.  
 
5. 
    Delivery
Charges
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“An award of costs shall be subject to the following: . . . Allowable
costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather
than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (c)(2).)
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel claims $138.28 in delivery charges because he is 70
years old and preferred to work with hard copies as he prepared for trial.
(Plaintiff’s Opposition to Motion to Tax Costs, p. 5:6–14.)
 
However, without evidence of a disability or something more than just a
benefit to Counsel’s ability to prepare the case, the Court is unable to find
that this cost was reasonably necessary here. 
 
The Court TAXES the $138.28 in delivery charges.
 
6. 
    Equipment
Charges and Trial Technician
 
The equipment charges and trial technician costs are neither
specifically allowed or prohibited. Thus, they are within the discretion of the
Court. 
 
        Having considered the contingencies
Plaintiff’s Counsel was accounting for, the Court considers these costs as
having been reasonably incurred for the conduct of the trial. The Court allows
them. 
 
7. 
    Trial
Transcripts
 
a.  
    Legal
Standard
 
“Transcripts of court proceedings ordered by the court” are
specifically allowable costs, while “[t]ranscripts of court proceedings not
ordered by the court” are specifically prohibited, except where expressly
authorized by law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subds. (a)(9), (b)(5). 
 
b.  
    Discussion
 
The Court did not order any transcripts, and Plaintiff has not pointed
to any law that specifically authorizes the recovery of these costs in absence
of the Court ordering the transcripts. Thus, the transcript costs are not
recoverable. 
 
The Court TAXES the $1,739.81 in trial transcript costs. 
 
8. 
    Consultant
Costs
 
Plaintiff withdraws his request for the
consultant costs. 
 
The Court TAXES the $2,890.00 in consultant
costs. 
 
C. 
    Conclusion
 
The Motion to Tax is GRANTED in part. Plaintiff’s costs are TAXED by
$6,887.55. Costs are AWARDED in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
total amount of $19,608.42, as indicated in the spreadsheet below:
