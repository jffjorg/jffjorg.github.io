Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The defendants, Prism Hospitality, Inc. and Maanbir Punia, claimed they never received actual notice of the lawsuit, but the judge found that they had actual notice and were properly served with the complaint and summons. The defendants also failed to demonstrate extrinsic mistake or diligence in seeking to set aside the default and default judgment. The judge noted that the defendants had over five months to file the motion and did not demonstrate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense, a meritorious defense, or diligence in seeking to set aside the default. The case will proceed to a hearing date of March 21, 2024, and the parties are advised to submit on the tentative if they wish to do so.
