And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Malibu Surf, Inc.'s (Plaintiff) motion for an order directing West Coast Escrow to release $614,460.00. The Plaintiff initially sought this relief via an ex parte application, which was denied. The court has determined that the Plaintiff's subsequent motion is essentially a motion for reconsideration, which must be denied as it does not present any new law or facts. Additionally, the court has raised concerns about the Plaintiff's standing to make this request, as it has allegedly assigned all rights to Iris Amar, who is not a party to this litigation. Furthermore, the court has determined that there remains a dispute over whether a good faith dispute existed between the buyer and seller, which precludes relief under Civil Code section 1057.3.
