MALIBU SURF, INC.  
  
        
  vs.
 
CHOI PAK, et al. 
  


 Case
  No.:  24STCV12549   
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 7, 2025




 
 
Plaintiff’s motion for an order directing
West Coast Escrow to release $614,460.00, presently held in escrow to Malibu
Surf, Inc is DENIED. 
 
            On
5/17/2024, Plaintiff Malibu Surf, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed suit against Choi and
Jeanie Pak (collectively, Defendants), alleging: (1) breach of contract.
 
            On
10/18/2024, Plaintiff moved for release of undisputed funds. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks an order directing West Coast Escrow to release $614,460, presently held
in escrow to Malibu Surf, Inc.
 
            After
review, the Court denies the motion for several reasons. 
 
            First,
Plaintiff sought this relief via an ex parte application. As made clear
in its 11/21/2024 Minute Order, the Court read and considered all moving and
opposing party papers, and denied the application. As such, Plaintiff’s motion
amounts to a motion for reconsideration. (See Powell v. County of Orange (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1573, 1577 “…regardless of the name, a motion asking the trial
court to decide the same matter previously ruled on is a motion for
reconsideration…”) Given that Plaintiff has not set forth any new law or facts
which could justify reconsideration, the motion must be denied. 
 
            Second,
Defendants’ opposition raises issues of Plaintiff’s standing to make this
request, given that Plaintiff apparently assigned all rights, title, interest,
and obligations to the Subject Property and the original Purchase Contract to
Iris Amar, who is not a party to this litigation. As such, there are disputes
as to whether or not Plaintiff is able to request the relief sought.    
 
            Third,
Plaintiff seeks relief under Civil Code section 1057.3. However, section
1057.3(c) provides that there is no cause of action under that statute if there
is a good faith dispute between the buyer and seller. Here, at the pleadings
stage, there remain triable issues as to whether or not a good faith dispute
existed here. Accordingly, relief is premature.
 
            Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for an order directing
West Coast Escrow to release $614,460, presently held in escrow to Malibu Surf,
Inc is denied. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
