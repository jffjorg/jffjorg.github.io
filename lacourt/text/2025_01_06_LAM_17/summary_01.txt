And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint, which was dismissed due to the plaintiff's failure to prosecute. The plaintiff's counsel had submitted a declaration taking responsibility for the dismissal, stating that it was due to the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. The judge found that the plaintiff's motion was accompanied by a credible attorney's sworn affidavit, as required by Civil Code section 473(b), and therefore granted the motion. The judgment is mandatory under this section.
