Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in a construction defect case. The plaintiff, Queens Land Builder, Inc., has moved for attorney's fees in the amount of $910,107.00, which the court has reduced to $455,053.50. The court finds the fees reasonable and grants the motion. The plaintiff's motion to increase the supersedeas bond is denied as moot, as the bond has already been increased.
