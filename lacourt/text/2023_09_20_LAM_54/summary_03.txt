**English Summary:**

The judge has ruled that the Estate of Shane E. Minassian must arbitrate their claims against both sets of defendants: Dariush G. Aldi and Datev Shenian, and Safarian Choi & Bolstad, LLP and David Bolstad. The judge found that both the retainer agreement and the Engagement Letter signed by Shane E. Minassian contained valid arbitration provisions, despite Plaintiff's argument that the lack of initials on those provisions meant there was no agreement to arbitrate.  This means the lawsuit will be paused (stayed) while the parties proceed with arbitration to resolve their dispute.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants, Dariush G. Aldi, Datev Shenian, Safarian Choi & Bolstad, LLP, and David Bolstad. The motion was opposed by the plaintiff, Estate of Shane E. Minassian by Executor Arthur Minassian. The judge found that the defendants had met their burden to establish an agreement to arbitrate, and the plaintiff had not established any defenses to enforcement.

The agreement to arbitrate was contained in the retainer agreement executed by Decedent on March 30, 2013, and the engagement letter executed by Plaintiff on March 29, 2016. The judge noted that the plaintiff had signed the engagement letter, which included the arbitration provision, and therefore had agreed to all terms of the agreement, including the arbitration provision.

The judge also relied on the Court of Appeal's decision in Martinez v. BaronHR, Inc. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 962, which held that an employee's failure to initial a subpart of an arbitration agreement did not show a lack of mutual assent to arbitrate.

As a result, the judge granted the motion to compel arbitration and stayed the action. The defendants are ordered to notice the plaintiff and other parties of the stay and the arbitration proceedings.
