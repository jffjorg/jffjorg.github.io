And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to compel arbitration brought by the Bolstad Defendants and has determined that the motion is GRANTED. The court has also reviewed the motion to compel arbitration brought by the Aldi Defendants and has determined that the motion is GRANTED. In both cases, the court finds that the parties have entered into enforceable arbitration agreements and that the disputes should be resolved through arbitration rather than through the courts. The court has stayed the court action and has ordered the defendants to provide notice to the plaintiff. The parties have the opportunity to submit on the tentative ruling by email before the hearing on September 20, 2023.
