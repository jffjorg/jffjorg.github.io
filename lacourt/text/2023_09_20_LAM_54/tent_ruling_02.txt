DEFENDANTS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please email the
courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers
and opposition.
 
Plaintiff moves to “continue”
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration of the Court’s July 10, 2023 order
granting Defendants’ motion for terminating sanctions. The Court previously
advanced Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration from October 2023 to August 16,
2023 via Plaintiff’s ex parte request. Plaintiff did not file moving papers in
accordance with the advanced hearing date and the motion was not heard.
 
Plaintiff now represents that her
father was terminally ill and Plaintiff was not able to timely file her motion
for reconsideration. Plaintiff does not provide authority for this motion nor
does Plaintiff provide a date for continuance. The Court will not “continue”
the motion. The Court notes, however, that Plaintiff may challenge the judgment
via a motion to set aside judgment if she believes the motion for terminating
sanctions was decided in error.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED.
