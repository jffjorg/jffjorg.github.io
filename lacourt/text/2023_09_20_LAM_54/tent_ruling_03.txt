BACKGROUND
 
On April 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative first amended complaint against Defendants Dariush G. Aldi, Datev
Shenian, Safarian Choi & Bolstad, LLP, and David Bolstad, asserting causes
of action for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. Plaintiff
alleges Defendants committed legal malpractice, resulting in a
multi-million-dollar judgment against Plaintiff.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate a
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists….”  (CCP §
1281.2.)  The right to compel arbitration
exists unless the court finds that the right has been waived by a party’s
conduct, other grounds exist for revocation of the agreement, or where a
pending court action arising out of the same transaction creates the
possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.   (CCP § 1281.2(a)-(c).)  “The party seeking arbitration bears the
burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement, and the party
opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any defense, such as
unconscionability.”  (Pinnacle Museum
Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223,
236.) 
 
A.           Existence of
Arbitration Agreement and Applicable Law
 
Defendants Safarian Choi & Bolstad,
LLP and David Bolstad move to compel arbitration based on the arbitration
provision in the retainer agreement executed by Decedent on March 30, 2013.
(Decl. Bolstad, Exh. A.) The agreement provides,
 
By signing this engagement
letter, we agree that, in the event of any dispute or claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, our relationship, our charges, or our services
(Including but not limited to disputes or claims regarding our charges, professional
malpractice, errors or omissions, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty,
fraud, or violation of any statute or Rules of Professional Conduct), SUCH
DISPUTE OR CLAIM SHALL BE RESOLVED BY SUBMISSION TO FINAL AND BINDING
ARBITRATION IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, CALIFORNIA BEFORE A RETIRED JUDGE OR
JUSTICE. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU HA VE TO A COURT OR
JURY TRIAL (Emphasis in original.)
 
(Id.)
 
In opposition, Plaintiff does not
dispute the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. Instead, Plaintiff argues
that the claims against the Bolstad Defendants should not be arbitrated because
the claims against the Aldi Defendants cannot be arbitrated. Plaintiff asserts
there is no agreement to arbitrate against the Aldi Defendants and ordering
arbitration of the Bolstad claims could create conflicting rulings. As stated
in the Court’s tentative ruling on the Aldi Defendants’ motion to compel
arbitration, there is an enforceable agreement to arbitrate between Plaintiffs
and the Aldi Defendants.
 
Defendants have met their burden to
establish an agreement to arbitrate. Plaintiff has not established any defenses
to enforcement. Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED.

Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223,
236.) 
 
A.           Existence of
Arbitration Agreement
 
The Aldi Defendants move to compel
arbitration based on the arbitration provision in the Engagement Letter
executed by Plaintiff on March 29, 2016. (Decl. Aldi, Exh. 1.) The agreement
provides, 
 
Any dispute between the
parties regarding the construction, application or performance of any services
under this Engagement Letter, and any claim arising out of or relating to this
Engagement Letter or its breach, including, without limitation, claims for
breach of contract, professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty,
misrepresentation, fraud and disputes regarding attorney fees and/or costs
charged under this Engagement Letter (except as provided in paragraph B below)
shall be submitted to binding arbitration upon the written request of one party
after the service of that request on the other party. 
 
… 
 
By initialing below, Client
and ADLI Law confirm that they have read and understand subparagraph A above
and voluntarily agree to binding arbitration. In doing so, Client and ADLI Law
voluntarily give up important constitutional rights to trial by judge or jury,
as well as rights to appeal. Client has the right to have an independent lawyer
of Clients’ choice to review these arbitration provisions, and this entire
Engagement Letter, prior to initialing this provision or signing this
Engagement Letter.
 
(Id.)
 
In opposition, Plaintiff asserts there
is no agreement to arbitrate because neither Plaintiff nor the Aldi Defendants
initialed the arbitration provision. As shown on the engagement letter, the
space for initialing under the arbitration provision has been left blank by
both parties. (Id.) Plaintiff Arthur Minassian, who acted as GAL to Decedent at
the time of execution, declares that he deliberately did not initial the
arbitration provision because he did not consent to arbitrate. (Decl. Minassian
¶ 4.)
 
Defendants assert it is immaterial that Plaintiff did not initial the
arbitration provision. In support, Defendants rely on Martinez v. BaronHR,
Inc. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 962. In Martinez, an employee signed an
arbitration agreement provided by their employer but did not initial a subpart
agreeing to waive the right to a jury. The plaintiff employee argued that this
showed no mutual assent to arbitrate. The Court of Appeal disagreed, finding
that by signing the agreement, the plaintiff had assented to all its terms. (Id.
at 967.) The Court also noted that the plaintiff’s declaration stating they did
not initial the agreement because they did not agree to its terms should not
have been considered evidence for lack of mutual assent. (Id. at 970
[“The law is well-settled that unexpressed subjective intentions are irrelevant
to the issue of mutuality.”])
 
Here, the Engagement Letter states, “[t]he undersigned Client has read
and understood the above Engagement Letter and hereby agree to the terms
described therein.” (Decl. Aldi, Exh. 1.) Plaintiff signed the agreement below
this provision. Accordingly, Plaintiff agreed to all terms of the Engagement
Letter, including the arbitration provision.
 
Defendants have met their burden to
establish an agreement to arbitrate. Plaintiff has not established any defenses
to enforcement. Defendants’ motion is GRANTED.
