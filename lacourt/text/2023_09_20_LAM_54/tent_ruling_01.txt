BACKGROUND
 
This is a construction defect case arising
out of the construction of condominium complex and its subterranean garage. The
owners of adjoining property to the complex, claim that the construction caused
substantial subsidence and settlement issues on its property. The action
involves several contractors/sub-contractors, complaints and cross-complaints.
ANALYSIS
 
A. Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees
 
The prevailing party in “any action on a contract” shall be awarded
reasonable attorney’s fees incurred to enforce that contract where the contract
specifically provides for attorney’s fees.  (Civ. Code § 1717(a).)
 
Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees in the amount of $910,107.00, which includes a 2.0 multiplier.
 
The verified
time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.” 
(Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of California State University (2005) 132
Cal. App. 4th 359, 396.)  If the motion is supported by evidence, the
opposing party must respond with specific evidence showing that the fees are
unreasonable.  (Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys. v. California Ins. Guarantee
Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal. App. 4th 550,
560–63.) 
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel represents that 919.3 hours at $495.00 per hour were spent prosecuting
this action, for a total lodestar of $455,053.50. In opposition, Defendants
assert Plaintiff’s counsel should not be compensated for administrative tasks
and points out that certain billing entries related to “daily logs” may be
fabricated. The Court has reviewed counsel’s hours and finds them reasonable.
Counsel may recover time for administrative tasks and the Court is unpersuaded
any entries are fabricated. 
 
The Court finds
that no mulitplier should be awarded. The Court is permitted, but not required,
to apply a multiplier to an award for attorney’s fees. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138.)
Relevant factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1)
the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed
in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation
precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the
fee award. (Id. at 1132.)
 
Though this
action required Plaintiff’s counsel to take on financial risk, the Court finds
a 2.0 multiplier inappropriate. The risks involved here do not warrant a multiplier of
fees.
 
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees
is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $455,053.50.
 
B. Plaintiff’s Motion to Increase
Supersedeas Bond
 
Plaintiff moves to increase the
supersedeas bond posted by Defendants. In opposition, Defendants represent the
bond has been increased and the motion is moot.
 
Plaintiff’s motion to increase
supersedeas bond is DENIED as MOOT.
 
C. Defendants’ Motion to Tax Costs
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided
by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover
costs in any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b).)  “Allowable costs shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation.”  (CCP §
1033.5(c)(2).)  “If the items appearing
in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking
to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.”  (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn.
(1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774.)  “On
the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue
and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.”  (Ibid.)
 
Defendants move to tax Plaintiff’s
costs on the ground they are untimely by 5 days. The Court declines to strike
Plaintiff’s costs on this ground and notes that Defendants’ motion is untimely
by one day. 
 
Alternatively, Defendants move to
strike certain deposition costs and witness fees incurred in the related cases.
Plaintiff does not dispute this in opposition. Plaintiff cannot recover costs
incurred in other actions.
 
Defendants’ motion to tax costs is
GRANTED in part. Plaintiff’s costs are taxed in the amount of $3,585.00.
