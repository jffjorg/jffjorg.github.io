And here is a simple summary in English text:

Judge Maurice A. Leiter has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to continue the motion for reconsideration of the Court's July 10, 2023 order granting defendants' motion for terminating sanctions. Plaintiff Kumi Kawamura seeks to continue the motion, citing her father's terminal illness and her inability to timely file the motion for reconsideration. However, the Court notes that Plaintiff did not provide authority for the motion and did not specify a date for continuance. As a result, the Court denies the motion to continue. Plaintiff may instead choose to challenge the judgment via a motion to set aside judgment if she believes the motion for terminating sanctions was decided in error.
