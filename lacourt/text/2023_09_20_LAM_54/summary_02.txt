## English Summary

The judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Kumi Kawamura's motion to continue her previously advanced motion for reconsideration of a July 10, 2023 ruling that granted Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The court previously advanced the motion for reconsideration to August 16, 2023, but Plaintiff failed to file the required papers. Plaintiff now argues that her father's terminal illness prevented her from timely filing and requests a continuance. However, the court finds that Plaintiff has not provided legal authority or a proposed continuance date, and thus denies the motion. The court notes that Plaintiff may still challenge the July 10, 2023 ruling through a motion to set aside judgment if she believes it was decided in error.
