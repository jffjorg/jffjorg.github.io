Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration of the Court's previous order denying the request for sanctions. The Court finds that the motion is deficient because the declaration in support fails to include the required information. Even if the Court were to reconsider the motion, it would not modify the denial of sanctions. The Court declines to modify the order and denies the motion. The Plaintiff shall provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
