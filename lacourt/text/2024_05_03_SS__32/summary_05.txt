And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The court finds that the counsel has not provided an adequate reason for seeking relief, and has not provided proof of service of the moving papers on the plaintiff via mail. Additionally, the counsel has not included dates, times, locations, and subject matter of all future proceedings in the motion. The court has ordered the counsel to give notice and file a proof of service of the motion.
