```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling denies the motion to compel the deposition of LACMTA's person most knowledgeable and request for production of documents as moot without prejudice to filing a new motion. The court notes that the deposition was already held on April 4, 2024, and the plaintiffs did not reply to the opposition. The court also orders that the plaintiffs shall give notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such. The court notes that the plaintiffs may still seek to compel the production of the documents requested in the April 4, 2024 deposition notice, but must file a new motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480."
