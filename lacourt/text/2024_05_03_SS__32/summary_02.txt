```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to consolidate three cases involving motor vehicle accidents. The cases involve the same plaintiff but different defendants, and the same medical providers and counsel in all cases. The court finds that the cases are not deemed related and are not pending in the same department, which makes consolidation infeasible. Additionally, the court denies the defendants' request to continue trial without a properly noticed motion to continue trial.
