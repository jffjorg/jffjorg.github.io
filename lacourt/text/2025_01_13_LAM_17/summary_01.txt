And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Prime Pan-Pacific Co.'s motion for determination of good faith settlement. The company had settled with Kap Dong Kim, Bridget Kim, and Dalton Medical Corporation for $275,000, $125,000, and $25,000, respectively. The settlement was reached after extensive arms-length negotiations and no opposition was filed. The judge applied the standards set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) and found that the settlement meets the factors and was entered into in good faith. As a result, the settlement is deemed to be in good faith, and any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor will be barred from making further claims against the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution or partial or comparative indemnity.
