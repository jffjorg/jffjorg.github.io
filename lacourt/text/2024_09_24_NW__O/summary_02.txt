And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to strike certain portions of a complaint filed by a plaintiff against the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority and one of its employees, Curtis Simon. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's conduct was reckless and entitled to punitive damages. The defendant is seeking to strike portions of the complaint that state that the defendant's conduct demonstrates a willful and conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights, health, and safety. The judge is considering the evidence presented, including a statement by the defendant's managing agent that the plaintiff was responsible for a bus accident. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiff's claims of punitive damages may be disputed and that the defendant's motion to strike certain portions of the complaint will be considered.
