And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for determination of good faith settlement between the City of Los Angeles and Defendant Brandon Min is granted. The settlement is considered in good faith because it satisfies the Tech-Bilt factors, which include proportionate liability, amount paid in settlement, recognition that the settlor should pay less in settlement, allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, financial condition and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, and evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct between the settlor and plaintiffs.

The judge found that Defendant Brandon Min is settling with LADWP for his proportionate share of the Property, which is not suspicious. The judge also found that the settlement is not grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person would estimate the settling defendant's liability to be.

The judge concluded that the Tech-Bilt factors have been satisfied and that the settlement is in good faith.
