This analysis applies to Moving Parties’ motion to strike, too.


[2]
Moving Party’s arguments that the contract does not exist is not appropriate at
this stage.


[3]
Defendant Simi Oil is not part of this cause of action.


[4]
Although, it is likely sufficient at this stage for Plaintiff to simply allege
he suffered damage as a result of the breach. (See Maxwell, supra, 231 Cal.App.4th at p. 98.)


[5]
Defendant Simi Oil is not part of this cause of action.


[6]
For purposes of this Demurrer, Defendant Chahayed’s alleged wrongful act was
refusing to sign the New Lease. (FAC ¶ 23.)


[7]
The court does not know if this is an intentional omission. Out of an abundance
of caution, the court will still analyze the merits of this cause of action.


[8]
As with the seventh cause of action, there are no factual allegations
concerning Simi Oil’s supposed unfair competition.


[9]
The court disregards Moving Parties’ factual assertions.


[10]
Again, there are no facts as to Defendant Simi Oil.


[11]
Reading the FAC in its entirety and in context, Plaintiff alleged reliance and
damages with requisite particularity because he details his efforts to perform
his contractual duties, namely, pursuit of the new lease from Defendant
Nickerson. (FAC ¶¶ 19, 20, 21, 22.)
