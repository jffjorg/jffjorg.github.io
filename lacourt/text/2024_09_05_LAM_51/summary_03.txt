And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer (a motion to dismiss) and has issued a tentative ruling. The judge finds that the plaintiff has adequately alleged a cause of action for breach of contract, alleging that the defendant refused to sign a new lease and that the plaintiff suffered damage as a result. The judge notes that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient at this stage, and that the defendant's refusal to sign the lease is a sufficient wrongful act to support the claim. The judge also finds that the defendant Simi Oil is not part of this cause of action, and that the plaintiff's allegations of unfair competition by Simi Oil are lacking in factual support. The judge will analyze the merits of the cause of action despite the absence of factual allegations about Simi Oil's alleged wrongdoing.
