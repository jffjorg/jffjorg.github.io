And here is the English-text summary:

This Tentative Ruling addresses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, The International Christian Church, Inc. and City of Angels International Christian Church, in response to the original complaint filed by plaintiffs Salud Gonzalez and Joana Diaz. The complaint alleges childhood sexual abuse and various causes of action against the defendants. The defendants filed the demurrer and motion to strike on January 26, 2023, but on February 20, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint (FAC) alleging the same causes of action against the same defendants. As the FAC now serves as the operative complaint, the demurrer and motion to strike are moot. The court finds that the related cases are assigned to Judge Christian R. Gullón in Department O at Pomona Courthouse South.
