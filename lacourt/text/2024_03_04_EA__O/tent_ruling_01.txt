Background
 
This is a lemon law case. 
 
On November 29, 203, Plaintiff PAUL SINGH HUSSON filed suit
against Defendant General Motors LLC for the following causes of action (COA)
arising from his purchase of a new 2019 Cadillac CTS that experienced
transmission defects: 1.    
VIOLATION OF SONG-BEVERLY ACT - BREACH OF EXPRESS
WARRANTY 2.    
VIOLATION OF SONG-BEVERLY ACT - BREACH OF IMPLIED
WARRANTY 3.    
VIOLATION OF THE SONGBEVERLY ACT SECTION 1793.2 4.    
FRAUD – FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT – CONCEALMENT
 
On January 2, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer and
motion to strike (MTS).
 
On February 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a FAC asserting the
same 4 COAs against the same Defendant.
 
Discussion
 
As the demurrer and MTS are to the original complaint but
Plaintiff on 2/16/24 filed a FAC, which serves as the operative complaint, the
demurrer and MTS are moot.
