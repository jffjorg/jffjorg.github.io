And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a hearing scheduled for March 4, 2024. The defendant, General Motors LLC, had filed a demurrer and motion to strike the plaintiff's original complaint. However, the plaintiff had filed a first amended complaint (FAC) on February 16, 2024, which serves as the operative complaint. As a result, the demurrer and motion to strike are now moot. The judge will likely dismiss the demurrer and motion to strike at the upcoming hearing.
