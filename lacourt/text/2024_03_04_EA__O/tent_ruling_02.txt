instant demurrer with a motion to strike.

complaint (FAC) alleging the same COAs against the same Defendants.

complaint but on 2/20/23, Plaintiffs filed a FAC, which now serves as the operative
complaint, the demurrer and MTS are moot. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer and MTS are moot.
