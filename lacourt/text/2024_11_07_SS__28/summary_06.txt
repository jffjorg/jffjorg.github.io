And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition to approve the compromise of minor plaintiff Connor Cappelli's claims filed by petitioner Christopher Cappelli. The petition was filed on September 12, 2024, and was set for hearing on November 7, 2024. The judge found that the petition contains discrepancies regarding medical expenses and liens, which were not resolved by counsel's attached declaration. The judge notes that the total amount of medical expenses was $5,023.00, and that this amount was reduced by $2,681.14. However, the amount to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds ($3,834.99) exceeds the amount remaining after the reduction amounts are subtracted from the total medical expenses. The judge also notes that the amount to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds is inconsistent with the amount of medical expenses paid ($4,032.13). The judge concludes that the petition does not meet the requirements of Section 12a(1) of the petition, and therefore denies the petition without prejudice. The judge orders the petitioner to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
