Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the parties' arguments and weighed Plaintiff's privacy rights against Garcia's right to seek discoverable information. The court concludes that the subpoena is overbroad to the extent that it is not limited in time or in subject matter. Garcia seeks information about the pain Plaintiff experienced due to the accident and before the birth of her child. The court limits the time period covered by the subpoena to the period from May 12, 2022 (the date of the accident) to the date Plaintiff gave birth to her child. Additionally, the court limits the subpoena to include only documents and records involving Plaintiff's complaints of pain in her neck, back, and head, any treatment recommended or provided for that pain, and any resulting billing information. With these limitations, the court finds that the subpoena does not violate Plaintiff's privacy rights. Therefore, the court grants in part Plaintiff's motion to quash the deposition subpoena and limits the subpoena as described above.
