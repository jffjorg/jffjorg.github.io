Defendant argues that Plaintiff Phoebe Nalubega served the summons and other documents on the wrong party at the wrong address. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion. The judge has reviewed the moving papers and notice of non-opposition and rules that the motion is granted. The judge quashes the attempted service of the summons on Defendant. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
