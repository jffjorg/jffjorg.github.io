And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to continue the trial. The plaintiff, Amanda Montano, filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) and others for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. Metro is seeking to continue the trial to April 8, 2025, citing the health issues of Joseph Aquino, who was involved in the accident at issue and is unable to attend the trial.

The judge has denied Metro's request to continue the trial, finding that Metro has not provided sufficient evidence to support its assertion that Aquino's medical condition prevents him from attending the trial until April 2025. The judge has also found that Metro has not carried its burden of establishing good cause for the continuance.

The judge has granted Metro's request for a "short continuance" of the trial, continuing the trial to November 24, 2024, or the next available date. The judge has denied Metro's request to continue or reopen discovery or related deadlines.
