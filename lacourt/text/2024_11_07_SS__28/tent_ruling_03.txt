 Case Number:  22STCV26279    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
August 15, 2022, Plaintiff Yehuda Abikhzer (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants M S Excel Rent A Car, Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1-100 for
negligence, negligence per se, intentional misrepresentation, negligent
misrepresentation, breach of written contract, violation of Business and
Professions Code section 17200, violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act,
and products liability. 
On
December 7, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to replace Defendant’s name
with MS Excel Rent A Car, Inc. 
On
March 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service
of the summons, complaint, and other documents on Defendant on October 2, 2023. 
On April 8, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
June 6, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
June 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service
of the summons, complaint, statement of damages and other documents on
Defendant on December 19, 2023.  On August 19, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff's first application for default judgment, observing (among other things) that Plaintiff had not provided a copy of the statement of damages which Plaintiff contended that he served on December 19, 2023. Although Plaintiff stated that Exhibit I was “a true and correct copy of the Statement of Damages served on Defendant, filed with the court on March 22, 2024,” Exhibit I was titled “Summary of Case in Support of Plaintiff’s Request for Court Judgment; Declaration of Roy Aviram, Esq. in Support Thereof.” The document asserted that “[a] Statement of Damages was served on Defendant pursuant to CCP §425.11 & §425.115 on December 19, 2023.” However, no statement of damages was attached. On October 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service of a statement of damages on Defendant on September 25, 2024.
On October
8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second application for default judgment. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Yehuda Abikhzer asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant MS
Excel Rent A Car, Inc. and award Plaintiff $5,085,768.29, consisting of
$5,000,000.00 in general damages, $83,499.38 in special damages, and $2,268.91
in costs. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          “In personal injury and wrongful death actions, the
complaint must not state the amount of damages sought [citations].  Therefore, before a default may be entered,
plaintiff must serve defendant with a statement of ‘the nature and amount of
damages being sought.’ ”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 5:82, p. 5-27 (Cal. Practice Guide).)  “[S]ervice [of the statement of damages]
after default but before prove-up [is] not sufficient[.]”  (Ibid.) 
“The
purpose is to give defendant ‘one last chance’ to respond, knowing exactly what
judgment may be entered if he or she fails to appear.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:83,
p. 5-28.)  “Absent such a statement,
defendant lacks notice of the actual liability threatened, so that any default
judgment is void.”  (Ibid.) 
Here,
Plaintiff has submitted a proof of service showing that he personally served a
statement of damages on Defendant on September 25, 2024, after the clerk
entered Defendant’s default on April 8, 2024. 
Because Defendant did not serve the statement of damages before the
entry of default, the Court vacates the default and denies Plaintiff’s
application for default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Yehuda Abikhzer’s
application for default judgment against Defendant MS Excel Rent A Car, Inc.  In addition, the Court VACATES the default entered
on April 8, 2024 against Defendant
MS Excel Rent A Car, Inc. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
