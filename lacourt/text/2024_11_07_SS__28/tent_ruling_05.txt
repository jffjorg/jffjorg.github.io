PARTY’S REQUEST 
Defendant

LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 416.10 provides: 
“A summons may be served on a corporation by
delivering a copy of the summons and the complaint by any of the following
methods: 
“(a) To the person designated as agent for service of
process as provided by any provision in Section 202, 1502, 2105, or 2107 of the
Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to
6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976,
with respect to corporations to which they remain applicable). 
“(b) To the president, chief executive officer, or
other head of the corporation, a vice president, a secretary or assistant
secretary, a treasurer or assistant treasurer, a controller or chief financial
officer, a general manager, or a person authorized by the corporation to
receive service of process. 
“(c) If the corporation is a bank, to a cashier or
assistant cashier or to a person specified in subdivision (a) or (b). 
“(d) If authorized by any provision in Section 1701,
1702, 2110, or 2111 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303,
inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in
effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which they remain
applicable), as provided by that provision.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 416.10.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 418.10 provides in part: 
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her
time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause
allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following
purposes: 
“(1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack
of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10.
subd. (a)(1).)
A
motion made under Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10 does not constitute an
appearance unless a court denies the motion. 
(See L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (Rutter 2023) (Cal. Practice Guide) ¶ 3:376, p. 3-116 [“If the
motion is denied, defendant is deemed to have made a general appearance –
waiving any jurisdictional objection – upon entry of the order denying the
motion” (emphasis omitted)].) 
“
‘Although a proper basis for personal jurisdiction exists and notice is given
in a manner which satisfied the constitutional requirements of due process,
service of summons is not effective and the court does not acquire jurisdiction
of the party unless the statutory requirements for service of summons are met.’
” (Engebretson & Co. v. Harrison (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 436, 443,
quoting Schering Corp. v. Superior Court (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 737, 741.) 
“
‘When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process the burden is on the plaintiff to prove … the facts
requisite to an effective service.’ “ 
(Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 4:421.5, p. 4-72, quoting Summers
v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.) 
DISCUSSION 
On August
29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service asserting that Plaintiff served
the summons, complaint, and statement of damages on Defendant on August 24, 2024 using substituted
service.  The proof of
service states that the process server left the documents with “John Doe,”
purportedly Defendant’s co-occupant, at 115 E Broadway,
Apt G101, San Gabriel, CA 91776-1893, Defendant’s “home.” 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff served the summons and other documents on the wrong party
at the wrong address.  According to Defendant, Defendant has
never lived at that address and has no connection with it.  As a result, Defendant contends, the service
was invalid.  Defendant has provided a declaration
to support these assertions. 
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to Defendant’s motion. 
 The
Court grants the motion and quashes Plaintiff’s August 24, 2024 attempted
service of the summons on Defendant. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Specially Appearing Defendant Qi Song’s
motion to quash Plaintiff Phoebe Nalubega’s service of the summons.  The Court quashes service of the summons. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
