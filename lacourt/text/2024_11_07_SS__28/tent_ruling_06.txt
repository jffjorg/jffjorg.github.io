 Case Number:  23STCV16655    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  28           Having considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules
as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
July 17, 2023, Plaintiffs Christopher Cappelli, Jessica Cappelli, and Connor
Cappelli, a minor by and through his guardian ad litem, Christopher Cappelli,
filed this action against Defendants Zohrab Barseghyan, Lyft, Inc., and Does
1-25 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
July 19, 2023, the Court appointed Christopher Cappelli to serve as Plaintiff
Connor Cappelli’s guardian ad litem. 
On
February 7, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On September
12, 2024, Petitioner Christopher Cappelli (“Petitioner”) filed a third amended
petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Connor
Cappelli’s claims. The petition was set for hearing on November 7, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff
Connor Cappelli (“Plaintiff”). 
DISCUSSION 
The
petition provides the following information: 
Gross
settlement amount:                              $17,483.00
Total
medical expenses:                                 $5,023.00
Medical
expenses paid:                                  $4,032.13
Reductions:                                                    $2,681.14
          To be paid/reimbursed from proceeds:            $3,834.99
          Liens:                                                             $6,131.00
          Attorney’s fees:                                             $4,370.75
          Costs:                                                             $373.15
          Net balance:                                                   $8,706.97 
Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $5,023.00.  Section 12a(5) of the petition states that
the total amount of contractual or statutory liens is $6,131.00.  The lien amount should not exceed the total amount
of medical expenses incurred. 
As
noted, Section 12a(1) of the petition
states that total medical expenses were $5,023.00.  Section 12a(3) of the petition states that
this amount was reduced by $2,681.14. 
This should mean that the remaining amount of medical expenses – $2,341,86 – will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  However, Section
12a(4) of the petition states that $3,834.99 will be paid or reimbursed from
the settlement proceeds.  The amount
to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds should not exceed the
amount remaining after the reduction amounts are subtracted from the total
medical expenses. 
As noted,
Section 12a(4) of the petition states that $3,834.99 will be paid or reimbursed
from the settlement proceeds.  However,
Section 16b of the petition states that $4,032.13 in medical expenses will be
paid from the settlement proceeds.  The
number in Section 12a(4) and 16b should be the same.  In addition, as explained above, the number should
not exceed the amount remaining after the
reduction amounts are subtracted from the total medical expenses. 
The
Court has reviewed counsel’s attached declaration, which attempts to explain
the discrepancies discussed above.  The
declaration does not resolve these issues.
The
Court denies the petition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Connor Cappelli’s claims filed
by Petitioner Christopher Cappelli on
September 12, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
