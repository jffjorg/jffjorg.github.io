And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default judgment and has ruled as follows. The Plaintiff, Yehuda Abikhzer, seeks to enter a default judgment against the Defendant, MS Excel Rent A Car, Inc., and award $5,085,768.29 in damages. However, the Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to provide a copy of the statement of damages, which was required before the entry of default. The Court also notes that the Defendant did not receive notice of the actual liability threatened until after the default was entered. As a result, the Court vacates the default and denies the Plaintiff's application for default judgment. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
