Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Martin R. Berman, Counsel for Plaintiff Jacob Jacobson, a minor, has been granted. The Court finds that Counsel has shown good cause for the requested relief due to the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The Court notes that Counsel is seeking to be relieved as counsel for a minor child, and that the Guardian Ad Litem will need to hire new counsel to continue the lawsuit. The Court sets trial on or after October 15, 2024, to give the Guardian Ad Litem sufficient time to retain new counsel and prepare for trial.
