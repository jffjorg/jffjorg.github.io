Tentative

Background
On February 25, 2022, Talbot Louis Wells
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against PIH Health Downey Hospital, Juan Jose
Macias Barreto, and Does 1 to 100 for (1) assault, (2) battery, (3) infliction
of emotional distress, (4) negligence, and (5) negligent hiring, supervision,
and retention, all arising from a physical altercation occurring on March 15,
2020.
In January and February 2023, Plaintiff amended
the complaint to name Allied Universal Security Services Universal Protection Service
LPP as Doe 1 and Allied Barton Security Services LP as Doe 2. 
On March 27, 2023, Defendant
Universal Protection Service LP dba Allied Universal Security Services,
erroneously served as Allied Barton Security Services LP (“Defendant”) filed
an answer to the complaint.  On the same
day, Defendant also filed a cross-complaint against Roes 1 through 10.
On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel was
relieved as counsel. 
On April 2, 2024, Defendant filed the motions
to compel the depositions of Plaintiffs. No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
 
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  Any such motion to compel
must show good cause for the production of documents and, when a deponent has
failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a declaration stating that
the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.”  (Id., subd.
(b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
On
February 14, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with notice of his depositions
set for February 28, 2024. (Sharaby Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff did not object to
the deposition. (Id.) On February 28, Plaintiff failed to appear. (Id.,
see also Exh. 3.)
 
Defense
counsel requested further dates from Plaintiff’s counsel, and noticed a
deposition of Plaintiff for March 11, 2024. (Id., ¶ 4.) The deposition
was taken off-calendar and renoticed for March 22, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5.)
Plaintiff failed to appear a second time. (Id.) 
 
Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition to the motion. 
 
The
Court finds that Plaintiff failed to appear on two separate occasions for a
noticed deposition.  The motion to compel
is granted.
 
The
Court denies Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions in the future if
Plaintiff fails to appear.  The request
is premature at this time.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff. 
 
The Court
ORDERS Plaintiff to appear for deposition and answer questions under oath on
June __, 2024, at 10:00 am, by videoconference, with a link to be provided to
Plaintiff at least 48 hours in advance. 
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
