And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to appear for two separate deposition notices, and the defendant has shown good cause for the production of documents. The court finds that the plaintiff engaged in misuse of the discovery process and will impose a monetary sanction in favor of the defendant. The court denies the defendant's request for a terminating sanction in the future if the plaintiff fails to appear. The court orders the plaintiff to appear for deposition and answer questions under oath on a specific date.
