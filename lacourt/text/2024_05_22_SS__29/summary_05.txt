```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion in part and denies it in part. The judge modifies the subpoena to strike out the request for the plaintiff's complete personnel file, as it is overly broad and extends far beyond the information that defendants have a legitimate interest in obtaining. The judge allows the subpoena to proceed with the request for payroll records, documents related to the termination of the plaintiff's employment, and documents related to the plaintiff's compensation. The judge also allows the subpoena to proceed with depositions on topics 1, 2, and 3. The judge concludes that defendants' legitimate interest in obtaining information outweighs the plaintiff's substantial privacy interest in this information.
