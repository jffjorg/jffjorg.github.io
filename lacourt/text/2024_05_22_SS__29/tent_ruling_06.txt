 Case Number:  22STCV16408    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, for
Summary Adjudication 
Tentative
The Court will hear from counsel on all issues, including (but not
limited to) the following:
First, with regard to the common law negligence cause of action, viewing
the evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, in what way did
Defendant breach a duty to Plaintiff?  The
undisputed evidence in the record is that there were no prior incidents in
which Bixby had attacked, or otherwise shown aggression against, people.  In what way did Defendant, the owner of a
peaceful dog, breach a duty to Plaintiff? 
What is the duty and what is the evidence in the record of a breach?
Second, with regard to the statutory strict liability cause of action,
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, in what way is
Defendant liable under Civil Code section 3342, subdivision (a)?  Was Plaintiff “in a public place”?  Was Plaintiff “lawfully in a private place”?  Is this issue governed by the law of trespass
or some other principle?  The undisputed
evidence in the record appears to be that Plaintiff did not have permission to
enter Defendant’s private premises – Plaintiff was a delivery driver and was
instructed to leave the food at the bottom of the stairs.
Third, with regard to the common law strict liability cause of action,
what is Plaintiff’s theory of recovery? 
The Complaint alleges that, prior to the incident, Defendant knew or
should have known that the dog was vicious and had dangerous propensities.  What evidence in the record supports that
allegation?
This is only a partial tentative decision.  It is not a ruling or order of the Court and
should not be treated or cited as such.
Background
Plaintiff
Jun Chen (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on or about February 6, 2022, he was bitten
by a dog owned by Defendant Stephen Ingram Marsh (“Defendant”) while Plaintiff
was making a food delivery to a residence on La Castana Drive in Los
Angeles.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 6-9.)  Plaintiff filed the complaint in this action
against Defendant and Does 1 through 50 on May 17, 2022.  In the complaint, Plaintiff asserts causes of
action for negligence, negligence per se, strict liability (common law), and
strict liability (Civil Code section 3342).
Defendant
filed his answer on July 12, 2022, and an amended answer on October 17, 2023.
On
July 28, 2023, Defendant filed this motion for summary judgment, along with a
request for judicial notice. Plaintiff filed an opposition on March 21, 2024.
Defendant filed a reply on March 29, 2024, along with objections to Plaintiff’s
evidence.
On
April 29, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on the motion to May 22,
ordered Plaintiff to file a separate statement, and granted Defendant leave to
file a further reply in response to the separate statement.  
On May
8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a separate statement. 
On May 17, 2024, Defendant filed a further reply.
Legal Standard
“The purpose of
the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each cause
of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment
or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing
a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon
the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)
Request for
Judicial Notice
Defendant
requests that the Court take judicial notice of Los Angeles County Code
sections 10.08.150, 10.20.320, and 10.32.010. 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request.
Objections to Evidence
Defendant objects to certain portions
of the evidence submitted by Plaintiff.  Evidence
presented in support of, or in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment
must be admissible.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (d); Perry v. Bakewell
Hawthorne LLC (2017) 2
Cal.5th 536, 541-43.)  The court must “consider all of the evidence set forth
in the papers, except the evidence to which objections have been made and
sustained.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (c).)
The Court
SUSTAINS in part and OVERRULES in part Objection No. 1.  The objection to the final sentence of
paragraph 3 of the Beasecker Declaration is overruled, as it is supported by
Defendant’s deposition testimony.  The
objection to the remainder of paragraph 3 is sustained on the grounds of
hearsay, lack of personal knowledge, and lack of foundation.
The Court
SUSTAINS Objection No. 2 (to paragraph 4 of the Beasecker Declaration) on the
grounds of hearsay, lack of personal knowledge, and lack of foundation.
The Court OVERRULES
Objections Nos. 3, 4, and 5, as these statements are supported by Defendant’s
deposition testimony and discovery responses. 
The Court
SUSTAINS Objection No. 6 (to paragraph 8 of the Beasecker Declaration) on the
ground that it is argument, not a statement of fact.
The Court
OVERRULES Objections Nos. 7-11, as they refer to Defendant’s deposition
testimony and discovery responses.
Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement
Plaintiff did not
initially file a separate statement with his opposition, as required by Code of
Civil Procedure 437c, subdivision (b)(3), and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(f).  The Court continued the hearing to give
Plaintiff the opportunity to cure this error; the Court also admonished
Plaintiff that failure to comply with the requirement of a separate statement may
constitute a sufficient ground to grant the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(3).)
Plaintiff has now
filed a separate statement.  In certain
respects, this separate statement complies with the applicable requirements,
but in other respects it does not.  For
example, when Plaintiff disputes certain facts, he does not refer to or cite the
evidence that, he contends, places the issue in dispute.  (E.g., Separate Statement, Nos. 7, 20).  In addition, Plaintiff does not unequivocally
state whether he disputes or does not dispute certain other facts.  (E.g. Separate Statement, Nos. 27, 28, 29, 30,
31.)
Nonetheless, the
Court will exercise its discretion to move past this procedural issue and
adjudicate the motion on the merits, based on the evidence in the record and
the arguments of both sides.
Discussion 
Plaintiff was
bitten by Bixby, a Rhodesian Ridgeback/Shephard mixed breed female dog, while
Plaintiff was delivering food to Defendant’s residence on February 6,
2022.  (Defendant’s Statement of
Undisputed Material Facts (“DSUMF”), Nos. 2, 18-19, 26.)  Defendant owns Bixby.  (Stephen Marsh Decl., ¶ 2.)  
Prior to this
incident, neither Defendant nor his wife had ever witnessed Bixby bite or
attack anyone and had never received any notice or complaints that Bixby bit or
attacked anyone.  (DSUMF, Nos. 27-30.)
Defendant’s
residence is a two-story home on a hillside. (DSUMF, No. 5.)  To access the residence, one must first enter
through an iron gate on the ground floor, then walk up a staircase with
approximately 37 steps, and then enter through a second gate.  (DSUMF, No. 6.)  At the top of the staircase, approximately 6
inches from the latch of the second gate, there is a sign that states, “Dog On
Premises.”  (Stephen Marsh Decl., ¶ 7.)  At the time of the dog bite, Bixby was kept
inside Defendant’s property in a gated yard at the top of the stairs.  (Id., ¶ 8.)
On February 6,
2022, the date of the dog bite, Plaintiff was a delivery driver for
DoorDash.  (DSUMF, No. 10.)  Plaintiff is fluent in Mandarin Chinese but
has only a limited understanding of English. 
(Ibid.)  The information on
the DoorDash application available to Plaintiff was in English.  (DSUMF, No. 11.)  Plaintiff testified that he uses a translation
software (Youdao Translation) to translate the instructions on the DoorDash
application into Mandarin Chinese. 
(Mosier Decl., Exh. B [“Plaintiff Depo.”], at 23:18-24:22.)
Plaintiff
testified that he does not always read the delivery instructions on the
DoorDash application, particularly when he is “running out of time.”  (Plaintiff Depo., at 28:20-25.)  He also stated that he does not think it is “that
important” to read those instructions every time he makes a delivery.  (Id., at 29:2-5.)
On that date
of the dog bite, Defendant and his wife, Kathleeen Marsh, were hosting a
birthday party and ordered a pizza through a delivery application.  (DSUMF, No. 3.)  Ms. Marsh left instructions on the delivery
application stating, “Please do not enter gate upstairs we have dogs. U can
leave at bottom, thank you.”  (Kathleen
Marsh Decl., ¶ 6 & Exh. 1.)
Plaintiff
arrived at Defendant’s residence to deliver the pizza.  (DSUMF, No. 11.)  Plaintiff did not recall reading the delivery
instructions.  (Plaintiff Depo., at 29:6-9,
31:7-13.)  He testified that reading the
instructions was not necessary “[b]ecause I saw that it was a house.”  (Id., at 29:10-15, 31:14-18.)
The gate at
the bottom of the stairs was open, and so Plaintiff entered and walked up the
stairs.  (DSUMF, No. 15.)  At the top of the stairs, the gate was closed
but not locked.  (DSUMF, No. 16.)  Plaintiff opened the gate because he did not
think that it would be sanitary to place the pizza on the ground outside the
gate, and he saw that there was a table nearby inside the gate.  (DSUMF, No. 17.)  Plaintiff did not see the “Dog On Premises”
sign or hear any sound of dogs.  (DSUMF,
No. 19; Plaintiff Depo., at 35:23-36:12.) 
Given his limited understanding of English, Plaintiff testified at his
deposition that he understood the words “Dog” and “on” on the sign but not the
word “premises.”  (Plaintiff Depo. at
36:16-24.)
Plaintiff
placed the pizza on the table, and then Bixby bit his leg.  (DSUMF, No. 18.)
In his
complaint, Plaintiff asserts four causes of action: (1) negligence; (2) negligence per se; (3)
strict liability (Civil Code section 3342); and (4) strict liability (common
law).  Defendant moves for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of each cause of action.  
For ease of discussion, the Court addresses
these causes of action in a slightly different order.
Negligence Per Se (Second Cause of Action)
Negligence per se is not a separate cause of action. (Turner
v. Seterus, Inc. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 516, 534; accord Jones v. Awad (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1200, 1210; Millard v.
Biosources, Inc. (2007)
156 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1353, fn.2; Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center (2006)
140¿Cal.App.4th 1256, 1285.) Rather, the doctrine of negligence per se “creates
an evidentiary presumption that affects the standard of care in a cause of
action for negligence.” (Turner, supra, 27 Cal.App.5th at p. 534.) It
“codifies the rule that a presumption of negligence arises from the violation
of a statute which was enacted to protect a class of persons of which the
plaintiff is a member against the type of harm that the plaintiff suffered as a
result of the violation. (Quiroz, supra, 140¿Cal.App.4th at p. 1285.)
Plaintiff concedes that negligence per se is not a separate
cause of action.  (Plaintiff’s Separate
Statement, at p. 13:2-3.)  Accordingly,
the motion for summary adjudication as to the Second Cause of Action is
granted.
Negligence
The basic elements of a cause of action for
negligence are: (1) the existence of a legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting
damages. (Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158.)  
The Court will hear from counsel.
Statutory Strict Liability

Common Law Strict Liability
The Court will hear from counsel.
Conclusion
The Court will hear from counsel.
