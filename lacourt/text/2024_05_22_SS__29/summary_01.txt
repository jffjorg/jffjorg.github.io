And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part the defendant's motion for leave to conduct a second physical examination of the plaintiff. The plaintiff suffered injuries in an automobile accident and has already undergone a physical examination. The defendant has shown good cause for a second examination, as the plaintiff's condition has changed since the first examination. The court has ordered the plaintiff to submit to a second physical examination by Dr. A.N. Shamie, an orthopedic spine specialist, on a date to be determined. The examination may include observation, palpation, testing of range of motion, and strength testing. The court has also denied the defendant's request for additional X-ray or other imaging.
