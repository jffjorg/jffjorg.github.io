And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by defendants Russell Lyster, Hope Ranch Cattle Company, LLC, and Isaiah Morales. The court finds that the settlement agreement was entered into in good faith, considering the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates, such as the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery, the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, and the allocation of the settlement proceeds among plaintiffs. The court notes that the settlement is for the total insurance policies available to the defendants, and there is no evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants. Therefore, the court grants the motion and determines that the settlement was made in good faith.
