  Case Number:  21STCV36635    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion for Leave to Conduct a Second Physical
Examination of Plaintiff 
 
 
Tentative
 
The
motion is granted in part and denied in part.
Background 
On
October 5, 2021, Valeria Guaman (a minor) and Norma Alicia Ruiz-Pelayo
(collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed the complaint in this action against The Los
Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, Spencer Thomas, and Does 1 through 50, asserting
one cause of action under Government Code section 815.2 arising out of an
automobile accident that occurred on September 20, 2020, on Santa Fe Avenue in
Los Angeles.
On June
3, 2022, Defendant County of Los Angeles, erroneously sued as The Los
Angeles County Sherif’s Department (“County”), filed its answer.
On
April 3, 2024, County filed this motion for leave to conduct a second physical
examination of Plaintiff Guaman. 
Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 9, and County filed a reply on May
15.
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery . . . by means of a physical or mental examination
of (1) a party to the action, (2) an agent of any party, or (3) a natural
person in the custody or under the legal control of a party, in any action in
which the mental or physical condition … of that party or other person is in
controversy in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.020, subd. (a).)
In a
personal injury action, the defendant may demand one physical examination of
plaintiff as of right, without advance leave of the court.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2032.220.) 
If a
defendant seeks a further physical examination of plaintiff, or a mental
examination, the defendant must first file a motion and “obtain leave of
court.” (Id., § 2032.310, subd. (a).) Such a motion must “specify the
time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well
as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will
perform the examination.” (Id., subd. (b).) The court may grant such a
motion “only for good cause shown.” (Id., § 2032.320, subd. (a).) A
showing of good cause generally requires “that the party produce specific facts
justifying discovery and that the inquiry be relevant to the subject matter of
the action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.” (Vinson v. Super. Ct. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 840.) 
The examination will be limited to whatever condition is “in controversy” in
the action. (Id., § 2032.020, subd. (a).) 
“An
order granting a physical or mental examination shall specify the person or
persons who may perform the examination, as well as the time, place, manner,
diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subd. (d).) “The
court is to describe in detail who will conduct the
examination, where and when it will be conducted, the conditions, scope and
nature of the examination, and the diagnostic tests and procedures to be
employed.  The way to describe these ‘diagnostic tests and procedures’—fully and in
detail—is to list them by name.” (Carpenter v. Super. Ct. (2006)
141 Cal.App.4th 249, 260.)
The
moving party must support the motion with a meet and confer declaration. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (b).) A meet and confer declaration
must state facts “showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Id., § 2016.040.) 
Discussion
 
County has
satisfied the meet and confer requirement of section 2032.310, subdivision
(b).  (Ward Decl., ¶ 13 & Exh. F.)
 
County previously demanded, and Plaintiff submitted to, a physical (orthopedic)
examination by A.N. Shamie, M.D., on April 19, 2023.  (Ward Decl., ¶ 6.)  Prior to this examination, Plaintiff had
identified low back pain as one of the injuries that she attributed to the
accident in both written discovery and in her deposition.  (Pantsulaya Decl., ¶¶ 3-4 & Exhs.
1-2.)  During the examination, and in his
report, Dr. Shamie noted that Plaintiff was complaining of (among other things)
back pain and numbness.  (Id., ¶ 6
& Exh. 4.)  
 
On March 27, 2023, approximately three weeks before the examination by
Dr. Shamie, Plaintiff had an MRI and X-Rays of her lumbar spine.  (Id., ¶ 8 & Exh. 5.)  The records of that examination and imaging were
produced in May 2023, after Dr. Shamie examined Plaintiff.  (Id., ¶ 8; Ward Decl., ¶ 7 & Exh.
C.)  Subsequently, in November 2023,
Plaintiff produced additional medical records, including from an examination by
a doctor in September 2023 who recommended lumbar spine surgery.  (Pantsulaya Decl., ¶ 9 & Exh. 6; Ward
Decl., ¶ 9 & Exh. E.)  The estimated
cost for this procedure is $175,000. 
(Ward Decl., ¶ 9.)
 
 
The Court
finds that County has established good cause for Plaintiff to undergo a second
physical examination by Dr. Shamie.  At
the time of the first examination, neither County nor Dr. Shamie had received
information regarding the full severity of Plaintiff’s back condition,
including the recommendation for a significant surgical procedure.  The Court finds that there is good cause to
grant leave to require Plaintiff to submit to a second physical examination in
light of this new, and very significant, information.  The motion is therefore granted in part.
 
The Court
will not, however, require Plaintiff to submit to additional X-ray or other imaging
by Dr. Shamie.  Plaintiff has already had
an MRI and X-rays and has provided that information to County in
discovery.  County has not presented any
evidence that the existing images are of poor quality, unclear, or otherwise
insufficient for Dr. Shamie to examine or provided any other good cause for
additional X-rays or other images.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.520.)
Conclusion

The Court GRANTS in part County’s
motion for leave to require Plaintiff to submit to a second physical
examination by Dr. A.N. Shamie, an orthopedic spine specialist, on June __,
2024, at ____ a.m./p.m., at 10850 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 1270, Los Angles
California.  The examination may include
observation, palpation, testing of range of motion, and strength testing.  
The examination will be conducted
in accordance with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
2032.510.
Moving
Party is to give notice.
