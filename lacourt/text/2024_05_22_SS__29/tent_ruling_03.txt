Tentative
 
The
motion is granted.
 
Background
 
On January 18, 2022, Plaintiff Ixsa Orellana
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint asserting causes of
action
for (1) general negligence and (2) premises liability against defendants Vive
Night Club, Ruben Aguinaga, individually and dba Vive Night Club, Matrix
Entertainment, and Does 1 through 50. In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that
on July 11, 2021, she was “walking to a table at Defendants’ place of business
when she slipped and fell on the wet floor, falling and sustaining bodily
injuries including a facial fracture.” (Complaint, at p. 4.)
 
On
January 26, 2023, Defendants Topanga Entertainment, Inc. (erroneously sued as
Vive Night Club) (“Topanga”) and Ruben Aguinaga (“Aguinaga”) each filed an
answer. (Topanga and Aguinaga are referred to collectively as “Defendants.”)
 
On February
20, 2024, Defendants filed this motion for leave to conduct a second physical  examination of Plaintiff with Jeffrey Wang,
M.D. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 9, 2024. Defendants filed a reply on May
15, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by means of a
physical or mental examination of (1) a party to the action, (2) an agent of
any party, or (3) a natural person in the custody or under the legal control of
a party, in any action in which the mental or physical condition … of that
party or other person is in controversy in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.020,
subd. (a).)
 
In a personal injury action, the defendant may
demand one physical examination of plaintiff as of right, without advance leave
of the court.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.220.)  
If a defendant seeks a further physical examination
of plaintiff, or a mental examination, the defendant must first file a motion
and “obtain leave of court.” (Id., § 2032.310, subd. (a).) Such a motion
must “specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination.” (Id., subd. (b).) The
court may grant such a motion “only for good cause shown.” (Id., §
2032.320, subd. (a).) A showing of good cause generally requires “that the
party produce specific facts justifying discovery and that the inquiry be
relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably calculated to lead
to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Vinson v. Super. Ct. (1987)
43 Cal.3d 833, 840.)  
 
“An order granting a physical or mental examination
shall specify the person or persons who may perform the examination, as well as
the time, place, manner, diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope,
and nature of the examination.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subd.
(d).) “The court is to describe¿in detail¿who will conduct the
examination, where and when it will be conducted, the conditions, scope and
nature of the examination, and the diagnostic tests and procedures to be
employed.  The way to describe these ‘diagnostic tests and procedures’—fully¿and¿in
detail—is to list them by name.” (Carpenter v. Super. Ct.¿(2006)
141 Cal.App.4th 249, 260.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The moving party¿must support the motion with a meet
and confer declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.310, subd. (b).) A
meet and confer declaration must state facts “showing a reasonable and good
faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.”¿ (Id., § 2016.040.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The examination will be limited to whatever
condition is “in controversy” in the action.¿ (Id., § 2032.020, subd.
(a).)  
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff has previously submitted to one physical examination by Dr.
Ilan Danan, a neurologist, as well as a mental examination.  Defendants now seek leave to conduct a second
physical examination of Plaintiff, this one with Dr. Jeffrey Wang, an orthopedic
physician. 
 
Plaintiff has alleged both neurological and orthopedic injuries.  (Soll Decl., ¶ 11.)  Plaintiff contends, in her opposition, that
Dr. Danan performed a physical examination of her, but Dr. Danan is a specialist
in the field of neurology, not orthopedics. 
Given the range of Plaintiff’s alleged injuries, Defendants have shown
good cause for a physical examination of Plaintiff by an orthopedic specialist.
 
The motion is granted.
 
Conclusion

The Court GRANTS without
prejudice the physical examination of Plaintiff.
The Court
ORDERS Plaintiff to appear for and submit to a physical examination by Dr.
Jeffrey Wang, an orthopedic physician, on June 18, 2024, at 4 p.m., at 1450 San
Pablo Street, Suite 5400, Los Angeles, CA 90033. 
 
The examination
will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 2032.520.
 
Moving
Party is to give notice.
