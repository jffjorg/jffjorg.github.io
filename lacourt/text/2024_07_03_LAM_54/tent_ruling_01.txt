BACKGROUND
 
This is a dispute over legal fees. Plaintiffs Dariush G. Adli and ADLI
Law Group P.C. (ALG) sued defendants Skypanels, Inc., Ali Salomi, and Chadwick
Tyner on November 12, 2020, alleging a single cause of action for breach of
contract and claiming $33,343.25 in damages.
 
Defendants Ali Salomi and Chadwick Tyner cross-complained against
Plaintiffs on May 27, 2021 for intentional misrepresentation, negligent
misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, conversion, unfair business practices,
breach of contract (in two iterations), and civil theft (Penal Code § 496).
Salomi and Tyner allege Adli and ALG overbilled them at least $40,000.00 for
the services in question.
 
On November 16, 2021, Plaintiffs gave notice of ALG’s bankruptcy, and an
automatic stay went into effect.
 
On November 7, 2023, the parties appeared for a status conference, and
Defendant contended that the bankruptcy stay should be lifted. Plaintiff did
not argue otherwise. (See 11-07-2023 Minute Order.)
 
On January 4, 2024, Plaintiff appeared for an OSC Re: Dismissal for
Failure to Prosecute and Trial Setting Conference. Defendants did not appear. The
minute order states:
 
The Court and Plaintiff
confer regarding the status of the case and bankruptcy. [¶] The Court orders
the entire case dismissed Without Prejudice.
 
(01-04-2024 Minute Order.)
 
            On February 1, 2024,
cross-complainants Salomi and Tyner moved to set aside the dismissal. On
February 26, 2024, the Court granted their motion, ruling:
 
The Court orders the dismissal ordered
on 01/04/2024 as to the entire action set aside and vacated only as to Dariush
G. Adli (Cross-Defendant) and ADLI LAW GROUP P.C. (Cross-Defendant).
 
            On May 30, 2024, ALG filed the
instant motion for leave to file an amended complaint.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A. Plaintiff’s Proposed Pleading is Not a
Compulsory Cross-Complaint.
 
The Court revived the entire
action as to Adli and ALG in its ruling on February 26, 2024. Plaintiff’s
initial complaint remains operative. Plaintiff improperly relies on Code of
Civil Procedure § 425.60, which refers to compulsory cross-complaints,
suggesting he is proposing a whole new pleading. Cross-Complainants correctly
point out that section 425.60 does not apply. This argument is beside the
point. Plaintiff captioned his motion as a motion for leave to amend, even
though he did not cite the correct statutory authority.
 
B. The Court Permits Plaintiff Leave to Amend
the Complaint.
 
The court may, in its discretion and after notice
to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(a).) The Rules of Court prescribe various
procedural requirements for a motion for leave to amend. (See Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324.)
 
Plaintiff
has complied with Rule 3.1324. Plaintiff states that its “proposed amendments
have the effect of removing the individual Cross-Defendant Dariush Adli as a
plaintiff and only assert claims on behalf of ALG, the real party in interest.”
(Mot., 4:9-12.) It appears that what Plaintiff is filing is a request for
dismissal of Adli only.
 
Notwithstanding
Plaintiff’s confusion, the Court grants the motion in the interests of justice
and efficiency. The Court will allow the filing of the proposed first amended
complaint as ALG’s operative pleading and dismisses Dariush Adli’s claims in
their entirety.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to file a first amended complaint is granted. Plaintiff
Dariush Adli’s claims are dismissed. Plaintiff ALG is ordered to separately
e-file its operative FAC within five days of this ruling.
