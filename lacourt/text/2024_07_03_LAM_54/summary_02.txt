And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for appointment of an arbitrator filed by the plaintiffs, Lillian B. Scott and Patricia Y. Mogart, in their lemon law and consumer fraud action against defendants Norm Reeves, Inc., American Honda Finance Corporation, and others. The motion was denied because the arbitration agreement allows the plaintiffs to choose between multiple options, including the American Arbitration Association (AAA), and they agreed to arbitrate before AAA unless defendants approve otherwise. The court found that the agreed-upon method of appointing an arbitrator has not failed, and the plaintiffs simply refused to participate in it.
