Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Dariush G. Adli and ADLI Law Group P.C. (ALG) in a dispute over legal fees. The Court has granted the motion, allowing the filing of a first amended complaint as ALG's operative pleading and dismissing Dariush Adli's claims in their entirety.

The Court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and has concluded that the motion is granted in the interests of justice and efficiency. The Court notes that Plaintiff's initial complaint remains operative, and that the proposed amended complaint is not a compulsory cross-complaint.

The Court also notes that the automatic stay in effect due to ALG's bankruptcy has been lifted, and that the parties have complied with the procedural requirements for a motion for leave to amend. The Court has ordered Plaintiff ALG to separately e-file its operative first amended complaint within five days of this ruling.
