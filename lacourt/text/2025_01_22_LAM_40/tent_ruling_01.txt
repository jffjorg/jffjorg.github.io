[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION FOR DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY’S FEES REGARDING PLAINTIFFS’
MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AND ENTRY OF ORDER
 
I.      
BACKGROUND
      The first amended
complaint filed January 8, 2024, alleges that Plaintiff, Grace Rodriguez, is a
sister and heir of Evangeline Rodriguez (“Decedent”), who was a resident of
Defendant’s skilled nursing facility. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant failed
to establish mandated safety protocols due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a
result, Decedent died on December 17, 2020, after contracting the virus.
Plaintiffs alleged claims for elder abuse, violation of residents’ rights,
negligence, and wrongful death.
      A jury trial
commenced on March 13, 2024. The court declared a mistrial on March 18, 2024,
at Plaintiffs’ oral request. On May 3, 2024, the court determined that
Plaintiffs were entitled to an award of attorney’s fees and costs pursuant Code
Civ. Proc., § 128.5  as a result of defense
counsel’s frivolous and bad faith conduct but deferred determination of the
amount of those sanctions until the conclusion of the matter. (M.O.
5/3/24.)
      On June 10, 2024,
the court entered judgment on special verdict in favor of Defendant with the
amount of costs to be determined. The court updated the judgment on September
3, 2024, and awarded Defendant costs of $120,653.38. 
      The court previously
heard Plaintiffs’ motion on August 13, 2024, but continued the hearing to allow
Plaintiff to submit a supplemental declaration and evidence in support of the
amount of sanctions to be awarded under Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5.
II.    
ARGUMENTS
      Plaintiffs
request an award of sanctions totaling $68,450, for 123 hours spent as a result
of Defendant’s conduct. Plaintiffs contend that the request is warranted given
the highly specialized nature of the claims for elder abuse. 
      In
opposition, Defendant argues that the supplemental declaration was untimely
filed on January 15, 2025, when it was due 10 days prior to this hearing. The
supplemental declaration does not clarify whether the costs and fees were
reasonably incurred. The new table provided by Plaintiffs is not generated by a
billing program. Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that $750 per hour and $350
per hour incurred by counsel are the prevailing market rates. 
      Plaintiffs
did not file a reply brief by January 14, 2025, five court days before the
hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005 subd. (b).) 
III.   
PROCEDURAL FACTS
      The
court previously determined that Plaintiffs met their burden of showing that
Defendant engaged in “frivolous actions or tactics” entitling Plaintiffs to
fees and costs incurred as a result of such conduct. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 128.5 subd. (a); (M.O.
5/3/24.) The court previously heard Plaintiffs’ motion for determination of
fees and costs on August 13, 2024, but continued the hearing as Plaintiffs did
not provide sufficient facts from which the court could exercise its discretion
to determine whether reasonable fees and costs claimed by Plaintiffs could be
attributed to Defendant’s bad faith actions or tactics. Therefore, the court
ordered Plaintiffs' counsel to provide additional evidence, including billing
records and a supplemental declaration to be filed 10 court days before the
hearing. Plaintiffs subsequently moved to continue this hearing, which the
court granted based on the parties’ stipulation. (M.O.
10/8/24.)   
IV.  
LEGAL STANDARDS
      To
determine whether fees are reasonable, the court begins with the lodestar,
which is the number of hours reasonably spent multiplied by the reasonable
hourly rate. (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) The court
considers a number of factors including "the nature of the litigation, its
difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its handling, the
skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and other
circumstances in the case.’” (PLCM
Group at 1096.) The lodestar figure can be adjusted based on the
factors specific to the case. (Id.)
      To
determine a reasonable market rate, "the courts will look to equally
difficult or complex types of litigation.” (Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 700.)
The “market rate” is generally based on the rates prevalent in the community
where the court is located. (Id.) 
      The
court may rely on his or her own experience and is given broad discretion in
calculating reasonable attorney’s fees. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132 ["The experienced trial
judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his
court, and while his judgment is of course subject to review, it will not be
disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.”].)        
V.    
DISCUSSION
      The
court has considered Plaintiffs’ untimely supplemental declaration in favor of the strong policy favoring disposition of
the case on the merits. (Kapitanski
v. Von’s (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d
29, 32). [“Judges are well aware of the unnecessary burdens placed on courts
and counsel when strict compliance with local procedural rules results in the
expenditure of unnecessary time and money for the preparation of later section
473 motions.”]. Defendant has not shown any prejudice resulting from the delay.
Defendant was able to file an opposition to the supplemental declaration, which
the court has considered. 
      Plaintiffs’ counsel, Dawn M. Smith,
requests an hourly rate of $750 per hour based on 23 years of experience,
primarily litigating elder abuse cases and $350 per hour for work performed by
Janine Mitchell, an associate. Both counsel worked on a contingency fee basis.
(Smith decl. ¶¶ 11-13.) The court finds that the rate requested by both counsel
is reasonable in light of the specialized nature of the litigation. 
      The motion for determination filed on July
17, 2024, requested $68,450.00 in fees and $13,086.13 in costs. (Mot.  5:4.) Plaintiffs’ request for costs is
supported by a ledger for travel and hotel room expenses incurred by counsel
and their witnesses until the mistrial. (Mot. 
Ex. ii.) 
      Plaintiffs request fees performed for all
hours expended to prepare for the trial. Plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable
expenses resulting from the bad faith conduct. Here, the two attorneys
representing Plaintiffs were required to duplicate the efforts expended for trial
preparation generally, jury selection, opening statements, reviewing records,
preparing for and examining the first witness, and both counsel’s attendance at
trial, all of which were required to be duplicated upon retrial. 
      The court has reviewed the Smith
declaration and exhibit thereto. The time spent by one managing partner and one
associate attorney appears reasonable.            
      Defendant
takes issue with the table submitted as evidence of fees incurred as it does
not appear to be a billing record. (Concepcion
v. Amscan Holdings, Inc. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1324 ["It is
not necessary to provide detailed billing timesheets to support an award of
attorney fees under the lodestar method.”]. An attorney's testimony as to the number
of hours worked is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees,
even in the absence of detailed time records. (Steiny
& Co., Inc. v. California Electric Supply Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th
285, 293.)
VI.  
CONCLUSION
      Sanctions
pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5 may be imposed on a party, the party’s
attorney, or both. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 128.5. subd. (a). Absent exceptional circumstances, “a law
firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its
partners, associates, and employees." (Code
Civ. Proc., § 128.5 subd. (f)(a)(C).)
      Based
on the foregoing, the court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion and awards sanctions under
Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5 in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant, Paramount
Convalescent Group, Inc., dba Paramount Convalescent Hospital, and its counsel Martin
R. Boags, jointly  and severally, consisting
of $68,450 in attorney’s fees and $13,086.13 in costs, payable to Plaintiffs
within thirty [30] days.
