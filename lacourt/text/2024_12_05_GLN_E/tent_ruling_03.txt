ANALYSIS


Service
16/21
Day Lapse (§ 1005(b)): Uncertain
Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC, Rule 3.1300(c)): No
Correct Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a, § 1013b): Uncertain
On eCourt, a “Hearing on Motion to Dismiss” is on
calendar for 12/5/2024.

As a preliminary matter, this “Hearing on Motion to Dismiss” does not contain a
CRS number (aka Res ID).
Additionally, it is not entirely clear if a motion to
dismiss was ever filed by Movant.
On 11/13/2024, Defendant, Tiffany Fairbanks, filed a
notice of ex parte motion to dismiss.
On 11/14/2024, this Court ruled as following:
The matter is called for hearing. 
Arguments are made by both sides. 
After hearing all oral argument and
reviewing moving papers, the Court rules as follows: 
The Ex Parte Application For an order to
dismiss filed by Tiffany Rose Fairbanks on 11/13/2024 is Denied. 
Hearing on Motion to Dismiss is scheduled
for 12/05/24 at 08:30 AM in Department E at Glendale Courthouse. 
Opposition brief to be filed by 11/21/21. 
Reply brief to be filed by 11/27/24. 
The Court orders the parties to meet and
confer telephonically in the next 3 business days to discuss potential
resolution and potential stipulations. 
On the Court's own motion, the Status
Conference scheduled for 11/18/2024 is advanced to this date and vacated. 
Plaintiff to give notice.
(Min. Order, 11/14/2024.)
It is unclear based on
the 11/14/2024 Minute Order if the notice of ex parte motion to dismiss filed
on 11/13/2024 was intended to serve as the instant moving papers for the motion
to dismiss on hearing for 12/5/2024.
If the ex parte filed on
11/13/2024 is serving as the motion to dismiss on calendar for 12/5/2024, the
Court notes how the 11/13/2024 ex parte motion to dismiss did not contain a
proof of service. Therefore, it is unclear if Movant served Plaintiffs’ counsel
at the proper address, and it’s unclear if Movant complied with the timeliness
requirements of CCP § 1005(b). Further, Movant did not comply with CRC, Rule
3.1300(c) which states, “Proof of service of the moving papers must be filed no
later than five court days before the time appointed for the hearing.” (Id.)
Movant here did not file a proof of service with her 11/13/2024 ex parte motion
to dismiss.
Substantive Analysis
Further,
if the ex parte filed on 11/13/2024 is serving as the motion to dismiss on
calendar for 12/5/2024, the Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to dismiss for the
reasons explained below.
As a preliminary matter,
Defendant’s motion is not the model of clarity and at times is indecipherable.
Movant cites to CCP §
396a(a) which states:
In a case that is subject to Sections
1812.10 and 2984.4 of the Civil Code, or subdivision (b) of Section 395 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, or in an action or proceeding for an unlawful detainer
as defined in Section 1161 of the Code of Civil Procedure:
(a) The plaintiff shall state facts
in the complaint, verified by the plaintiff’s oath, or the oath of the
plaintiff’s attorney, or in an affidavit of the plaintiff or of the plaintiff’s
attorney filed with the complaint, showing that the action has been commenced
in the proper superior court and the proper court location for the trial of the
action or proceeding, and showing that the action is subject to the provisions
of Sections 1812.10 and 2984.4 of the Civil Code or subdivision (b) of Section
395 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or is an action for an unlawful detainer.
When the affidavit is filed with the complaint, a copy thereof shall be served
with the summons. Except as provided in this section, if the complaint or affidavit
is not filed pursuant to this subdivision, no further proceedings may occur in
the action or proceeding, except to dismiss the action or proceeding without
prejudice. However, the court may, on terms that are just, permit the affidavit
to be filed after the filing of the complaint, and a copy of the affidavit
shall be served on the defendant and the time to answer or otherwise plead
shall date from that service.
(CCP § 396a(a).)
Movant points the Court
to 396a(a) because of the portion that states, “…showing that the action has
been commenced in the proper superior court and the proper court location for
the trial of the action or proceeding,…” Movant then argues that Plaintiff did
not file the required statement of facts or affidavit showing that the action
was commenced in the proper court.
Here, Movant’s argument
is unavailing. In the Civil Case Cover Sheet Addendum (filed on eCourt on
6/26/2024) which was served on Plaintiff as indicated in the proof of service
of summons (filed on eCourt on 10/7/2024), Plaintiff’s counsel signed the
Certification of Assignment that stated, “ I certify that this case is properly
filed in the Northeast District of the Superior Court of California, County of
Los Angeles [Code of Civ. Proc., 392 et seq., and LASC Local Rule 2.3(a)(1)(E)].”
Therefore, Plaintiff did
file the required statement of facts.
Local Rule 2.3(a)(1)(C)
Defendant’s
next argument is that under Local Rule 2.31(a)(1)(C) the Pasadena Courthouse,
where this case was initially filed, was the wrong courthouse to file this
action.
Defendant admits that
this rule was revised.
Defendant quotes a
portion of this local rule that states, “An unlimited civil action may not be filed
in the Northeast District.”
In Exhibit 1, Defendant
attaches a copy of this rule that has allegedly now been revised. 
Defendant’s argument
appears to be that the Pasadena Courthouse is in the Northeast District, and
since an unlimited civil action cannot be filed in the Northeast District, the
Pasadena Courthouse was the wrong location.
The Court does not find
Defendant’s argument persuasive as the argument appears to be moot. 
The instant matter is now
in the Glendale Courthouse. According to Defendant’s Exhibit 1, the Glendale
Courthouse is in the North Central District, not the Northeast District.  
Other
As
to the other arguments that Defendant asserted in her motion/ex parte filed on
11/13/2024, the Court does not find those arguments availing as they are either
not on point or indecipherable.
On 11/25/2024, Defendant filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition. This notice mentions that Plaintiff did not file an opposition
brief by November 21, 2024.
While the Court notes that the notice of
non-opposition is accurate in pointing out that Plaintiff did not file an
opposition, Defendant’s Notice of Non-Opposition is otherwise unhelpful. The
Notice of Non-Opposition attacks several issues not before the Court on
Defendant’s motion to dismiss.
Defendant’s notice of non-opposition also states, “Due
to Plaintiff’s failure to submit an opposition brief by the Court-ordered
deadline of November 21, 2024, Defendant intends to file a supplemental brief
in support of the Motion to Dismiss, in lieu of the reply brief initially
ordered by the Court to be submitted by November 27, 2024. This supplemental
brief will address the new grounds for dismissal arising from Plaintiff’s
submission of improperly labeled "joint" trial documents.” (Def. Not.
Non-Oppo. p. 3.)
As to the supplemental brief filed by Defendant on
11/27/2024, the Court does not find the supplemental brief availing. 
The supplemental brief attacks issues not before this
Court on the motion to dismiss. 
In the supplemental brief, Defendant attacks alleged issues
in the trial documents filed by Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff’s trial documents are not at issue in
Defendant’s motion to dismiss.
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant’s
motion to dismiss is DENIED.
