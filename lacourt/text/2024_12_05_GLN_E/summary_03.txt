And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss filed by Defendant Tiffany Rose Fairbanks. The motion is based on Plaintiff Faramarz Bagheri's failure to comply with mandatory requirements under the California Code of Civil Procedure, including sections 396a(a) and 1166(a), and violations of Local Court Rule 2.3(a)(1)(C). The judge notes that the motion is not clear and is indecipherable at times. The judge finds that Plaintiff did file the required statement of facts, and that Defendant's argument that the Pasadena Courthouse was the wrong courthouse is moot since the case is now in the Glendale Courthouse. The judge also finds that Defendant's supplemental brief filed in support of the motion to dismiss is unavailing because it attacks issues not before the court. Therefore, the judge DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss.
