And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Jason Desrouleaux (also known as Jason Derulo), to the first amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Frank Harris. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached a contract, made a promissory estoppel, and committed quantum meruit, and is seeking accounting and declaratory relief.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges definite terms of a contract. The court has also overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action for promissory estoppel, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges detrimental reliance.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action for quantum meruit, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges that the services rendered by the plaintiff were of direct benefit to the defendant.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for accounting, finding that the accounting claim depends on the viability of the claims for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and quantum meruit.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for declaratory relief, finding that the declaratory relief claim is not duplicative of the breach of contract claim.

Overall, the court has found that the plaintiff's claims are sufficient to proceed to trial.
