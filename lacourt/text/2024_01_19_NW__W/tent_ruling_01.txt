FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff alleges Defendants entered
into a written agreement with Plaintiff and that pursuant to that agreement,
Defendants became indebted to Plaintiff for materials and labor it delivered. 
 
On February 25, 2022, Plaintiff CR
Rodas, Inc. filed a second amended complaint against Defendants Varuzh Vic
Avedisian, 14222 Victory, LLC, Holtman Construction Inc., and Angel Martinez
asserting causes of action for breach of contract, common counts, and quantum
meruit. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: GRANT
 
Counsel contends their office has lost all communication with
Plaintiff and/or the owner of the company. As a result, Counsel cannot
effectively perform their duties to represent the legal interests of Plaintiff
in the continuation of this case. The Client has not returned any of Counsel’s
written requests for meetings, documents, etc. Counsel has made several
attempts to meet and discuss with the client only to have the Client cancel
and/or not show up. 
 
Counsel has complied with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362 by
filing forms MC-051 and MC-052 and lodging with the court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053. Counsel confirmed client’s last known mailing
address by telephone within the last 30 days.  
 
The MC-053 form is blank. It should be resubmitted with the
client’s information.  
 
Trial is set for June 24, 2024. Counsel is to warn corporate Plaintiff
that they can only appear through counsel because it is a corporation, and
corporations cannot proceed in pro per.
