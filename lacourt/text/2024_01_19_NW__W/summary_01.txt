Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Brenda E. Vargas, Esq., Counsel for Plaintiff CR Rodas, Inc. The Judge finds that the Counsel has lost all communication with the Plaintiff and/or the owner of the company, making it impossible for the Counsel to effectively represent the legal interests of the Plaintiff. The Counsel has attempted to meet with the Client, but the Client has not responded to the Counsel's requests. The Judge notes that the Counsel has complied with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362 and has filed the required forms. The Judge sets the trial for June 24, 2024 and warns the corporate Plaintiff that it can only appear through counsel.
