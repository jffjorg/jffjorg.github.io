And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motions to set aside the order deeming their requests for admissions admitted. The judge finds that the defendants' failure to respond to the requests was due to excusable neglect, as they were hard of hearing, spoke poor English, and required translation. The judge also grants the defendants' motion to withdraw their admissions, but conditions the granting of the motion on the defendants paying $8,000 in attorney fees to the plaintiff.

The plaintiff's motions for order compelling responses of the defendants to the plaintiff's first set of requests for production of documents and form interrogatories are moot, as the defendants have already served their responses.

The judge grants the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendants in the amount of $1,305.00.
