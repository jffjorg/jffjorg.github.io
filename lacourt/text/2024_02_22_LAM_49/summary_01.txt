And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied General Motors' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in this lemon law action. The plaintiffs, Cynthia Rios and Brittney Rios, brought a claim against General Motors for breach of implied warranty and breach of express warranty, alleging that their leased vehicle had transmission defects and was not fit for its ordinary purpose.

The judge found that the plaintiffs had established a triable issue on the point of whether the vehicle was fit for its ordinary purpose, and therefore denied General Motors' motion for summary adjudication of the first cause of action. The judge also denied General Motors' motion for summary adjudication of the second cause of action, finding that the plaintiffs had established a triable issue on the point of whether General Motors failed to repair the transmission defects after a reasonable number of attempts.

The judge noted that the parties' lease agreement and warranty did not contain language that would negate the express warranty, and therefore General Motors' argument that the plaintiffs' excess mileage voided the warranty was not persuasive. The judge also found that the plaintiffs had established a triable issue on the point of whether General Motors failed to repair the transmission defects after a reasonable number of attempts.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to submission and may be modified or overturned at the hearing scheduled for February 22, 2024.
