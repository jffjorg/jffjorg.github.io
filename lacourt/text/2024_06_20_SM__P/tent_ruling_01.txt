Carla, LLC v. Schwarz, et al., Case No. 23SMCV02101
Hearing
date June 20, 2024
Defendant
Schwarz’s Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment
Defendant
Glidden’s Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment
 
Plaintiff
landlord sued defendants Schwarz and Glidden for past due rent in this unlawful
detainer claim. Defendants did not file responsive pleadings, and defaults were
entered. On 8/28/23 the court entered default judgment for $106,766.52. Schwarz
and Glidden separately move to set aside the default judgment, pursuant to Code
Civ. Proc. §473. 
 
Proofs
of service filed 6/7/23 state registered process server Alexis Alpisa
substitute served the summons and complaint to “JANE DOE (Gender: F Age: 30
Height: 5'7'' Weight: 140 Race: DARK Hair: BROWN Other: ) CO OCCUPANT” on
5/20/23 at 9:28AM. Copies were mailed to the property address. 
 
The
proof of service is attested to by a registered process server, creating a
rebuttable presumption of service. Cal. Evid. Code §647; American Express
Centurion Bank v. Zara¿(2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390. The party seeking
to defeat service of process must present sufficient evidence to show that the
service did not take place as stated. Palm Property Investments, LLC v.
Yadegar¿(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1428.
 
Unless
inexcusable neglect is clear, the policy favoring trial on the merits prevails
over the general rule of deference to the trial court's exercise of discretion,
and doubts are resolved in favor of the application for relief from default. Tunis
v. Barrow (1986) 184 Cal. App. 3d 1069, 1079.
 
Glidden’s Motion
Glidden’s motion is accompanied by a proposed answer. Glidden
states he did not reside at the property at any point from 10/10/22 to 4/20/25.
Glidden Decl. ¶¶2-3. He was never served with notice of default judgment and
only learned through a notice of foreign judgment in December of 2023. Glidden
Decl. ¶7. 
 
Relief is proper
under Code of Civ. Proc. §473.5. Defendant moved to set aside within the time
limit set forth in §473.5. The court is presented with contradictory
declarations regarding service. Given the strong public policy in favor of
resolving matters on the merits, rather than through default, without any basis
for judging the credibility of the declarants, the court will err on the side
of deciding this matter on the merits rather than via default. GRANTED. The
answer is to be filed within 5 court days.
 
Schwarz’s Motion
On 4/15/24 Schwarz
filed a motion to set aside, not accompanied by a
proposed answer. Schwarz stated she was served by
a sheriff 6/30/23 with a Writ of Execution for “POSSESSION ONLY” which did not
make references as to monies owed. Schwarz Decl. ¶6. Schwarz did not
realize plaintiff entered default until she received a text from Glidden on
12/18/23. Schwarz Supp. Decl. ¶10, Exh. E. Schwarz argues she was never
effectively served and had no notice, as she was in Cannes, France between
5/14/23-5/23/23 and had no co-occupants. Schwarz Decl. ¶5. Schwarz claims to be
unaware of anyone matching the description given of Jane Doe and states she did
not receive notice via mail. Id.
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel argues email and phone communication with Schwartz from 5/26/23 to
8/3/23 indicate she was aware of the suit. However, the emails presented threaten
suit should defendants fail to make payments but did not explicitly state suit
had been filed, so do not clearly put defendant on notice of an existing
lawsuit. 
 
Relief
is proper under Code of Civ. Proc. §473.5. Defendant moved to set aside within
the time limit set forth in §473.5. As above, given the contradictory
declarations regarding service, the court defers to the strong public policy in
favor of resolving matters on the merits, rather than through default. GRANTED
contingent upon filing a proposed answer within 5 court days.
