Summary in English:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions to set aside a default judgment in an unlawful detainer case. The plaintiff, Carla, LLC, sued the defendants, Schwarz and Glidden, for unpaid rent. The defendants did not respond, and a default judgment was entered for $106,766.52. The judge granted both motions, finding that the service of process was not properly served. The judge relies on the strong public policy favoring trial on the merits rather than through default. The judge also notes that the credibility of the declarants is not a factor in making this decision. The defendants are required to file a proposed answer within 5 court days.
