And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrers filed by ROAR Management Company, Inc. and 11 Funding, LLC to the third amended complaint filed by Allstate Insurance Company. The demurrers argue that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action against the defendants. The court finds that the demurrers are without merit and overrules them.

The complaint alleges that the defendants carried out a scheme to defraud insurance companies by submitting fraudulent claims. The court finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action against ROAR under the California False Claims Act and against 11 Funding Defendants under the same act. The court also finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action under the Unfair Competition Law against both ROAR and 11 Funding Defendants.

The court notes that the defendants had an opportunity to meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing their demurrers, but were unable to resolve the issues through this process. The court will consider the instant demurrers and will issue a final ruling after reviewing the parties' arguments.
