**Significant Statements**:
- "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem)
- "Plaintiff had been delinquent in her written discovery responses. This Court has twice continued Plaintiff's motion for trial preference and granted Defendant's unopposed motions to compel responses to Defendant's Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One)."
