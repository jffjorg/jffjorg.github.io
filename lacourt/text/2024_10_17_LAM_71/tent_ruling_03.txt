Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“CSMC”) (“Defendant”) moves
for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Markella Thanou (“Thanou”) (“Plaintiff”) on the
grounds Plaintiff has failed to comply with this Court’s orders on July 17,
2024, and August 5, 2024.  (Notice of Terminating, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§2023.030,
2030.010 et seq., 2031.010 et seq.)  
Plaintiff moves for an order granting her trial preference.  (Notice Trial Preference, pg. 1; C.C.P. §§
36(a), (c), (e), (f); CRC, Rule 3.1335.)
 
Procedural History
Plaintiff filed her initial Complaint in pro per on October
25, 2022, alleging three causes of action against Defendant for (1) wrongful
death, (2) professional negligence, and (3) general negligence.
On October 26, 2023, this Court dismissed the Complaint without
prejudice pursuant to C.C.P. §583.150.
On October 27, 2023, attorney Kingsley Opia-Enwemuche (“Opia-Enwemuche”)
substituted in as counsel of record for Plaintiff.  Thereafter, Opia-Enwemuche filed a motion to
set aside and vacate the dismissal pursuant to C.C.P. §473.
On March 6, 2024, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to set
aside/vacate the dismissal as to Plaintiff. 
(3/6/24 Minute Order.)

causes of action against Defendant: (1) wrongful death and survival action
sounding in professional negligence; (2) professional negligence; and (3) loss
of consortium.

October 7, 2024.  Defendant filed its
reply on October 10, 2024.  Defendant
objects to Plaintiff’s opposition as untimely. 
The Court, in its discretion, will consider Plaintiff’s late opposition.
Plaintiff filed her motion for trial preference on April 15,
2024.  Defendant filed its opposition to
the motion for trial preference on May 6, 2024. 
As of the date of this hearing no reply has been filed.
 
A.  
Defendant’s Motion for Terminating
Sanctions
Legal Standard
The Court, “after notice to any affected party . . . and after
opportunity for hearing,” may impose terminating and/or monetary sanctions for
misuses of the discovery process. 
(C.C.P. §2023.030(a), (d).) 
Misuses of the discovery process include failing to respond or to submit
to an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.  (C.C.P. §§2023.010(d),
(g).)  
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made
lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and
the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.”  (Mileikowsky v. Tenet
Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)  When deciding whether to impose terminating sanctions,
courts generally weigh three factors: (1) whether the party subject to the
sanction acted willfully, (2) the detriment to the party seeking discovery, and
(3) the number of formal and informal unsuccessful attempts to obtain
discovery.  (Creed-21 v. City of
Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  Nonmonetary
sanctions require evidence of willful violations of discovery orders or a history
of egregious abuses of discovery.  (R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486.)  A prerequisite to the imposition of
nonmonetary sanctions is willful disobedience of a court order.  (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403.)  By
requiring a violation of a discovery order before imposing nonmonetary
sanctions, California courts can be sure that the offending party does not
intend to comply with the discovery request.  (Ruvalcaba v. Government Employees Insurance
Co. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1579, 1581.) 
“[A] terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a
monetary discovery sanction is never justified.”  (Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 615.)
 
Terminating Sanctions
Defendant moves for terminating sanctions on the grounds Plaintiff
has willfully disobeyed this Court’s 7/17/24 and 8/5/24 Orders.  (Motion, pg. 3.)  Here, terminating sanctions are not appropriate
because there is no evidence before the Court that less severe sanctions would
not produce compliance with the discovery rules.  
First, although this Court ordered Amelia Thanou, a “Plaintiff
controlled witness,” to appear for a deposition, she is not a party and the
motion to compel her deposition refers to her as to a non-party.  (See 7/17/24 Minute Order.)  Further, Defendant cites no legal authority
authorizing this Court to grant sanctions against Plaintiff for the inaction of
a non-party.  (See Motion, pg. 3.)  
Second, Defendant’s motion indicates that Plaintiff attempted to
comply with this Court’s 7/17/24 Order by appearing for her deposition, but
“she was in no condition to provide deposition testimony and the deposition was
suspended” due to her health.  (Motion,
pg. 3.)  Therefore, Plaintiff did not willfully
fail to attend the deposition in violation of this Court’s 7/17/24 Order.
Plaintiff had been delinquent in her written discovery responses.  This Court has twice continued Plaintiff’s
motion for trial preference and granted Defendant’s unopposed motions to compel
responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set One) (“FROG”) and Special
Interrogatories (Set One) (“SROG”). 
(8/5/24 Minute Order.)  Plaintiff’s
opposition did not provide any reasons for her continued failure to provide
discovery responses in violation of this Court’s August 5, 2024, Order, but on
October 14, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration attached to which was
an unauthenticated letter from a Dr. Pauline Yi in which Dr. Yi states that Plaintiff
is on medication which makes her drowsy. 
Dr. Yi goes on to state that she has adjusted the dosage of the
medication to improve Plaintiff’s side-effects. 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration goes on to state that he has provided
Code-compliant responses to all of Defendant’s written discovery.  
In light of the delivery of verified discovery responses, the Court
denies Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions.
.         
 
Monetary Sanctions
In addition to or in lieu
of any other sanction, the court may order the disobedient party or counsel
responsible or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney fees,
incurred as a result of the failure to obey (including fees on the sanctions
motion).  (C.C.P. §2023.030(a).)
Here, monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff are appropriate because until just recently, Plaintiff failed
to provide documents responsive to Defendant’s written discovery. Such a
sanction is necessary to remedy Plaintiff’s actions and level the playing field
for trial, particularly in light of the proximity to trial based on Plaintiff’s
motion for trial preference.
Defendant requests
monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,470.00 against Plaintiff for attorneys’ fees in connection with the
preparation, filing, and service of the instant motion.  Defendant’s counsel declares his hourly rate
is $200.00/hour, and that counsel spent 3.4 hours in preparation of this motion
and anticipates an additional three hours analyzing an opposition, preparing a
reply, and attending a hearing on the motion. 
(Decl. of Moulin ¶40.)  The Court
determines Defendant’s counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable based on the
experience of the Court.  Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions is granted in the amount of $1,340.00,
calculated as follows:
($200.00/hour x 6.4 hours) + $60 filing fee = $1,340.00
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion for monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff and her counsel of record, jointly and severally, is granted pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.030, 2030.290(c), and 2031.300(c) in
the amount of $1,340.00.  Sanctions are
payable within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
          Defendant’s
motion for terminating sanctions is denied.
          Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff and her counsel of record, jointly and severally, is granted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290(c) and
2031.300(c) in
the amount of $1,340.00.  Sanctions are payable within 20 days.
 
B.   
Plaintiff’s Motion for Trial Preference
Legal
Standard
Parties
who are 70 years of age or older (or who reach that age during pendency of the
action) may be entitled to preference if they establish to the court’s
satisfaction that: (1) they have a “substantial interest in the action as a
whole”; and (2) their health is “such that a preference is necessary to prevent
prejudicing the party’s interest in the litigation.”  (C.C.P. §36(a), (c)(2).)
The
preference motion must be supported by a “declaration of the moving party” (or
presumably, the moving party’s attorney) “that all essential parties have been
served with process or have appeared.”  (C.C.P.
§36(c)(1).)
Trial
priority is not mandatory and absolute merely because one of the parties is age
70. The court has discretion to determine the extent of that party’s interest
and find as a matter of fact the risk posed of that party’s death or incapacity
if trial is delayed.  (C.C.P. § 36(a).)
 
Discussion
          Plaintiff’s motion and supporting
declaration demonstrates Plaintiff is entitled to a motion for trial
preference.  Plaintiff’s supplementary
declaration submits admissible evidence from her medical provider stating that
she is currently 94 years old. 
(Supp.-Decl. of Thanou ¶6, Exh. A.)
Plaintiff’s
attorney declares she is currently in ill health as she suffers numerous
illnesses such as congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease,
Hypertension, has a pacemaker, has Hyperlipidemia, and suffers from Atrial
fibrillation, for which she is currently on various medications.  (Decl. of Opia-Enwemuche ¶6.)  Plaintiff’s attorney declares on information
and belief that Plaintiff has a grave heart ailment and now has Cirrhosis of
the liver, due to her heart failure. 
(Decl. of Opia-Enwemuche ¶8.) 
Plaintiff’s attorney’s evidence supporting these facts would
sufficiently supplement admissible evidence of Plaintiff’s advanced age.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion for trial preference is granted.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion for trial preference is granted.
Moving
party to give notice.
