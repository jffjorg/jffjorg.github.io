## English Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by William S. Collins, attorney for Plaintiff Hares Fazli, to be relieved as counsel in the case. 

The Judge finds that Mr. Collins has complied with the legal requirements for filing this motion.  

The Judge's reasoning for granting the motion is based on Mr. Collins' statement that a conflict of interest has developed, preventing him from effectively representing Mr. Fazli.  

Specifically, Mr. Collins states that a conflict arose between him and Mr. Fazli, and that Mr. Fazli made statements against his attorney, creating an insurmountable obstacle to continuing representation. 

The Judge notes that unless there is evidence of prejudice to Mr. Fazli, the attorney's request to withdraw should be granted. 



The motion is granted, and Mr. Collins will be relieved as counsel once proper service of the order is completed.
