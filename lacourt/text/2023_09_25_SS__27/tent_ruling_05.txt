[1] The Court also notes that
Plaintiff has filed a “Response to Additional Interrogatories, Set One.  It is not clear whether Plaintiff’s filing is
meant to be responsive to the discovery requests that are the subject of this
motion.  If so, it is likewise unclear
whether Plaintiff has properly served those responses.  The Court will hear from the parties on this
issue.
