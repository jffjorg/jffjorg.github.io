PETITION
TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
Adalberto Rivas, Jr.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            Claimant,
Mayan Rivas, a minor, by and through her parent and guardian ad litem,
Petitioner Adalberto Rivas, Jr., has agreed to settle her claims against Defendant,
East Whittier School District, in exchange for a lump sum of $15,000.
 
            The
Petition was reviewed on September 6, 2023. 
The Court found the settlement fair and reasonable, as was the request
for attorney’s fees.  However, the
Petition could not be approved because (1) Petitioner did not include page 5 of
the Petition; (2) Items 5 and 6 of Form MC-351 were not completed; and (3) Item
2 of Form MC-355 was not completed.
 
            On
September 7, 2023, Petitioner filed an amended Petition.  If approved, $441.23 will be used for medical
expenses, $5,550 will be used for attorney’s fees, and $3,384.84 will be used
for other expenses, leaving a balance of $5,623.92 for Claimant to be deposited
at Credit Union of Southern California in Whittier, California, subject to
withdrawal only on authorization of the court.
 
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            Petitioner
has cured the defects noted in the Court’s previous order.  
 
            Accordingly, the Petition is GRANTED.  The Court sets an OSC Re: Proof of Deposit
for November 27, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.953,
subd. (a).)  If an acknowledgement of receipt by the financial institution
is filed before that date, no appearance will be required. 
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
