And here is the summary in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the defendant, City of Long Beach. The motions seek to file an amended Answer and an amended Cross-Complaint. The plaintiff, Edwin Sargenti, opposes the motions.

The judge grants the motion for leave to file an amended Answer, allowing the City to add affirmative defenses, including immunity defenses under the Government Code and contractual defenses based on the User Agreement between the plaintiff and Lime. The judge finds that the City has not shown a sufficient reason for the delay in seeking to amend its Answer, but concludes that the plaintiff will not suffer prejudice as a result.

The judge also grants the motion for leave to amend the Cross-Complaint, allowing the City to substitute ASM Global and Grand Prix Association of Long Beach as cross-defendants. The judge finds that the City has shown a reasonable excuse for the delay in seeking to amend its Cross-Complaint and that the plaintiff will not suffer prejudice as a result.

The judge orders that the City file its proposed amended Answer and Cross-Complaint within 5 court days of the order.

**Defendant/Cross-Complainant:** City of Long Beach

**Facts:**

*  The City initially filed an Answer to the complaint and a Cross-Complaint against unnamed parties (Roes 1-30).

**Issues:**

* The City is seeking leave to amend its Answer and Cross-Complaint.
* The proposed amendments include:
    * Adding affirmative defenses, including government immunity and contractual defenses based on the Lime scooter user agreement.
    * Substituting ASM Global and the Grand Prix Association of Long Beach as defendants in the Cross-Complaint.

**Arguments:**

* **City's Arguments:**
    *  The City claims they recently learned about ASM Global and the Grand Prix Association's potential liability. They argue they need to amend the Cross-Complaint to accurately reflect the situation. 
    * They also argue the delay in adding affirmative defenses in the Answer was due to new counsel needing time to review the case.
* **Plaintiff's Arguments:**
    * Plaintiff argues the City has been aware of ASM Global and the Grand Prix Association's potential liability since the beginning of the case and unreasonably delayed amending the Cross-Complaint.
    * He contends the City's proposed amendments will prejudice him by requiring additional discovery and delaying trial.

**Ruling:**

* The Judge granted the City's motion for leave to amend both the Answer and the Cross-Complaint.
* The Judge found that the liberal policy of allowing amendments prior to trial outweighs the Plaintiff's arguments about prejudice.

**Significant Statements:**

* The Judge recognized the importance of adjudicating cases on their merits, and the policy of liberally granting amendments.
* The Judge found that the Plaintiff did not sufficiently demonstrate prejudice from the City's proposed amendments.
