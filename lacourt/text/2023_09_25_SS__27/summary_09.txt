And here is the summary in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the defendant, City of Long Beach. The motions seek to file an amended Answer and an amended Cross-Complaint. The plaintiff, Edwin Sargenti, opposes the motions.

The judge grants the motion for leave to file an amended Answer, allowing the City to add affirmative defenses, including immunity defenses under the Government Code and contractual defenses based on the User Agreement between the plaintiff and Lime. The judge finds that the City has not shown a sufficient reason for the delay in seeking to amend its Answer, but concludes that the plaintiff will not suffer prejudice as a result.

The judge also grants the motion for leave to amend the Cross-Complaint, allowing the City to substitute ASM Global and Grand Prix Association of Long Beach as cross-defendants. The judge finds that the City has shown a reasonable excuse for the delay in seeking to amend its Cross-Complaint and that the plaintiff will not suffer prejudice as a result.

The judge orders that the City file its proposed amended Answer and Cross-Complaint within 5 court days of the order.
