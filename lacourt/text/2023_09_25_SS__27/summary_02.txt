The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the case brought by the plaintiff against the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for negligence and premises liability. The plaintiff dismissed other defendants in March and April 2021. The Judge notes that LAUSD is a public entity, and therefore, common law causes of action cannot be asserted against it. Instead, liability must be based on statute, specifically Government Code section 835. The Judge determines that the issue is one of notice, and that the plaintiff does not challenge LAUSD's contention that the alleged dangerous condition was not created by a wrongful act or omission of an LAUSD employee. The Judge declines to address other factors that may have impacted the timing of inspections, such as the length of the inspection and how it was performed.

## English Summary

The judge is considering a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for negligence and premises liability. The plaintiff claims they were injured at a location where LAUSD has property. LAUSD argues that as a public entity, they are only liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of public property if it meets specific requirements under Government Code section 835.

The judge notes that the central issue is whether LAUSD had notice of a dangerous condition on the property. LAUSD claims that any dangerous condition was not caused by its employees. While the court doesn't need to decide this point, it emphasizes that the focus remains on notice. The judge also mentions factors that might influence the determination of whether LAUSD's inspection schedule was reasonable, such as the traffic level and the nature of the inspection itself. However, based on the information provided, the judge doesn't need to delve into these details further.

And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion for summary judgment by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in a lawsuit filed by an unnamed plaintiff. The plaintiff claims LAUSD was negligent and failed to maintain a safe premises, leading to an incident on the premises. LAUSD argues that as a public entity, it is not liable under common law and that any liability must be based on statute. The Judge agrees, citing Government Code section 835, which sets out the exclusive conditions under which a public entity is liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of public property. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff does not challenge LAUSD's contention that the alleged dangerous condition was not created by a wrongful act or omission. The Judge will need to consider the timing and frequency of inspections, as well as other factors, to determine whether LAUSD provided adequate notice of the alleged dangerous condition.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the Plaintiff is suing the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for negligence and premises liability. The Plaintiff had also named other defendants, but they were dismissed in March and April 2021. The Judge notes that LAUSD is a public entity and that common law causes of action cannot be asserted against it. Instead, liability must be based on statute, specifically Government Code section 835. The Judge also notes that the issue is one of notice, and that LAUSD contends that it did not have notice of the alleged dangerous condition. The Judge does not need to address the issue of whether the alleged dangerous condition was created by a wrongful act or omission of an LAUSD employee, as the Plaintiff does not challenge this contention. The Judge also notes that various factors may calibrate the timing of inspections, such as heavily trafficked areas where slippery substances may be present. Ultimately, the Judge's tentative ruling suggests that LAUSD may not be liable for the incident due to lack of notice.
