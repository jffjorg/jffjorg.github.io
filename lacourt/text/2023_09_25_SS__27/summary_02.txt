The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the case brought by the plaintiff against the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for negligence and premises liability. The plaintiff dismissed other defendants in March and April 2021. The Judge notes that LAUSD is a public entity, and therefore, common law causes of action cannot be asserted against it.

## English Summary

The judge is considering a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for negligence and premises liability. The plaintiff claims they were injured at a location where LAUSD has property. LAUSD argues that as a public entity, they are only liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of public property if it meets specific requirements under Government Code section 835.

The judge notes that the central issue is whether LAUSD had notice of a dangerous condition on the property. LAUSD claims that any dangerous condition was not caused by its employees. While the court doesn't need to decide this point, it emphasizes that the focus remains on notice. The judge also mentions factors that might influence the determination of whether LAUSD's inspection schedule was reasonable, such as the traffic level and the nature of the inspection itself. However, based on the information provided, the judge doesn't need to delve into these details further.

The Judge is considering a motion for summary judgment by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in a lawsuit filed by an unnamed plaintiff. The plaintiff claims LAUSD was negligent and failed to maintain a safe premises, leading to an incident on the premises. LAUSD argues that as a public entity, it is not liable under common law and that any liability must be based on statute. The Judge agrees, citing Government Code section 835, which sets out the exclusive conditions under which a public entity is liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of public property. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff does not challenge LAUSD's contention that the alleged dangerous condition was not created by a wrongful act or omission. The Judge will need to consider the timing and frequency of inspections, as well as other factors, to determine whether LAUSD provided adequate notice of the alleged dangerous condition.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the Plaintiff is suing the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for negligence and premises liability. The Plaintiff had also named other defendants, but they were dismissed in March and April 2021. The Judge notes that LAUSD is a public entity and that common law causes of action cannot be asserted against it. Instead, liability must be based on statute, specifically Government Code section 835. The Judge also notes that the issue is one of notice, and that LAUSD contends that it did not have notice of the alleged dangerous condition. The Judge does not need to address the issue of whether the alleged dangerous condition was created by a wrongful act or omission of an LAUSD employee, as the Plaintiff does not challenge this contention. The Judge also notes that various factors may calibrate the timing of inspections, such as heavily trafficked areas where slippery substances may be present. Ultimately, the Judge's tentative ruling suggests that LAUSD may not be liable for the incident due to lack of notice.

This is a tentative ruling on a summary judgment motion filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The plaintiff is seeking to hold LAUSD liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition on the premises. The court has reviewed the evidence and determined that LAUSD is a public entity and cannot be held liable under common law causes of action. Instead, the court must consider whether LAUSD is liable under Government Code section 835, which sets out the exclusive conditions under which a public entity is liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of public property. The court has also considered the timing of inspections and the presence of slippery substances on the premises, but has determined that these issues are not relevant to the case.

### English Text Summary
The judge's tentative ruling discusses the plaintiff's opposition to the Los Angeles Unified School District's (LAUSD) motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff's causes of action for negligence and premises liability against LAUSD are based on an incident that occurred at the premises. However, LAUSD is a public entity, and common law causes of action cannot be asserted against it. Instead, liability must be based on statute, specifically Government Code section 835. The court must determine whether LAUSD had notice of the alleged dangerous condition and whether it failed to take reasonable steps to remedy it. The judge notes that various factors, such as the frequency of inspections and the length of the inspection, may be relevant in determining the reasonableness of an inspection. Ultimately, the court must decide whether there is a material fact for a reasonable trier of fact to find, and whether LAUSD has met its burden of persuasion.

- LAUSD is not liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of public property unless it is based on statute, specifically Government Code section 835.
- The issue is one of notice, not whether the alleged dangerous condition was created by a wrongful act or omission of an LAUSD employee.
- Heavily trafficked areas where slippery substances may be present require more frequent inspections and attention from the property owner.
- Other variables, such as the length of the inspection and how it was performed, may be considered when determining the reasonableness of an inspection.
