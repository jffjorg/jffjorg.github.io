And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the case brought by the plaintiff against the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for negligence and premises liability. The plaintiff dismissed other defendants in March and April 2021. The Judge notes that LAUSD is a public entity, and therefore, common law causes of action cannot be asserted against it. Instead, liability must be based on statute, specifically Government Code section 835. The Judge determines that the issue is one of notice, and that the plaintiff does not challenge LAUSD's contention that the alleged dangerous condition was not created by a wrongful act or omission of an LAUSD employee. The Judge declines to address other factors that may have impacted the timing of inspections, such as the length of the inspection and how it was performed.
