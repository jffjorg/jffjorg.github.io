And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to consolidate the related actions of Bertha Lidai Rapalo Rivera and Jesus Soto. The consolidated actions arise from a three-vehicle collision allegedly caused by Victor Hugo Cardona, who was driving a semi-truck owned by Oscar Misael Viera. The Judge found that the cases involve common questions of law and fact and that the motion is in proper form. The Judge granted the motion to consolidate the cases, despite Soto's opposition, which argued that consolidation would double the costs and discovery efforts. The Judge rejected Soto's argument, stating that there is no double costs or discovery efforts when Soto is not a party to the Rivera action. The Judge also found that defendants would be prejudiced by not consolidating the cases.
