And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motions to compel verified responses to discovery are continued to October 27, 2023 at 1:30 PM. The defendant had originally filed the motions on February 14, 2023, but the plaintiff was not served with notice of the motions until after the hearing date. The judge found that the motions were procedurally defective and continued them to allow the defendant to serve the plaintiff with notice by non-electronic means. However, the defendant has not yet filed proof of service, so the motions are being continued again. The judge warns that failure to comply with the order may result in sanctions and denial of the motions.
