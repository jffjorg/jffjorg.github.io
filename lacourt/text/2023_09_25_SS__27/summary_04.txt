The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motions to compel verified responses to discovery are continued to October 27, 2023 at 1:30 PM. The defendant had originally filed the motions on February 14, 2023, but the plaintiff was not served with notice of the motions until after the hearing date. The judge found that the motions were procedurally defective and continued them to allow the defendant to serve the plaintiff with notice by non-electronic means. However, the defendant has not yet filed proof of service, so the motions are being continued again. The judge warns that failure to comply with the order may result in sanctions and denial of the motions.

## English Text Summary

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger regarding a motion to compel discovery filed by Defendant Universal Protection Service LP against Plaintiff Richard Harris. The motion, filed on February 14, 2023, seeks to compel Harris to respond to discovery requests, and also asks for sanctions against him. 

The Court initially identified procedural issues with the motion, as Plaintiff Harris, who represents himself, was not properly served with the original motion. The Court continued the hearing to allow Defendant to properly serve Harris. However, despite this, Defendant has not provided proof of proper service.  Therefore, the Court further continues the hearing to October 27, 2023, requiring Defendant to file proof of service by that date. Failure to comply may result in sanctions and dismissal of the motion.

Universal Protection Service LP wants the court to force Mr. Harris to answer discovery requests, and they are also asking for penalties against him.

Universal Protection Service LP must file proof of service by a specific deadline. If they fail to do so, the judge may penalize them and deny their motions.
