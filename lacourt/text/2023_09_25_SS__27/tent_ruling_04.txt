MOTIONS
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY
      


 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Universal Protection Service LP
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
            On February
14, 2023, Defendant, Universal Protection Service LP, filed these motions to
compel verified responses to Set One of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,
and Request for Production of Documents from Plaintiff, Richrd Harris. Defendant
seeks sanctions against Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff is self-represented.
                                                     
            The motions
were heard on August 24, 2023.  The Court
found that the motions were procedurally defective because the proofs of
service indicated Plaintiff, in pro per, was not served with these motions pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 2.551, subdivision (c)(3)(B).  The Court continued the motions to allow Defendant
to serve Plaintiff with notice of these motions by non-electronic means.  
 
            The Court
notes that Defendant has not filed any proof of service or other document
indicating that Plaintiff has now been served with these motions by
non-electronic means.[1]  As such, the motions are CONTINUED to October
27, 2023 at 1:30 PM.  Defendant is to
file proof of service of these motions by non-electronic means no later than 5
court days before the rescheduled hearing. 
Failure to comply with the Court’s order may result in sanctions and
denial of the motions.
 
Moving party to give notice.
