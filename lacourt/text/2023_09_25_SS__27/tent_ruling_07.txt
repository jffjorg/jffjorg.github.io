MOTION
TO CONSOLIDATE ACTIONS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Oscar Viera and Victor Cardona
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Jesus
Soto
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
This action arises from a three-vehicle collision allegedly
caused by Victor Hugo Cardona (“Cardona”) and involving Bertha Lidia Rapalo
Rivera (“Rivera”) and Jesus Soto (“Soto”).  On  May 1, 2019, Cardona was driving a semi-truck
purportedly owned by Oscar Misael Viera dba OMD Trucking (“Viera”).  All
parties were traveling on the freeway. 
Soto was in the far left lane and Rivera was in the lane to Soto’s
right.  Cardona allegedly made an unsafe
lane change, forcing Rivera to veer left into Soto’s lane and collide with Soto.
 Rivera and Soto each filed separate
actions (Case Nos. 20STCV49058 and 21STCV12703).  On July 18, 2023, the Court found these cases
ruled were related.  Case No.
20STCV49058, filed by Rivera, was deemed the lead case.
 
On June 15, 2023, Viera and Cardona (hereafter,
“Defendants”) filed this motion to consolidate Case Nos. 20STCV49058 and
21STCV12703.  Soto opposes[1]
and Defendants reply.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 1048 states, in pertinent part: “When actions involving
a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).)  
 
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.350 provides, “[a] notice
of motion to consolidate must: (A) [l]ist all named parties in each case, the
names of those who have appeared, and the names of their respective attorneys
of record; (B) [c]ontain the captions of all the cases sought to be
consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first; and (C) [b]e filed in
each case sought to be consolidated.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.350, subd. (a)(1).)  Rule 3.350 further provides, “[t]he motion to
consolidate: (A) [i]s deemed a single motion for the purposes of determining
the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums, declarations, and other supporting
papers must be filed only in the lowest numbered case; (B) [m]ust be served on
all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated; and (C) [m]ust have a proof of service filed as part
of the motion.”  (Id., rule 3.350,
subd. (a)(2).)  
 
Further, Los Angeles County Court Rules, Rule 3.3, subd. (g)
states, “[c]ases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same
department.  A motion to consolidate two
or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the
cases were already assigned to that department.”  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule
3.3, subd. (g).)
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Defendants’
motion is in proper form.  Defendants
provide the information as required under California Rules of Court, rule 3.350.  (See Notice of Motion, pp. i and ii.)  Additionally, the cases to be consolidated
have been related into a single department (Department 27).  Moreover, both actions undoubtedly involve
common questions of law and fact.  There
is no dispute the related actions arise from the same event.  
 
            Nevertheless,
Soto opposes consolidation of the related actions.  He argues Defendants improperly seek to
reopen discovery.[2]  Soto’s argument lacks merit.  There is nothing in Defendants’ motion for
consolidation to suggest Defendants are seeking to reopen discovery.   Soto also argues without support that it
would be highly prejudicial if the cases were consolidated because “[d]oing so
would double the costs and discovery efforts that Plaintiff Soto already
diligently completed.”  (Opposition, p.
2:8-10.)  As Defendants point out, there
is no double costs or discovery efforts when Soto is not a party to the Rivera
action. More, Defendants would have to present the same case involving the same
facts and same witnesses if the related cases are not consolidated.  Defendants, and not Soto, would be prejudiced
by not consolidating these cases.
 
            Accordingly,
the motion to consolidated is GRANTED.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
The motion to consolidate is granted.
 
Moving party to give notice.
