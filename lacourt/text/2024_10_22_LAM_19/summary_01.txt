The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case with the number BC681863. The case involves Defendant City of Los Angeles and Defendant Soil Engineering Construction, Inc. The Judge has granted both defendants' motions to file a permissive cross-complaint. The proposed cross-complaints arise out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the cause brought against the defendants. The Judge finds that granting leave to file the proposed cross-complaints is in the interest of justice and will avoid circuity of action and duplication of time and effort.

The Judge orders that the first page of the proposed cross-complaint does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 2.111, because it does not state the name of each party. Defendant City of Los Angeles is ordered to correct this error and file the Cross-Complaint within five (5) court days. Defendant Soil Engineering Construction, Inc. is ordered to formally file the proposed cross-complaint within five (5) court days.
