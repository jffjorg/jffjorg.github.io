 Case Number:  23STCV28097    Hearing Date:   June 20, 2024    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  YU ZHENG CHEN, Plaintiff,vs. BRADLEY P. CHILDERS, et al.,Defendants.  Case No.:  23STCV28097 Hearing Date:  June 20, 2024  [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: DEFENDANT BRADLEY P. CHILDERS’ DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT Defendant Childers’ demurrer is SUSTAINED. Plaintiff must be prepared to address the issue of leave to amend.Moving party to provide notice.FACTUAL BACKGROUNDThis is an action breach of contract, forgery of documents, and forgery of evidence. The Complaint contains no facts about the events giving rise to this action.PROCEDURAL HISTORY On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed his Complaint against Defendants Bradley Childers, Ronald Hirano, Jay Wu, Chia-Chen Lin, Shao Xing Yang, Kevin Yen-Po Chen, and LTG South Hills, LLC.On March 20, 2024, Defendant Childers filed the instant demurrer.DISCUSSION Defendant Childers demurs to Plaintiff’s Complaint on the grounds that the Complaint fails to state facts relevant to the elements of the claim sufficient to support causes of action against him.A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 (internal citations omitted).)Meet and ConferA party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 430.41(a).) “The parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet and confer.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 430.41(a)(2).) A failure to meet and confer does not constitute grounds to sustain or overrule a demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., sections 430.41 (a)(4).)Here, Childers testifies that he met and conferred with Plaintiff and Plaintiff did not agree to file an amended complaint. Because Childers attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff, Childers satisfies meet and confer requirements.DiscussionPlaintiff’s Complaint is Made on form PLD-C-001. Plaintiff checked boxes stating he is bringing causes of action for breach of contract, forgery of documents, and forgery of evidence against Defendants. (Compl., Item 8.) Plaintiff also alleges in an attachment that documents were forged, evidence was forged, and Defendants compensated Plaintiff or $57,516,660 for losses. (Compl., p.3.) The elements of a claim for breach of contract are: “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint must demonstrate damages proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v. American Dynasty (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.) For a written contract, the plaintiff may plead it “by its terms – set out verbatim in the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by reference – or by its legal effect.” (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489 abrogated on other grounds in Freeman v. Quicken Loans Inc. (2012) 566 U.S. 624.) To plead a contract’s legal effect the plaintiff’s pleading must include “the substance of its relevant terms. This is more difficult, for it requires a careful analysis of the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal conclusions.” (Id.)¿Here, Plaintiff’s Complaint does not contain any facts describing the events giving rise to this cause of action. The Complaint merely states documents and evidence were forged. Because the Complaint fails to set forth any facts related to any contract, the Complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of contract. The demurrer is sustained on this ground. As for the causes of action for forgery, a private right of action for forgery does not appear to exist in California law. In any case, the Complaint does not contain any facts pertaining to the alleged forgery. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained as to these causes of action. The burden is on Plaintiff to show in what manner the complaint may be amended and how the amendment would change the legal effect of his pleading. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335.) Here, Plaintiff does not discuss the issue of leave to amend and must be prepared to discuss this issue at the hearing on this matter.DATED: June 20, 2024__________________________Hon.
