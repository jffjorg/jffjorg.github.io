  Case Number:  23CHCV00845    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  F49 Dept. F49  Date: 6/27/24 Case Name: Kubota Credit  Corporation, USA, v.  Esmeralda Rubio-Acosta,  and Does 1-100 Case No. 23CHCV00845   LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    JUNE 27, 2024    MOTION  FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  Los  Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23CHCV00845    Motion filed:  3/20/24   MOVING  PARTY: Plaintiff  Kubota Credit Corporation, USA, (“Kubota” or “Plaintiff”) RESPONDING  PARTY: none NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: An  order granting Kubota’s Motion for Summary Judgment against Defendant Esmeralda  Rubio-Acosta    TENTATIVE RULING: The  motion is GRANTED.   BACKGROUND   This action arises from alleged  default in payment of a security agreement Defendant entered into for the  purchase of a KUBOTA SVL65-2 (“Subject Vehicle”) and the subsequent refusal to  surrender possession of the Subject Vehicle.   On March 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the  Complaint against Defendant Esmeralda Rubio-Acosta (“Defendant”) and Does 1  through 100, alleging (1) Possession of Personal Property, (2) Breach of  Contract, (3) Good Sold and Delivered, (4) Book Account, and (5) Account  Stated. Subsequently, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint on May 12,  2023.    On June 8, 2023, the Court granted  Kubota’s Application for Writ of Possession filed on March 27, 2023. (2023/6/8  Minute Order.)   On February 2, 2024, the Court granted  multiple discovery motions filed by Kubota: Motion to Compel Responses to  Requests for Production, Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories,  Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, and Motion to Deem  Request for Admissions Admitted, imposing monetary sanctions against Defendant  in the amount of $3,840.00. (2024/2/2/ Minute Order.)   On March 20, 2024, Kubota filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment  (the “Motion”).   No Opposition or Reply papers have been received by the Court.              ANALYSIS   “The motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the  papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact  and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. In  determining if the papers show that there is no triable issue as to any  material fact, the court shall consider all of the evidence set forth in the  papers, except the evidence to which objections have been made and sustained by  the court, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence, except  summary judgment shall not be granted by the court based on inferences  reasonably deducible from the evidence if contradicted by other inferences or  evidence that raise a triable issue as to any material fact.” (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 437c, subd. (c).)    “[I]f  the moving papers establish a prima facie showing that justifies a [ruling] in  the [plaintiff's] favor, the burden then shifts to the [defendant] to make a  prima facie showing of the existence of a triable material factual issue.”'  (Citation.)" (See's Candy Shops, Inc. v. Superior Court (2012)  210 Cal.App.4th 889, 900, quoting Rehmani v. Superior Court (2012)  204 Cal.App.4th 945, 950.) “The defendant or cross-defendant shall not rely  upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue  of material fact exists but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts  showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action  or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)    A.    Request  for Judicial Notice   Kubota requests the Court  take judicial notice of the following documents under Evidence Code section  452, subdivisions (c) and (d):   (1)    An Order Compelling Defendant Esmeralda  Rubio-Acosta to Provide Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special  Interrogatories, Request for Production of Documents, Deem Requests for  Admission Admitted, and for Monetary Sanctions CCP § 2023.030;   (2)    Motion to Deem Admitted The Truth of the Matters  Specified in the Request for Admissions Set One; Request for Monetary Sanctions; Memorandum of Points  and Authorities;  Declaration of Steven Ernest filed on October 18, 2023.   The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s  Request for Judicial Notice.   B.     Motion  for Summary Judgment   1)      Cause  of Action – Possession of Personal Property   The  Complaint asserts a cause of action for possession of personal property.    Code of Civil Procedure  sections 511.010 to 516.050 establish a provisional remedy that grants the plaintiff the  right to immediate possession of the property involved in the action for  specific recovery of the property without waiting for trial and judgment. (See  American Machine & Foundry Co. v. Pitchess (1968) 262 Cal.App.2d  490, 493.)   The case records indicate  that on March 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed an application for a writ of possession  pursuant to the claim and delivery provisions in Code of Civil Procedure sections  511.010 to 516.050. The Court granted the application on June 8, 2023.  (2023/6/8 Minute Order.)    Thus, there is no need for  the Court to reconsider the provisional remedy which has already been afforded  to Plaintiff.   2)      Cause of Action – Breach  of Contract   The elements for a  breach of contract cause of action include: (1) existence of a contract; (2)  plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach,  and (4) resulting damage to plaintiff. (Reichert v. General Ins. Co. (1968) 68 Cal.2d  822, 830; Hale v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1387.)   The essential elements of a  contract are: “(1) Parties capable of contracting; (2) Their consent; (3) A  lawful object; and, (4) A sufficient cause or consideration.” (Civil Code, §  1550.) Only a signatory to the contract may be liable for any breach. (Clements  v. American Warranty Corp. (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 444, 452.)   “[A] pleader must state with  certainty the facts constituting a breach of contract.” (Melican v. Regents  of Univ. of Cal. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 168, 174; Levy v. State Farm  Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1, 5 [“Facts alleging a breach,  like all essential elements of a breach of contract cause of action, must be  pleaded with specificity.”])    General (direct)  contract damages may be alleged with a bare statement of damage. Special  (consequential) damages must be pled with particularity. (Lewis Jorge  Construction Management, Inc. v. Pomona Unified School Dist. (2004) 34  Cal.4th 960.)               Here,  Plaintiff alleges that on March 11, 2021, Defendant and a nonparty dealer  Diamond A Equipment, LLC entered into a typical written Retail Installment  Sales Contract (“RISC”, or the “Contract”) for Defendant’s purchase of a KUBOTA  SVL65-2. (UMF, p.2, No. 1, Steen Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) The Contract  is attached to the Complaint and included in the Motion’s Compendium of  Exhibits (“COE”) Exhibit “A”, demonstrating that Diamond A Equipment, LLC  assigned the RISC to Plaintiff “without recourse.” The assignment was executed  concurrently with the Contract. (Steen Decl. Ex.”A.”) Furthermore,  Plaintiff maintains that it is the present holder of the beneficial interest in  the Contract (UMF, p. 2, No.2, RFA, No. 3), the authenticity of which  is deemed admitted as the truth of the matter. (RFA, No. 2.)               Moreover, Kubota asserts that Defendant defaulted on her  obligation according to the Contract by failing to make the payment which came  due October 2022, and each subsequent payment due. (UMF, p.3, No. 3, RFA, Nos.  1-2.)               Furthermore, Kubota claims that the Contract contains a  provision that stipulates Defendant to pay reasonable attorney’s fees and costs  to Plaintiff should it prevail in any action on the Contract. (UMF, p. 4, No.  5, Tran Decl. ¶ 3.)               Additionally, Kubota alleges that it has sustained damage  of $38,462.73 for the balance on the Subject Vehicle (UMF, p.3, No. 4, Steen  Decl. ¶ 10), as well as incurred attorney’s fees in the amount of $7,388.50  (UMF, p.4, No. 6, Steen Decl. ¶ 6), and costs in the amount of $578.52. (UMF, p.4,  No. 7, Steen Decl. ¶ 7.)   Based  on the above records, the Court finds that Kubota has satisfied its burden of  establishing a prima facie showing that justifies a ruling in its favor  for the breach of contract cause of action, the burden then shifts to Defendant  to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable material factual  issue. However, Defendant fails to file any opposition, thereby creating a  waiver of the issues.    3)       Cause of Action – Good Sold  and Delivered   The only  essential allegations of a common count are: (1) the statement of indebtedness  in a certain sum, (2) the consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, etc., and  (3) nonpayment. (Farmers Ins.  Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53  Cal.App.4th 445, 460; Allen v.  Powell (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 502,  510; Johnson v. Dixon Farms Co. (1915) 29 Cal. App. 52, 53-55;  see CACI 371.)               Here, these elements are the same as alleged under the Breach  of Contract cause of action. Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant became  indebted to it for goods sold and delivered for which Defendant agreed to pay  the sum of $58,445.00. (UMF, p.6, No. 3.)              Accordingly, the  Court concludes that Plaintiff has met the burden of establishing a prima facie  showing that justifies a ruling in its favor for this cause of  action.   4)       Cause of Action – Book Account   To establish a cause of action  for Open Book Account, the following elements must be satisfied: (1) plaintiff  and defendant had financial transactions, (2) plaintiff kept an account of the  debits and credits involved in the transactions, (3) defendant owes plaintiff  money on the account, and (4) the amount of money that the defendant owes the  plaintiff.  (State Comp. Ins. Fund v. ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc.  (2020) 50 Cal. App. 5th 422, 449.)  A book account is “open” if a balance  remains due on this account.  (Interstate Group Administrators, Inc. v.  Cravens, Dargan & Co. (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 700, 708.)   Here, the element for a financial transaction is  established under the previous analysis for the existence of the Contract.  Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that due to Defendant’s default on the Contract and  after crediting the payments to Defendant’s account, there remains a balance of  $38,462.73. (UMF, p. 9, No. 5.)   Accordingly, the  Court concludes that Plaintiff has met the burden of establishing a prima facie  showing that justifies a ruling in its favor for the cause of  action for Book Account.   5)      Cause  of Action – Account Stated   “The essential  elements of an Account Stated are: (1) previous transactions between the  parties establishing the relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement  between the parties, express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to  the creditor; [and] (3) a promise by the debtor, express or implied, to pay the  amount due.” (Zinn v. Fred R. Bright Co. (1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 597, 600;  see CACI 373.)    Based on the  analysis above, these elements are sufficiently alleged under the elements for the  Breach of Contract claim and the cause of action for Book Account.   Therefore, the  Court finds that Plaintiff has met its burden of demonstrating the existence of  previous financial transactions between it and Defendant, the existence of an  express written agreement, and a promise by Defendant to pay the amount due in  installment payments.   Notably,  Defendant has failed to file an Opposition, thereby creating a waiver of any  issues raised in Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment. By waiving these  issues and not setting forth any specific facts, the Court concludes that  Defendant does not meet her burden of showing that a triable issue of material  fact exists.   Based on the foregoing, the Court  GRANTS the unopposed Motion for Summary Judgment.               CONCLUSION   The unopposed Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.   Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice is  GRANTED.   Moving party to provide notice.
