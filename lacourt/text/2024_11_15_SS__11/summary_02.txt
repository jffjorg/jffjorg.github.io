And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration filed by Central Valley Meat Co., Inc. (CVMC) and its affiliates. The motion was filed in response to a lawsuit brought by Jonathan Cruz-Pulido, a former employee of CVMC, alleging wage-and-hour violations. The dispute centers around the existence and enforceability of an arbitration agreement signed by Cruz-Pulido during the onboarding process.

The judge found that the agreement is unconscionable because it has an overbroad scope, allowing CVMC to compel arbitration of claims unrelated to employment. The judge also found that the agreement lacks mutuality, as it requires Cruz-Pulido to arbitrate claims against CVMC's affiliates and subsidiaries, but does not require those affiliates and subsidiaries to arbitrate claims against Cruz-Pulido.

The judge declined to reach the issues of injunctive relief, class waiver, and confidentiality, as the arbitration agreement is deemed unconscionable and unenforceable.
