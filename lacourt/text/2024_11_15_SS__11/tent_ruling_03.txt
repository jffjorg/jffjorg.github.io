[1] Plaintiff declares that he “do[es] not recall
signing” the agreement.  (Cruz-Pulido
Decl., ¶ 3.)  Lack
of memory is not a defense.  Nor is
failure to read.  (See, e.g., Ramos v. Westlake Services LLC (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 674, 687 [“[T]he fact
that [the plaintiff] signed a contract in a language he may not have completely
understood would not bar enforcement of the arbitration agreement.  If [the plaintiff] did not speak or understand
English sufficiently to comprehend the English Contract, he should have had it
read or explained to him.”].)
