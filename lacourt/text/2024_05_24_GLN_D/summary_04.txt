This tentative ruling concerns a dispute over the production of documents and responses to interrogatories in a Song-Beverly Act case. The court has issued an addendum to the case management conference order, which outlines the procedures for discovery in Song-Beverly cases. The court has denied without prejudice the plaintiffs' motions to compel responses to interrogatories and requests for production, and to deem the truth of matters admitted in requests for admissions. The court notes that the parties are ordered to meet and confer in good faith concerning compliance with the order, and to serve any further discovery. The court also notes that the parties are required to file a proposed protective order if they believe any of the information requested in discovery should be subject to a protective order.
