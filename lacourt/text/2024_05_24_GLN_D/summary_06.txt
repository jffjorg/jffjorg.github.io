And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendant from dissipating the allegedly converted funds. The court finds that the plaintiff has a strong likelihood of prevailing on its claim of conversion, and that the harm to the plaintiff if the injunction is not granted (loss of possession and control over the allegedly converted funds) is greater than the harm to the defendant if the injunction is issued (loss of control over the allegedly converted funds until this matter is resolved, which can be compensated for in money). The court orders the plaintiff to post a bond in the sum of $15,000 to cover any damages or expenses incurred by the defendant as a result of the injunction. The preliminary injunction is granted without prejudice to the plaintiff seeking to modify or extend the injunction in the future.
