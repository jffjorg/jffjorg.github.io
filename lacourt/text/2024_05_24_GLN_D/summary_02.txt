Here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

The court is considering a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories in the case of Ordookhanian v. County of Los Angeles. The motion is brought by Adrineh Ordookhanian, who alleges that she was subjected to adverse employment actions, including being denied promotions and a transfer, and that she was subjected to discrimination, harassment, and retaliation by the County of Los Angeles.

The court finds that the County of Los Angeles failed to provide a response to the interrogatories, citing objections, and that the objections are not justified. The court orders the County of Los Angeles to provide a complete response to the interrogatories regarding damages and benefits.

The court also orders the parties to meet and confer regarding the discovery of damages and benefits, and to use a Stipulated Confidentiality Order Form as a model. The court notes that the parties did not engage in a good faith meet and confer prior to the filing of the motion, and that the County of Los Angeles did not justify its objections to the interrogatories.

The court further orders that the County of Los Angeles will provide a substantive answer to each interrogatory, including identifying each type of benefit to which the employee would have been entitled, and estimating the amount of the benefit. The court rejects the argument that the interrogatory is dependent on which benefit plan the plaintiff chooses and requires her to input personal information into a benefits website.

The court also notes that the County of Los Angeles failed to provide a response to the interrogatory regarding the form interrogatory No. 201.4, which requests information about the adverse employment action, and that the response provided was improper. The court orders the County of Los Angeles to provide a complete response to this interrogatory.
