STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a habitability action filed on behalf of 43 Plaintiffs,
consisting of 22 adults and 21 children across eight families. Plaintiffs, who
are and were tenants at the Chesapeake Apartments, a residential apartment
complex, allege that Defendants permitted the premises to develop extensive
uninhabitable conditions and allowed those conditions to persist in violation
of statutes and municipal ordinances. Plaintiffs seek monetary and injunctive
relief.
 
Plaintiffs bring a set of petitions
to approve eleven minors’ compromises of the pending action. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
The Petitions for Approval of
Minors’ Compromise of Claims are GRANTED.

Alzate-Quinones Family Petitions
 
            Plaintiff
Andrea Quinones Partida, as parent and Guardian ad Litem for minor Plaintiffs

and Brayan Alzate-Quinonez (age 13) seeks approval of the minors’ compromise

Legal Standard
 
Court approval is required
for all settlements of a minor’s claim or that of a person lacking the capacity
to make decisions.  (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1333, 1337.)  “[T]he
protective role the court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a
role to assure that whatever is done is in the minor’s best interests . . . .  [I]ts primary concern is whether the compromise is sufficient to
provide for the minor’s injuries, care and treatment.”  (Goldberg v.
Superior Court (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.)   
 
A petition for court
approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure
section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.950, 7.951, and
7.952.  The petition must be verified by the petitioner and contain a full
disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the reasonableness” of
the compromise or the covenant.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
The person compromising the claim on behalf of the minor or person who lacks
capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of
the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal
appearance.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).) 
An order for deposit of funds of a minor or
person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition for the withdrawal of
such funds must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.953 and
7.954.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A.
County, Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.) 
 
Form MC-350 (Rev. January 1, 2021):
 
The petitions have been verified by
Petitioners and presented on a fully completed mandatory Judicial Council Form
MC-350, using the current January 1, 2021 revision. (Cal. Rule of Court Rule
7.950.)
 
//
Settlement:
 
Plaintiffs are a family of three
adults and three minor children. (Declaration of Zaina Alfi ISO Petitions ¶ 4.)
Pursuant to the settlement with Defendants, each individual in this household will
receive $55,769.23. (Id., Exh. C.) 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
The retained attorney’s information
has been disclosed as required by Rule of Court 7.951. (Petition ¶ 17b.)  There is an agreement for services provided
in connection with the underlying claim. (Petition ¶ 17a(2).)  A copy of the agreement was submitted with
the Petition as strictly required by Rule of Court 7.951(6). (Attach. 17a(2).) 
 
Petitioner’s counsel is seeking to
recover $16,730.77 in attorney’s fees on each of the petitions, representing
30% of each minor’s gross settlement award, plus $407.94 in costs, for a total
of $51,416.13 across the three petitions. (See Petition ¶ 16e.)  Counsel has provided a declaration addressing
the reasonableness of the fee request, as required by Rule of Court 7,995(c),
accounting for the factors specified in Rule of Court 7,955(b). CRC Rule
7.955(b) provides:
 
(b) Factors the court may consider in
determining a reasonable attorney's fee. 
 In determining a reasonable
attorney's fee, the court may consider the following nonexclusive factors:
 
 (1) The fact that a minor or person with a
disability is involved and the circumstances of that minor or person with a
disability.
 (2) The amount of the fee in proportion to the
value of the services performed.
 (3) The novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved and the skill required to perform the legal services
properly.
 (4) The amount involved and the results
obtained.
 (5) The time limitations or constraints
imposed by the representative of the minor or person with a disability or by
the circumstances.
 (6) The nature and length of the professional
relationship between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person
with a disability.
 (7) The experience, reputation, and ability of
the attorney or attorneys performing the legal services.
 (8) The time and labor required.
 (9) The informed consent of the representative
of the minor or person with a disability to the fee.
 (10) The relative sophistication of the
attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability.
 (11) The likelihood, if apparent to the
representative of the minor or person with a disability when the representation
agreement was made, that the attorney's acceptance of the particular employment
would preclude other employment.
 (12) Whether the fee is fixed, hourly, or
contingent.
 (13) If the fee is contingent:
  
(A) The risk of loss borne by the attorney;
  
(B) The amount of costs advanced by the attorney; and
  
(C) The delay in payment of fees and reimbursement of costs paid by the
attorney.
 (14) Statutory requirements for representation
agreements applicable to particular cases or claims. 
 
(Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(b).) The Court addresses
these factors below.
 
            Amount
of Fee in Proportion to Value of Services Performed
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel contends that an attorney fee of 30% of the sum recovered on behalf of
the minor claimants is a reasonable fee in proportion to the services provided
and is less than the 40% contingency rate for the adults. (Alfi Decl. ¶ 32(a).)
 
            Novelty
and Difficulty
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel contends that this habitability action was both novel and difficult
because of the number of parties, claims, and applicable regulations. (Alfi
Decl. ¶ 32(b).) 
 
            Amount
Involved and Results Obtained
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel does not directly address this factor, but the attached accounting of
the full settlement demonstrates that this case settled for nearly $2.4
million. (Alfi Decl. Exh. C.)
 
            Nature
and Length of Professional Relationship
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel has been representing Plaintiffs since 2023. (Alfi Decl. ¶ 32(c).)
 
            Experience,
Reputation, and Ability of Counsel
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel testifies to the experience, reputation, training, and skills of the
several attorneys involved with this case. (Alfi Decl. ¶¶ 28 p.13 - ¶ 34 p.14.)
 
            Time and
Labor Required
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel has been working this case for over one year, and state that it
involved extensive investigation, discovery, negotiation, and substantive
motion practice, accounting for some 1,000 hours. (Id. ¶ 30 p. 9.) 
 
//
            Acceptance
of Case Precluding Other Employment
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel does not address whether acceptance of this case precluded other
employment.
 
            Contingent
Fee
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel states this case was taken strictly on a contingency basis, and all
costs and expenses were borne by Plaintiffs’ counsel. (Id. ¶ 32(g).)
 
            The Court
finds that, although Plaintiffs’ counsel has not addressed all the factors,
Plaintiffs’ counsel has adequately demonstrated the reasonableness of the fee
award.
 
Medical Bills:
 
            No medical
expenses have been incurred. (Petition ¶ 12.) 
 
Costs
 
            Attorney’s
fees in the amount of $16,730.77, plus costs in the amount of $407.94, which
are owed by Petitioner, will be paid by each claimant, for a total of $17,138.71
in costs for each claimant and a combined total of $51,416.13 in costs.
(Petition ¶ 16.) 
 
Amount to Be Paid to Minor:
 
The net amount to be paid to each
minor claimant is $38,630.52. (Petition ¶ 15.)
 
Court Appearance:
            
            California
Rule of Court 7.952 requires attendance by the petitioner and claimant unless
the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. The Court
finds that the appearance of the claimants Rogelio Edwardo Alzate-Quinonez;
Roxana Olivarria Quinones; and Brayan Alzate-Quinonez is not required due to their
age. 
 
Prognosis:
 
            The minors
have completely recovered from their injuries. (Petition ¶ 8.)
 
Disposition of Balance of Proceeds:
 
            The
petitions request that the balance of the proceeds be invested in a
single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of
the Court. (Petition ¶ 18b.) The petitions include the terms and conditions of
that annuity. (Attach. 18b(5).) 
 
 
Proposed Order MC-351:
 
            Petitioners
have filed a Proposed Order Form MC-351 for each minor claimant. 
 
The Court finds the settlement to
be fair and adequate. As the petitions are procedurally in order, the Petitions
for Approval of Minor’s Compromise are GRANTED.
 
Valencia Family Petition
 
            Plaintiff
Ronald Oswaldo Valencia Amaya, as parent and Guardian ad Litem for minor
Plaintiff Emely Dayanna Valencia Arce (age 15), and Ashli Mayli Portillo
Martinez, as parent and Guardian ad Litem of Santiago Asher Lara Portillo (age 2)

of each minor’s gross settlement award, plus $407.94 in costs, for a total of $22,715.88
across the two petitions. (See Petition ¶ 16e.) 
Counsel has provided a declaration addressing the reasonableness of the
fee request, as required by Rule of Court 7,995(c), accounting for the factors
specified in Rule of Court 7,955(b). CRC Rule 7.955(b) provides:

finds that, although Plaintiffs’ counsel has not addressed all the factors,
Plaintiffs’ counsel has adequately demonstrated the reasonableness of the fee
award.
 
Medical Bills:
 
            No medical
expenses have been incurred. (Petition ¶ 12.) 
 
Costs
 
            Attorney’s
fees in the amount of $16,730.77, plus costs in the amount of $407.94, which
are owed by Petitioner, will be paid by each claimant, for a total of $17,138.71
in costs for each claimant and a combined total of $51,416.13 in costs.
(Petition ¶ 16.) 
 
Amount to Be Paid to Minor:
 
The net amount to be paid to each
minor claimant is $ 38,630.52. (Petition ¶ 15.)
 
Court Appearance:
            
            California
Rule of Court 7.952 requires attendance by the petitioner and claimant unless
the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. The Court
finds that the appearance of the claimants Anderson Alexis Avila, Thiago
Alejandro Agustin, and Kylian Abdiel Agustin are not required due to their age.

 
Prognosis:
 
            The minors
have completely recovered from their injuries. (Petition ¶ 8.)
 
//
 
Disposition of Balance of Proceeds:
 
            The
petitions request that the balance of the proceeds be invested in a
single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of
the Court. (Petition ¶ 18b.) The petitions include the terms and conditions of
that annuity. (Attach. 18b(5).) 
 
Proposed Order MC-351:
 
            Petitioners
have filed a Proposed Order Form MC-351 for each minor claimant. 
 
The Court finds the settlement to
be fair and adequate. As the petitions are procedurally in order, the Petitions
for Approval of Minor’s Compromise are GRANTED.
 
Dean-Jimenez Family Petitions
 
            Plaintiff
Diana Dean, as parent and Guardian ad Litem for minor Jesse Dean (age 13),
Hailey Jimenez (age 10), and Lucy Jimenez (age 1) seeks approval of the minors’
compromise with Defendants. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Court approval is required
for all settlements of a minor’s claim or that of a person lacking the capacity
to make decisions.  (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1333, 1337.)  “[T]he
protective role the court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a
role to assure that whatever is done is in the minor’s best interests . . . .  [I]ts primary concern is whether the compromise is sufficient to
provide for the minor’s injuries, care and treatment.”  (Goldberg v.
Superior Court (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.)   
 
A petition for court
approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure
section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.950, 7.951, and
7.952.  The petition must be verified by the petitioner and contain a full
disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the reasonableness” of
the compromise or the covenant.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
The person compromising the claim on behalf of the minor or person who lacks
capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of
the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal
appearance.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).) 
An order for deposit of funds of a minor or
person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition for the withdrawal of
such funds must comply with California Rules of Court Rules 7.953 and
7.954.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384; see also Super. Ct. L.A.
County, Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.) 
 
//
 
Form MC-350 (Rev. January 1, 2021):
 
The petitions have been verified by
Petitioners and presented on a fully completed mandatory Judicial Council Form
MC-350, using the current January 1, 2021 revision. (Cal. Rule of Court Rule
7.950.)
 
Settlement:
 
Plaintiffs are a family of four
adults and three minor children. (Declaration of Zaina Alfi ISO Petitions ¶ 4.)
Pursuant to the settlement with Defendants, Diana Dean will receive
$113,576.92; the remaining adults will each receive $55,769.23, and the minors
will each receive $36,500. (Id. Exh. C.) 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
The retained attorney’s information
has been disclosed as required by Rule of Court 7.951. (Petition ¶ 17b.)  There is an agreement for services provided
in connection with the underlying claim. (Petition ¶ 17a(2).)  A copy of the agreement was submitted with
the Petition as strictly required by Rule of Court 7.951(6). (Attach. 17a(2).) 
 
Petitioner’s counsel is seeking to
recover $10,950 in attorney’s fees on each of the petitions, representing 30%
of each minor’s gross settlement award, plus $407.94 in costs, for a total of 75,426.18
across the three  petitions. (See Petition
¶ 16e.)  Counsel has provided a
declaration addressing the reasonableness of the fee request, as required by
Rule of Court 7,995(c), accounting for the factors specified in Rule of Court
7,955(b). CRC Rule 7.955(b) provides:
 
(b) Factors the court may consider in
determining a reasonable attorney's fee. 
 In determining a reasonable
attorney's fee, the court may consider the following nonexclusive factors:
 
 (1) The fact that a minor or person with a
disability is involved and the circumstances of that minor or person with a
disability.
 (2) The amount of the fee in proportion to the
value of the services performed.
 (3) The novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved and the skill required to perform the legal services
properly.
 (4) The amount involved and the results
obtained.
 (5) The time limitations or constraints
imposed by the representative of the minor or person with a disability or by
the circumstances.
 (6) The nature and length of the professional
relationship between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person
with a disability.
 (7) The experience, reputation, and ability of
the attorney or attorneys performing the legal services.
 (8) The time and labor required.
 (9) The informed consent of the representative
of the minor or person with a disability to the fee.
 (10) The relative sophistication of the
attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a disability.
 (11) The likelihood, if apparent to the
representative of the minor or person with a disability when the representation
agreement was made, that the attorney's acceptance of the particular employment
would preclude other employment.
 (12) Whether the fee is fixed, hourly, or
contingent.
 (13) If the fee is contingent:
  
(A) The risk of loss borne by the attorney;
  
(B) The amount of costs advanced by the attorney; and
  
(C) The delay in payment of fees and reimbursement of costs paid by the
attorney.
 (14) Statutory requirements for representation
agreements applicable to particular cases or claims. 
 
(Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(b).) The Court addresses
these factors below.
 
            Amount
of Fee in Proportion to Value of Services Performed
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel contends that an attorney fee of 30% of the sum recovered on behalf of
the minor claimants is a reasonable fee in proportion to the services provided
and is less than the 40% contingency rate for the adults. (Alfi Decl. ¶ 32(a).)
Plaintiffs’ counsel states that the greater amounts allocated to the adult
Plaintiffs accounts for claims for back rent, statutory damages, and emotional
distress arising from concern for the health and development of their children.

 
            Novelty
and Difficulty
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel contends that this habitability action was both novel and difficult
because of the number of parties, claims, and applicable regulations. (Alfi
Decl. ¶ 32(b).) 
 
            Amount
Involved and Results Obtained
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel does not directly address this factor, but the attached accounting of
the full settlement demonstrates that this case settled for nearly $2.4
million. (Alfi Decl. Exh. C.)
 
            Nature
and Length of Professional Relationship
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel has been representing Plaintiffs since 2023. (Alfi Decl. ¶ 32(c).)
 
//
            Experience,
Reputation, and Ability of Counsel
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel testifies to the experience, reputation, training, and skills of the
several attorneys involved with this case. (Alfi Decl. ¶¶ 28 p.13 - ¶ 34 p.14.)
 
            Time and
Labor Required
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel has been working this case for over one year, and state that it
involved extensive investigation, discovery, negotiation, and substantive
motion practice, accounting for some 1,000 hours. (Id. ¶ 30 p. 9.) 
 
            Acceptance
of Case Precluding Other Employment
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel does not address whether acceptance of this case precluded other
employment.
 
            Contingent
Fee
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel states this case was taken strictly on a contingency basis, and all
costs and expenses were borne by Plaintiffs’ counsel. (Id. ¶ 32(g).)
 
            The Court
finds that, although Plaintiffs’ counsel has not addressed all the factors,
Plaintiffs’ counsel has adequately demonstrated the reasonableness of the fee
award.
 
Medical Bills:
 
            No medical
expenses have been incurred. (Petition ¶ 12.) 
 
Costs
 
            Attorney’s
fees in the amount of $10,950, plus costs in the amount of $407.94, which are
owed by Petitioner, will be paid by each claimant, for a total of $11,357.94 in
costs for each claimant and a combined total of $75,426.18 in costs. (Petition
¶ 16.) 
 
Amount to Be Paid to Minor:
 
The net amount to be paid to each
minor claimant is $ 25,142.06. (Petition ¶ 15.)
 
Court Appearance:
            
            California
Rule of Court 7.952 requires attendance by the petitioner and claimant unless
the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. The Court
finds that the appearance of the claimants Jesse Dean, Hailey Jimenez, and Lucy
Jimenez are not required due to their age. 
 
//
Prognosis:
 
            The minors
have completely recovered from their injuries. (Petition ¶ 8.)
 
Disposition of Balance of Proceeds:
 
            The
petitions request that the balance of the proceeds be invested in a
single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of
the Court. (Petition ¶ 18b.) The petitions include the terms and conditions of
that annuity. (Attach. 18b(5).) 
 
Proposed Order MC-351:
 
            Petitioners
have filed a Proposed Order Form MC-351 for each minor claimant. 
 
The Court finds the settlement to
be fair and adequate. As the petitions are procedurally in order, the Petitions
for Approval of Minor’s Compromise are GRANTED.
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
the Petitions for Approval of Minors’ Compromise of Claims are GRANTED. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
