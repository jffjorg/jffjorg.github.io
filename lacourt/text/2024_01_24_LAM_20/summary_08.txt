And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between Bradley J. Dechter (the plaintiff) and Ronald Massman and DHX–Dependable Hawaiian Express, Inc. (the defendants). The plaintiff alleges that he has an interest in DHX due to his contributions, but that his ownership stake has been refused. The defendants have demurred to the plaintiff's breach of contract and fraud claims, arguing that the claims are barred by a two-year statute of limitations and the economic loss rule.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged delayed discovery and that the statute of limitations is a factual issue in this case. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim is not barred by the economic loss rule, and that the plaintiff is permitted to plead unjust enrichment as an alternative to the breach of contract claims.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice and has denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's alter ego allegations. The judge has ordered the defendants to file an answer within 20 days.
