And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling concerns an employment action where plaintiff Victoria White seeks to compel initial responses to her interrogatories propounded on defendants Service All-Stars Energy, Inc. and Faisal Lodhi. The defendants argue that they were surprised by the motion because the parties had agreed to engage in settlement discussions and pause discovery. However, the court finds that the agreement was to pause discovery and have the plaintiff's counsel initiate settlement discussions. The court will compel the defendants to respond to the interrogatories within 30 days, but will not award sanctions. The defendants can still assert objections. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, counsel are strongly encouraged to participate in the hearing via LACourtConnect rather than in person.
