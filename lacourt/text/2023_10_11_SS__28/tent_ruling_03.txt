LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Motion
to strike 
“Any
party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a
notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).)  The Court may “[s]trike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436,
subd. (a).)  “The grounds for a motion to
strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading of from any matter
of which the court is required to take judicial notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437, subd. (a).)  “Where the motion to
strike is based on matter of which the court may take judicial notice pursuant
to Section 452 or 453 of the Evidence Code, such matter shall be specified in
the notice of motion, or in the supporting points and authorities, except as the
court may otherwise permit.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437, subd. (b).) 
“In
order to survive a motion to strike an allegation of punitive damages, the
ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief must be pled by a
plaintiff.” (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255
(Clauson).)  “In passing on the
correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike, judges read allegations of a
pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context,
and assume their truth.”  (Ibid.)  “In ruling on a motion to strike, courts do
not read allegations in isolation.”  (Ibid.) 
B.       Punitive damages 
“(a) In an action for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that
the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff,
in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example
and by way of punishing the defendant. 
* * * 
“(c) As used in this section, the following
definitions shall apply: 
“(1) ‘Malice’ means conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others. 
“(2) ‘Oppression’ means despicable conduct that
subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that
person’s rights. 
“(3) ‘Fraud’ means an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention
on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal
rights or otherwise causing injury.” 
(Civ. Code, § 3294, subds.
(a), (c).) 
“In
addition to the requirement that the operative complaint set forth the elements
as stated in section 3294, it must include specific factual allegations showing
that defendant's conduct was oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious to support a
claim for punitive damages.” (Today's IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1137, 1193,
citing Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872 (Brousseau).)
“Punitive damages may not be pleaded generally.”  (Ibid., citing Brousseau, 73
Cal.App.3d at p. 872.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.      Punitive
damages allegations 
Moving
Defendants argue the Second Amended Complaint does not allege facts that
support a punitive damage claim against Defendant Ryan Scott Davis (“Ryan Davis”).  The complaint alleges that, at the time of
the accident, Ryan Davis was driving while under the influence of
narcotics.  The complaint also alleges Ryan
Davis’s engaged in despicable conduct with a willful and conscious disregard of
Plaintiffs’ safety for purposes of Civil Code section 3294. 
“[C]onclusory
allegations will not be stricken where they are supported by other, factual
allegations in the complaint.”  (L. Edmon
& C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter
2023) ¶ 7:181, p. 7(l)-80, emphasis omitted (Cal. Practice Guide).)  
“Simple
negligence will not justify an award of punitive damages.” (Spencer v. San
Francisco Brick Co. (1907) 5 Cal.App.126, 128.) But a complaint states
facts that support a punitive damage claim when its gravamen is that
“‘[d]efendant became intoxicated and thereafter drove a car while in that
condition, despite his knowledge of the safety hazard he created thereby’” (Peterson
v. Superior Court (1983) 31 Cal.3d 147, 163, quoting Taylor v. Superior
Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 896 (Taylor).)  “[T]he act of operating a motor vehicle while
intoxicated may constitute an act of ‘malice’ under section 3294 if performed
under circumstances which disclose a conscious disregard of the probably
dangerous consequences.”  (Taylor,
supra, 24 Cal.3d at p. 892.) 
“There
is a very commonly understood risk which attends every motor vehicle driver who
is intoxicated. One who willfully consumes alcoholic beverages to the point of
intoxication, knowing that he thereafter must operate a motor vehicle, thereby
combining sharply impaired physical and mental faculties with a vehicle capable
of great force and speed, reasonably may be held to exhibit a conscious
disregard of the safety of others.  The
effect may be lethal whether or not the driver had a prior history of drunk
driving incidents.” (Taylor, supra, 24 Cal.3d at pp. 896-897.) 
The Court concludes that the complaint does not allege facts showing
that Ryan Davis with malice, oppression, or fraud for purposes of Civil Code
section 3294, subdivision (c).  The
allegation that Ryan Davis engaged in
despicable conduct with a willful and conscious disregard of Plaintiffs’ safety
is too general to support a claim for punitive damages. 
Therefore,
the Court grants the motion to strike the punitive damages claim, including
paragraph 32 and the punitive damage request in the prayer. 
B.       Allegations against John Davis 
Moving
Defendants argue Defendant John E. Davis (“John Davis”) was not a driver and
was not present at the scene of the incident. 
Plaintiffs do not dispute these facts but nonetheless argue John Davis
can be “vicariously” liable for Ryan Davis’s alleged violation of the Vehicle
Code. 
The
Court agrees and strikes the portions of the complaint that allege that John Davis
violated Vehicle Code section 21352, subdivision (f).  The Court also strikes all allegations that suggest
that John Davis can be held responsible for taking or failing to take particular
actions at the accident location. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS IN PART the motion to strike filed by Defendants Ryan Scott Davis and
John E. Davis as follows: 
The
Court strikes the punitive damages claim, including paragraph 32 and the
punitive damage request in the prayer. 
The
Court strikes the portions of the complaint that allege that John Davis
violated Vehicle Code section 21352, subdivision (f), and the portions of the
complaint that suggest that John Davis can be held responsible for taking or
failing to take particular actions at the accident location. 
The
Court grants Plaintiffs Katelyn Hiller,
Kaylie Branch, and Kylie Branch 30 days leave to amend. 
The
Court DENIES the motion to strike in all other respects. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
