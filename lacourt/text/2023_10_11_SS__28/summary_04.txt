And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 21STCV37524, granting the motion for change of venue filed by defendant Cerritos Property Holdings LLC. The plaintiff, Blanca Canales, filed the original complaint against multiple defendants, including Joshua Medical Center, Cerritos Prop Holdings, AMPAC Management Group Inc., and Cerritos Property Holdings, alleging negligence and injuries sustained at a location in Los Angeles County. However, the defendant argued that the plaintiff was actually injured in Orange County, and that the inclusion of AMPAC Management Group Inc. in the complaint was solely to create venue in Los Angeles County. The judge found that the defendant had carried its burden of proof, showing that the plaintiff was injured in Orange County and that AMPAC Management Group Inc. was not a proper defendant in the case. As a result, the judge granted the motion and transferred the case to Orange County, ordering the plaintiff to pay the transfer fee.
