BACKGROUND 
On April

against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority,
the City of Los Angeles, and Does 1-50 for negligence (Gov. Code, § 815.2) and common
carrier liability (Gov. Code. § 815.2). 
On
June 2, 2022, the Court dismissed the City of Los Angeles without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
May 31, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, the City of Los Angeles, and Does 1-50 for negligence
(Gov. Code, § 815.2) and common carrier liability (Gov. Code. § 815.2). 
On
August 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint against Defendants Los Angeles
County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the City of Los Angeles, and
Does 1-50 for negligence (Gov. Code, § 815.2). 
On
September 20, 2022, Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“Metro”) filed an answer. 
On
July 13, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as
counsel. 
On
September 12, 2023, Metro filed a motion for an order that the truth of matters
specified in Metro’s requests for admission be deemed admitted.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for October 16, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Metro
requests that the Court order that the truth of matters specified in Metro’s
requests for admission be deemed admitted. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission
are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied:  
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.  
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the
truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.”  

(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280.)  
DISCUSSION  
On
August 1, 2023, Metro served requests for admission on Plaintiff.  (Metro’s motion describes the requests for admission
both as set one and set three.) 
Responses were due on September 5, 2023. 
Plaintiff
failed to serve timely responses.  Before
Metro filed this motion on September 12, 2023, Plaintiff had not served responses
or requested an extension of time to respond to the requests for admission. 
Metro
now moves the Court to deem admitted the matters specified in Metro’s requests
for admission.  The Court grants the
motion and deems admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission
served on Plaintiff. 
CONCLUSION  
The Court GRANTS Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests
for admission served on Plaintiff Maria Salud Zepeda-Pedrizco. 
Moving
party is to give notice of this ruling.         
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
