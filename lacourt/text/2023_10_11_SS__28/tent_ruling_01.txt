On December 7, 2022, Defendant Estate of Rina Falcone (Defendant) served Form Interrogatories, Set No. One, Special Interrogatories, Set No. One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set No. One, on Plaintiff Shuki Zanna (Plaintiff).

The Court grants the motions to compel responses to the form and special interrogatories under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b), and orders Plaintiff to provide verified responses to the interrogatories in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210, subdivision (a) and 2030.220 without objections by November 10, 2023. The Court grants the motion to compel responses to the demand for inspection and production of documents under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 and orders Plaintiff to provide verified responses under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210 and to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by November 10, 2023.
