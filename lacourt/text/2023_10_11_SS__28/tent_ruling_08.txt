PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
 A.      Informal Discovery Conference 
 The Eighth Amended Standing
  Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts Effective October 10,
  2022 (Filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub Courts will not hear
  Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery until the parties
  have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
  to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
  complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further
  Responses to Discovery.” 
 The parties participated in
  an IDC on July 6, 2023. 
 B.       Timeliness of motions 
 A notice of motion to
  compel further responses must be given within 45 days of the service of the
  responses, or any supplemental responses, or on or before any specific later
  date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
  2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c).) 
  Failure to file a motion within this time period constitutes a waiver
  of any right to compel further responses to interrogatories. 
 Defendant filed her motions
  on the dates set forth above. 
  Plaintiff does not dispute the timeliness of the motions. 
 C.   Meet and confer 
 “A motion to compel must be
  accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure
  section 2016.040.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
  §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)  “A meet and confer declaration must state
  facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an informal resolution
  of each issue presented by the motion.” 
  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  Defendant's counsel has provided declarations that describe reasonable efforts to meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel.  D.      Separate statement 
 California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, requires that motions involving the content of discovery contain a separate statement with the text
  of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons
  for why an order compelling further responses is warranted.  
 Defendant filed separate
  statements for the motion to compel further responses to the special
  interrogatories and the demand for inspection and production of documents.  Defendant states that a separate statement
  is not required for the motion to compel further responses to form
  interrogatories because Plaintiff did not provide any responses to the form
  interrogatories that are the subject of this motion. 
APPLICABLE LAW 
 A.      Inspection demand 
 “(a)
  On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
  sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
  response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following
  apply: 
 “(1)
  A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. 
 “(2)
  A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
  evasive. 
 “(3)
  An objection in the response is without merit or too general. 
 “(b)
  A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with each of the following: 
 “(1)
  The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
  discovery sought by the demand. 
 “(2)
  The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
  Section 2016.040. 
 “(3)
  In lieu of a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court,
  the court may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the
  discovery request and each response in dispute. 
 “(c)
  Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the
  verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any
  specific later date to which the demanding party and the responding party
  have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a
  further response to the demand. 
 *
  * *
 “(h)
  Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary
  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any
  party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
  compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
  the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
  make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2031.310, subds. (a), (b), (c), (h).) 
 B.       Interrogatories 
 Code of Civil Procedure
  section 2030.300, subdivision (a) provides:         
 “On
  receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for
  an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that
  any of the following apply: 
 “(1)
  An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. 
 “(2)
  An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
  unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. 
 “(3)
  An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.”(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2030.300, subd. (a).)
 C.    Discovery sanctions 
 “The court may impose a
  monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
  process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
  expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
  conduct. The court may also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully
  asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or
  on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both. If a monetary
  sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose
  that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
  substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
  the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ.
  Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
 “Misuses of the discovery
  process include . . . * * *
 “(d) Failing to respond or
  to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”
