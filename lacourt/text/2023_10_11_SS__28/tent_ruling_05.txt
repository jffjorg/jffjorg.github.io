Having considered the moving papers, the Court rules
  as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On January 5, 2022, Plaintiff Ramses Gonzalez
  (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Mike Leroy Bowen, Ronald
  Alonza Bowen, and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On April 28, 2022, the clerk entered Defendant Mike
  Leroy Bowen’s default.  On July 28,
  2022, the Court set aside the default. 
On June 6, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint to
  add Estate of Ronald Alonza Bowen, Deceased, as Doe 1. 
On September 12, 2022, Defendants Mike Bowen and
  Estate of Ronald Alonza Bowen, Deceased, filed an answer. 
On September 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first
  amended complaint. 
On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel, Robin
  Saghian, filed a motion to be relieved as counsel to be heard on October 11,
  2023. 
Trial is currently scheduled for January 8, 2024. 
COUNSEL’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s counsel asks to be relieved as counsel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
  Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed
  to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
  form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising
  the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under
  Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent
  under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in
  Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
  service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order
  on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
  proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion
  to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw.  The motion should be granted if there is no
  prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
DISCUSSION 
Counsel has submitted completed MC-051, MC-052, and
  MC-053 forms.  Counsel submitted a
  declaration stating that “Robin Saghian, Esq. of Omega Law Group, PC and
  Plaintiff, Ramses Gonzalez, have come to a point of irreconcilable
  differences with regards to further handling of this action.”  Counsel served the client by mail at the
  client's last known address with copies of the motion papers and confirmed
  within the past 30 days that the address is current by telephone and
  conversation.  Counsel has submitted
  proof of service on all parties who have appeared including Plaintiff. 
The Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s counsel's motion to be
  relieved as counsel.  Counsel will be
  relieved upon filing proof of service on the client of the Order Granting Attorney’s
  Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053). 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Counsel is ordered to file the proof of service of
  this ruling with the Court within five days.
