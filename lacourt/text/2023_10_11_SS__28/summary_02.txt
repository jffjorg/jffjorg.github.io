And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the petition filed by Zhe Jin, the attorney for Ethan Jin, regarding a minor's compromise. The petition sought approval of a settlement agreement between Ethan Jin and Bernendo Street Baptist Church, where Ethan Jin suffered a laceration over his right eyebrow. The judge found that the petition did not account for remaining medical expenses of $1,171.97 and that the petition did not provide proof of filing a notice of claim with the Director of Health Care Services. As a result, the judge cannot approve the minor's compromise.
