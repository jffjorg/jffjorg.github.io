Ethan Jin (“Claimant”) was attending Defendant Bernendo Street Baptist Church’s
(“Defendant”) when he hit his head while unsupervised. As a result of the
incident, Claimant suffered a laceration over his right eyebrow. 
This
is an expedited petition without a hearing, which is permitted under California
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.5, if Petitioner Zhe Jin (“Petitioner”) uses
the required Judicial Council forms and meets certain conditions. The
conditions are: 
1. Petitioner is represented
by an attorney.
2. The claim is not for
wrongful death.
3. Settlement proceeds will
not be placed in a trust.
4. There are no unresolved
liens.
5. Petitioner’s attorney did
not become involved at the request of Defendant or the insurance carrier.
6. Petitioner’s attorney is not
employed by or associated with a Defendant or insurance carrier in connection
with the petition.
7. If an action is filed, all
Defendants have appeared and are participating in the compromise OR the court
has determined that the settlement is in good faith.
8. The settlement, exclusive of
interests and costs, is $50,000 or less OR if greater than $50,000, the amount
payable is the insurance policy limits AND all proposed contributing parties
would be substantially unable to use assets other than the insurance policy limits
AND the court does not otherwise order. 
SETTLEMENT:
$25,000.00 
INJURIES:
Laceration over right eye 
MEDICAL
EXPENSES: $1,226 
COSTS:
$7,936.13 
ATTORNEY’S
FEES: $6,250.00, which is 25% of the gross settlement 
BALANCE
OF PROCEEDS: $10,791.46 
DISCUSSION: 
Section
13a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses, prior to reduction, were $1,226.00. Section 13a(3) states that the total medical expenses were
reduced by $31.62 as a result of negotiated, contractual, or statutory
reductions.  That should mean that the remaining
$1,194.38 will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  (For example, Section 13a(2) states that
$54.03 of the total medical expenses was paid. 
The person or entity that paid the $54.03 would need to be reimbursed
from the settlement proceeds.)  However,
Section 13a(4) of the petition states that only $22.41 is to be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
The petition does not account for the remaining $1,171.97 in medical
expenses. 
The
Court cannot approve a minor’s compromise unless it reimburses all medical
expenses that have not been reduced or waived. 
Section
13c(2)(a) of the petition states that a copy of the notice of claim given to
the Director of Health Care Services was filed in this matter on January 20,
2023. The Court has no record of such a filing. 
For
the reasons stated above, the Court denies the petition.
