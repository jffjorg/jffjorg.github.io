And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition for approval for transfer of structured settlement payment rights, without prejudice. The court cannot determine if the transfer is in the best interest of the payee because DBR Capital LLC represents that the transferor is both unemployed and has full-time employment. Additionally, DBR Capital LLC failed to comply with the formatting requirements of the written disclosure statement as outlined in California Insurance Code, section 10136, subdivision (b). The court also notes that there is no declaration from the transferor that she fully understands the terms of the transfer agreement. The court does not make the express findings as required by California Insurance Code, section 10139.5, subdivision (a)(1) through (6). DBR Capital LLC may amend their petition if they choose.
