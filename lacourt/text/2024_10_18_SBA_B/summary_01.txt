And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to abate the action for failure to join indispensable parties. The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to join the decedent's children, Marcus Perkins and Keith Perkins, as necessary parties under CCP §389. The judge finds that the decedent's children are known heirs under CCP §377.60 and thus "necessary parties" who must be joined as plaintiffs or nominal defendants. The judge orders the plaintiff to join and serve the decedent's children or file a declaration under CCP §377.32 attesting that she is the decedent's successor in interest/personal representative. The action is abated, and a status conference is set for January 13, 2025, to address the joinder of the decedent's children.
