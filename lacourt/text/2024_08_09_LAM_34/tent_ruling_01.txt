Background    
 
Plaintiffs Victor Silva, Maria Ramirez, Salma Silva and
Victor Silva, Jr., by and through his Guardian Ad Litem Maria Ramirez
(“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows: 
 
On or about 2000, Plaintiff Victor
Silva (“Victor”) and his wife Maria Ramirez (“Maria”) rented a dwelling at 321
N. Arizona Street, Los Angeles, California (hereafter “the Property”). They
have lived there since with their children, Plaintiffs Salma Silva and Victor
Silva, Jr. (collectively with Victor and Maria as “Plaintiffs”). On or about
November, 2018, Defendant Emma Nunez (“Emma” or “Defendant”) purchased the
Property and made her son, Defendant Sergio Nunez (“Sergio” and collectively
the “Defendants”), the property manager. At the time Defendant purchased the property,
Plaintiffs rent was approximately $685.00. 
 
Defendant illegally increased Plaintiffs
rent to $1,500.00 per month, and demanded Plaintiffs entered into a written
lease. On or about November, 2018, Plaintiffs Victor and Maria entered into a
written rental agreement with Defendants for the rental of the Property. 
 
Plaintiffs filed a complaint with the
County of Los Angeles Department of Consumer and Business Affairs, which
determined the rent increase was illegal and ordered Defendant to revert to the
pre-contract rent. 
 
During their tenancies, Plaintiffs
suffered from some or all of the following substandard condition, including but
not limited to: holes in the wall, cockroach infestation, defective electrical
outlets/receptacles, defective or damaged doors, defective and broken flooring;
peeling paint; leaking faucets; deteriorated stairs; lack and ineffective
waterproofing and weatherproofing. 
 
On or about January 2023, Defendant,
through her son and agent Defendant Sergio Nunez (“Sergio”), interrupted
electrical service to Plaintiffs’ unit. As such, only one room in the Property
has light. Despite Plaintiffs’ request to restore service, Defendant Sergio
told Plaintiff Victor to leave the dwelling if he did not like being without
electricity and that he would not restore the service to the dwelling. 
 
On February 14, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint,
asserting the following causes of action:
 
1.              
Civil Code section 1942.4
2.              
Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability
3.              
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
4.              
Nuisance
