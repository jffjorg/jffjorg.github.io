SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of foreclosure proceedings against
property owned by Edward Babalians (“Babalians”).  
 
In April 2007, Babalians obtained a mortgage loan on
property commonly known as 17239 Chatsworth Street, Unit #1, Granada Hills, CA
91344 (the “Property”) from Lender Inter Mountain Mortgage in the amount of
$143,000.00, memorialized by a Deed of Trust.  (SAC ¶¶ 1, 10 and Ex.A thereto).
 
The Second Amended Complaint alleges that in June 2022 Babalians
submitted a loss mitigation application to Defendant Rushmore Servicing,
formerly known as Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC (Rushmore).  (SAC¶ 14). 
The Second Amended Complaint alleges that a notice of default was
recorded on 8/23/22 and on 12/6/22, a notice of trustee’s sale was recorded.  (SAC ¶¶15, 21 and Ex.B and C thereto).  
 
The Second Amended Complaint alleges that Babalians filed
bankruptcy on 12/30/22.  (SAC ¶25).  The Second Amended Complaint alleges that
Babalians requested a reinstatement quote from Rushmore but was not provided
one until 1/2/23.  (SAC ¶26).  Babalians’ December bankruptcy case was
dismissed on 1/17/23.  (See
Request to Take Judicial Notice (“RJN”), Ex. 1).  
 
Babalians filed another bankruptcy case on 1/19/23.  (RJN, Ex.2). 
Babalians’ 2023 bankruptcy case was dismissed on 2/6/23.  (RJN, Ex.2). 
The foreclosure sale was held on 2/7/23. 
(SAC, 
¶33, Ex.D).  The
Second Amended Complaint alleges that on 2/7/23,  Babalians tendered reinstatement funds in the
form of a personal check.  (SAC ¶¶29, 32
and Ex.D thereto).  Rushmore returned the
reinstatement funds on 2/14/23.  (SAC ¶31).  
 
On 7/31/23, Babalians filed this action against Rushmore
and others alleging various causes of action for violation of the Homeowners’
Bill of Rights.  After filing the
complaint, Babalians died.  In response
to Rushmore’s demurrer to the original complaint, a First Amended Complaint was
filed by Plaintiff Hermina Gazmarian as Executor of the Estate of Edward
Babalians (Plaintiff).  Pursuant to a
stipulation between the parties, on 4/24/24, Plaintiff filed the subject Second
Amended Complaint alleging causes of action for: (1) Fraud; (2) Violation of
Civil Code 2923.5; (3) Violation of Civil Code 2923.6; (4) Violation of Civil
Code 2923.7; (5) Violation of Civil Code 2924.17 and (6) Violation of Business
& Professions Code 17200.
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Rushmore has with the Second Amended Complaint, on 6/20/24, Rushmore
filed and served the instant demurrer to the entire Second Amended
Complaint.  Plaintiff has opposed the
demurrer and Rushmore has filed a reply to the opposition.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Rushmore’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is
granted.  
 
Judicial Estoppel/Bankruptcy
 
Rushmore has failed 
to establish that Babalians’ failure to disclose the claims which are
the subject of this action in his bankruptcy filings judicially estops Plaintiff
from asserting them in this action.  Based
on the relief sought in the Second Amended Complaint, the damages did not
accrue until the foreclosure sale occurred on 2/7/23, after Babalians’
bankruptcy was dismissed.  
 
However, the Second Amended Complaint fails for other
reasons as set forth below.  
 
Standing
 
Plaintiff has failed to establish her standing to
continue this action.  Plaintiff has not
complied with the requirements of CCP 377.31 and/or CCP 377.32 in order to
continue this action after the death of the original plaintiff, Edward
Babalians.  
 
Plaintiff has also failed to establish that the quit
claim deed executed in 2022 whereby Babalians granted title to the Property to
Hermina Gazmarian provides Plaintiff with standing to bring this action as a third-party
beneficiary of the loan agreement which was executed years before in 2007.  Additionally, Plaintiff has not filed the
Second Amended Complaint in her individual capacity but rather as the purported
Executor of the Estate of Edward Babalians. 
As noted above, Plaintiff has failed to follow the proper procedures to
establish her standing to proceed with this action in place of Babalians.  See CCP 377.31; CCP 377.32.  
1st cause of action - Fraud
 
The elements of a fraud cause of action are: (1) misrepresentation
(a false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure), (2) knowledge of
falsity, (3) intent to defraud (to induce reliance), (4) justifiable reliance,
and (5) resulting damage.  Agosta
(2004) 120 CA4th 596, 603.  Additionally,
a fraud cause of action must be pled with factual specificity including facts
showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered..  Lazar (1996) 12 C4th
631, 645.  When pleading facts against a
corporate defendant, a plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made
the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to whom
they spoke, what they said or wrote and when it was said or written.  Id; Tarmann (1991) 2 CA4th 153,
157.
 
Plaintiff alleges that “Defendants” made
misrepresentations to Babalians that “he won’t have other options to avoid
foreclosure by asking him to submit a mortgage assistance application without
even exploring his financials.”  (SAC
¶48).  Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that
a Rushmore agent’s alleged inability to explain why it initiated foreclosure
constitutes fraud.  (SAC ¶¶59-60).  Based on the foregoing, it is not clear what,
if any, specific misrepresentations were made to Babalians.  Plaintiff also alleges that “Defendants” misrepresented
to Babalians that he would be able to reinstate the past due balance on the
loan at any time prior to the 2/7/23, 10:00 A.M. Trustee’s Sale.  (SAC ¶67). 
With regard to all of the purported misrepresentations, Plaintiff has
failed to allege exactly who made the misrepresentations, when, where, by what means,
etc. they were made.    
 
2nd cause of action - Violation of Civil
Code 2923.5
 
Civil Code 2923.5 requires a servicer to attempt to
contact a borrower, to assess their financial situation and explore options to
avoid foreclosure, at least 30 days before a notice of default is recorded.  Civil Code 2923.5(a)(2).  If the servicer is unable to speak with the
borrower, it may satisfy the outreach requirements by sending and making three
telephone calls.  Civil Code
2913.5(e).  In order to state a claim
under the Homeowners’ Bill of Rights (HOBR), a plaintiff must allege facts
showing that the alleged statutory violation was material.  Civil Code 2924.12(a)-(b); Civil Code
2924.19(a)-(b).
 
Here, it is not clear how the alleged violation of Civil
Code 2923.5 was material as Plaintiff admits that in early May of 2022, she
contacted Rushmore on behalf of Babalians to inquire about loss mitigation
options and was instructed to submit a mortgage assistance application.  (SAC ¶13). 
Therefore, even if Rushmore did not contact Babalians as required,
Plaintiff, acting as his agent, communicated with Rushmore and was instructed to
submit a loss mitigation application which they did.  (SAC ¶¶13-14).  The Notice of Default was not recorded
against the Property until 8/23/22, more than 30 days later.  (SAC ¶15). 

 
3rd cause of action – Violation of Civil
Code 2923.6
 
Civil Code 2923.6 requires the submission of a complete loan
modification application at least 5 business days before a scheduled
foreclosure sale to prevent the sale from proceeding.  See Civil Code 2923.6(c).  Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that a
complete loan modification application was submitted.  Rather, Plaintiff alleges that Babalians has
attempted to apply for loan modifications with Defendants, but agents would
repeatedly ask for the same documents. 
It is not clear whether Plaintiff is alleging a complete application was
submitted and despite such, Rushmore repeatedly asked for the same documents.  (See SAC ¶93).
 
4th cause of action – Violation of Civil
Code 2923.7
 
Civil Code 2923.7 requires a loan servicer to appoint a
single point of contact (SPOC) after a borrower requests a foreclosure
prevention alternative.  Civil Code 2923.7(a).  The SPOC is responsible for providing
information to the borrower and for having access to people who can halt the
foreclosure sale when appropriate.  Civil
Code 2923.7(b).  The SPOC can be an
individual or a team of personnel.  Civil
Code 2923.7(e).
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff sufficiently alleged
Rushmore failed to provide a SPOC in violation of Civil Code 2923.7.  (SAC ¶¶106-107).  However, the cause of action still fails due to
the standing issue noted above.  
 
5th cause of action – Violation of Civil
Code 2924.17
 
Civil Code 2924.17 provides that “[a] declaration
recorded pursuant to Section 2923.5 or ... pursuant to Section 2923.55, a
notice of default, notice of sale, assignment of a deed of trust, or
substitution of trustee recorded by or on behalf of a mortgage servicer in
connection with a foreclosure subject to the requirements of Section 2924, or a
declaration or affidavit filed in any court relative to a foreclosure
proceeding shall be accurate and complete and supported by competent and
reliable evidence.”  Civil Code 2924.17(a).  Civil Code 2924.17(b) provides that “[b]efore
recording or filing any of the documents described in subdivision (a), a
mortgage servicer shall ensure that it has reviewed competent and reliable
evidence to substantiate the borrower’s default and the right to foreclose,
including the borrower’s loan status and loan information.”  
 
This cause of action is based, at least in part, on
Rushmore’s purported violations of Civil Code 2923.5 and 2923.6, which as noted
above are insufficiently pled.  (See
SAC ¶120).  As such, this cause of action
is also insufficiently pled.        
 
6th cause of action – Violation of Business
& Professions Code 17200
 
This cause of action is based on the statutory violations
alleged in the 2nd-5th causes of action.  (See SAC ¶¶131, 133, 137-141).  Since those claims are deficient, as set
forth above, this cause of action also fails to state a claim.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained.  Although this is already the Second Amended
Complaint, since this is the first time the pleading is before the Court and
due to the liberal policy of allowing leave to amend, Plaintiff is given the
opportunity to try to cure the defects in the Second Amended Complaint.  
 
A Third Amended Complaint is due to be filed and served
within 30 days.
