```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has denied BSD's motion to vacate default in this case. The case arises from a foreclosure on a mechanic's lien, and BSD claims that its counsel's illness prevented it from timely responding to the complaint. However, the judge concludes that none of the grounds supporting the grant of discretionary relief are present, including mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The judge notes that BSD's counsel did not provide any evidence of her illness, and that the representative, Yoseh Illulian, did not provide any details about the nature of the illness. The judge also notes that the lien may not be enforceable because Plaintiff did not provide preliminary notice, but this is a matter that should be addressed in a demurrer or other dispositive motion, rather than in a motion to vacate default.
