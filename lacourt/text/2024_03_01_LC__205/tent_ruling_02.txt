 Case Number:  23SMCV04335    Hearing Date:   March 1, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  CALIFORNIA ACCESS SCAFFOLD, LLC,   Plaintiff, v.  ONE SILVER SERVE, INC., et al.,    Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV04335     Hearing Date:  March 1, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANT BSD PROPERTIES 18, LLC’S     MOTION TO VACATE DEFAULT    BACKGROUND This case arises from a foreclosure on a mechanic’s lien.  Defendant One Silver Serve, Inc. (“One Silver”) entered into a written agreement with Plaintiff California Access Scaffold, LLC, for scaffolding services.  Plaintiff supplied the requested scaffolding and related labor for work on property located at 9930 Santa Monica, Blvd, Beverly Hills, California (the “Property”).  Defendant BSD Properties 18, LLC aka BAS Properties 18 LLC owns the Property.   In the midst of the construction project, a dispute arose between One Silver and BSD, and One Silver stopped work on the Property.  Plaintiff’s scaffolding was left on the Property, and Plaintiff was unable to recover the scaffolding because BSD refused access to the Property.  After One Silver failed to pay Plaintiff, Plaintiff recorded a mechanic’s lien with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office.   Plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit, alleging six claims for (1) foreclose lien, (2) open book account, (3) account stated, (4) reasonable value, (5) breach of contract, and (6) statutory labor and materials bond.  Plaintiff served the complaint on BSD on September 26, 2023.  Service is not contested. Plaintiff granted four extensions to BSD to respond to the Complaint.  On December 29, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to grant a last extension through January 5, 2024, over one hundred days after the Complaint had been served.  No answer or any responsive pleading was filed by BSD on January 5, 2024.  Plaintiff sought entry of default, which was entered by the Clerk’s office on January 17, 2024.  On January 23, 2024, a week after default was already entered, BSD’s counsel, Jasmine Duel, advised Plaintiff that she was no longer representing BSD due to “illness or other reasons.”       This hearing is on BSD’s motion to vacate default.  BSD seeks discretionary relief under Code Civ. Proc. 473(b) on grounds of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect of its attorney.  Specifically, BSD claims that its counsel fell ill and did not timely respond to the Complaint.   LEGAL STANDARD Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)¿provides, in relevant part: “The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken¿against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence,¿surprise, or excusable neglect.  Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) The court has broad discretion to vacate the entry of default, default judgment, a dismissal, or other proceeding, but that discretion can be exercised only if the moving party establishes a proper ground for relief, by the proper procedure and within the set time limits. Pursuant to¿Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), a motion to vacate cannot be brought more than six months after the proceeding was taken and must be made within a “reasonable time.” Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)¿allows a court to vacate a prior order upon a showing that the order was entered due to a party's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  The terms mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect which warrant relief under¿Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)¿are defined as follows: Mistake may be one of¿fact or law.  Mistake of¿fact occurs when a person understands the¿facts to be other than they are; a mistake of¿law occurs when a person knows the¿facts as they really are, but has a¿mistaken belief as to¿the legal consequences of those¿facts.  (People v. Kelly (1939) 35 Cal.App.2d 571, 574.)  “Mistake is not a ground for relief under¿section 473, subdivision (b), when the court finds that the ‘mistake’ is simply the result¿of professional incompetence, general ignorance of the law, or unjustifiable negligence in discovering the law”.  (Henderson v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 215, 229-230.)   Further, the term “surprise,” as used in¿section 473, refers to “some condition or situation in which a party … is unexpectedly placed to his injury, without any default or negligence of his own, which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against.”  (Id. at 229-230.)   Finally, as for inadvertence or neglect, “[t]o warrant relief under¿section 473¿a litigant’s neglect must have been such as might have been the act of a reasonably prudent person under the same circumstances.”  (Henderson, 187 Cal.App.4th at 229-230.)  A lawyer’s failure to discharge routine professional duties is not excusable.  “Conduct falling below the professional standard of care, such as the failure to timely object or to properly advance an argument is not therefore excusable.”  (Generale Bank Nederland N.V. v. Eyes of the Beholder Ltd. (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1400.)   Where the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect is excusable “and the party seeking relief has been diligent, courts have often granted relief pursuant to the discretionary relief provision of¿section 473¿if no prejudice to the opposing party will ensue.” (Id.)  In such situations only “very slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting aside the default.”  (Miller v. City of Hermosa Beach (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1118, 1136.)   Moreover, because the law strongly favors trial and disposition on¿the merits, “any doubts in applying [Code of Civil Procedure] section 473¿must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default. Therefore, a trial court order denying relief is scrutinized more carefully than an order permitting trial on the merits.” (McCormick¿v.¿Board of Supervisors, 198 Cal.App.3d at 359-360 citing,¿Elston¿v.¿City of Turlock¿(1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233.) EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS  The Court overrules Plaintiff’s objections to paragraphs 6, 12, 13 and sustains Plaintiff’s objections to paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 of the Declaration of Yoseh Illulian. DISCUSSION BSD seeks discretionary relief under Code Civ. Proc. § 437, subdivision (b).  The Court concludes that none of the grounds supporting the grant of discretionary relief are present here. BSD is not claiming any kind of mistake.  There is no indication that BSD was mistaken about the fact that Plaintiff had given it an extension only until January 5, 2024 or the law that it had an obligation to respond as of the last extension granted by Plaintiff.  Rather, BSD blames its counsel’s illness for the failure to timely respond.        There is also no evidence of surprise.  While BSD claims its counsel had suddenly taken ill, there is no admissible proof of this fact.  There is no declaration from counsel herself.  There is also no showing the illness prevented counsel from timely responding to the Complaint after she had been given numerous extensions and had over 100 days to respond to the Complaint.   BSD also cannot show excusable neglect as there is no admissible evidence of its counsel’s illness.  Even if the Court were to credit the declaration by BSD’s representative, Yoseph Illulian, the assertion that counsel was ill is too conclusory and lacking in any details.  The Court and Plaintiff are left to guess as to the nature of counsel’s illness, when it started, how long it lasted, when it ended, and therefore whether the failure to timely file an answer was excusable and one that a reasonably prudent person would have failed to do under the same or similar circumstances.   In its reply, BSD claims that the “mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect” was not on the part of its attorney, but rather, was on the part of Joseph Illulian, a non-attorney with no experience in dealing with mechanic’s lien issues, who was trying to help his aging father who was in ill health handle an ongoing business dispute.  BSD claims Illulian was mistaken in believing the attorney he initially hired would obtain sufficient time for him to locate another attorney who could represent BSD.  Despite Illulian’s alleged good faith efforts, he claims he could not find an attorney quickly enough before the default was entered.  These facts are not found in Illulian’s declaration.  Accordingly, the Court does not credit them.     BSD also argues that the lien may not be enforced because Plaintiff did not provide preliminary notice.  Absent proof of proper and timely service of a preliminary notice, BSD argues Plaintiff’s mechanic lien claim has no legal basis.  This argument, however, goes to the merits of the mechanic’s lien claim and is more properly addressed in a demurrer or other dispositive motion.  But the Court cannot entertain such a motion when default has been entered.  “The entry of a default terminates a defendant's rights to take any further affirmative steps in the litigation until either its default is set aside or a default judgment is entered.”  (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385.)¿ CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES BSD’s motion to vacate default.      IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: March 1, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
