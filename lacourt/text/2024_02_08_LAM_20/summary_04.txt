**Significant Statements:**

* The Court does not see why preemption or res judicata would apply to the extent that the subject transfer of assets never took place pursuant to the bankruptcy proceedings.
* The idea that Defendants cannot be sued simply because MS filed a bankruptcy petition and there was a determination of no assets makes little sense.
* The transfer of assets from MS to EE without court approval is a disputed issue.
* There is no evidence to establish a conspiracy between Hindin and the other Defendants.
* The formation of a conspiracy requires knowledge of the wrongful plan and agreement to achieve it.
