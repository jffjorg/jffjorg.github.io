And here is the English-text summary:

This is a medical malpractice action brought by Ana Cordova and Luis Cordova against Shuo Steven Wang. The plaintiffs are seeking a trial preference under California Code of Civil Procedure section 36(a) to have the trial set on May 20, 2024. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that there is no declaration that all essential parties have appeared and that there is no prejudice without a preference, citing that the plaintiff has already received substantial settlements and her expert has stated she will live another ten years.

The court finds that Ana Cordova has a substantial interest in the action as a whole and that her health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing her interest in the litigation. The court notes that Ana Cordova has paralysis, which can lead to ulcers and potential infections, and is at increased risk for various health complications.

The court grants the request for trial preference and sets the trial date for June 7, 2024. The court also grants the Request for Judicial Notice. The moving parties are directed to give notice, and counsel are strongly encouraged to appear remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
