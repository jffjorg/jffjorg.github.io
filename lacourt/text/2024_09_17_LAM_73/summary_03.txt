And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant RN Wellness, LLC's motion for relief from entry of default. The motion was filed on August 16, 2024, and is a renewed motion after the initial motion was denied on August 8, 2024. The judge found that Defendant's counsel failed to present new or different facts, circumstances, or law that were not available at the time of filing the prior motion, and failed to provide an explanation for not having presented the new or different information earlier. The judge also found that the Defendant's counsel's mistakes were not the cause of the entry of default, and that the Defendant had not established a basis to set aside the default under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The judge ordered the moving party to give notice of the denial of the motion.
