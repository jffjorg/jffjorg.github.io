As an initial matter, it does not appear that default
has been entered yet against Defendants. 
Plaintiff filed a request for entry on April 23,
2024. 
On April 24, 2024, a notice of rejection
default/clerk’s judgment was filed. The clerk’s rejection states, in relevant
part:
“#1c Request for default defendant
name listed does not match, missing "company". Defendant's name
listed on Summons DOES NOT match to name listed on the Complaint. No Proof of
Service on Amendment to Complaint 4-22-24 (court order to correct plaintiff's
name). Proof of service 2-1-24--Proof of service by Mail--defendant name listed
does not match to #3a POS 010- No Proof of mailing to named defendant Michael
Ndinwa. No Proof of Service on Amendment to Complaint 4-22-24 (court
order to correct plaintiff's name).”
The Court may not enter judgment prior to entry
of default. (CCP § 585; L.A. SUP. CT. L.R. 3.200(a).)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED
without prejudice.
