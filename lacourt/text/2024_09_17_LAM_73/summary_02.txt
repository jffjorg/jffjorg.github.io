And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff had filed a request for entry of default against the defendants, Sky Power Secure Solutions, Inc. and Michael Ndinwa, alleging that they had violated various labor laws during the plaintiff's employment from February 2020 to July 21, 2022. The plaintiff sought judgment against the defendants for $124,941.38, which includes damages, interest, costs, and attorney fees. However, the judge noted that default had not yet been entered against the defendants, and instead, a notice of rejection of default/clerk's judgment was filed due to errors in the defendant's name and proof of service. The judge ruled that the court may not enter judgment prior to entry of default, and therefore, the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment was denied without prejudice. The case will proceed to a hearing on September 17, 2024, to address the plaintiff's request for entry of default.
