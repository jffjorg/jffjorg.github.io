TENTATIVE
RULING 
 
The
petition for approval of structured settlement payments is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 17, 2024, Petitioner Intelifund, LLC (“Petitioner”) filed a
petition for approval of transfer of structured settlement payment rights. Petitioner
brings this petition on behalf of third party in interest, M.D. (“Payee”),
pursuant to Insurance Code §§10139.3(b), 10139.5(c). 
 
On July 25, 2024, Petitioner filed a notice of motion for order
approving transfer of structured settlement payment rights. Petitioner seeks
court approval of a proposed transfer of structured settlement payments.¿
 
No opposition was filed.
II.
DISCUSSION
 
A
direct or indirect transfer of structured settlement payment rights is not
effective unless the transfer has been approved by a court order
finding:¿¿ 
¿ 
(1) The transfer is in the best interest of the payee, considering
the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents.¿ 
(2) The payee has been advised in writing by the transferee to seek independent
professional advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice
or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice. ¿ 
(3) The transferee has complied with the notification requirements pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has provided the payee with a disclosure
form that complies with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement complies with
Sections 10136 and 10138. ¿ 
(4) The transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the
order of any court or other government authority.¿ 
(5) The payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the
terms set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136. ¿ 
(6) The payee understands and does not wish to exercise the
payee’s right to cancel the transfer agreement.¿¿ 
¿ 
(Ins. Code § 10139.5(a).)¿ 
 
As a result of a personal injury settlement entered into when she
was a minor, Payee M.D. became entitled to certain structured settlement
payments. (Petition, Exh. 2.)¿ 
¿ 
Payee and Petitioner, as Assignee, have entered into a Structured
Settlement Payments Purchase Agreement, under which Payee is to sell future
payments totaling $119,750.60 in exchange for a purchase price of $10,028.27.
(Petition, Exh. 2.)¿¿ 
¿ 
The discounted present value of the amount being sold is $33,068.85,
calculated by applying the 5.6% applicable federal interest rate most recently
published by the Internal Revenue Service. (Petition, Exh. 2.)¿¿If Payee
did not sell the right to receive structured settlement payments but instead
borrowed the net amount and paid that loan back in installments with each of
the payments she is now selling, the equivalent interest rate would be 11.61%
per year. (Ibid.)¿ 
¿ 
All of this information has been properly disclosed to Payee by
way of the disclosure form in compliance with Insurance Code § 10136, as
required by § 10139.5(a)(3). (Petition, Exh. 4.) Payee was advised in writing
to seek independent professional advice, both legal and financial. (Ibid.)
Payee chose not to seek an independent professional’s advice. (Petition, Exh. 7.)
Thus, Petitioner has complied with the statutory disclosure requirements. (Ins.
Code § 10139.5(a)(2).)¿ 
¿ 
The transfer agreement (Exh. 2) also complies with Insurance Code
§§ 10136 and 10138 as required by § 10139.5(a)(3). It does not contravene any
applicable statute or order of any court or other governmental authority. (Ins.
Code § 10139.5(a)(4).)¿¿ 
¿ 
Copies of the relevant portions of the annuity contract, qualified
assignment agreement, and underlying structured settlement agreement were
submitted as required by Ins. Code § 10139.5(f)(2)(E)-(G). 
¿ 
A.    
Information About Transferor¿ 
¿ 
Payee is 25 years old. (Declaration of M.D., ¶ 4).¿Payee has
indicated that she resides in Los Angeles County, California and has disclosed
her address. (Ibid.) Payee has stated that she is unmarried as required
by Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(2). (Ibid.) Payee has stated that she has
one minor child as required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(3). (Ibid.)
¿ 
Payee has indicated that she is employed and has therefore
attested as to the amount and source of her monthly income as required by
Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(4). (Ibid.)
¿ 
Payee has stated that she has no child support obligations, as
required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(5). (Id., ¶ 5.)¿ 
¿ 
Payee has provided information regarding previous transfers, as
required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(c)(6). (Id., ¶¶ 6-7.)¿ 
¿ 
In sum, Payee has provided all of the information required by
Insurance Code § 10139.5(c).
¿ 
Given the foregoing, the Court finds that the transfer is fair, reasonable
and in the best interest of Payee. (Insurance Code § 10139.5(a)(1) &
(b)(1)-(15).)¿ The Payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement,
including those set forth in the § 10136 disclosure statement, as required by
Insurance Code § 10139.5(a)(5). In signing the California Disclosure Statement
and in her declaration and affidavit in support of to the Petition, Payee has
evidenced an understanding of the right to cancel and election not to cancel
the transfer agreement, as required by Insurance Code § 10139.5(a)(6).¿ 
¿ 
Thus, Petitioner has met all the procedural requirements under the
Insurance Code. The Petitioner has also served a copy of the notice to all
interested parties and the Attorney General.¿¿ 
¿ 
Accordingly, the petition for approval of structured settlement
payments is GRANTED. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
The petition for approval of structured settlement payments is
GRANTED.
