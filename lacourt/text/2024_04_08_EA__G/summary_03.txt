Here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the application for default judgment filed by National Commercial Recovery, Inc. (NCR) against the Lin Defendants. The case is a collections action, where NCR seeks to collect a debt of $67,960, plus interest, attorney fees, and costs, from the Lin Defendants. The Lin Defendants allegedly purchased wholesale poultry from Leyen Food, LLC, but failed to make full payment. Leyen assigned its rights to NCR, which then filed a complaint and served process on the Lin Defendants. Default was entered against the Lin Defendants on January 23, 2024, and NCR has now applied for default judgment. The court has found that NCR has submitted sufficient evidence to support its application and has granted the request for default judgment in the amount of $78,735.26.
