 Case Number:  23PSCV01933    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. From August 2022 to February 2023, Defendants T &
R Enterprise USA Inc.; Royal Wholesale Food Inc.; Ringo Lin Family Partnership,
L.P.; Howard Lin; Ringo Lin; and Jesse Lin (collectively, Lin Defendants) allegedly
purchased wholesale poultry from Leyen Food, LLC (Leyen) on an open book
account. Subsequently, the Lin Defendants allegedly failed to make full payment
upon demand by Leyen and owe an outstanding balance of $67,960. Leyen then
assigned its rights to Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc. (NCR).
On June
28, 2023, NCR filed a complaint against the Lin Defendants and Does 1-10 alleging
the following causes of action: (1) open book account, (2) goods sold and
delivered, and (3) account stated. On October 23, NCR’s process server served
the Lin Defendants with substitute service in Lilburn, Georgia.
On January
23, 2024, default was entered against the Lin Defendants. On March 13, NCR
submitted the present application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for April 8, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
NCR
seeks default judgment against the Lin Defendants in the total amount of $78,735.26,
including $67,960 in damages, $8,690.26 in interest, $1,200 in attorney fees,
and $885 in costs. Because the court finds NCR has submitted sufficient
evidence, the court GRANTS NCR’s application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, NCR’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
