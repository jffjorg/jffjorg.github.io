  Case Number:  22PSCV00799    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Manuel Meza, Jr.’s Motion for Attorney Fee,
Costs, and Expenses
Respondent: Defendant General
Motors, LLC
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Manuel Meza, Jr.’s Motion for Attorney Fee,
Costs, and Expenses is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $21,655.50 in attorney
fees and $744.81 in costs.
BACKGROUND
In
September 2018, Plaintiff Manuel Meza, Jr. entered into a warranty contract
with Defendant General Motors, LLC (General Motors) by purchasing a 2018
Chevrolet Camaro. Subsequently during the warranty period, Meza alleges the
vehicle developed defects with its transmission system.
On
July 29, 2022, Meza filed a complaint against General Motors and Does 1-50,
alleging (1)¿violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (d); (2)
violation of Civil Code section 1793.2, subdivision (b); (3) violation of Civil
Code section 1793.2, subdivision (a)(3); (4) breach of express warranty; and
(5) breach of implied warranty of merchantability.
On
September 29, 2023, General Motors sent Meza a settlement offer that Meza
accepted on October 31. On January 5, 2024, Meza submitted a memorandum of
costs. On January 18, General Motors filed a motion to tax Meza’s memorandum of
costs. On March 4, the court granted General Motors’ motion in part.
On March
15, 2024, Meza filed the present motion. A hearing on the present motion is set for April 8,
with a final status conference on May 13 and a jury trial on May 21.
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL
NOTICE
Meza requests that the court
take judicial notice of twenty trial court rulings on similar attorney fee
motions. Pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d), “[j]udicial
notice may be taken of . . . . [r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2)
any court of record of the United States or of any state of the United States.”
Because these trial court rulings are records of state and federal courts, the
court GRANTS Meza’s request. But in doing so, the court notes that these
decisions and rulings are neither precedent nor binding authority for this
court. (B.F. v. Superior Court (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 621, 627, fn. 2.)
ANALYSIS
Meza
moves the court for an award of reasonable attorney fees in the amount of $44,204.50
and costs in the amount of $1,533.72. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS Meza’s motion in
the reduced amount of $21,655.50
in attorney fees and $744.81 in costs.
Legal
Standard
Pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act, a prevailing buyer “shall be allowed by the court to recover as
part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court
to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) They
have “the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably necessary to
the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v.
Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785,
817.) In granting their motion, “[a] trial court may not rubber stamp a request
for attorney fees, but must determine the number of hours reasonably expended.”
(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 38 (Morris),
quoting Donahue v. Donahue (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 259, 271.) “If the
time expended or the monetary charge being made for the time expended are not
reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court must take this into
account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.” (Nightingale v. Hyundai
Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)
Calculation of attorney fees
begins with the lodestar approach in which the court fixes the lodestar at “the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”
(Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004,
quoting Copeland v. Marshall (D.C. Cir. 1980) 641 F.2d 880, 891.)
“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Ibid.) “The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The factors to be
considered include the nature and difficulty of the litigation, the amount of
money involved, the skill required and employed to handle the case, the
attention given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.” (EnPalm,
LLC v. Teitler (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774.)
“It is appropriate for a
trial court to reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a
routine, noncomplex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant
inefficiencies and inflated fees resulted.” (Morris, supra, 41
Cal.App.5th at p. 39.) It is also appropriate to reduce a fee award based on
“inefficient or duplicative efforts” in the billing record. (Id., at p.
38.) But the analysis must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general
notions about the fairness of the fee award. (Kerkeles v. City of San Jose
(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88, 102.) And in conducting the analysis, courts are not
permitted to tie any reductions in the fee award to some proportion of the
buyer’s damages recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30
Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)
Discussion
In this case, Meza argues Meza
is entitled to a total of $39,204.50 in attorney fees and an additional $5,000
in attorney fees for the present motion. In opposition, General Motors argues Meza’s
requested fees and costs should be reduced to $18,457.81.
Prevailing Party
On September 29, 2023, General Motors sent Meza a
settlement offer that Meza accepted on October 31 in which General Motors agreed to pay Meza $88,727.78
for Meza’s vehicle. Thus, Meza qualifies as the prevailing party in this action
and is entitled to attorney fees and costs.
Reasonableness of
Hourly Rate
Meza’s counsel requests
hourly rates of $515 per hour for Julian A. Moore and $350 per hour for Joseph
Kowalski. (Moore Decl., ¶ 23.) In opposition, General Motors argues Meza failed
to produce evidence showing that a court in Los Angeles County has approved
these requested rates.
To determine if an hourly
rate is reasonable, courts consider the rates of similar attorneys in the community
as well as “the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting
fees.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th
972, 1009.) Here, Moore’s declaration provides an overview of Moore and
Kowalski’s experience. (Moore Decl., ¶ 23.) Based on this information and the
court’s own experience, the court finds the requested rates of $515 per hour
and $350 per hour to be reasonable. But despite Moore’s declaration, the
billing statements show Moore charged an increased hourly rate of $530 for 12.9
hours. (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 1, 4-6.) Thus, the court reduces the hourly
rate charged for these hours to $515 and accordingly reduces the total amount
by $193.50 ($6,837.00 reduced to
$6,643.50).
In addition to Moore and
Kowalski, Meza’s request also includes attorney fees of $35.00 for Arbre
Kornley (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 19.) and $376.50 for Jessica Anvar (Moore
Decl., Ex. 24, p. 53.). Because Meza failed to provide any declarations that
establish whether the rates charged by these attorneys were reasonable, the
court declines to award any attorney fees incurred by these attorneys, which
the court calculates at $411.50.
Reasonableness of Hours
Billed
Meza contends that the 99.1
hours spent by counsel in this action was reasonable. (Motion, p. 9:20.) In
opposition, General Motors contends that a total of 57.9 of the hours incurred
were not actually and reasonably incurred.
Although a verified fee bill
is “prima facie evidence the costs, expenses and services listed were
necessarily incurred,” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677,
682), counsel still has the burden to demonstrate the reasonableness of
charges. (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240, 247.) The court reviewed the fee bill submitted by Meza and
the proposed reductions by General Motors and addresses the parties’
contentions below.
Clerical Work
General Motors argues the
court should decline to award fees for the 4.0 hours spent by paralegals on
clerical work. (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 1-3, 5.) Upon review of these entries,
it appears this time was billed in the following manner.
On February 27, 2024, Katherine
Carreno billed 0.10 hours for calendaring a motion to tax costs. (Moore Decl.,
Ex. 24, p. 1.) On February 20, Carreno billed 2.0 hours for filing Meza’s
opposition to General Motors’ motion to tax costs (0.10 hours), emailing
counsel (0.10 hours), drafting an opposition to “memo of cost” (1.10 hours), and
reviewing invoices (0.70 hours). (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 1-2.) On February 2,
Carreno billed 0.10 hours for conducting a review of a “docket audit.” (Moore
Decl., Ex. 24, p. 2.) On January 29, Carreno billed 0.50 hours for filing a
notice of trial continuance (0.10 hours), emailing counsel regarding trial
continuance (0.10 hours), receipt of drafted notice of trial continuance (0.20 hours),
and receipt and review of calendared motion to tax costs (0.10 hours). (Moore
Decl., Ex. 24, p. 2.) On January 16, Carreno billed 0.50 hours for calendaring
continued motion for attorney fees (0.20 hours) and finalizing motion for
attorney fees (0.30 hours). (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 3.) Last, on January 5,
Carreno billed 0.40 hours for filing memorandum of costs (0.10 hours), emailing
memorandum of costs to counsel (0.10 hours), and saving drafted memorandum of
costs to file (0.20 hours). (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 5.)
While the court agrees that
many of these entries appear to be clerical or secretarial tasks rather than legal
work, some of the entries do involve legal work including the 1.80 hours spent
drafting an opposition to General Motors’ motion to tax costs and 0.30 hours
spent finalizing the present motion. Accordingly, the court will only reduce
Meza’s requested hours for these entries by 1.5 hours at an hourly rate of $200
per hour for a total reduction of $300.
General Motors also argues
the court should strike 1.2 hours of clerical work that was billed by Meza’s
counsel. But General Motors failed to provide specific citations and dates for
these billing entries and instead references the entire billing statement.
Thus, the court declines to make this requested deduction.
Discovery
General Motors contends the
court should reduce fees awarded for Meza’s discovery requests, review of
General Motors’ discovery responses, discovery motion practice, and Meza’s
discovery responses.
First, Meza requests fees for
7.0 hours spent preparing discovery requests billed as follows: On September 8,
2022, Kowalski billed 1.8 hours for reviewing and analyzing technical service
bulletins in preparation for drafting discovery requests. (Moore Decl., Ex. 24,
p. 46.) On September 22, Kowalski billed 3.1 hours for reviewing repair orders
to create a defect definition and drafting discovery requests. (Moore Decl.,
Ex. 24, p. 45-46.) On October 26, Kowalski billed 1.3 hours for continued
drafting of discovery requests. (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 45.) On the same day,
Moore billed 0.4 hours for reviewing and editing the discovery requests. (Moore
Decl., Ex. 24, p. 44.) On October 28, Kowalski billed 0.4 hours for finalizing
the drafting of discovery requests. (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 44.)
In opposition, General Motors
contends the court should reduce the time spent drafting the discovery requests
to 1.0 hour billed at Kowalski’s hourly rate as the discovery requests
submitted were templated discovery requests. Upon review of Meza’s discovery requests,
the court agrees with General Motors’ analysis. The discovery requests included
a request for admissions, request for production of documents, special
interrogatories, and a notice of deposition for General Motors’ person most
qualified, all of which appear to be standard Song-Beverly Act discovery
requests with minimal edits tailored to the subject vehicle. (Quezada Decl.,
Ex. A, C.) Given the experience of counsel with lemon law cases, the court
finds a request of 8.0 hours is unjustified and reduces the time requested to 2.0
hours with 1.6 hours billed at Kowalski’s hourly rate and 0.4 hours billed at
Moore’s hourly rate. Accordingly, the court reduces the total requested fees by
$1,750.
Second, Meza requests fees for 4.5 hours spent preparing
for depositions of third-party dealers billed as follows. On September 22,
2022, Kowalski billed 1.0 hours for reviewing repair orders to identify
dealerships and technicians and for drafting deposition materials. (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 45.) On September 23,
Kowalski billed 0.5 hours for continuing to draft dealership subpoenas and for
two dealerships and three technicians. (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 45.) On October
31, Kowalski billed 2.2 hours for finalizing the drafting of the deposition
notices and subpoenas. (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 44.) On November 14, Kowalski
billed 0.5 hours addressing service issues with regards to one of the
dealership deposition subpoenas. (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 42.) On November 15,
Moore billed 0.3 hours for reviewing and analyzing deposition objections by
Culver City Chevrolet. (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 42.) In opposition, General
Motors contends the court should eliminate this request as the depositions were
never confirmed and would not have materially advance the parties’ claims or
defenses. The court agrees as Meza failed to demonstrate why these depositions
were reasonably necessary. Accordingly, the court declines to award the
requested fees in the amount of $1,624.50.
Third, Meza requests fees for 7.0 hours spent
reviewing General Motors’ discovery responses and drafting meet-and-confer
correspondence billed as follows. On December 12, 2022, Kowalski billed 3.0
hours for reviewing General Motors’ responses for a discovery plan and drafting
a meet-and-confer letter. (Moore
Decl., Ex. 24, p. 38.) On the same day, Kowalski billed another 4.0 hours for
reviewing discovery responses which included several hundred pages of repair
orders, technical service bulletin lists, warranty information, and manuals.
(Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 38.) In opposition, General Motors contends the court
should reduce the amount of spent by 5.0 hours as General Motors contends it
should not have taken more than two hours to review documents and make changes
to a templated meet-and-confer letter. While the court agrees that 7.0 hours
for reviewing discovery responses and drafting a meet-and-confer letter is excessive
in a standard lemon law case, the court declines to make General Motors’
requested reduction and instead reduces the time awarded by 2.5 hours and
reduces the total requested fees by $875.
Fourth, Meza requests fees for 28.3 hours spent
on discovery motion practice by Kowalski including 8.3 hours billed for
drafting a motion to compel deposition of General Motors’ person most qualified
(Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 34
(3/27/2023), 36 (1/13/2023), 37 (1/4/2023)), 12.0 hours billed for drafting a
motion to compel requests for production (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 30
(4/19/2023), 31 (4/18/2023)), and 8.0 hours drafting a reply in support of
Meza’s motion to compel (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 24 (7/3/2023 and 7/5/2023). In
opposition, General Motors contends these motions were templated and should be
reduced to 0.5 hours for the motion to compel deposition, 1.0 hour for the
motion to compel, and 1.0 hour for the reply in support of the motion to
compel. The
court agrees these discovery motions appear to be boilerplate lemon law
discovery motions and accordingly reduces the time requested to 2.0 hours for
the motion to compel deposition, 2.0 hours for the motion to compel, and 1.0 hour
for the reply in support of the motion to compel. Thus, the court reduces the
total requested fees by $8,155.
Last, Meza requests fees for 3.0 hours billed by
Kowalski for responding to General Motors’ discovery requests. (Moore Decl., Ex. 24, p. 26 (5/22/2023).) In
opposition, General Motors contends these were templated responses that should not
have taken more than thirty minutes. But upon review, the court disagrees and
finds the amount of time spent on these responses was not excessive.
Accordingly, the court declines to reduce the fees incurred for Meza’s
responses to General Motors’ discovery.
Fees for the Present
Motion
General Motors maintains
counsel’s billing of 21.1 hours for the drafting of the present motion as well
as the drafting of a reply and attending a hearing on the motion is excessive. The
court agrees and reduces the time to 2.0 hours of drafting, 1.0 hour of
drafting the reply, and 0.5 hours attending the hearing at Moore’s hourly rate
of $515. Accordingly, the court reduces counsel’s requested fees of $11,042 ($6,042
+ estimated $5,000) by $9,239.50.
Costs
Meza also requests the court
award costs in the amount of $1,533.72. In granting General Motors’ previous
motion to tax costs in part, the court struck $788.91 in costs. (3/4/2024
Ruling, p. 2.) Accordingly, the court awards costs to Meza in the reduced
amount of $744.81.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Meza’s
motion for attorney fees and costs is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $21,655.50
in attorney fees and $744.81 in costs.
