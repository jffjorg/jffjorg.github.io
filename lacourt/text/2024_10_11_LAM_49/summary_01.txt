And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Randolph M. Hammock has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit brought by Monica Sanchez against Marriott International, Inc. The lawsuit alleges that Marriott used spyware on its website to obtain Sanchez's personal data without her consent. Marriott has moved to quash service of summons, arguing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it.

The judge has granted Marriott's motion, finding that the court lacks general jurisdiction over Marriott because it is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Maryland, and that Marriott's contacts with California are not sufficient to establish general jurisdiction. The judge also found that the court lacks specific jurisdiction over Marriott because its website does not target California residents specifically and Marriott's suit-related conduct does not create a substantial connection with California.

As a result, the judge has ordered the case to be dismissed in its entirety without prejudice. Marriott is required to give notice of the dismissal.
