Jennifer Robles ASE NO.:                    23STCV23841  MOTION TO STAY PENDING APPEAL MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs Libra Securities Holdings, LLC and Jess Ravich RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Jennifer Robles I.              Procedural History On October 31, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel arbitration. On February 13, 2024, Defendant Robles filed an opposition and Plaintiffs filed a reply on February 22, 2024.On February 28, 2024, the court continued the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration to March 22, 2024 for supplemental briefing. (02/28/24 Minute Order.)On March 22, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the court took the matter under submission. (03/22/24 Minute Order.)On March 25, 2024, Defendant Robles filed an Answer to the Complaint. Also, on March 25, 2024, Defendant Robles filed a Cross-Complaint alleging, among other claims, causes of action for sexual harassment in violation of FEHA, breach of contract, and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.On March 26, 2024, the court denied Plaintiffs’ motion to compel arbitration. (03/26/24 Minute Order at p. 15.)On April 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed and served a demurrer and motion to strike pertaining to the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant Robles.On May 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed and served a Notice of Appeal.  Plaintiffs appeal from  the court’s order denying their motion to compel arbitration.Also, on May 6, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Appeal.  Although Plaintiffs move to stay further proceedings in this matter, they also seek to lift the stay to allow them to pursue a new motion to compel arbitration based upon the allegations in the Cross-Complaint.[1]  On May 15, 2024, Defendant Robles filed an opposition.  Robles joins in Plaintiffs’ motion to stay the case pending resolution of the appeal.  What Robles opposes is Plaintiffs’ request to lift the stay to pursue a renewed motion to compel arbitration.   Plaintiffs filed a reply.II.            LEGAL STANDARD“An aggrieved party may appeal from . . . [a]n order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration. Notwithstanding Section 916, the perfecting of such an appeal shall not automatically stay proceedings in the trial court during the pendency of the appeal.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1294, subd. (a).) “[T]he perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order, but the trial court may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 916, subd. (a).)“An appeal, including an interlocutory appeal, divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.” (Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski (2023) 599 U.S. 736, 740.) A trial court “must stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability is ongoing.” (Ibid.) “In general, filing of a notice of appeal confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.” (Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (1985) 470 U.S. 373, 379.)III.          DISCUSSIONAs noted in this court’s March 26, 2024, the parties agree the FAA applies.  Given the United States Supreme Court’s ruling in Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski (2023) 599 U.S. 736, 740, this matter must be stayed.  Alternatively, this court also exercises its discretion pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1294, subd. a, to stay this matter pending resolution of the appeal. The parties are in agreement on this issue.Notwithstanding the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ ask the court to lift the stay to pursue a renewed motion to compel arbitration.  CCP section 916 precludes the relief requested.  “The purpose of the automatic stay provision of section 916, subdivision (a) is to protect the appellate court's jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until the appeal is decided. The [automatic stay] prevents the trial court from rendering an appeal futile by altering the appealed judgment or order by conducting other proceedings that may affect it.  To accomplish this purpose, section 916, subdivision (a) stays all further trial court proceedings “upon the matters embraced” in or “affected” by the appeal.”  (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 189 (Cleaned up.)  Ruling on a second motion to compel arbitration is a matter that is embraced in and affected by the appeal. IV.          CONCLUSIONThe Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Appeal is GRANTED.  The motion to lift the stay to allow Plaintiff to pursue another motion to compel arbitration is DENIED. Plaintiffs to give notice.   Dated:   May 31, 2024                                            Kerry Bensinger    Judge of the Superior Court
