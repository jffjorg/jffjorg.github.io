[1]  Although the Cross-Complaint was filed on March 25, 2024 and the court’s ruling was issued on March 26, 2024,  Plaintiffs did not file a motion to compel arbitration based upon the allegations in the Cross-Complaint or a motion for reconsideration based thereon.  Instead, Plaintiffs filed the notice of appeal on May 6, 2024, and now, after the notice of appeal was filed, divesting this court of jurisdiction, Plaintiffs move to lift the automatic stay to pursue such a motion.  For the reasons stated herein, the request to lift the stay to pursue another motion to compel arbitration is denied.
