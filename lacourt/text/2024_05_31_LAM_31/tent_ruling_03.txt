MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES AND REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Charles Wilder
 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant General
Motors, LLC
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            This is a Song-Beverly action relating to a 2019 Chevrolet
Silverado (the “Vehicle”).  On March 17,
2023, Plaintiff, Charles Wilder, filed a Complaint against Defendant, General
Motors, LLC, after Defendant failed to repair the transmission of the Vehicle,
among other parts, pursuant to a Chevrolet Limited Warranty for the Vehicle.  
 
On November 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Second Amended
Complaint (“SAC”).   In the SAC, Plaintiff
asserts causes of action for (1) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability
under The Song-Beverly Act, (2) Breach of Express Warranty under The
Song-Beverly Act, (3) Breach of Express Warranty under California Commercial
Code § 2-313, (4) Violation of The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, and (5)
Violation of Civil Code § 1750 et seq., The Consumers Legal Remedies Act
(“CLRA”).  
 
            On
September 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed these motions to compel further responses
to special interrogatories, and request for production of documents.  On January 26, 2024, Defendant filed
oppositions. On February 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed replies.
 
            On March
14, 2024, the Court held an informal discovery conference (“IDC”) in connection
with the discovery at issue in these motions, and in connection with a
deposition of Defendant’s person most knowledgeable (“PMK”). 
             
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A motion to compel further responses to a demand for
inspection or production of documents may be brought based on: (1) incomplete
statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of
inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) 
 
As
an additional requirement pertaining only to requests for production, the
moving party must first offer facts demonstrating: “good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
This burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG
Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448; see
also Glenfed Dev. Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113,
1117.) 
On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems
that (1) an answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete, (2)
an exercise of the option to produce documents under CCP section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate, or
(3) an objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general. (CCP §
2030.300(a).)  The responding party has
the burden of justifying the objections thereto.  (Coy v.
Sup.Ct. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-21.)
The propounding party
must submit a declaration under Code of Civ. Proc. §2016.040 stating facts
demonstrating a good faith and reasonable effort to informally resolve each
issue raised by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.300, subd. (b).)
Trial courts are vested with “wide discretion” to allow or
prohibit discovery. (Williams v. Superior Court¿(2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,
540.) 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
On March 14, 2024, the court held an informal discovery
conference in connection with the discovery at issue in these motions to compel further responses. 
 
Because the parties have not
apprised the court of the current status of the outstanding discovery and have
not taken the motions off calendar, the court continues the motion to July 2,
2024.  If the motions are going forward, counsel are to submit revised
briefs narrowing the issues.  The simultaneous briefs are due 7 court days
before the hearing. 
 
 IV.
     CONCLUSION
            
Based on the foregoing, the Motions to Compel Further
Discovery Responses are CONTINUED to July 2, 2024. The parties are ordered to
file their briefs 7 court days before the continued hearing date.
 
Moving party to give notice.
