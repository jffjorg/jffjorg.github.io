And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to stay proceedings pending appeal. The court finds that the parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies, and that the court must stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability is ongoing. The court also exercises its discretion to stay the matter pending the resolution of the appeal. The court denies the request to lift the stay to allow the plaintiff to pursue another motion to compel arbitration, as this would contravene the automatic stay provision of CCP section 916, subdivision (a). The court finds that ruling on a second motion to compel arbitration is a matter that is embraced in and affected by the appeal.
