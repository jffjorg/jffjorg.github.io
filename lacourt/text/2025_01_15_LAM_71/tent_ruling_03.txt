Defendant AG-SCH 8150 Sunset Boulevard

amount of $4,475. (Notice of Motion, pg. 1.)
 
Background

On
or about March 5, 2024, Defendant propounded the RFP on Plaintiff, which it
served by email and mail.  (Decl. of
Marsh ¶5, Exh. 1.)  On or about April 8,
2024, Plaintiff proceeded with serving written responses to the RFP.  (Decl. of Marsh ¶6, Exh. 2.)  On or about April 10, 2024, Plaintiff served
verified responses to Defendant’s RFP. 
(Decl. of Marsh ¶7, Exh. 3.) 
After a prolonged period of email exchanges between counsel for parties,
on or about June 21, 2024, counsel for Plaintiff sent counsel for Defendant an email
advising that “[y]ou didn’t miss anything. I have an FSC this morning and will
send you our responses thereafter.” 
(Decl. of Marsh ¶25, Exh. 15.)
On
or about October 29, 2024, this Court held a hearing on Defendant’s Motion to Compel.
After considering the moving papers and oral argument of counsel, this Court
granted Defendant’s Motion and ordered Plaintiff to: (1) serve verified code
compliant supplemental responses to RFP Nos. 39-51 within 20 days, by November
18, 2024, and (2) pay Defendant sanctions in the amount of $9,010.00, within 20
days, by November 18, 2024.  (See
10/29/24 Minute Order.)
On
or about November 18, 2024, Plaintiff served supplemental responses to
Defendant’s RFP Nos. 39-51; however, Plaintiff failed to produce any documents
at the time when it served supplemental responses.  (Decl. of Marsh ¶28, Exh. 17.)
Defendant
filed the instant motion on January 2, 2025. 
Plaintiff filed its opposition on January 10, 2024.  Pursuant to this Court granting Defendant’s
ex parte application to expedite this hearing, no reply was ordered to be
filed.  (See 1/7/25 Minute Order.)
 
Legal
Standard
“If
a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280
thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in
accordance with that party’s statement of compliance, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling compliance.” 
(C.C.P. §2031.320(a).)
 
Motion
to Compel Compliance
Defendant’s motion to compel compliance
is granted pursuant to C.C.P.
§2031.320(a).  Plaintiff is ordered to
produce documents supplementing its responses to RFP Nos. 39-51 within seven
days of this ruling.
 
Sanctions
          Defendant’s notice of motion does not
provide notice of this statute in its request for sanctions.  Under C.C.P. §2023.040, “A request for a
sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and
attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of
sanction sought. The notice of motion shall be supported by a memorandum of
points and authorities, and accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts
supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought.”  (C.C.P. §2023.040, emphasis added.)
          Accordingly, the Court
declines to award Defendant’s requested sanctions.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion to
compel Plaintiff to comply with its agreement to produce documents in response
to Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents (Set Two), Request Nos.
39-51 is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered
to produce documents in response to Request Nos. 39-51 within 7 days of this
ruling.
Defendant’s request for
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and its counsel of record, Ross, LLP, is
denied. 
Moving Party to give
notice.
