And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by plaintiff Henry Azaryan to permit informal service of process on defendant Anahit Arakelyan, who resides in Yerevan, Armenia. The plaintiff seeks to serve the defendant via a private process server rather than through the Central Authority of Armenia. The judge notes that service of process outside the United States must comply with both California law and the Hague Service Convention. The plaintiff presents testimony by Nelson Tucker, an expert on international service of process in Armenia, who states that the informal method of service is the most common and customary method in Armenia. The judge finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause for an order permitting informal service of process and grants the motion. The court orders that the plaintiff may serve the summons and complaint on the defendant in Armenia via personal delivery by a private process server.
