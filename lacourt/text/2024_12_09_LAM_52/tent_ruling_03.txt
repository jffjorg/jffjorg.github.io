 Case Number:  24STCV11083    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant Guadalupe
Inchaurregui’s Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs
Defendant Guadalupe Inchaurregui moves for $64,965
in attorney fees and costs from plaintiffs Luis Macias and Maria Macias.  Defendant prevailed on her special motion to
strike and is therefore entitled to recover attorney fees from plaintiffs.  “[A] prevailing defendant on a special motion
to strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and
costs.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16,
subd. (c)(1).)  An award of attorney fees
is mandatory.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131 (Ketchum).) 

Amount of Fees
            Defendant
claims a lodestar of $42,900 in attorney fees. 
In
determining what constitutes a reasonable fee, the court ordinarily begins with
the lodestar, that is, “the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by
the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (PLCM).)  The court may rely
on its own experience and knowledge in determining the reasonable value of
attorney fees.  (Id. at p. 1096;
accord Taylor v. Nabors Drilling USA, LP (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1228,
1249.)
I. Hourly
Rates
Defendant’s
counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable.  “The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work.”  (PLCM, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1095.)  The court should consider many factors,
including the nature and difficulty of the litigation, the stakes involved, the
skill required and employed by the attorney in handling the case, the
attorney’s age, experience, and learning, the success or failure of the
litigation, and other relevant circumstances. 
(Id. at p. 1096; Contractors Labor Pool, Inc. v. Westway
Contractors, Inc. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 152, 168.)  
Defendant’s counsel’s rate of $500 per
hour is reasonable.  Joseph A. Schwar has
practiced law in California for over 20 years. 
(Schwar Decl., ¶ 6.)  He achieved
total success in this litigation at an early stage.  
2. Number of Hours
The court will substantially reduce defendant’s
lodestar.  In calculating the lodestar, the court must determine
whether the tasks performed by an attorney were necessary and whether the
amount of time billed for each task was reasonable.  (Baxter
v. Bock (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 775, 793.) 
 
            Defendant’s
lodestar totals 85.8 hours of fees for: (1)
“16.2 hours preparing for and attempting to meet and confer over defects in the
complaint in connection with anticipated filings of demurrer and motion to
strike, ” (2) “6.2 hours seeking and obtaining an order ex parte to extend the
Defendant’s time for responding to the complaint”, (3) “48.1 hours spent
researching and preparing the anti-SLAPP Special Motion to Strike and” other
supporting papers, including the reply brief, and attending the hearing, (4) “1.1
hours preparing proposed judgment”, and (5) “14.2 hours incurred and
anticipated in relation to the instant Motion.” 
(Motion, p. 5.)  
Defendant may only recover fees incurred in
categories (3), (4), and (5).  “A prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP
motion is entitled to seek fees and costs ‘ “incurred in connection with” ’ the
anti-SLAPP motion itself, but is not entitled to an award of attorney fees and
costs incurred for the entire action.” 
(569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.
(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 433.)  The
award “includes attorney fees incurred to litigate the special motion to strike
(the merits fees) plus the fees incurred in connection with litigating the fee
award itself (the fees on fees).”  (Ibid.)
 The first two categories of fees were not incurred
in connection with the anti-SLAPP motion or this motion for attorney fees.  
Defendant did not reasonably incur 48.1 hours of
attorney fees for the anti-SLAPP motion. 
Defendant’s counsel billed 4.9 hours for one unnecessary task.  He billed two entries to “Prepare Evidentiary
Objections re anti-SLAPP motion.”  (Schwar
Decl., Ex. A, p. 17.)  In the initial
moving papers, defendant objected to 50 allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint.  Those purported evidentiary objections were
unnecessary because allegations, even in a verified complaint, are not evidence.  (Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v.
Gilbane Building Co. (2019) 6 Cal.5th 931, 940 [“a plaintiff seeking to
demonstrate the merit of the claim ‘may not rely solely on its complaint, even
if verified; instead, its proof must be made upon competent admissible evidence’
”].)   
Defendant’s counsel also billed an unreasonable
amount for two tasks.  He billed 0.3
hours to prepare the proposed order. 
(Schwar Decl., Ex. A, p. 17.)  The
proposed order is only 10 lines of text and contains nothing substantive.  A paralegal could have prepared it.  Defendant’s counsel also billed two entries
totaling 3.5 hours to prepare the request for judicial notice in support of the
anti-SLAPP motion.  (Ibid.)  Defendant requested judicial notice of: (1) the
complaint in a separate action, (2) the date that complaint was filed, and (3) that
the complaint does not assert a claim for malicious prosecution.  That did not reasonably require more than 0.5
hours of work.    
The court will reduce the lodestar of 48.1 hours for
the anti-SLAPP motion by 4.9 hours for the evidentiary objections, by 0.2 hours
for the proposed order, and by 3.0 hours for the request for judicial
notice.    
Defendant also did not reasonably incur 1.1 hours of
fees to prepare the proposed judgment. 
Like the proposed order granting the motion, a paralegal could have
prepared this simple and short document. 
It did not require 1.1 hours of an attorney’s work at $500 per hour.  The court will award only 0.1 hour to prepare
the proposed judgment.  
Finally, defendant did not reasonably incur 14.2
hours for this fee motion.  This simple
motion should not have required more than 9 hours of work. 
After the reductions discussed above, the court will
award defendant a lodestar of 49 hours at $500 hourly.
Lodestar Enhancement
            Defendant
moves for a 1.5 multiplier to enhance the lodestar.  Courts may enhance a party’s lodestar based
on factors including “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,
(2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature
of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Ketchum,
supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1132.)  
After considering all relevant factors,
the court will exercise its discretion to not enhance the lodestar.  The
anti-SLAPP motion did not involve novel or difficult questions.  Defendant’s counsel was wholly successful but
did not demonstrate exceptional skill.  Schwar
makes only a conclusory statement that “[t]his case has precluded my employment
on other matters.”  (Schwar Decl., ¶
11.)  Counsel’s hourly rates adequately
account for representation on contingency. 
(See Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005)
132 Cal.App.4th 359, 395.)  
Other Expenses
Defendant claims $615 in other expenses under Code
of Civil Procedure 1033.5.  The expenses
defendant claims are recoverable and reasonable.
Disposition
            Defendant Guadalupe Inchaurregui’s motion for attorney fees and costs is granted in part.  Defendant Guadalupe Inchaurregui
shall recover $24,500 in attorney fees and $615 in other expenses from
plaintiffs Luis Macias and Maria Macias.
