And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that defendant Guadalupe Inchaurregui is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs from plaintiffs Luis Macias and Maria Macias. The defendant seeks $64,965 in fees and costs, but the court will award only $24,500. The court reduced the lodestar by 4.9 hours for unnecessary tasks, 0.2 hours for preparing a proposed order, and 3.0 hours for preparing a request for judicial notice. The court also reduced the time spent preparing a proposed judgment from 1.1 hours to 0.1 hour. Finally, the court denied the defendant's request for a 1.5 multiplier to enhance the lodestar. The judge found that the anti-SLAPP motion did not involve novel or difficult questions, and the defendant's counsel did not demonstrate exceptional skill.
