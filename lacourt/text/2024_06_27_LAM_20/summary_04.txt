And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the Plaintiffs, David Reed and Connie Reed, against the Defendants, Cal Homes Group, Inc., Eddie Salinas, and HVMJ, LLC. The Plaintiffs are seeking judgment on the pleadings based on the Defendants' Answer, which asserts general denials and 15 affirmative defenses. The Judge has denied the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, stating that the Court's previous rulings on the Plaintiffs' application for default judgment, motion for charging order, and motion to amend the default judgment cannot be used to defeat the Plaintiffs' breach of contract and fraud claims. The Judge noted that those rulings were made when the Defendants had defaulted and could not dispute the assertions made by the Plaintiffs, and therefore, those findings cannot now be used to defeat an operative pleading.
