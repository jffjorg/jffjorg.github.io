And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer filed by defendants Goodwin Procter LLP and D'Juan Parker. The defendants argued that the complaint filed by plaintiff Teresa Martinez lacks factual support and is nothing more than legal conclusions. The judge agreed that most of the causes of action lack factual support, except for the sixth and seventh causes of action, which relate to harassment. The judge overruled the demurrer for these two causes of action, finding that they have factual support. However, the judge sustained the demurrer for the other causes of action, giving the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The judge encouraged counsel to submit on the tentative or appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
