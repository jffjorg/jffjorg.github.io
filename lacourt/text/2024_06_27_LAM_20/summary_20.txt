And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Mark Perry, who is seeking to confirm an arbitration award in his favor, and Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher LLP, which is seeking to vacate the award. The award requires Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher LLP to pay Perry $557,371.55 and finds that Perry is a retired partner entitled to retirement payments. Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher LLP argues that the arbitrator exceeded his powers and ignored relevant evidence.

The Judge has denied Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher LLP's petition to vacate the award, finding that there is no basis to review the arbitrator's decision for legal errors and that the arbitrator did not refuse to consider material evidence.

The Judge has also granted Perry's petition to confirm the award, finding that Perry has attached the arbitrator's award and the underlying agreement to arbitrate, as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 1285.4.

Regarding the motions to seal and unseal documents, the Judge has found that Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher LLP has established an overriding confidentiality interest in certain portions of its partnership agreement and has granted its motion to seal those documents. The Judge has also allowed the names of former partners to be redacted, as well as the terms of their settlement agreements. However, the Judge has denied Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher LLP's request to seal most other documents, finding that the requests are not narrowly tailored and that the information is not confidential.

The Judge has also denied the motion to unseal the documents, finding that the documents are not public records and that the petitioners have not established a sufficient basis for unsealing.
