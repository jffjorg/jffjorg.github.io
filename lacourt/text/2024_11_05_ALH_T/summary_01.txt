And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion for leave to amend the answers of the defendants, Storopack, Inc. and Thana Vong, to include the affirmative defense of "Sudden Emergency Doctrine". The defendants argue that new facts revealed during the discovery phase of the case necessitate the amendment. The Judge finds that granting leave to amend is appropriate in this case, citing judicial policy in favor of resolving all disputed matters between the parties. The Judge notes that granting leave to amend will not significantly prejudice the remaining parties to the action, whereas denying the motion may deprive the defendants of the right to assert a meritorious affirmative defense under the Sudden Emergency Doctrine. The defendants are ordered to file their amended answers within seven days.
