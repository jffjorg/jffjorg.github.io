Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering the City of Santa Monica's demurrer to Plaintiff Emmanuel Gali's complaint alleging fair housing violations. The City argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to support claims against the City. The court agrees, finding that the complaint does not allege facts sufficient to support claims of failure to provide reasonable accommodations or discrimination based on the use of a Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) voucher.

The court rules that the City's demurrer is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. The court finds that the complaint is uncertain and does not state facts sufficient to support claims against the City. The court also finds that the City was not involved in setting the rental requirements that allegedly discriminated against Plaintiff, and therefore there are no allegations of discrimination against the City.

Overall, the court's ruling is in favor of the City, and Plaintiff will have the opportunity to amend the complaint to address the court's concerns.
