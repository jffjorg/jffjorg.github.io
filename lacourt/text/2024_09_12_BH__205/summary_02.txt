And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case between Bradley Fischer, a former officer and employee of New Republic Pictures, LLC, and New Republic Pictures, LLC. The case is about Fischer's allegations that New Republic failed to pay him compensation due under a 2019 employment agreement.

The judge has sustained New Republic's demurrer to Fischer's second cause of action for conversion, meaning that Fischer cannot assert a claim for conversion because he only has a contractual right of payment, without more, to recover the compensation he is seeking. The judge has also granted New Republic's motion to strike the references in the complaint to a 25% penalty, as Fischer did not allege compliance with the pre-filing requirements under the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act.

The judge has denied leave to amend the complaint, meaning that Fischer will not be allowed to revise his complaint to address the issues raised by the demurrer and motion to strike. The case will proceed with New Republic's demurrer and motion to strike sustained, and Fischer's second cause of action for conversion dismissed.
