And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants the Beverly Hills Unified School District's motion for terminating sanctions. The Court dismisses the complaint against the District with prejudice. The Court orders terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, LIAV MANN, for his willful failure to comply with the Court's prior orders. The Court finds that the plaintiff has failed to respond to discovery requests, failed to comply with court orders, and failed to appear for deposition. The Court concludes that less severe sanctions have had no effect on the plaintiff and that terminating sanctions are warranted. The Court declines to award additional monetary sanctions, as the most severe sanction of termination has been issued.
