And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment or in the alternative for summary adjudication filed by the Plaintiff, GREEN & MCCAHILL HOLDINGS, LIMITED. The Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on its claims for breach of contract and money lent against the Defendant, JCTLA INVESTMENT CORPORATION, et al. The Defendant owns the real property located at 433 South Glen Blvd, Los Angeles, California, and the Plaintiff loaned the Defendant $529,000 to pay for repairs, improvements, and overdue taxes on the Property.

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment because there are triable issues of fact regarding the amount of interest due under the loan agreement and the amount of damages sustained by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has not presented evidence of the amount due on its common count for money lent, and the Judge has sustained the Defendant's objections to the Plaintiff's evidence.

The case will proceed to trial, and the Judge will not grant summary judgment or summary adjudication at this time.
