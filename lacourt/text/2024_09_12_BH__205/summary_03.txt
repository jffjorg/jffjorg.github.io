Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Beverly Hills Unified School District (Defendant) has filed a motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Liav Mann for his failure to comply with discovery requests and court orders. The District alleges that Plaintiff has willfully failed to respond to discovery requests, refused to pay monetary sanctions, and failed to comply with court orders. The Court has reviewed the evidence and agrees that terminating sanctions are warranted. The Court concludes that Plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests and court orders is willful and that less severe sanctions have had no effect on Plaintiff. The Court also finds that the District is prejudiced by Plaintiff's failure to submit to discovery. Therefore, the Court grants the District's motion for terminating sanctions and enters judgment in favor of the District and against Plaintiff.
