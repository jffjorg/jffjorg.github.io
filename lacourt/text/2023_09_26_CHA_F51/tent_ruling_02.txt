The Court notes that Defendant has again failed to comply with the Court rules
on formatting. For example, “line numbers must be placed at the left margin and
separated from the text by a vertical column of space at least 1/5 inch wide or
a single or double vertical line. Each line number must be aligned with a line
of type, or the line numbers must be evenly spaced vertically on the page. Line
numbers must be consecutively numbered, beginning with the number 1 on each
page. There must be at least three line numbers for every vertical inch on the
page.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.108(4).) Future pleadings not in
compliance will be rejected.
