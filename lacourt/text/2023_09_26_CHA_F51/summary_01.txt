And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's representation and debt collection agency, The Moore Law Group, APC, was not authorized to bring the action against the defendant and was not properly licensed at the time the action was initiated. The court finds that the defendant lacks legal authority for this motion and that the plaintiff's complaint must be maintained. The court notes that the Moore Law Group's license application was pending since December 2021 and was therefore authorized by statute to operate pending the approval of its application. The court concludes that the motion is denied.
