## English Text Summary:

This is a tentative ruling in a case where a homeowner named Fred S. Hong sued U.S. Bank for breach of contract related to a loan modification. The Judge has determined that Hong lacks the legal authority (standing) to bring this lawsuit because he is not the original borrower on the loan.

The Judge also found that Hong failed to adequately state a breach of contract claim in his complaint.  Because the Court found these issues fatal to Hong's case, the demurrer filed by U.S. Bank was sustained without granting Hong the opportunity to amend his complaint.

Essentially, this means the case is dismissed at this stage and Hong cannot continue with his lawsuit against U.S. Bank.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the Defendant, U.S. Bank, National Association, as trustee for GSR Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-3F, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-3F, is sustained without leave to amend. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff, Fred S. Hong, lacks standing to bring the breach of contract action and that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract. The Judge also finds that the complaint fails for lack of joinder of necessary parties, namely the loan Borrower. The demurrer was filed on the basis that the Plaintiff has failed to join necessary and indispensable parties, the borrower under the subject foreclosed loan and prior co-owners of the subject property, and that the Plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has failed to oppose the demurrer and has not made any showing that he can successfully amend his complaint.

This is a summary of the tentative ruling in case number 23CHCV01336, scheduled for a hearing on September 26, 2023, at the F51 Los Angeles Superior Court. The judge sustained the defendant's demurrer without leave to amend, granted the defendant's request for judicial notice, and found that the plaintiff lacks standing to bring the action as he is not the loan borrower and failed to join necessary parties. The demurrer was sustained due to the plaintiff's failure to identify any agreement between the parties, making it impossible for the court to determine the parties' performance, breach, or damages. The plaintiff failed to oppose the demurrer, and therefore, the court found that the plaintiff is not the real party in interest in this action. Additionally, the plaintiff failed to show a reasonable possibility of successful amendment, and the court noted that a plaintiff's lack of standing is a fatal jurisdictional defect that requires a judge to render judgment against the plaintiff.
