Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the Defendant, U.S. Bank, to the Plaintiff's complaint. The Plaintiff, Fred S. Hong, brought a wrongful foreclosure action alleging that the Defendant engaged in deceptive business practices and breached a contract. The Defendant demurred to the complaint on several grounds, including that the Plaintiff lacks standing to bring the action and that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of contract.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the Plaintiff lacks standing to bring the action and that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for breach of contract. The Judge has also granted the Defendant's request for judicial notice of loan documents. The Plaintiff has failed to oppose the demurrer and has not made a showing that he can successfully amend his complaint. The Judge has found that the complaint is not so incomprehensible that the Defendant cannot respond, and therefore has not sustained the demurrer on the ground of uncertainty.
