Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 22CHLC10272

 
Motion filed: 7/5/23
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant
Peter Bures, in pro per (“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Citibank, N.A. (“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: ok  
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order dismissing Plaintiff’s
complaint with prejudice.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is denied.
 
The parties are reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended
General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing
documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set
forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First
Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly
bookmarking declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply
with these requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected,
matters being placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be
resubmitted in compliance with these requirements, documents not being
considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
 
 
On 7/5/23, Defendant filed the
instant motion. On 9/7/23, Plaintiff filed its opposition. No reply has been
filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Here, Defendant appears to argue
that Plaintiff’s representation and debt collection agency, The Moore Law
Ground, APC, was not authorized to bring this action against Defendant on
Plaintiff’s behalf, and was not properly licensed when the action was
initiated. (Def.’s Mot. p. 2.)[1] “There is no statutory
authority for using a motion to dismiss to challenge pleadings. Nevertheless,
some cases have stated a motion to dismiss may serve the same function as a
general demurrer.” (Cal. Civ. Ctrm. Hbook. & Desktop Ref. § 11:44 (2023
ed.), citing McKay v. Riverside County (1959) 175 Cal.App.2d 247,
248–250, Barragan v. Banco BCH (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 283, 299.)
 
Here, the Court notes that Defendant
points to no legal authority for the instant motion, nor any authority requiring
The Moore Law Group to provide legal documentation showing that the firm is
authorized to bring this action on behalf of Plaintiff against Defendant. To
the extent that Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s complaint must be dismissed
because The Moore Law Group was not a properly licensed debt collection agency
at the time the action was initiated, this argument likewise lacks merit.
 
Plaintiff argues that under the
Debt Collection Licensing Act, “the commissioner shall allow any debt collector
that submits an application prior to January 1, 2022, to operate pending the
approval or denial of the application.” (Pl.’s Opp. 3:26–28, citing Fin. Code § 100000.5, subd. (c) (eff.
1/1/22 to 9/26/22).) “Plaintiff filed this Action while its CA DFPI Debt
Collector License Number application was pending approval since December 2021.
Since March 2023, TMLG's license application has been approved and TMLG has
received its CA DFPI Debt Collector License Number of 10223-99.” (Decl. of
Matthew Keim ¶ 6.) Here, because The Moore Law
Group’s license application was pending since December 2021, the agency was
authorized by statute to operate pending the approval of its application, and
was therefore authorized to collect the alleged debt from Defendant, and to file
the instant collections action against Defendant on Plaintiff’s behalf on
5/17/22.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Defendant’s motion
to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint with prejudice. The Court notes the parties’
arguments regarding discovery, but declines to address them as they should be
raised by relevant discovery motions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied.
