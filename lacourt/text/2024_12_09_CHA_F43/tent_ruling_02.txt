SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
July 1, 2023, Plaintiffs Enrique Gomez and Marcy Linares (Plaintiffs) were
involved in a vehicle collision with Defendant Alejandra Gomez (Defendant).  As a result of the collision, Plaintiffs
suffered damages and serious injuries.  Plaintiffs
filed this action against Defendant on June 17, 2024, alleging causes of action
for (1) negligence and (2) “negligence involvement”.  The “negligence involvement” cause of action
appears largely duplicative of the first cause of action.  
 
On
July 29, 2024, Defendant propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One on
Plaintiffs.  Responses were due August
30, 2024.  Defendant gave Plaintiffs two
deadline extensions, but Plaintiffs did not serve responses. 
 
On
October 31, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel responses to her Form
Interrogatories, Set One.  No opposition
has been filed.
 
Meet and Confer
A
motion to compel form interrogatory responses must include a declaration
stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the
issues mentioned in the motion before filing. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1), 2016.040.)  
 
Defendant’s
counsel of record, Michael J. Lowell, declares he attempted to meet and confer
with Plaintiff’s counsel before filing this motion.  (Declaration of Michael J. Lowell, ¶ 2, Exh.
A.)  After Plaintiffs missed the August
30 deadline, Mr. Lowell sent Plaintiffs’ counsel a meet and confer letter
informing Plaintiffs they waived all objections and extending Plaintiffs’
deadline to respond to October 1, 2024. 
(Lowell Dec., ¶ 3, Exh. B.)  After
Plaintiffs missed the October 1 deadline, Mr. Lowell sent Plaintiffs’ counsel a
second letter extending the time to respond to October 15, 2024.  (Lowel Dec., ¶ 4, Exh. C.)  As of October 31, 2024, Plaintiffs have not
served responses.  
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
A
propounding party may move to compel responses to form interrogatories where
the responding party fails to provide any responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (b).)  The propounding
party must show the interrogatories were properly served, that the time to
respond expired, and no response has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980)
111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)  The
responding party must serve responses within 30 days after the interrogatories
are served or according to an agreed upon deadline extension.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270.)  Failing to respond within these time limits
waives objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).)  
 
Defendant
has shown that she properly served Plaintiffs on July 29, 2024.  Plaintiffs did not serve responses by the
original August 30 deadline or any of Defendant’s subsequent deadline
extensions.  As of October 31, 2024,
Plaintiffs have not served responses.  
 
Accordingly, the Court orders
Plaintiffs to serve code-compliant, objection-free responses to each individual
form interrogatory.
 
Sanctions
The Court may impose sanctions against any party who
“unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel responses to
interrogatories unless,
it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
Defendant
requests $1,135.00 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs and their
counsel.  Defendant’s counsel, Michael J.
Lowell, charges an hourly rate of $250.00. 
(Lowell Dec., ¶ 7.)  Defendant’s
other counsel, Meredith J. Norris, Esq., charges an hourly rate of
$225.00.  (Lowell Dec., ¶ 6.)  The request includes the following: (1) Ms.
Norris spent 2 hours preparing this motion ($450.00); (2) Mr. Lowell
anticipates 2.5 hours preparing for and attending the motion hearing ($625.00);
and (3) a $60.00 filing fee.  (Lowell
Dec., ¶ 7.)  
 
The Court finds the hourly rates are reasonable, but
the time spent on this motion is unreasonable. 
This motion is virtually identical to five separate discovery motions Defendant
filed, and the issues are not complex. 
 
Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant’s request in
the reduced amount of $535.00: (1) 1 hour preparing this motion; (2) 1 hour preparing
for and attending the motion hearing; and (3) a $60.00 filing fee.

Linares are ordered to serve responses within twenty (20) days of the date of

3.

ordered to pay these sanctions to Defendant’s counsel within twenty (20) days of
the date of this order.
