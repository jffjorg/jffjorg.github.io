The defendant propounded the interrogatories on July 29, 2024, and the plaintiff's responses were due by August 30, 2024. Despite two deadline extensions, the plaintiff's failed to serve responses. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond was unreasonable and grants the defendant's motion to compel responses. Additionally, the judge imposes sanctions on the plaintiff's in the amount of $535.00, which is reduced from the original request of $1,135.00.
