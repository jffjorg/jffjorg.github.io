Roles: Judge, Plaintiff, Defendants
Significant Statements:
* "Although as a rule a party is limited to a single peremptory challenge in a case ..., the statute clearly permits an additional challenge following reversal of a judgment if the same judge is assigned to hear the case on remand." (Stubblefield v. Construction Co. v. Superior Court (2000))
* "A motion under this paragraph may be made following reversal on appeal of a trial court's decision, or following reversal on appeal of a trial court's final judgment, if the trial judge in the prior proceeding is assigned to conduct a new trial on the matter." (CCP section 170.6)
* "The analysis of whether or not the meaning of 'new trial' is met requires a determination of whether there has been a trial, and whether there will be a retrial..." (First Fed. Bank of California v. Superior Ct. (2006))
* "CCP section 170.6 is not triggered if any factual or legal determination has been made prior to the reversal. Rather, it is triggered when the reversal and remand involves a motion which would itself require 'reexamination' of a factual or legal issue that was in controversy in the prior proceeding." (Akopyan v. Superior Court (2020))

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is tentatively denying the plaintiff's preemptory challenge under CCP section 170.6. The plaintiff initiated the action in 2013 and previously exercised a peremptory challenge in 2021. The issue is whether the reversal and remand of the case triggers CCP section 170.6, which allows an additional peremptory challenge if the same judge is assigned to hear the case on remand. The judge concludes that the reversal and remand does not require a "reexamination" of any factual or legal issue that was in controversy in the prior proceeding, and therefore CCP section 170.6 is not triggered. The case is set for hearing on the issue and trial setting conference on February 24, 2025.
