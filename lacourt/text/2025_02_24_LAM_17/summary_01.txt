And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is tentatively denying the plaintiff's preemptory challenge under CCP section 170.6. The plaintiff initiated the action in 2013 and previously exercised a peremptory challenge in 2021. The issue is whether the reversal and remand of the case triggers CCP section 170.6, which allows an additional peremptory challenge if the same judge is assigned to hear the case on remand. The judge concludes that the reversal and remand does not require a "reexamination" of any factual or legal issue that was in controversy in the prior proceeding, and therefore CCP section 170.6 is not triggered. The case is set for hearing on the issue and trial setting conference on February 24, 2025.

```

## English Summary

The judge, Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, has tentatively denied Plaintiff James McDonald's second request for a peremptory challenge under CCP §170.6. 

The judge explains that while a party is generally limited to one peremptory challenge, an additional challenge may be allowed after a reversal and reassignment of the case to the same judge. However, the judge cites case law stating that CCP §170.6 is triggered only when the "retrial" involves reexamination of a factual or legal issue previously in controversy.

In this case, the Court of Appeal reversed the previous dismissal of the case due to failure to prosecute. While this necessitates a continuation of the case, it does not require the court to reexamine any issues previously raised. Therefore, the judge finds that a second peremptory challenge is not warranted. 


The case is scheduled for a hearing on February 24, 2025, at 8:30 am.

**English Summary:**

In this case, the judge is tentatively denying the Plaintiff's request to use a second peremptory challenge under California Code of Civil Procedure §170.6. 

The Plaintiff previously used a §170.6 challenge in 2021.  The case was dismissed due to a motion to quash for failure to prosecute, but the dismissal was reversed on appeal.  

The judge explains that a second §170.6 challenge is only permissible when the reversal and remand require a "reexamination" of a factual or legal issue previously in dispute.  

In this case, the remand does not require such a re-examination, so the judge is denying the Plaintiff's request.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's peremptory challenge under §170.6. The plaintiff, James MacDonald, had previously exercised a peremptory challenge under §170.6 against a different judge, and the court must determine if §170.6 is triggered in this case. The court considered the case law, including Stubblefield v. Construction Co. v. Superior Court and First Fed. Bank of California v. Superior Ct., and determined that the "retrial" element is not satisfied. The court found that the reversal on appeal and remand does not require a reexamination of any factual or legal issue that was in controversy in the prior proceeding. Therefore, the court tentatively denied the plaintiff's peremptory challenge under §170.6. The matter is set for a hearing on February 24, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.

Significant Statements:
  - "The analysis of whether or not the meaning of 'new trial' is met requires a determination of whether there has been a trial, and whether there will be a retrial... the dividing line in determining whether there had been a trial was whether the trial court's initial decision had 'either addressed the merits or otherwise terminated the case.'"
  - "CCP section 170.6 is not triggered if any factual or legal determination has been made prior to the reversal. Rather, it is triggered when the reversal and remand involves a motion which would itself require 'reexamination of a factual or legal issue that was in controversy in the prior proceeding.'"
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the plaintiff's request to grant a preemptory challenge under CCP section 170.6. The case was originally filed on July 23, 2013, and was reversed and remanded to the same judge after a motion to quash for failure to prosecute was granted. The plaintiff had previously exercised a peremptory challenge against the late Judge Malcolm Mackey. The judge determined that CCP section 170.6 is not triggered in this case because the reversal and remand does not require the court to redetermine any motion that evaluated the merits of the plaintiff's claim, nor does it require redetermination of the issues raised in the defendant's motion to quash. The case will proceed on the merits without any reexamination of any legal or factual issue previously raised.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's peremptory challenge under §170.6. The court finds that the "retrial" element required to trigger §170.6 is not satisfied, as the reversal and remand do not require the court to reexamine any factual or legal issue previously raised. The plaintiff had previously exercised a peremptory challenge against the late Honorable Malcolm Mackey, but the court determines that the plaintiff has not exhausted their right to raise a 170.6 challenge. The court cites relevant case law, including Stubblefield v. Construction Co. v. Superior Court and First Fed. Bank of California v. Superior Ct., to support its decision. The hearing on the matter is set for February 24, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.
