DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
PLM Lender Services, Inc., and Secured Income Fund-II, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Bay
Area Development Co.
 
 
            This is a quiet
title action.  On October 27, 2023, Defendants,
PLM Lender Services, Inc., and Secured Income Fund-II, LLC, filed this demurrer
to the First Amended Complaint of Plaintiff, Bay Area Development Co.
 
            On January
29, 2024, Defendants filed a Reply to Non-Opposition to the demurrer urging the
court to sustain the Demurrer in light of Plaintiff’s failure to file an opposition.

 
            On January
30, 2024, Plaintiff filed the declaration of its counsel, Eric J. Olson.  Mr. Olson requests an extension until
February 16, 2024 to respond to the demurrer, or alternatively, if the court is
inclined to sustain the demurrer, to grant leave to amend.  Mr. Olson explains that his failure to file a
timely opposition was not done in bad faith. 
After receiving Defendants’ Reply to Non-Opposition, Mr. Olson asked his
assistant what happened and why his assistant believed the demurrer had been
taken off calendar.  Mr. Olson submits a
screenshot of the Attorney Portal which indicates the following from
11/07/2023: “Hearing on Demurrer -without Motion to Strike – Not Held – Taken
Off Calendar by Party”.  (Olsen Decl.,
Ex. 1.)  Further, Mr. Olson’s assistant pointed
out that he did not see the entry dated 10/27/2023 which indicates that the
hearing for this Demurrer - without Motion to Strike was reserved.  (Id.) 

 
            Based on
the foregoing, the court is inclined to allow Plaintiff to file its opposition
no later than February 16, 2024.  The
court is inclined to continue the hearing to March 14, 2024 but will discuss amenable
hearing dates with the parties.
 
            Additionally,
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint does not appear in the court’s electronic
case file.[1]
 Plaintiff is ordered to file the First
Amended Complaint.
 
Clerk of the Court to give notice.  
 
Dated:   February 2,
2024
