And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motions to compel and deem admitted. The defendant is required to serve verified responses to the discovery at issue within 30 days, including responses to the requests for admission (RFA's). If the defendant has already served responses, they may stand by those responses, but if they are found to be non-compliant, a successful motion to compel further may be brought, and non-monetary sanctions may be sought. The judge has also granted sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $1280 for their failure to comply with the discovery requests.
