  Case Number:  23SMCV04791    Hearing Date:   September 10, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motions to compel are GRANTED; the motion to
deem admitted is GRANTED unless responses were served prior to this hearing in
which case that motion is MOOT.  Verified
responses to the discovery at issue will be served without objection other than
privilege in 30 days, which includes responses to the RFA’s.  If defendant has served responses defendant
believes are compliant with this order, then defendant may stand on those
responses.  However, in that case, a
successful motion to compel further may be brought as asserting a violation of
this order and non-monetary sanctions may be sought.  Sanctions are GRANTED as prayed against
defendant, but not counsel, in the amount of $1280 for all three motions combined.
