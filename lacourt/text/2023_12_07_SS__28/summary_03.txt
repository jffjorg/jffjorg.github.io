And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has considered the parties' requests and legal arguments regarding the motion to reopen discovery. Defendant Nathan A. Anslow seeks to reopen discovery to obtain a pre-accident MRI study and medical records related to Plaintiff Hilber Emerito Aguilar Tomas's prior low back injuries. Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to disclose the identity of pre-accident treatment providers, which prevented Defendant from completing discovery before the cut-off date. The court finds that reopening discovery is appropriate, as the information about Plaintiff's prior back injury is relevant and Defendant has been reasonably diligent in seeking information about Plaintiff's prior injury. The court grants the motion and reopens discovery, which will be based on the new March 27, 2024 trial date.
