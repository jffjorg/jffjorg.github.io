Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Mag Cho, filed this action against various defendants, including Fully Hope Church, Hope Sight Mission Association, and others, alleging general negligence and premises liability. The defendants have filed answers, and Hope Sight has filed a demurrer, which has been unopposed by the plaintiff.

The judge has considered the legal standard for a demurrer, which requires that the pleading states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has also considered the complaint, which alleges that the defendants were negligent in managing, supervising, controlling, and operating the premises, and failed to provide a safe, suitable, and adequate premises for individuals using the premises.

The judge has also considered the documents submitted by Hope Sight, which purport to show that Hope Sight transferred the premises to JNC Properties in 2018 and no longer owns or controls the property. However, the judge has taken judicial notice of these documents and cannot rule out the possibility that Hope Sight retains an ownership interest in the premises.

Based on the above, the judge has overruled Hope Sight's demurrer, allowing the case to proceed.
