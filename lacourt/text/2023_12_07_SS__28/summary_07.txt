And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 22STCV35073, a motor vehicle tort and negligence lawsuit filed by Johnny Lorenzo Perez against Daniel Wreszin, City of Los Angeles, and Does 1-20. The Defendant has filed a motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission and request for sanctions, which the Plaintiff has opposed. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the Plaintiff's service of objections to the requests for admission before the hearing on the motion requires denial of the motion.
