English-text summary:

The Court has ruled on a motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Defendant Kenneth Josue Stepter. The motion is based on a proposed settlement between Stepter and Plaintiff Juan Manzo for $50,000.00. The Court has considered the Tech-Bilt factors, which include the rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than they would if found liable after a trial. The Court has also considered the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, as well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of nonsettling defendants. Based on its consideration of these factors, the Court finds that the proposed settlement was made in good faith. The Court grants the motion and dismisses all pending and future claims against Stepter by the parties served with this motion.
