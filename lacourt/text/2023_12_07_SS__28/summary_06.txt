Significant Statements:
  - "The existence of a dangerous condition ordinarily is a question of fact, but the issue may be resolved as a matter of law if reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion." (Zelig v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1133)
  - "A public entity is not, without more, liable under [Government Code] section 835 for the harmful conduct of third parties on its property." (Cordova v. City of Los Angeles (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1099, 1104)
  - "For example, [the Supreme Court] held in [Peterson v. San Francisco Community College Dist. (1984) 36 Cal.3d 799] that the condition of a community college campus may be dangerous if the presence of trees with thick foliage near a parking lot and stairway facilitated criminal activity against students. The risk of crime was reasonably foreseeable in that case because the district was aware of prior assaults." (Zelig, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 1135)
  - "However, ‘[i]n appropriate circumstances, a public entity may owe members of the public a . . . duty not to maintain public premises in a dangerous condition and, specifically, not to maintain its premises in a condition that will increase the reasonably foreseeable risk that criminal activity will injure such individuals.’" (Avedon v. State of California (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1336, 1342–1344)

Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the County of Los Angeles to the second amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Cuauhtemoc Perez, Primia Hernandez, Miguel Perez, and Erica Perez. The plaintiffs allege that the County is liable for the injuries sustained by them due to the dangerous condition of the public property. The Court sustains the demurrer and holds that the County is not liable because Franck's harmful conduct was not caused by a defect in the property. The Court finds that the plaintiffs have not pleaded facts which demonstrate that a condition of public property created a substantial risk of injury even when the property was used with due care. The County's motion to dismiss the complaint is granted, and the plaintiffs are denied leave to amend their complaint.
