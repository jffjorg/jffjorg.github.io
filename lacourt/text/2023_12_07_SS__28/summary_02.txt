And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by Plaintiff Patricia Avila for leave to file a second amended complaint. The motion is granted, allowing the Plaintiff to file a second amended complaint within 10 days of the hearing. The amended complaint will add factual allegations about the parties, add Black Pyramid as a defendant to the second cause of action, and make other changes. The Defendants did not object to the motion, and the judge has exercised their discretion to grant the motion in furtherance of justice. The ruling does not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading, but rather allows the Plaintiff to file the amendment and gives the opposing party the opportunity to attack its validity later.
