emotional distress, and negligence. 
On

3.300(a). 21STCV13947 became the lead case.

to be heard on December 7, 2023.   On

PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court grant leave to file a second amended complaint. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          "The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any
terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding
or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name
of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms,
enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion,
after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an
amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like
terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this code."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).)      
"Any
judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of
justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any
pleading or pretrial conference order."  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 576.) 
“The
court may grant leave to amend the pleadings at any stage of the action.  A party may discover the need to amend after
all the pleadings are completed and new information requires a change in the
nature of the claims or defenses previously pleaded.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 6:636, p. 6-187, emphasis
omitted (Cal. Practice Guide).)  “[T]he court’s discretion will usually be exercised
liberally to permit amendment of the pleadings.”  (Id., ¶ 6:638, p. 6-187, emphasis
omitted.)  “The policy favoring amendment
is so strong that denial of leave to amend can rarely be justified:  ‘If the motion to amend is timely made and
the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error
to refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party
being deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a
meritorious defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion.’”  (Id., ¶ 6:639, p. 6-188, emphasis
omitted, quoting Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527,
530.)  
“Ordinarily,
the judge will not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in
deciding whether to grant leave to amend. . . . After leave to amend is
granted, the opposing party will have the opportunity to attack the validity of
the amended pleading.” (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 6:644, pp. 6-189
to 6-190.) 
In
addition, “it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend where
the opposing party was not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.” (Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.)  “Prejudice exists where the amendment would
result in a delay of trial, along with loss of critical evidence, added costs
of preparation, increased burden of discovery, etc.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 6:656,
p. 6-193.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
requests leave to file a second amended complaint adding factual allegations about
the parties, adding Black Pyramid as a defendant to the second cause of action,
and making other changes. 
Defendants
do not object to the motion.  The Court
grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Patricia Avila’s motion for leave to file a second amended
complaint.  Plaintiff is ordered to file
and serve the second amended complaint within 10 days of the hearing on the
motion. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
