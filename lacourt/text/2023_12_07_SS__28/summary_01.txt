And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the application for default judgment filed by Plaintiff Irma Cardenas Lopez and Gloria Avalos Arteaga against Defendant Olivia Camacho Chopin. The Plaintiffs had requested a default judgment in the amount of $188,173.90, consisting of $150,000.00 in general damages, $37,688.90 in special damages, and other amounts. The Judge found that the application did not comply with the California Rules of Court, as it did not include a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought (in this case, Does 1-10). The Judge also noted that the relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or the amount listed in the statement of damages, and that a trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. The case is set for hearing on December 7, 2023, and the Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
