considered the moving and opposing papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On
November 3, 2022, Plaintiff Johnny Lorenzo Perez (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants Daniel Wreszin (“Defendant”),
City of Los Angeles, and Does 1-20 for motor vehicle tort, general negligence,
premises liability, and dangerous conditions of public property. 
On
March 10, 2023, Defendant filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Roes 1-20 for total indemnity, implied partial indemnity,
declaratory relief, and equitable apportionment. 
On
September 21, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to deem admitted matters specified
in requests for admission and request for sanctions, set to be heard on
December 7, 2023.  On November 27, 2023,
Plaintiff filed an opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for May 2, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendant
requests that the Court deem admitted the matters specified in requests for
admission, set one, and impose $568.65 in sanctions on Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel. 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
August 18, 2023, Defendant served (or attempted to serve) requests for admissions, set one, on
Plaintiff. Responses were due on September 19, 2023.  Plaintiff did not provide timely responses
and had not provided responses by the time Defendant filed this motion. 
Plaintiff
states that his counsel did not receive the requests for admission when Defendant served or attempted to serve them.  However, when Plaintiff's counsel later received Defendant's motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission, Plaintiff's counsel evidently obtained a copy of the requests for admission.  On November 23, 2023, before the hearing on Defendant's motion, Plaintiff served objections to the requests for admission. Defendant has not filed a reply indicating if he believes that Plaintiff's objections to the requests for admission are in substantial compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  In the absence of an argument that Plaintiff's objections are not in substantial compliance with section 2033.220, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's service of the objections before the hearing on Defendant's motion requires denial of the motion.   The Court declines to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), because the Court cannot determine on this record if Defendant’s counsel properly served, or if Plaintiff’s counsel
received, the requests for admission in August 2023.  Therefore, the Court cannot find that Plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses -- rather than, for example, Defendant's failure to properly serve the requests for admission -- necessitated Defendant's motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the motion of Defendant Daniel
Wreszin to deem admitted the matters specified in requests for admission, set
one, and for sanctions. 
Moving party is to give notice of the Court’s ruling. 
Moving party is to file proof of service of the Court’s
ruling within five days.
