COUNSEL’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiffs’ counsel, Analicia
  Avila, Esq., asks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Carlos Galvez and Guadalupe Lopez. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
  Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed
  to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
  form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising
  the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under
  Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent
  under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in
  Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
  service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order
  on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
  proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion
  to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw.  The motion should be granted if there is no
  prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
DISCUSSION
