PARTY’S REQUEST 
Hope

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Demurrer 
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint
has been filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30,
to the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds: 
* * * 
“(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. 
“(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this
subdivision, ‘uncertain’ includes ambiguous and unintelligible. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subds. (e), (f).) 
In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or by judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a) [“When any ground
for objection to a complaint, cross-complaint, or answer appears on the face
thereof, or from any matter of which the court is required to or may take judicial
notice, the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the
pleading”].) 
“For
the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer
admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded (i.e., all ultimate
facts alleged, but not conclusions, deductions, or conclusions of facts or
law).”  (L. Edmon
and C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023)
¶ 7:43, p. 7(l)-25, emphasis omitted (Cal. Practice Guide).) 
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only
allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550 (Doe).) “All that is required of a plaintiff,
as a matter of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is that his
complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precision
and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature,
source and extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft
Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.) “[D]emurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a
defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency,
Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848, fn. 3, citing Lickiss v. Fin.
Indus. Regulatory Auth. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135 (Lickiss).)
In addition, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, courts
strictly construe a demurrer for uncertainty “because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Lickiss, supra,
208 Cal.App.4th at p. 1135, citing Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
B.
 Premises liability and negligence 
“‘The
elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for
negligence.’” (Jones v. Awad (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1200, 1207, quoting Castellon
v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) “Accordingly, the
plaintiff must prove, “ ‘ “a legal duty to use due care, a breach of such legal
duty, and the breach as the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.”
’ ” (Ibid., quoting Beacon Residential Community Assn. v. Skidmore,
Owings & Merrill LLP (2014) 59 Cal.4th 568, 573.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The complaint 
The
complaint alleges the following:         
          General negligence claim: 
On or about October 24, 2021, Plaintiff entered Defendants’ premises located
at 1029 South Normandie Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90006 (“premises”) and a stack
of chairs fell on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff
sustained serious injuries and incurred damages as direct result of the
negligence of Defendants in failing to properly and securely stack the chairs
so they would not fall. Defendants were further negligent in managing,
supervising, controlling and/or operating the premises including, but not
limited to, negligently hiring, training, supervising, controlling and/or
monitoring employees and agents responsible for the stacking of the chairs as
well as inspections, supervision, control and operations; and failing to provide a
safe, suitable and adequate premises for individuals using the premises.
Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that said hazardous,
dangerous conditions were caused and created by Defendants. Defendants also
failed to warn Plaintiff of the risks and dangers which Defendants created or
knew about, or in the existence of reasonable care should have known about, and
which were unknown and not readily apparent to Plaintiff.  Defendants' failure to warn was a direct legal
cause of Plaintiffs injuries and damages. Defendants had actual and/or
constructive notice of the dangerous conditions. 
Premises
liability claim:  Plaintiff was injured when
negligently and improperly stacked chairs fell on Plaintiff while on the
premises, causing injuries/damages to Plaintiff. Defendants are negligent for
their failure to provide a safe, adequate premises. Plaintiff is informed and
believes and thereon alleges that said hazardous, dangerous conditions were
caused by Defendants and/or existed for a sufficient time prior to the incident
for Defendants to have corrected, removed, and/or warned Plaintiff of said
conditions, which Defendants negligently and carelessly failed to do.
Defendants had actual and/or constructive notice. Plaintiff incorporates the
facts as set forth in the General Negligence Cause of Action. 
B.   Hope Sight’s demurrer 
Hope
Sight argues that it moved out of the premises three years before the alleged
incident and no longer owned or controlled the property.  Hope Sight asks the Court to take judicial
notice of the following documents which, according to Hope Sight, prove these
facts: 
(1) “Grant
Deed from Hope Sight to JNC Properties as of March 28, 2018 the subject
property at 1029 S. Normandie Ave., Los Angeles, CA which was recorded at the
Recorder’s Office of the County of Los Angeles, a copy of which is submitted
herewith as Exhibit 1”; 
(2) “Grant
Deed from Young Soo Chu to Hope Sight as of March 25, 2018 another property at
1508 6th Ave., Los Angeles, CA which was recorded at the Recorder’s Office of
the County of Los Angeles, a copy of which is submitted herewith as Exhibit 2”; 
(3) “bills
from Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (“LADWP”) in the years of 2018
and 2019 sent to Hope Sight at 1508 6 Ave., Los Angeles, CA, a copy of which is
submitted herewith as Exhibit 3”; 
(4) “Annual
Secured Property Tax Bills for the years of 2020 to 2021, and 2021 to 2022,
sent to Hope Sight at 1508 6th Ave., Los Angeles, CA, a copy of which is
submitted herewith as Exhibit 4”; and 
(5) “the
statement of information recorded, as of September 2020 and April 2022, with
California Secretary of State specifying Hope Sight’s address as 1508 6th Ave.,
Los Angeles, CA, a copy of which is submitted herewith as Exhibit 5.” 
The
Court takes judicial notice of the documents under Evidence Code sections 452,
subdivision (h), and 453. 
The
grant deed dated March 28, 2018 shows that Hope Sight transferred the premises
to JNC Properties, which Plaintiff sued as Doe 6.  (Exh. 1.) 
The complaint alleges that the Doe defendants were “agents or employees
of other named defendants and acted within the scope of that agency or
employment.”  Therefore, the Court cannot
rule out the possibility that Hope Sight, through its alleged agent JNC
Properties, retains an ownership interest in the premises that exposes it to
potential liability under the complaint. 
The
Court overrules the demurrer. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court OVERRULES Defendant Hope
Sight Mission Association’s demurrer to Plaintiff Mag Cho’s complaint.
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days of the date of the hearing.
