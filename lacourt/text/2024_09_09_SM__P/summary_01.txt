And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Hughes' motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff sued defendant insurance brokers Shekhtman and YS Insurance for professional negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty after fire loss claims were denied. The plaintiff seeks to add two new defendants, General Insurance Company of America and Safeco Insurance, and additional allegations regarding YS Insurance's negligent use of a Safeco address analyst tool. The motion complies with the procedural requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, and recent discovery has unearthed factual misrepresentations by Safeco and YS Insurance, giving rise to the amendment. The defendants do not oppose the motion, and the judge grants leave to file the second amended complaint.
