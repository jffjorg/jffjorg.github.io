And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Freeman et al. v. Lannes et al., Case No. 23SMCV05520. The case involves a motion by the plaintiff, Freeman, to enforce a written settlement agreement reached with the defendants, Lannes and Torres. The agreement was conditional and included language from California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, which allows for ex parte enforcement upon default. The defendants failed to make required payments, and the plaintiff has moved to enforce the settlement. Because the parties filed a stipulation that includes the required language and is signed by both parties, the court has jurisdiction to interpret the terms of the settlement. The court also notes that it may interpret the terms of the settlement, but may not create new material terms. Since there is no opposition to the motion, the judge grants the motion to enforce the settlement.
