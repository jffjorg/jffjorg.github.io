Freeman, et al. v.
Lannes, et al., Case No. 23SMCV05520
Hearing Date: September
9, 2024 
Plaintiff Freeman’s
Motion to Enforce Written Settlement Pursuant to CCP 664.6 (UNOPPOSED)
 
Plaintiffs Freeman brought an unlawful detainer action
against defendants Lannes and Torres for failure to pay rent. The court
dismissed the action under CCP 664.6 after the parties reached a conditional
settlement. Plaintiffs now move to enforce the settlement under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6. No opposition is filed.
The court may interpret the terms and conditions of a
settlement, Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566, but the
court may not create material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding
what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed upon. Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810.
The court has
jurisdiction because the parties filed a stipulation which includes §664.6
language and is signed by both parties. Freeman Decl. Ex. 1. The stipulation
allows ex parte enforcement upon default. Id. ¶5, 15. Freeman states
that defendants defaulted by failing to make required payments. Freeman Decl. ¶9.
Considering this evidence, and lack of opposition, enforcing the settlement is
appropriate. GRANTED.
