  Case Number:  21SMCV01184    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2023    Dept:  P Tentative Ruling 
Yadegar v.
Shayanian et al., Case No. 21SMCV01184 
Hearing Date
October 16, 2023 
Plaintiff
Yadegar’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal 
 
On August 3, 2023
the court dismissed this case due to plaintiff’s failure to appear at three
hearings: a post-arbitration status conference (June 1, 2023) and two OSC
hearings (July 6 and August 3, 2023). Yadegar’s counsel Seuthe states he failed
to appear because he mistakenly took the June hearing off his calendar after
the death of the parties’ arbitrator and because notices of rulings after the
June 1 and July 6 hearings went to his spam email folder. 
 
Under Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc. §473, the court may relieve a party from a “judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §473(b).

 
Seuthe states plaintiff’s
failure to appear resulted from good-faith mistakes. Defendant argues these excuses
are unreasonable, and a reasonable attorney should have checked the docket.
Although the court agrees best practices include checking the docket, Seuthe
diligently prosecuted the case, and the failure to appear at the hearings was not
the result of unusual carelessness. As there is a strong public policy in favor
of resolving disputes on the merits, the dismissal is set aside. GRANTED.
