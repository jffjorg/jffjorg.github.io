And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Yadegar's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case is GRANTED. The case was dismissed due to Yadegar's failure to appear at three hearings, but Yadegar's counsel, Seuthe, claims that the failure was the result of good-faith mistakes, including mistakenly taking the June hearing off his calendar and notices of rulings going to his spam email folder. The Judge agrees that these excuses are not unreasonable, and that Seuthe diligently prosecuted the case. The Judge also notes that there is a strong public policy in favor of resolving disputes on the merits, and therefore the dismissal is set aside.
