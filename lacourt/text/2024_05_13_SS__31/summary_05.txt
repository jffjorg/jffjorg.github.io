And here is the summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling is regarding a motion to continue the trial date from July 8, 2024, to a later date. The case involves a motor vehicle collision and a subsequent lawsuit filed by Josue Ramirez against Tyler Kelleher, Horizon Production Resources, LLC, and Foxburg Productions, LLC. The defendants have yet to file an answer to the complaint, and the plaintiff has filed an amendment to the complaint naming Foxburg Productions, LLC as a defendant. The defendants have requested a six-month continuance of the trial date to allow for further discovery and potential resolution of the case. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the case is already two years old and that the plaintiff has suffered severe injuries. The court finds good cause to continue the trial date and grants the motion.
