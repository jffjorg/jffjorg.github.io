And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff's counsel claims that the initial handling attorney, Alexander Polyachenko, passed away in September 2022, and that the associate attorney, Vanessa Garcia, left the firm to open her own office. As a result, the office failed to calendar the hearing date, leading to the non-appearance. The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel's affidavit of mistake due to the passing of the initial handling attorney is sufficient to set aside the dismissal. However, the court notes that no proof of service of the summons and complaint has been filed on any named defendant to date, and sets an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proof of Service.
