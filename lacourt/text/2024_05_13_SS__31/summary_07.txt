And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to quash service of summons and complaint in a case between Rosalinda Padua (plaintiff) and Philip Barnes (defendant) regarding a motor vehicle collision. The defendant challenges the service of the summons and complaint, alleging that he was never served a copy of the documents. The defendant has rebutted the presumption that service was proper, so the burden is on the plaintiff to establish that service was proper. Since no opposition was filed, the plaintiff has not met its burden, and the defendant's motion is granted.
