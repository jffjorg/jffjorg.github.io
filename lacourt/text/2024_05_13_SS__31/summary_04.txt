And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motions for terminating sanctions filed by Vons and Kehe against Plaintiff Patrick Rayfield. The Plaintiff failed to serve verified responses and pay monetary sanctions as ordered by the court. The court finds that the purpose of discovery sanctions is to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting from lack of information, and that imposing terminating sanctions would not serve a remedial purpose. The court grants the motions for monetary sanctions, but reduces the amount requested to $225. The court also orders the Plaintiff and his counsel to pay the imposed sanctions.
