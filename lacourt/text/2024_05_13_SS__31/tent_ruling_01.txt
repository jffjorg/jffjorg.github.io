  Case Number:  18STCV08840    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  05/13/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  18STCV08840 FARHAD NAZARIAN vs JOHARI MOHSEN, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  JOHARI MOHSEN RECOMMENDATION:  GRANT in the following amounts: Principal damages: $45,382.75 Costs: $1,931.65 TOTAL: $47,314.40   TENTATIVE  Plaintiff Farhad Nazarian (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants American Pacific Forwarders, Inc., Inc. [sic], Fernando Lucas Garcia, and Johari Mohsen for damages arising from a multi-vehicle collision. American Pacific Forwarders, Inc., Inc. and Fernando Lucas Garcia were dismissed on on April 18, 2022, and Does 1-75 were dismissed on June 27, 2023.   Johari Mohsen remains as the sole defendant in this action. Plaintiff seeks $114,682.75 in special damages, $700,000 in general damages, and $1,931.65 in costs against him.  Plaintiff has obtained new entry of default against Jahari Mohsen after the last denial on January 23, 2024. The Court reviews the request for court judgment filed on April 3, 2024, and the declarations and proposed judgment filed on April 16, 2024.   Special Damages  Plaintiff seeks $114,682.75 in special damages, which he declares is comprised of $17,321.47 in medical costs, $3,061.28 in property damage to his vehicle, and $94,300 in future costs.   In terms of medical specials and property damage, Plaintiff has submitted sufficient medical bills for $17,321.47 and property damage of $3,061.28 in support thereof. However, Plaintiff’s declaration fails to specify what the future medical costs are for, what specific treatment, and how that would amount to $94,300. Further, none of the medical records provided support any future medical treatment, or the expected expenses for the unspecified treatment. The Court will not grant unknown and unsubstantiated requests.     Therefore, Plaintiff’s special damages is granted only in the amount of $20,382.75.  General Damages  Plaintiff seeks $700,000 in general damages to compensate for pain, inconvenience, suffering, disruption of life, and the closing of his business in which he estimates he lost more than $400,000 in income from December 19, 2016 through March 31, 2024.  First, there is no evidence that Plaintiff earned over $125,000 a year, or any support for lost income. Loss of earnings is a category of special damages, which appears to have been conflated here with general damages. The Statement of Damages served by publication does not seek any special damages related to loss of earnings or loss of future earning capacity, and thus its inclusion in Plaintiff’s declaration is without basis. (Plotitsa v. Superior Ct. (1983) 140 Cal. App. 3d 755, 761 [Section 425.11 requires special and general damages to be specified, including stating the amount sought to be recovered].)  Second, there is no support substantiating $700,000 for pain and suffering. Plaintiff declares that “sustained severe injuries and suffered major damage” to his health, and that he had left shoulder arthroscopy surgery. The limited records provided by Plaintiff relate only to medical bills and property damage repair costs. There are no medical records, or any other evidence, regarding the extent of Plaintiff’s injuries and the related pain and suffering associated with those injuries arising from this motor vehicle collision. The Court previously noted that Plaintiff did not provide evidence in support of his general damages. (Min. Order, Jan. 23, 2024.) On this renewed application, Plaintiff still has not provided any evidence in support of his general damages, especially to the extent requested.   Therefore, the Court reduces the amount in general damages to $25,000.  Costs  Plaintiff seeks costs in the total amount of $1,931.65 for clerk’s filing fees of $555 and process server’s fees of $1,376.65. The request is granted. (CCP § 1033.5(a)(1) and (4).)  Conclusion  Therefore, the application for default judgment filed on April 3, 2024 is GRANTED in the principal amount of $45,382.75, and $1,931.65 in costs, against Johari Mohsen.  Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
