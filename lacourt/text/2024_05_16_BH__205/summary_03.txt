Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained in part and overruled in part Defendants' demurrer to Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The court has found that Plaintiff has not stated a claim for battery against Tyler Clark because Plaintiff has not alleged that Clark engaged in harmful or offensive contact. The court has also found that Plaintiff has not stated a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against either Defendant because the alleged conduct was not extreme or outrageous. The court has found that Clark is not liable for negligence or premises liability because he did not own, possess, or control the subject premises. The court has found that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for negligent hiring, retention, or supervision against Clark because there is no allegation that Clark knew the employees were unfit.
