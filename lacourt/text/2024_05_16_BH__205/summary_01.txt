And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the Defendant's motion for a protective order, which seeks to limit the Plaintiff's discovery requests. The Defendant argues that the requests are duplicative, overbroad, and irrelevant, and that some seek privileged information. However, the Defendant has failed to identify specific requests that are allegedly duplicative or overbroad, and has not specified the amount of time it would take to respond to the requests. The court finds that the Defendant's motion is overbroad and unsupported by the record, and grants the motion in part, allowing the Defendant to respond to some discovery requests, but denying the motion in part.
