And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's PMQ. The judge orders Defendant to produce its PMQ on certain topics within 10 days. The judge finds that certain topics are relevant to show Defendant's knowledge of the engine defect and the effectiveness of its repair efforts. The judge also finds that evidence of similar incidents in other vehicles is relevant to prove a defective condition. The judge concludes that Defendant's policies and procedures for complying with the Song Beverly Act are relevant to show compliance or willful avoidance of the Act's repurchase requirements. The judge denies production of the PMQ on certain topics, including those relating to document preservation and production, and those relating to Defendant's third party dispute resolution program.
