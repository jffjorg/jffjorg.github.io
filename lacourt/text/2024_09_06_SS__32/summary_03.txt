And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Brayden Medina Molina (Plaintiff) and Target Corporation (Defendant). The Plaintiff had moved to compel the Defendant to provide responses to a request for production of documents, set four, and to award monetary sanctions.

The judge found that the Defendant had failed to serve timely responses to the request and had not established that its failure was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The judge granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel the Defendant to provide verified responses, without objections, within 5 days.

The judge also awarded the Plaintiff monetary sanctions against the Defendant in the amount of $1,061.65, which represents 2 hours of attorney time and a filing fee. The judge denied the Plaintiff's request for issue sanctions and did not award any additional sanctions.

The judge ordered the Defendant to provide verified responses to the request for production of documents, set four, and to pay the awarded monetary sanctions within 30 days of the date of the order. The Plaintiff was ordered to provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
