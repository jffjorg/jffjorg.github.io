[1] The
Court notes that both Lang and SJP Limited Partnership are cases
decided by the Second District Court of Appeal. SJP Limited Partnership
was decided after Lang and relies on Benedict.


[2] In
opposition, Plaintiff does not explicitly contend that this motion is untimely
based on the mandatory provision, but instead cites to the discretionary
provision which also requires that it be made “within a reasonable time”, not to
exceed six months. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Opp., 10.) Neither party
addresses the timeliness of the motion when judgment has not yet been entered.


[3] In
opposition, Plaintiff demonstrates that counsel was first contacted by MDZ on
December 4, 2023. (Dequito Decl., Exh. 7.)
