And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to set aside judgment. The court notes that the case is related to two previous cases, Lang and SJP Limited Partnership, which were decided by the Second District Court of Appeal. The court also notes that the plaintiff's counsel was contacted by the defendant, MDZ, on December 4, 2023. The court is considering the timeliness of the motion, which is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The court is also considering whether the mandatory provision or the discretionary provision applies. The plaintiff's opposition does not explicitly argue that the motion is untimely based on the mandatory provision, but instead cites to the discretionary provision. The court is seeking further clarification on the timeliness of the motion and will issue a final ruling at a later date.
