```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to vacate the entry of default. The motion was filed on June 6, 2024, which is after the six-month time limit for granting statutory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). Although the defendants' counsel claims that MDZ staff's mistake led to the default, the court finds that the counsel has not established that MDZ was timely notified and retained by Loya to represent the particular defendants in this case, and therefore, the default was not caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The court also notes that the defendants' counsel did not provide a declaration regarding the failure to timely file an answer, which is a critical fact in determining whether the default was caused by the attorney's mistake.
