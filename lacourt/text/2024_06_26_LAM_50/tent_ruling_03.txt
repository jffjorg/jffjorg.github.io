[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFFS’
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 



 
Plaintiffs Daniel Acosta (“Acosta”), Salvador Gomez (“Gomez”) Marcos Ochoa (“Ochoa”), and Xiomara
Sanchez (“Sanchez”), (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
request entry of default judgment against Defendants Libra Hollywood, LLC and
John Greenwood (jointly, “Defendants”). Plaintiffs
appear to seek judgment in the total amount of $32,078.37, comprising $26,480.00 in damages, $3,388.78 in
interest, $923.53 in costs, and $1,286.06 in attorney’s fees.  
The Court notes a number of defects with the submitted
default judgment package. 
First, Plaintiffs’
proposed judgment states, inter alia, that “Plaintiffs shall also be awarded…$1,155.87
in recoverable costs against Defendants.” However, the request for court
judgment (Form CIV-100) indicates that Plaintiffs seek $923.53 in costs.
(Request, Item 2(d).) The proposed judgment also states that “Plaintiffs shall
collect the total of $34,600.10, encompassing all recovery.” However, the
request for court judgment indicates that Plaintiffs seek a total of
$32,078.37. (Request, Item 2(f).) 
In addition, in the proposed judgment, Plaintiffs refer to “Defendants”
but the proposed judgment does not define this term. Further, certain amounts
listed in the proposed judgment do not match Plaintiffs’ supporting
declarations. 
Specifically, the proposed judgment states that Acosta seeks, inter
alia, “[p]ayment for unpaid minimum wages in the amount of $2,000,”
and “[p]rejudgment Interest in
the amount of $753.33.” However, in his supporting declaration, Acosta states
that he “estimate[s] that [he is] owed a total of $1[,]550 in unpaid minimum
wages,” and that he “estimate[s] that [he is] owed at least $833.75 in prejudgment
interest.” (Acosta Decl., ¶¶ 9, 13(c).)
In addition, the proposed
judgment states that Sanchez seeks, inter alia, “[p]ayment for unpaid
minimum wages in the amount of $3,060,” and “[p]rejudgment Interest in the
amount of $1,020.” However, in her supporting declaration, Sanchez states that
she “estimate[s] that [she is] owed a total of $1[,]860 in unpaid minimum
wages,” and that she “estimate[s] that [she] owed at least $1,013 in
prejudgment interest.” (Sanchez Decl., ¶¶ 9, 13(c).) 
Further, the proposed
judgment refers to “Salvador Guzman.” (Emphasis added.) However, the
Complaint names “Salvador Gomez” as a defendant. To the extent the proposed
judgment is referring to Salvador Gomez, it states that Gomez seeks, inter
alia, “[p]ayment for unpaid minimum wages in the amount of $1,400” and
“[p]rejudgment Interest in the amount of $618.33.” However, in his supporting
declaration, Gomez states that he “estimate[s] that [he is] owed a total of
$1[,]240 in unpaid minimum wages, and that he “estimate[s] that [he is] owed at
least $690.33 in prejudgment interest…” (Gomez Decl., ¶¶ 9, 13(c).) 
In addition, the proposed
judgment states that Ochoa seeks, inter alia, “[p]ayment for unpaid
minimum wages in the amount of $2,150,” and “[p]rejudgment Interest in the
amount of $803.83.” However, in his supporting declaration, Ochoa states that
he “estimate[s] that [he is] owed a total of $1[,]550 in unpaid minimum wages,”
and that he “estimate[s] that [he is] owed at least $851.66 in prejudgment
interest.” (Ochoa Decl., ¶¶ 9, 13(c))
Second, in
the April 16, 2024 Order on Plaintiffs’ prior request for default judgment, the
Court noted that “it is unclear from Plaintiffs’ supporting declarations how
many days of prejudgment interest each plaintiff seeks.” (Order at p. 3:8-10.)
Plaintiffs still do not appear to specify the number of days of interest each
plaintiff seeks. Thus, it is difficult for the Court to determine how
Plaintiffs calculated the requested interest amounts. 
Third, in
the April 16, 2024 Order on Plaintiffs’ prior request, the Court noted that
“Plaintiffs do not appear to provide a supporting declaration from their
counsel substantiating the attorney’s fees requested.” (Order at p. 3:14-15.) Plaintiffs still do not provide any such
declaration. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies the request for
default judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiffs a
schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
