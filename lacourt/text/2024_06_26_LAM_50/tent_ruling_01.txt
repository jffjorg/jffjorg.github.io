[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PETITION
  FOR AN ORDER NOMINATING ARBITRATORS UNDER CODE OF CIVIL PROCDURE § 1281.6
 




 
Background 
On November 2, 2023, Petitioner Tich Van Nguyen (“Petitioner”) filed a
“Petition…for Assignment of Case Number in Uninsured Motorist Action” against
Respondent Progressive West Insurance Company (“Respondent”) in this action. 
 In the Petition, Petitioner alleges,
inter alia, that “Petitioner seeks to have a case number assigned to the
above entitled uninsured motorist arbitration pursuant to Insurance
Code Section 11580.2(f)(1). A case number is needed by the petitioner to
allow the filing of a Motion to Appoint a Neutral Arbitrator in this uninsured
motorist action for the the [sic] hearing of the binding arbitration of the
matter and motions to compel verified responses to discovery.” (Petition, ¶ 1.)

Petitioner now seeks “an [o]rder nominating arbitrators.” Respondent
filed a response to the petition. 
Discussion 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.6
provides as follows: 
 
“If the arbitration agreement provides a method
of appointing an arbitrator, that method shall be followed. If the arbitration
agreement does not provide a method for appointing an arbitrator, the parties
to the agreement who seek arbitration and against whom arbitration is sought
may agree on a method of appointing an arbitrator and that method shall be
followed. In the absence of an agreed method, or if the agreed method fails or
for any reason cannot be followed, or when an arbitrator appointed fails to act
and his or her successor has not been appointed, the court, on petition of a
party to the arbitration agreement, shall appoint the arbitrator.
 
When a petition is made to the court to appoint a neutral
arbitrator, the court shall nominate five persons from lists of persons
supplied jointly by the parties to the arbitration or obtained from a
governmental agency concerned with arbitration or private disinterested
association concerned with arbitration. The parties to the agreement who seek
arbitration and against whom arbitration is sought may within five days of
receipt of notice of the nominees from the court jointly select the arbitrator
whether or not the arbitrator is among the nominees. If the parties fail to select an arbitrator
within the five-day period, the court shall appoint the arbitrator from the
nominees.” 
            In his supporting declaration,
Petitioner’s counsel states that “on August 31, 2023, I sent Respondent’s
counsel a letter which I [sic] proposed a list of four proposed arbitrators.
The letter requested Ms. Korff to select an arbitrator or propose her own list
of arbitrators no later than September 15, 2023.” (Dunham Decl., ¶ 3.)
Petitioner’s counsel’s August 31, 2023 letter provides, inter alia, that
“[o]n August 7, 2023, I wrote you and advised that this office would be
agreeable to utilize [sic] the following as arbitrators: 1. Mitch Green of
Green Mediation 2. James P. Spaltro (IVAMS) 3. William Molfetta, Esq. 4. Barry
Plotkin, Esq…Should the same not be acceptable, I would request that you
provide me with the names of an arbitrator you would agree to act in this
matter…” (Dunham Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) Petitioner’s counsel states that he “did
not receive[] any response to [his] effort to have a neutral arbitrator
selected.” (Dunham Decl., ¶ 4.) Petitioner asserts that accordingly, the Court
should “nominate five persons for the parties to select from.” (Petition at p. 5:5-7.)

            In support of its response,
Respondent submits the Declaration of Eve H. Korff, counsel for Respondent. Ms.
Korff states, inter alia, that “[b]y email dated May 13, 2024 I advised
opposing counsel of respondent’s agreement to attorney William Molfetta serving
as the arbitrator in this matter…By email dated May 13, 2024 opposing counsel’s
office advised me that William Molfetta was no longer hearing uninsured
motorist arbitrations, and inquired whether respondent was agreeable to any
other arbitrator previously proposed by the petitioner.” (Korff Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.)
            Ms. Korff also states that “[o]n
April 25, 2024 by email correspondence to Kevin Wu of Donald T. Dunham’s
office, attorney’s for petitioner, I proposed retired judges Chris Conway,
Linda Marks and Patricia Schnegg for petitioner’s consideration as possible
arbitrators.” (Korff Decl., ¶ 7.) In addition, Ms. Korff states that “[b]y
email dated May 13, 2024 to opposing counsel’s office, I requested that
additional names be provided for the respondent’s consideration as possible
arbitrators.” (Korff Decl., ¶ 10.) Ms. Korff indicates that “[b]y email dated
May 15, 2024 opposing counsel’s office proposed the Retired Judge Cesar
Sarmiento as a possible arbitrator.” (Korff Decl., ¶ 12.) Ms. Korff further
indicates that “[b]y email dated May 15, 2024, I proposed retired judges Christopher
Warner, Christopher Conway and Suzanne G. Brueguera as possible arbitrators for
petitioner’s consideration.” (Korff Decl., ¶ 13.) 
Ms. Korff also states that “[b]y email dated May 30, 2024, I…also
suggested the following additional arbitrators…retired judges Robert Polis and
Steven Lachs, and attorney Jay Horton.” (Korff Decl., ¶ 16.) Ms. Korff states
that “[b]y email dated May 31, 2024, opposing counsel advised the arbitrators
proposed by me on the previous day were not acceptable and that he would
proceed with his motion to compel the appointment of an arbitrator and his
office wants to litigate all issues at arbitration.” (Korff Decl., ¶ 17.) 
The parties did not submit a joint list of proposed arbitrators. However,
based on the declarations of the parties’ counsel, it appears that Petitioner
proposes the following four arbitrators: 
 
1.    
Mitchell Green, Esq. - Green Mediation 
2.    
James P. Spaltro, Esq. - IVAMS 
3.    
Barry Plotkin, Esq.
4.    
Hon. Cesar Sarmiento, Ret. – Judicate West[1] 
In addition, based on Mr. Korff’s declaration, it appears Respondent
proposes the following eight arbitrators: 
 
1.    
Hon. Chris Conway, Ret.  – Judicate West
2.    
Hon. Linda Marks, Ret. – Judicate West
3.    
Hon. Patricia Schnegg, Ret. – Judicate West
4.    
Hon. Christopher Warner, Ret. – Judicate West
5.    
Hon. Suzanne G. Bruguera, Ret. – ADR Services, Inc. 
6.    
Hon. Robert Polis, Ret. – Judicate West
7.    
Hon. Steven Lachs, Ret. – ADR Services, Inc.
8.    
Jay Horton, Esq.
            As set forth above, Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.6 provides, inter alia,
that “[w]hen a petition is made to the
court to appoint a neutral arbitrator, the court shall nominate five persons from
lists of persons supplied jointly by the parties to the arbitration or obtained
from a governmental agency concerned with arbitration or private disinterested
association concerned with arbitration.” Accordingly, the Court nominates the
following five arbitrators: Hon. Suzanne G. Bruguera, Ret. Chris Conway, Ret.,
Ret., Hon. Steven Lachs, Ret., Hon. Cesar Sarmiento, Ret. , Hon. Patricia
Schnegg, Ret., 
 
            Conclusion 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.6, within five days of receipt of notice of the
above-referenced nominees from the Court, Petitioner and Respondent “may…jointly select the arbitrator whether or not the
arbitrator is among the nominees.” If the parties fail to select an arbitrator
within the five-day period, the Court shall appoint the arbitrator from the
nominees. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1281.6.)
