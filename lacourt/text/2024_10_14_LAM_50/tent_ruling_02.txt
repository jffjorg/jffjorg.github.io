[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff
Navy Federal Credit Union (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default judgment
against Defendant Artium AME, Inc. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount
of $59,530.19, comprising $56,977.14 in damages, $2,029.54 in attorney’s fees,
and $523.51 in costs.
On
August 13, 2024, the Court issued an Order on Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment which provides, inter alia, that “it does not appear that
Plaintiff filed the declaration and proposed order regarding the original of
the note. [Plaintiff] will file the proposed order by 9/13/24. The hearing is
continued to 10/14/24…”  
On
August 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Declaration in Support of Relief Sought in
Default Judgment – Authenticated Copy in Lieu of the Original” and a proposed
order. The proposed order provides, inter alia, that “[t]he Court accepts the
authenticated copies attached as Exhibit A, B, and C in lieu of the
original(s).” However, no Exhibits are attached to the declaration and proposed
order. It is unclear whether Plaintiff is referring to the Exhibits attached to
the “Declaration in Support of Request for Default Judgment” filed in this
matter on April 12, 2024. In addition, the August 19, 2024 declaration only
references an “Exhibit A” and “Exhibit B,” not an “Exhibit C.”  (Martinez-Little Decl., ¶ 3.) 
Otherwise, the Court
finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently supported its request with the submitted
declarations and evidence. 
If Plaintiff corrects the
defects identified above in advance of the hearing, the Court is inclined to
grant the request for default judgment.
