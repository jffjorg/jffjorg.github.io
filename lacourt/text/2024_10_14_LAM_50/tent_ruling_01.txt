  ORDER RE: 
  
 
MOTION
  TO COMPEL EUN ZOO LEE’S ATTENDANCE AND TESTIMONY AT DEPOSITION AND MONETARY
  SANCTIONS ($6,250.00)




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 
 



 
            Defendant Robert Lee (“Lee”) moves
for an order compelling Eun Zoo Lee’s attendance and testimony at deposition
and for production of documents. 
Lee’s motion will be continued to a new date as set forth below. NO
HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON OCTOBER 14, 2024. 
Pursuant to the Court’s power to “amend and control its process and
orders so as to make them conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128,
subd. (a)(8)), the Court orders the parties in this case to participate in a
meet and confer with the Court (“Informal Discovery Conference” or “IDC”). Lead
or other designated counsel for the parties with full authority are ordered to
participate in person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel
regarding available dates, Lee must make a prompt reservation for the IDC using
the Court’s online reservation system. Lee must file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC
form in the department seven days prior to the IDC, and the responding parties
may file the same form in the department setting forth a response three days
prior to the IDC.¿    
Once Lee has confirmed an IDC date, Lee must use the Court’s online
reservation system to continue the motion to a post-IDC discovery hearing date.
The parties are ordered to have with them whatever materials are needed to make
the IDC session productive and successful. Prior to the IDC date, lead or other
designated counsel for the parties, with full authority, are to meet and
confer, in person or via telephone in a further
attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before the IDC. (See
CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).) If the parties resolve their discovery disputes
before the IDC date, Lee is ordered to take both the IDC and the motion off
calendar as soon as possible.¿ 
Lee is ordered to provide notice of this Order.¿
