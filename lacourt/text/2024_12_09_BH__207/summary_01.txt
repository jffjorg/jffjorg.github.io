And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 21SMCV01495, where the Plaintiffs, Trinidad Velazquez, Hector Velazquez, and Wilson Acevedo, are seeking a default judgment against the Defendant, Chisvin Law Group, a Professional Law Corporation, in the amount of $515,281.44. The Plaintiffs are seeking damages of $315,000, prejudgment interest of $199,701.44, and costs of $580.

The Judge has denied the Plaintiffs' request for default judgment, finding that they have not sufficiently substantiated their claims for damages. The Judge notes that the promissory note signed by Craig L. Chisvin on January 1, 2015, does not establish that the Defendant law corporation can be bound by the note, and that the Plaintiffs have not provided evidence that the loan was actually made or that any portion of it remains unpaid.

The Judge has granted the Plaintiffs' request for costs in the amount of $580, as they are the prevailing parties in the action. The Judge's tentative ruling will be subject to further review and consideration before the final judgment is entered.
