MATTER


Request for Default Judgment



 
Plaintiffs Trinidad Velazquez,
Hector Velazquez, and Wilson Acevedo (“Plaintiffs”) request for default
judgment against Defendant Chisvin Law Group, a Professional
Law Corporation (“Defendant”) in the amount of $515,281.44, which is composed
of special damages in the amount of $315,000.00; prejudgment interest in the
amount of $199,701.44; and costs in the amount of $580.00.
 
A.   
Damages
 
            Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges eight causes of action for
(1) Breach of Written Contract; (2) Fraud; (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (4) Negligence;
(5) Conversion; (6) Goods and Services Rendered; (7) Open Book Account; and (8)
Account Stated against Defendants Craig Chisvin and Chisvin Law Group, a
Professional Law Corporation.  Craig
Chisvin (the individual) has since been dismissed from the case.  
 
            Defendant Chisvin Law Group was served with a copy of the
summons and complaint by substitute service on September 17, 2021.  Default was entered against Defendant on February
14, 2022, and the Doe defendants were dismissed on June 21, 2024.  
 
            Plaintiff’s Complaint seeks $495,000
in compensatory damages. (See Compl.) 
Therefore, Plaintiff does not seek damages that are in excess of what is
pled in the Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a) [“The relief
granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in
the complaint”]; Levine v. Smith (2006)
145 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default
judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            In support
of the request, Plaintiff has provided the Declaration of Michael J. Armenta,
attached to which as Exhibit B is a copy of the January 1, 2015 promissory note
signed by Craig L. Chisvin, which provides that replaces eleven loans
pertaining to money Craig L. Chisvin borrowed from Plaintiffs, totaling
$313,500.00, to be paid back from money Defendant (Chisvin Law Group) deposits
into a particular bank account, that Chisvin shall use to pay back the loans,
with a due date of January 1, 2018.
 
            However,
only Chisvin, in his individual capacity, is listed as “borrower” on the
promissory note, which is simply signed by Chisvin, without reference to the
Defendant law corporation entity at the signature line.  Although the Court recognizes that the intent
was for Defendant law corporation to make payments and the law corporation
bears the same name as Chisvin, there is no evidence in the record establishing
that Chisvin can bind Defendant law corporation.
 
            Further,
Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that the money was actually loaned or that
any portion thereof remains unpaid. 
Moreover, Plaintiffs have not explained the discrepancy between the
$315,000 sought and the $313,500 loan amount listed on the promissory note.
 
            Therefore,
the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently substantiated they are
entitled to the requested $315,000 in damages from Defendant. 
 
B.   
Prejudgment Interest
 
            Because Plaintiffs have not
demonstrated entitlement to the requested $315,000 damages, the Court similarly
cannot calculate the appropriate prejudgment interest.           
 
C.   
Costs
 
            Plaintiff also requests $580 in costs composed of $495 in filing fees and $85 in process server fees. (CIV-100; see
also Memorandum of Costs.)  Plaintiffs’
request for costs is granted as Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties in this
action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Because Plaintiffs have not sufficiently substantiated
the requested $315,000 in damages, the Court denies Plaintiffs’ request for
default judgment.
