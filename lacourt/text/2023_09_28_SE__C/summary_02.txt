## English Summary:

The judge denied LAUSD's motion for summary judgment in a personal injury case filed by a minor student, I.H.  

I.H. alleges he was sexually assaulted by other students during gym class, and that LAUSD and its employees failed to adequately supervise the students. LAUSD argued that it had a sufficient supervision plan in place and was not liable for the alleged assault.

The judge found that there were enough disputed facts to warrant a trial. The judge noted that LAUSD had a duty to supervise students and that a jury could reasonably find that the school failed to meet that duty. The judge also found that Plaintiff's allegations of prior bullying incidents were relevant to the case.

However, the judge granted LAUSD's motion for summary adjudication on the second cause of action (negligent hiring, retention, and supervision) because the Plaintiff did not oppose it.

The case will now proceed to trial.
