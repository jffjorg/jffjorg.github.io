FELIX GOLDBERG, Trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust’s
unopposed Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party(s) to give notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of September 25, 2023. 
 
On June 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendants K&M MEAT COMPANY, INC.; FELIX GOLDBERG TRUST; and FELIX
GOLDBERG, an individual. Felix Goldbert is the CEO of K&M Meat Company,
Inc. and trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust. 
 
Felix Goldberg, Trustee of the Felix Goldbert Trust now
moves to quash service of summons of the Complaint against the Felix Goldberg
Trust because a trust is not a legal entity that can be sued. 
 
A trust is not a legal entity that can sue or be sued—legal
proceedings are properly directed at the trustee. (Greenspan v. LADT, LLC
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 521.) “As a general rule, the trustee is the real
party in interest with standing to sue and defend on the trust’s behalf.” (Portico
Management Group, LLC v. Harrison (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 4464, 473.). 
 
It is undisputed that Felix Goldberg has not been sued in
his capacity as trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust. To date, no motion/request
for leave to amend the Complaint to name Felix Goldberg as trustee of the Felix
Goldberg Trust as a defendant to this action has been filed/lodged with this
Court. 
 
The unopposed motion to quash is granted. Once a defendant
moves to quash service of process on jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has
the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of
jurisdiction. (Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Food, Inc. (1996) 14
Cal.4th 434, 449.) 
 
The Felix Goldberg Trust cannot be sued. Therefore, this
Court lacks jurisdiction over the Felix Goldbert Trust. Felix Goldberg, as
trustee of the Felix Goldberg trust, is not a named defendant to this action. Accordingly,
the Court finds that it has no basis to confer its jurisdiction over the Felix
Goldberg Trust. Service of the Summons and Complaint are hereby quashed as to
the Felix Goldberg Trust.
