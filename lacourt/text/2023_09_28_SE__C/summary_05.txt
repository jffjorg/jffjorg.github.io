**English Summary:**

In this case, Citibank (the Plaintiff) filed a lawsuit against Robert Avetisian (the Defendant) to collect a debt. Avetisian filed a motion to compel arbitration, arguing that their credit card agreement contained a clause requiring disputes to be settled through arbitration. However, Avetisian did not provide a copy of the agreement or the arbitration clause to the court.  

The judge denied the motion to compel arbitration because there was insufficient evidence to prove a valid arbitration agreement existed.  Essentially, the Plaintiff failed to meet their burden of proof.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied defendant Robert Avetisian's motion to compel arbitration in this lawsuit between Citibank N.A. and Avetisian. Citibank is seeking to collect a debt from Avetisian, but Avetisian is arguing that the two parties agreed to arbitrate their disputes instead of going to court. However, Avetisian did not attach an arbitration agreement to the complaint or the motion, and neither party provided the relevant terms of the agreement. As a result, the court cannot conclude that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties. The judge's decision is based on California law and previous court cases, which state that the court must order the parties to arbitrate if a valid written agreement to arbitrate exists.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in the case of Citibank N.A. v. Robert Avetisian. The defendant had urged the court to enforce an arbitration agreement, allegedly located within the credit card agreement entered into by the parties. However, the court found that no arbitration agreement was attached to the complaint or the motion, and the terms of the purported arbitration agreement were not recited in the complaint or the motion. Despite the plaintiff's lack of substantive opposition to the motion, the court could not conclude that a valid arbitration agreement existed between the parties. The court cited California law, including CCP §1281.2, which requires that a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy exist before the court can order the parties to arbitrate. The court also relied on case law, including Craig v. Brown & Root, Inc. and Engalia v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc., which establish the requirements for a petition to compel arbitration. Ultimately, the court denied the defendant's motion, finding that the defendant had not met the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement.

Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling in the case 21NWCV00512, scheduled for a hearing on 2023-09-28, denies Defendant ROBERT AVETISIAN's Motion to Compel Arbitration. The plaintiff, CITIBANK N.A., filed a lawsuit against the defendant to collect a debt. The defendant urged the court to enforce an arbitration agreement, allegedly part of the credit card agreement between the parties. However, since no Arbitration Agreement was attached to the Complaint or the Motion, and the terms of the purported Arbitration Agreement were not recited, the court couldn't conclude a valid arbitration agreement existed between the parties.
