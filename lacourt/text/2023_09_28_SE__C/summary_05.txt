And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration. The Plaintiff, Citibank N.A., filed a lawsuit to collect a debt from the Defendant, Robert Avetisian. The Defendant argued that a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, but failed to attach the agreement to the Complaint or Motion. The Court found that the Defendant did not provide sufficient evidence to prove the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, and therefore denied the Motion.
