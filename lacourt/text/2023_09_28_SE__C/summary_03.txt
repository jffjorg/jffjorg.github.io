And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant TRI-COUNTIES ASSOCIATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED, INC.'s motion for judgment on the pleadings, but with 30 days' leave to amend. The plaintiff, Gloria Valles, alleges that the defendant is liable for the physical attack on her by Doe 1, who was under the care and custody of the defendant. The defendant argues that it is not liable because it is a regional center and does not have a direct relationship with the plaintiff. The judge has denied the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred, finding that the plaintiff may have been unaware of the defendant's identity and role in the alleged injuries at the time the initial complaint was filed. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice. The case will proceed with the plaintiff having 30 days to amend its complaint.
