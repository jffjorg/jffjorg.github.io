The defendant argues that it is not liable because it is a regional center and does not have a direct relationship with the plaintiff. The judge has denied the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred, finding that the plaintiff may have been unaware of the defendant's identity and role in the alleged injuries at the time the initial complaint was filed. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice. The case will proceed with the plaintiff having 30 days to amend its complaint.

However, the judge also denies the motion based on the statute of limitations argument, finding that the Plaintiff may have factual basis for their claim against TRI-COUNTIES and that more information is needed to determine if the relation-back doctrine applies.

The Plaintiff is granted 30 days to amend their complaint.

```

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, with 30 days' leave to amend. The defendant, TRI-COUNTIES ASSOCIATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED, INC., argued that it is not liable for the plaintiff's injuries because it is a regional center and not a direct care provider. The judge found that the Morohoshi v. Pacific Home (2004) case is applicable and that the plaintiff's claims against the defendant are barred. However, the judge also granted the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint because it appears that the plaintiff may be in possession of facts that might state a cause of action.

The defendant also argued that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred because the defendant was not named as a defendant until almost 3 years after the plaintiff initially filed suit. The judge found that the relation-back doctrine does not apply in this case because the plaintiff was not aware of the defendant's identity and role in the plaintiff's alleged injuries at the time the initial complaint was filed. Therefore, the judge did not grant judgment on the pleadings based on the statute of limitations defense.
