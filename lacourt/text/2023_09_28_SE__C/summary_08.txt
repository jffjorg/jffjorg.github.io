## English Summary:

This tentative ruling deals with a demurrer filed by the Plaintiff, NATIONAL COMMERCIAL RECOVERY, INC. (NCR), against a Cross-Complaint filed by several Defendants.  

NCR, who is acting as a debt collector for J. Label, Inc., alleges the Defendants owe J. Label, Inc. $215,357.89 for purchased fabric. The Defendants deny purchasing fabric from J. Label, Inc. and claim they are not responsible for the alleged debt.  

The Defendants' Cross-Complaint seeks declaratory relief, essentially asking the court to clarify who is responsible for the debt. NCR argued that the Cross-Complaint should be dismissed because as a mere assignee of J. Label, Inc.'s rights, it doesn't assume any personal liabilities. 

The Judge, however, overruled NCR's demurrer. The Judge explained that while generally an assignee doesn't automatically assume liabilities, the circumstances of this case are unclear from the filed documents.  The Judge noted that the pleadings don't definitively show that NCR did not assume any obligations from J. Label, Inc. at the time the debt was assigned. Therefore, the Court finds there is a genuine dispute between the parties regarding their rights and obligations, making declaratory relief a suitable remedy.  

The case will proceed, and the parties will have the opportunity to present further evidence and arguments to the court.

And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by the defendants, L.A. GRAND CLOTHING, INC., SSS APPAREL INC., GUILBERT TEX, INC., SM CLOTHING INC., and SIAMIAK OKHOVAT, individually and as trustee of The Okhovat Revocable Family Trust. The cross-complaint alleges that the plaintiff, NATIONAL COMMERCIAL RECOVERY, INC., has no personal knowledge of the facts relevant to a determination of liabilities between the cross-complainants and other remaining cross-defendants.

The Court finds that the cross-complaint adequately alleges that an actual and immediate controversy exists between the parties regarding their rights and duties with respect to each other for purposes of surviving demurrer. Therefore, the demurrer is OVERRULED. The Court will require notice of this ruling.

The underlying dispute centers on the assignment of rights under an executory contract from J. Label, Inc. to NATIONAL COMMERICAL RECOVERY, INC. The cross-complaint alleges that the cross-complainants have never operated under the name "Angel Kiss" and have never purchased fabric or any other good or service from J Label, while the plaintiff alleges that it was assigned a debt that has already been incurred. The Court will need to determine whether the plaintiff assumed the obligations of its assignor at the time of assignment and whether the cross-complainants and cross-defendants are liable for the amounts alleged to be due and owing to NCR and J Label.
