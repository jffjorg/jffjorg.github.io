And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Felix Goldberg, Trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust, an unopposed motion to quash service of summons. The motion was filed because a trust is not a legal entity that can be sued, and legal proceedings should be directed at the trustee instead. Since the trust is not a legal entity, the Court lacks jurisdiction over it, and service of the summons and complaint is hereby quashed as to the Felix Goldberg Trust.
