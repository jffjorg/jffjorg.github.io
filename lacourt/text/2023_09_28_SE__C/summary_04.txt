## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons filed by Felix Goldberg, Trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust. The judge agrees with the argument that a trust is not a legal entity and cannot be sued, so service of the lawsuit was improperly directed at the trust.

The plaintiff has the burden of showing why the court should exercise jurisdiction over the Felix Goldberg Trust. However, since the trust cannot be sued, the court lacks jurisdiction and the service of summons is quashed. The judge notes that no motion has been filed to amend the complaint to name Felix Goldberg as trustee, which would potentially allow for him to be sued in his individual capacity.

The Judge's tentative ruling in this case is granting the unopposed motion to quash service of summons made by Felix Goldberg, trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust. The Judge states that a trust is not a legal entity that can be sued, and legal proceedings should be directed at the trustee. Felix Goldberg has not been sued in his capacity as trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust, and there has been no motion/request for leave to amend the Complaint to name him as such. Therefore, the Court finds that it has no basis to confer its jurisdiction over the Felix Goldberg Trust, and service of the Summons and Complaint are hereby quashed as to the Felix Goldberg Trust.
