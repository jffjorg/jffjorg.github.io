And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the unopposed demurrer filed by the defendants, 13435 MULBERRY PROPERTIES, LLC, PAUL SCHROEDER, and DELIA RAMIREZ, to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, RORYE MOSLEY JUNIOR, alleges a landlord-tenant disagreement over rental payments. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims are fatally uncertain and cannot be reasonably responded to. The Judge finds that the First Amended Complaint is uncertain due to the lack of separately labeled causes of action and insufficient pleading of the breach of verbal contract. The Judge also finds that the parties are unable to determine which causes of action are directed against each defendant and how each defendant is liable for each cause of action. As a result, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.

**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling to sustain the demurrer filed by the Defendants (13435 MULBERRY PROPERTIES, LLC; PAUL SCHROEDER; and DELIA RAMIREZ) against Plaintiff Rorye Mosley Junior's First Amended Complaint.  The judge finds the complaint to be uncertain and unclear. 

Specifically, the judge points out the lack of clearly defined causes of action within the complaint, making it difficult to determine which claims are directed against which defendants.  Additionally, the complaint fails to adequately state the terms of the alleged verbal contract and how the defendants breached it.  

Because the complaint is so unclear, the judge is sustaining the demurrer without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to amend it.

And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the unopposed demurrer of the defendants, 13435 MULBERRY PROPERTIES, LLC, PAUL SCHROEDER, and DELIA RAMIREZ, to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The Court finds that the pleading is uncertain and unclear, making it impossible for the defendants to reasonably respond to the claims.

The plaintiff, RORYE MOSLEY JUNIOR, alleges that the defendants are liable for various causes of action, including libel, conspiracy, making false claims, intentional negligence, defamation of character, enjoyment of a dwelling, breach of a verbal agreement, and illegal removal from premises. However, the pleading does not specify which causes of action are directed against each defendant, and the terms of the purported rental agreement are not sufficiently pled.

The Court cites California Rules of Court (CRC Rule 2.112) and case law (Butler v. Sequeira and Khoury v. Maly's of Calif. Inc.) to support its decision. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff cannot refile the complaint with additional information to clarify the uncertainty.

Summary:
The tentative ruling is for case number 22NWCP00475, which will take place on September 28, 2023, in department C. The plaintiff, Rorye Mosley Junior, filed a lawsuit on December 2, 2022, against the defendants, 13435 Mulberry Properties, LLC, Paul Schroeder, and Delia Ramirez. The lawsuit stems from a landlord-tenant disagreement regarding rental payments. The defendants filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint, which the judge sustained without leave to amend. The plaintiff's complaint lacks clarity regarding which causes of action are directed against each defendant and the liability of each defendant for each cause of action. Additionally, the plaintiff's breach of verbal contract claim lacks sufficient detail regarding the terms or legal effect of the purported contract and the defendants' breach.
