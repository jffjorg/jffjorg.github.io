And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the unopposed demurrer filed by the defendants, 13435 MULBERRY PROPERTIES, LLC, PAUL SCHROEDER, and DELIA RAMIREZ, to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff, RORYE MOSLEY JUNIOR, alleges a landlord-tenant disagreement over rental payments. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims are fatally uncertain and cannot be reasonably responded to. The Judge finds that the First Amended Complaint is uncertain due to the lack of separately labeled causes of action and insufficient pleading of the breach of verbal contract. The Judge also finds that the parties are unable to determine which causes of action are directed against each defendant and how each defendant is liable for each cause of action. As a result, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
