And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling to dismiss the claims against Trisha Parker with prejudice. The plaintiff, Shahrouz Jahanshahi, filed a legal malpractice action against his former attorney, Corey Evan Parker, and other defendants. After a demurrer, only three causes of action remained: legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. The Judge granted Corey Evan Parker's motion for summary judgment and also declared Shahrouz Jahanshahi to be a vexatious litigant. The Judge ordered Shahrouz Jahanshahi to post an undertaking of $10,685 and file proof of it on or before November 3, 2023. However, Shahrouz Jahanshahi failed to post the undertaking and did not file a written response to the Court's Order to Show Cause. Therefore, the Judge is dismissing the claims against Trisha Parker with prejudice.
