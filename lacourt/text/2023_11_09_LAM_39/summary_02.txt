The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding LPS's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and related allegations. The judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and lack sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge grants LPS's motion to strike and denies the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint. The judge orders LPS to file an answer within 30 days, and counsel for LPS must provide notice and file proof of such with the court.
