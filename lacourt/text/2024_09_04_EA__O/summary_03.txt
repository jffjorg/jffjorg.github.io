Significant Statements:
  - "The doctrine of equitable tolling was not intended to burden a defendant or the courts with having to repeatedly restart litigation of a case . . . simply because the plaintiff had a last-minute change of mind about the forum." (Demurrer p. 18, quoting Long v. Forty Niners Football Co., LLC)
```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants is sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer is based on the statute of limitations and whether equitable tolling applies. The Judge notes that the plaintiffs had notice as early as March 2023 that their claims were time-barred and that they had a last-minute change of mind about filing in federal court instead of state court. The Judge concludes that the plaintiffs' delay is unwarranted and that the doctrine of equitable tolling does not apply. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained and the lawsuit is dismissed.
