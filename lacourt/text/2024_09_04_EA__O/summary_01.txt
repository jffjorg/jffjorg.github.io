And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's application for entry of default judgment against Defendant Nai De Wu is not ripe because no formal entry of default has been entered against Wu. The case involves a trade secrets dispute between Auto Security & Monitoring, Inc. and Nai De Wu, who was employed by the company from 2008 to 2019. Wu allegedly solicited the company's customers and failed to install tracking devices correctly, causing the company to lose 8 clients and suffer financial losses of over $360,000. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Wu and Anytrek Corporation, alleging claims of misappropriation, conversion, intentional interference with contractual relations, and other claims. The court has previously entered default against Anytrek Corporation, but Wu remains in default status. The plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment against Wu in the amount of $492,750. However, the judge finds that any requests for entry of default judgment absent default is premature, and the case will proceed with the defendant in default status.
