Discussion
 
Defendants
demur to the FAC on the grounds that it is time-barred. (Demurrer p. 9.)
 
Plaintiffs do
not dispute that the applicable statute of limitations. (Opp. p. 2:8-9 [“As
explained more fully below, the applicable statutes of limitations are not
disputed.”].) But they argue that first, as to Plaintiff Desiree Perez, who was
an adult victim of sexual assault, CCP 340.16 applies, and this action is
permitted under the lookback period provided by subdivision (e) because she
alleges a “cover up” by the responsible legal entities. Second, with respect to
Plaintiffs that were victims of childhood sexual assault (Bernice Perez,
Darleen Diaz, Jane Roe 8, and Ashley Ruiz), CCP 340.1 applies, and their claims
were timely filed in federal court within the lookback period and refiled in
state court pursuant to an agreement to dismiss the federal causes of action. Thus,
equitable tolling of the limitations period should apply and allow their claims
to proceed. (Opp. p. 2:8-16.) 
 
A.   
Desiree
Perez (CCP 340.16) 
Subdivision
(b)(3) provides that “This section applies to any action described in
subdivision (a) that is based upon conduct that occurred on or after January 1,
2009, and is commenced on or after January 1, 2019, that would have been
barred solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had
expired.” (emphasis added.) Under CCP 340.16(e)(1), the subdivision permits
claims for sexual assault (and related claims) where a plaintiff alleges a
“cover up” by the responsible legal entities. Specifically, subdivision (C)
revises a claim if “The entity or entities,
including, but not limited to, their officers, directors, representatives,
employees, or agents, engaged in a cover up or attempted a cover up of a
previous instance or allegations of sexual assault by an alleged perpetrator of
such abuse.” “(A) “Cover up” means a concerted effort to hide evidence
relating to a sexual assault that incentivizes individuals to remain silent or
prevents information relating to a sexual assault from becoming public or being
disclosed to the plaintiff, including, but not limited to, the use of
nondisclosure agreements or confidentiality agreements.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 340.16 (e)(1)(4)(A), emphasis added.) 
 
Here, the
alleged sexual assault of Desiree Perez occurred in approximately 1999.
(FAC ¶¶ 132-151.) However, as noted in Reply, the FAC has alleged no cover up
occurred with respect to Plaintiff’s claims of sexual assault to her. (Reply p.
3.) To the extent that Plaintiffs rely upon allegation(s) that Desiree told
Kimberly Roscoe that she was allegedly raped, there are no allegations that the
entity attempted to cover up the alleged assault; instead, the allegations are
that they did not believe Plaintiff. (See generally FAC pp. 35-36.) 
 
Therefore,
the statute of limitations for Plaintiff Desiree Perez’s claims have expired,
and section 340.16(e) does not revive them. Notwithstanding, the court grants
leave to amend to allege facts about any purported cover-up(s). 
 
b. MINOR VICTIMS’ LIMITATIONS PERIOD
UNDER CCP 340.1
 
With the
enactment of AB 218 in 2020 (creating a three-year window) and Emergency Rule ,
victims of child sexual assault were allowed to file a claim against a
responsible defendant on or before June 27, 2023. Three of the Plaintiffs
(Darleen Diaz, Bernice Perez, and Ashley Ruiz) first filed the claims alleged
herein on December 30, 2022, in the United States District Court for Central
District of California (“CACD”) (Case No. 22-cv-09467) against Defendant ICOC
and others; Plaintiff Jane Roe 8 first filed the claims alleged herein on
February 16, 2023 (CACD Case No. 23-cv-01192). 
Plaintiffs cite to three
cases—Appalachian Ins. Co. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1,
San Francisco Unified School Dist. v. W.R. Grace & Co. (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 1318, and Addison v. State of California (1978) 21 Cal.3d 313—which
addresses the legal principle set forth by moving Defendants.2 In Appalachian
Ins. Co. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1 (Appalachian), the
appellate court observed the following:
The Respondents assert the
equitable tolling doctrine does not apply when the plaintiff voluntarily
dismisses an action; they assert it applies only to involuntary dismissals. To
support this assertion, the Respondents cite Wood v. Elling Corp. (1977) 20
Cal.3d 353, 142 Cal.Rptr. 696, 572 P.2d 755; Neff v. York Life Ins. Co. (1947)
30 Cal.2d 165, 180 P.2d 900; Dowell v. County of Contra Costa (1985) 173
Cal.App.3d 896, 219 Cal.Rptr. 341; Permanente Medical Group v. Workers' Comp.
Appeals Bd. (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1171, 217 Cal.Rptr. 873; Hill v. Allan (1968)
259 Cal.App.2d 470, 66 Cal.Rptr. 676; and Cook v. Stewart McKee & Co.
(1945) 68 Cal.App.2d 758, 157 P.2d 868.) Initially, we note none of the cases
applying the equitable tolling doctrine have depended on whether there was an
voluntary or involuntary dismissal. Second, the cases cited by the Respondents
do not, either when read singly or together, establish a general rule that a
voluntary dismissal precludes application of the equitable tolling doctrine. Rather,
these cases turn on the failure to meet the Bollinger criteria relating to
timely notice, lack of prejudice to the defendant and reasonable and good faith
conduct on the part of the plaintiff. (Id. at p. 40, emphasis added.)
Accordingly, the Appalachian court expressly establishes that equitable
tolling doctrine does not depend on whether there the dismissal was voluntary
or involuntary.
Defendants cite to Troche v. Daley (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 403 to hold otherwise,
but that case is inapposite as it involved relation back doctrine for purposes
of the statute of limitations. (Id. at p. 412.) 
Where an action is filed
first in federal court, is dismissed, and then is refiled in state court, the
statute of limitations is deemed tolled under the doctrine of equitable
tolling. (See Mojica v. 4211 Wilshire, LLC (2005) 13 Cal.App.4th 1069 [personal
injury plaintiff filed actions against defendants in federal district court,
based on diversity jurisdiction, then filed an action in state court when the
federal action was dismissed]; Thomas v. Gilliland (2002) 94 Cal.app.4th 427,
434 [“ Equitable tolling has been applied where a plaintiff first filed an
action in the federal court that was dismissed for lack of federal jurisdiction
and then refiled in the state court. In that circumstance the statute of
limitations is deemed tolled.”]; Nichols v. Canoga Industries (1978) 83
Cal.App.3d 956.)
That said, the three elements
of equitable tolling must still apply: (i) timely notice, (ii) lack of
prejudice to the defendant, and (iii) reasonable and good faith conduct on the
part of the plaintiff. (Saint Francis Memorial Hospital v. State Department of
Public Health (2020) 9 Cal. 5th 710, 725–26.)
Here, the same set of facts
are the basis for claims under both the state and federal actions. (See also
Addison, supra, 21 Cal.3d at p. 319.) Furthermore, since the federal court
action was timely filed, moving Defendants “were notified of the action and had
the opportunity to begin gathering their evidence and preparing their defense.”
(Ibid.) Moreover, no prejudice to defendants is shown for Plaintiffs' state
court action was filed the same day as the federal stipulated dismissal.
(Ibid.) Ultimately, similar to Addison, here, the moving Defendants were
fully notified of Plaintiffs' claims and their intent to litigate in state
court, and they were informed at all times of the nature of Plaintiffs' claims
such that any delay resulting from Plaintiffs' original choice of forum was
minimal. (Id. at p. 321.) 
Notwithstanding, equitable
estoppel is applied flexibly to “ensure fundamental practicality and fairness.”
(Opp. p. 7, quoting J.M. v. Huntington Beach Union High School Dist. (2017) 2
Cal. 5th 648, 658.) Here, it appears Plaintiffs made the decision to file their
action in federal court first, using the RICO Act to claim federal jurisdiction
even though all the other claims were grounded in state law. (Reply p. 6:2-4.)
In fact, “Defendants’ counsel repeatedly took issue with Plaintiffs’ RICO
claims” such that Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to resolve the RICO
pleading disputes. (Opp. p. 5-6.) It was not until after a motion to
dismiss was filed that Plaintiffs dismissed the action. It is unclear whether
allowing the same Plaintiffs—who are alleging the same facts and similar causes
of action against the same named Defendants—to file suit after the statute of
limitations would promote fairness. Even if Plaintiffs offered extensions for
Defendants and other defendants in the federal action (Opp. p. 6), that does
not appear to be a relevant in considering ‘good faith’ in moving the action
from federal to state court.  
Therefore, the court sustains
the demurrer with leave to amend. 
 
Motion to
Strike
 
The
allegations described in Defendants’ notice of motion to strike are described
as “highly inflammatory, not essential to any claim or defense, and neither
pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense.”
(Motion p. 4.)  
 
Plaintiffs
oppose largely on the grounds that the paragraphs include background
information about the organization, describe how the organization operates, and
how such operation and reporting structure foments abuse.
Here, as the allegations subject to this motion are
irrelevant to these Plaintiffs in this case and Plaintiffs have
not otherwise provided authority that providing such extensive and overbroad
“background information” is permissible, the court GRANTS the MTS with leave to
amend.
