And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which is a childhood sexual assault case. The plaintiffs filed a complaint against several defendants, alleging various forms of sexual assault and related claims. The defendants filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint is time-barred. The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, finding that the statute of limitations has expired for one of the plaintiffs' claims.

The court has also granted the motion to strike certain allegations in the complaint, finding that they are not essential to any claim or defense and are not supported by sufficient evidence. The court has given the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to provide additional information about any purported cover-ups.

The court has found that equitable tolling applies to the minor victims' limitations period under California Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1, but has noted that the three elements of equitable tolling must still apply: timely notice, lack of prejudice to the defendant, and reasonable and good faith conduct on the part of the plaintiff. The court has also noted that the plaintiffs' decision to file their original complaint in federal court and then refile in state court may not have promoted fairness, and has given the defendants leave to respond to the plaintiffs' claims in state court.
