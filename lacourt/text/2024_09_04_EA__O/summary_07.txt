Here is a brief summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has sustained the demurrer (a request to dismiss the claim) filed by Falck USA, a defendant in a negligence lawsuit brought by Angela Tapias, a 5-year-old who suffered an anoxic brain injury after being transported to the hospital with a high fever. The Judge ruled that the complaint fails to adequately allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action against Falck USA, as the allegations are too vague and lump together Falck and another defendant, CARE AMBULANCE SERVICE, INC. Additionally, the Judge ruled that the mother, Hortencia Tapias, did not have contemporaneous awareness that the fever was causing the anoxic brain injury, and therefore cannot recover under the bystander theory. The Judge granted leave to amend the complaint, allowing the plaintiffs to refile with more specificity and clarity.
