And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving alleged childhood sexual assault. The defendants, International Churches of Christ, Inc. and Al Baird, have filed a demurrer arguing that the claims are time-barred and lack subject matter jurisdiction. The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, finding that the plaintiffs have not alleged a "concerted effort to hide evidence relating to a sexual assault" as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 340.16.

Additionally, the defendants have filed a motion to strike certain allegations in the plaintiffs' first amended complaint, arguing that they are irrelevant and overbroad. The judge has granted the motion to strike with leave to amend, finding that the allegations are not pertinent to the actual claims asserted by the plaintiffs and do not provide any relevant context or background information. The judge notes that federal and state pleading standards differ and that the decisions of lower federal courts are not binding on the court.
