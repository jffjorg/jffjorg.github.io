  Case Number:  19PSCV00580    Hearing Date:   September 4, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Application for Entry of Default Judgment is NOT RIPE
because no formal entry of default has been entered
against Wu. 
 
Background
 
This case
involves trade secrets. Plaintiff Auto Security & Monitoring, Inc. alleges
the following against Defendants Nai De Wu, a.k.a Danny Wu: Since 2005,
Plaintiff has been a company in the business of providing services and
technical devices to the trucking and busing industry. Defendant was employed
between about March 2008 to about March 4, 2019. Wu began to solicit
Plaintiff’s customers to purchase Wu’s own products, failed to install tracking
devices correctly so as to lose the trust of clients, and then departed to a
competing firm. Thus far, Plaintiff has lost about 8 clients, suffering
financial losses over $360,000.00 from Wu's illegal solicitations from
Plaintiff’s customers.

On March 20,
2020, Plaintiff amended its complaint (FAC) to name ANYTREK Corporation, which
is the company Wu works at. 
 
On May 19,
2020, default was entered as to Anytrek as to the original complaint.
 
On September
3, 2020, default was entered as to Anytrek as to the FACt.
 
On September
10, 2020, Anytrek and Wu filed their answer. 
 
On March 24,
2021, the court entered the Stipulation and Order to Set Aside the Default
Entered Against Anytrek.
 
On April 1,
2021, Anytrek filed its answer to the FAC.
 
On November 3, 2022, the court granted Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend
its FAC. That same day, Plaintiff
filed its second amended complaint (SAC) against the same defendants,
and adding two new causes of action (COAs) for Violation of Unfair Competition
Under Business and Professions Code sections 17043 and 17044.
 
On November
8, 2022, Anytrek filed its answer to the SAC. (For clarity, the amended answer
was only filed by Anytrek.) 
 
On January
12, 2023, the court’s minute order re: mediation states that “Plaintiff's
counsel is to meet and confer with counsel James Green regarding setting
aside default to allow Mr. Green and Nai De Wu to participate in mediation
and contributing to the cost of mediation.” (emphasis added.) 
 
On June 14,
2023, the minute order provides in relevant party that “The Court notes,
Defendant Nai De Wu remains in Default. A Motion to Set Aside Default
nor any other related motions have been brought before the Court to allow the
Defendant to participate in this matter.” (Emphasis added.) 
 
On April 2,
2024, a notice of settlement was filed. 
 
On June 20,
2024, the court entered the stipulation and order for the court to retain
jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement between Anytrek
and Plaintiff.
 
On July 3,
2024, Anytrek was dismissed from the SAC.
 
On July 8,
2024, the court’s minute order provides, in relevant part, the following:
“Plaintiff's Counsel represents to the Court that the second amended complaint
is the operative pleading and Plaintiff's Counsel is seeking to move
forward with the Defendant as to Defendant Nai De Wu. The Court informs
Defendant Nai De Wu that he is currently in Default Status.” (emphasis
added.)  
 
On July 9,
2024, Plaintiff filed a ‘TRIAL BRIEF WITH SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND
AUTHORITIES; DECLARATIONS AND DOCUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT AGAINST
DEFENDANT NAI DE WU, a.k.a. DANNY WU.’
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
seeks entry of default judgment in the amount of $492,750 against Wu. However,
default has not been entered against Wu as to the SAC, which is the operative
pleading. Pursuant to CCP section 471.5, “[t]he defendant shall answer the
amendments, or the complaint as amended, within 30 days after service thereof,
or such other time as the court may direct, and judgment by default may be
entered upon failure to answer, in other cases.” And if a defendant does not
file his answer, CCP section 585 subdivision (b) provides that the plaintiff is
to file a request for entry of default with the clerk. Here, the docket does
not reflect entry of default (on a CIV-100 form). 
 
Therefore,
any requests for entry of default judgment absent default is premature.
