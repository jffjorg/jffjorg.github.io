On January 26, 2023, Defendants the International Christian
Church, Inc. and City Of Angels International Christian Church filed a demurrer
with a motion to strike.
 
On February 20, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a first amended
complaint (FAC) alleging the same COAs against the same Defendants, rendering
the 1/26/23 demurrer moot. 
 
On March 25, 2024, Defendants filed a demurrer to the FAC,
which on 4/29/24 the court continued for supplemental briefing as the
Plaintiffs’ opposition did not squarely address Defendants’ demurrer.
 
On June 17, 2024, the court heard the matter and took it
under submission.
 
On June 21, 2024, the court issued its final ruling
sustaining the demurrer and granting the MTS without leave to amend.
 
On July 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their SAC.
 
On August 5, 2024, Defendants filed the instant demurrer. 
 
Discussion
 
The court’s analysis will be brief as the demurrer is again
based upon the SOL and whether equitable tolling applies. As noted by
Defendants, the plaintiffs had notice as early as March 2023 – per the
plaintiffs’ own allegations – that the RICO claims were time-barred and that
their actions were inappropriate in federal court. Then, on June 16, 2023,
before the statute of limitations had expired, instead of dismissing the
federal action and filing in state court, the plaintiffs elected to file
amended complaints in federal court. “[T]he doctrine of equitable tolling was
not intended to burden a defendant or the courts with having to repeatedly
restart litigation of a case . . . simply because the plaintiff had a
last-minute change of mind about the forum.” (Demurrer p. 18, quoting Long
v. Forty Niners Football Co., LLC (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 550, 557.)
Ultimately, as Plaintiffs were in possession of the facts of their case all
along before filing the time-barred action (i.e., state action), such
unwarranted delay cannot constitute as good faith. (See Demurrer p. 17 citing Bacon
v. City of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 1988) 843 F.2d 372; Ervin v. Los Angeles
(9th Cir. 1988) 848 F.2d 1018; Mitchell v. Frank R. Howard Memorial Hospital
(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1396.)
 
Therefore, absent an opposition, which creates an inference
that the demurrer has merit, the demurrer is sustained WITHOUT leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is sustained without
leave to amend.
