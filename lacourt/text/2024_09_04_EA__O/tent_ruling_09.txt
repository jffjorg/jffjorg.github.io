Legal
Standard
 
A petition to compel arbitration must allege both (1) a “written
agreement to arbitrate” the controversy,[1]
and (2) that a party to that agreement “refuses to arbitrate” the controversy.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.) Once this is done, the burden shifts to the
opposing party to demonstrate the falsity of the purported agreement. (Condee
v. Longwood Management Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 218–219.) In ruling
on a motion to compel arbitration, the court must first determine whether the
parties actually agreed to arbitrate the dispute, and general principles of
California contract law help guide the court in making this determination.
(Mendez v. Mid-Wilshire Health Care Center (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 534,
541.) A petition to compel arbitration is a suit in equity to compel specific
performance of a contract. (Frog Creek Partners, LLC. v. Vance Brown, Inc.
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 515, 532.)  
 
Discussion
 
Defendant
attempts to compel arbitration under two arbitration provisions. One
provision is inside the vehicle glove box owner’s handbook and warranty
information. The second provision was contained within the ‘Blue Link’
connectivity/GPS software subscription set-up by dealership personnel after the
vehicle purchase. Here, the court compels arbitration.
 
First, Plaintiffs argue that “Hyundai has presented no
evidence whatsoever that the buyer, i.e., the Plaintiffs, even knew the clause
existed or reasonably may expect such to exist within the warranty itself.”
(Opp. p. 5:16-17.) However, as noted in reply, it is unclear how Plaintiffs can
allege in their Complaint to have understood and read the terms and conditions
of the Warranty that benefit them, but not the arbitration provision. (Reply p.
4:1-3.) After all, the Warranty includes a binding arbitration provision
requiring Plaintiffs to resolve any concerning the purchase or performance of
the Vehicle by binding arbitration on an individual basis, if either party so
elects. (Ameripour Decl., Ex. 3 [Warranty].) What is more, though Plaintiffs
argue that this arbitration agreement is hidden in that there is no bold print
(Opp. p. 5), that is not accurate. A review of the warranty illustrates that
there is a ‘Table of Contents’ and that Section 4 which is entitled ‘Hyundai
Warranty Information,’ which is bolded, contains a section entitled ‘Binding
Arbitration for California Vehicles Only.’ (Ameripour Decl., Ex. 3, p. 8 of 35
of PDF.) And the statement that there is ‘binding arbitration for California
vehicles only’ is capitalized and bolded in the warranty. (Ameripour
Decl., Ex. 3, p. 17 of 35 of PDF.) Thus, Plaintiffs mischaracterize that the
arbitration clause is “buried” in the warranty book. (Opp. p. 5:1-2.). To the
extent that Plaintiffs argue that warranty lacks a signature, estoppel would
apply to these facts. (See Reply p. 3, quoting Boucher v. Alliance Title
Co., Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 262, 269; Felisida v. FCA US LLC (2020
53 Cal. App. 5th 486, 496 [A nonsignatory is estopped from refusing to comply
with an arbitration clause when it receives a direct benefit from a contract
containing an arbitration clause.].) 
 
Therefore, as Plaintiffs have pled and fundamentally rely on
the existence of the Warranty and its terms in the Complaint—tacitly conceding
the presence of mutual assent—the warranty book compels arbitration. With that,
the court need not address the alternate method of enforcing arbitration via
the CSA system. (See Motion p. 13:19-20 [“In the alternative, if this Court for
any reason decides that arbitration cannot be enforced under the Warranty,
arbitration may also be enforced by HMA via the CSA.”].) 
 
To the extent that Plaintiffs argue that the warranty
booklet is unconscionable, the court disagrees. Plaintiffs largely rely upon Dougherty v. Roseville
Heritage Partners (2020) 47 Cal.App.5th 93.) But Dougherty is
factually distinguishable. There, the arbitration clause was inconspicuously
buried at page 70 of the contract. Here, the arbitration provision here is
fully conspicuous and found on page 12 of a 17 booklet that has a table of
content for easy navigation. Even assuming the agreement is adhesive in nature
(even though there is an opt out provision), should there be any doubts as to
the enforceability of the arbitration agreement, any doubts “are to be resolved
in favor of sending the parties to arbitration.” (United Transp. Union v.
Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 804, 808); see also
Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela (2019) 587 U.S. __ [139 S.Ct. 1407, 1418]
[“ambiguities about the scope of an arbitration agreement must be resolved in
favor of arbitration.”]; Chiron Corp. v. Ortho Diagnostic Systems, Inc., 207
F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 2000) [“little doubt that the dispute [was] subject
to arbitration” where agreement covered “[a]ny dispute, controversy or
claims”]; AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of Amer., 475
U.S. 643, 650 (1986) [“only the most forceful evidence” can overcome contract
enforcement.].)
Thus, absent meeting its
burden to establish a defense by a preponderance of the evidence (Pinnacle
Museum Towers Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55
Cal.4th 223, 246-247), that leaves no doubts that the parties are to arbitrate
the matter.
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing—as Plaintiffs are suing upon a written contract
that they, by judicial admission, assented to and that said warranty was
provided by HMA (as the direct provider) and they have failed to meet their burden of establishing both
procedural and substantive unconscionability—the
motion is GRANTED.
