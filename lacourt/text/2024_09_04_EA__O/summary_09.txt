And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Defendant, Hyundai Motor America, has moved to compel binding arbitration in a lemon law case brought by the Plaintiffs, Jennifer Whiteside and Garth Whiteside. The court has granted the motion, finding that the arbitration agreement in the warranty book is enforceable.

The court found that the Plaintiffs had pled and fundamentally relied on the existence of the warranty and its terms in their complaint, tacitly conceding the presence of mutual assent. The court also found that the arbitration provision in the warranty book was fully conspicuous and easily accessible, and that any doubts about the enforceability of the arbitration agreement should be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration.

The court disagreed with the Plaintiffs' argument that the warranty book was unconscionable, distinguishing the case from Dougherty v. Roseville Heritage Partners, in which the arbitration clause was inconspicuously buried in a contract. The court found that the Plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of establishing procedural and substantive unconscionability.

Therefore, the court compels arbitration under the warranty book and finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable.
