Discussion
 
As noted by
Plaintiffs, the demurrer is partly moot. As to Alyssia, Jane Roe 9, and 10,
they were dismissed; thus, the demurrer is moot. As for Jane Roe 6 and Jane Roe
7, Defendants’ demurrer states that they had until the age of 26 to file their
claims. (Demurrer p. 7:25-26.) And here, they filed their claims before the age
of 26: At the time of filing, Jane Roe 6 was 19 years old (FAC ¶ 114), and Jane
Roe 7 was 25 years old (FAC ¶ 142). (See Opp. p. 3.) Thus, the claims as to the
remaining Plaintiffs are timely. 
 
As for the
motion to strike, the court refers to the parties to its analysis in the other
related cases. Therefore, the MTS is granted with leave to amend.
