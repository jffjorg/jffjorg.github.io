And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrer is partly moot as to Alyssia, Jane Roe 9, and 10, who were previously dismissed from the case. However, the claims of Jane Roe 6 and Jane Roe 7 are timely, as they were filed before the age of 26. The judge grants the motion to strike, but allows the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. The hearing is scheduled for September 4, 2024.
