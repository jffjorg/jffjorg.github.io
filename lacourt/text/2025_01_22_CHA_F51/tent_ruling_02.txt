ANALYSIS
 
“The court may, upon any terms
as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or
other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall
not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 473, subd. (b).) “The
return of a [registered] process server … establishes a presumption, affecting
the burden of producing evidence, of the facts stated in the return.” (Evid.
Code § 647.) “The filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption
that the service was proper.” (Floveyor International, Ltd. v. Superior
Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 795.)
 
“When service of a summons has
not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a
default or default judgment has been entered against him or her in the action,
he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or
default judgment and for leave to defend the action. The notice of motion shall
be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the
earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment against him or her;
or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a written notice that the
default or default judgment has been entered.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 473.5, subd.
(a).) 
 
Here, Defendant argues that the
address where the complaint and summons were originally served was incorrect,
and therefore she lacked actual notice of the instant action until after
default was entered against her, as evidence by the answer she attempted to
file on 10/11/23. (Def.’s Mot. 15:15–28.)
 
Defendant also seeks to vacate
the default judgment against her “because Defendant's failure to respond was
due to mistake and excusable neglect resulting from clerical errors and changes
in counsel, rather than inexcusable neglect or avoidance of service.” (Id. at
4:7–8.) To the extent that Defendant seeks mandatory
relief from the default judgment against her based on her attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, Defendant has not provided the
Court with the requisite attorney affidavit of fault, and therefore is not entitled
to this form of relief. (Code Civ. Proc. § 473, subd. (b).)
 
To the
extent that Defendant seeks discretionary relief from the default judgment
against her based on her
own mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, Defendant contends
that she was mistaken in signing a declaration stating that she moved to her
current address in June 2023, when she in fact relocated in November 2022, as
indicated in her attached lease agreement. (Exs. A and B to Decl. of Matthew S.
Garvey.)
 
The Court notes that Plaintiffs have failed to oppose the
instant motion, and that “because the law strongly favors trial and disposition
on the merits, any doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of
the party seeking relief from default.” (Elston v. City of Turlock
(1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233.) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that
Defendant is entitled to relief from the default judgment entered against her
on 3/19/24 and 4/12/24. The Court further notes the lack of proofs of service
on Defendant of the entry of default and default judgment against her. Accordingly,
the unopposed motion is granted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b).
 
CONCLUSION

 
The unopposed
motion is granted. Defendant is relieved from the entry of default and default
judgment against her. Defendant to separately file and serve her proposed
answer within 10 days.
