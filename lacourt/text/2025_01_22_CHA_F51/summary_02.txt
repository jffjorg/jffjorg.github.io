The Court grants the unopposed motion to vacate/set aside the default judgment entered against Defendant Sonia Michelle Sanchez on March 19, 2024, and April 12, 2024. The Court finds that Defendant is entitled to relief from the default judgment based on her own mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Defendant had attempted to file an answer on October 11, 2023, but had previously signed a declaration stating that she moved to her current address in June 2023, when in fact she had relocated in November 2022. The Court notes that Plaintiffs have failed to oppose the motion and that the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits. The Court orders Defendant to separately file and serve her proposed answer within 10 days.
