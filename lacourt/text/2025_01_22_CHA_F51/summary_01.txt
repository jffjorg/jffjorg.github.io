Specifically, he has declared under penalty of perjury that he is not a resident of California, and has provided proof of his admission to practice in other courts, his licensure in good standing, and his lack of suspension or disbarment. The application was also properly served on all remaining parties, and Mr. Borkon has submitted it to the State Bar of California. Based on this evidence, the motion is granted, and Mr. Borkon is authorized to appear as counsel pro hac vice.
