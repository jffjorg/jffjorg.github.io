 Case Number:  22STCV11875    Hearing Date:   October 18, 2024    Dept:  29 Livas v. P.W. Stephens Environmental, Inc.
22STCV11875
Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, for Summary Adjudication
filed by Defendant P.W. Stephens Environmental, Inc.
Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Defendant Mike Jabbour
TENTATIVE
The motion of Defendant PWSE is denied in part
and granted in part.
The motion of Defendant Jabbour is granted.
Background
This action arises out of an incident in which Paula
Livas (“Plaintiff”) alleges that she fell and sustained severe injuries on
August 3, 2021, after her foot was caught by a protruding nail on the floor in
her home. Plaintiff alleges that the dangerous condition that caused her injury
was the result of (among other things) negligent work in her home performed by
defendants.
On April 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed her Complaint
asserting causes of action for negligence and negligent hiring, supervision,
and retention against Defendants P.W. Stephens Environmental, Inc. (“PWSE”),
Mike Jabbour (“Jabbour”), and Does 1 through 50. 
On August 8, 2022 (after Defendant Jabbour’s
demurrer was sustained with leave to amend), Plaintiff filed her First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”). 
PWSE filed its answer to the FAC on September 9,
2022. 
Jabbour filed his answer on February 14, 2023 (after
his demurrer to the FAC was overruled.)
On June 20, 2023, Defendants PWSE filed a
motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication. On
the same day, Jabbor filed a motion for summary judgment.
Defendant PWSE’s motion was initially set for
hearing on September 25, 2024. Defendant Jabbour’s motion was initially set for
hearing on September 26, 2024.
Plaintiff filed her oppositions to each motion
on September 11. PWSE and Jabbour each filed a reply on September 20.
The Court, on its own motion, continued both
hearings to October 18, 2024.
Legal Standard
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment is
to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in
order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact
necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision
(c), “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each cause of action as framed by the
complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one or
more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that there
is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)

A plaintiff or cross-complainant moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of
proof by presenting facts to show “that there is no defense to a cause of
action if that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling
the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the
burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that a “triable issue
of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense
thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon the allegations or
denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the specific facts
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in
support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning
the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Request for Judicial Notice
Each moving party requests that the Court take
judicial notice of the FAC. Although probably unnecessary, the Court grants the
request.
Discussion
In June 2021, Plaintiff and her husband Ronnie Livas suffered water
damage at their home. (Transcript of Deposition of Plaintiff [“Plaintiff’s
Depo.”], at 14:1-13; Transcript of Deposition of Ronnie Livas [“Ronnie Livas
Depo.”], at 11:2-8.) (Excerpts from the transcript of Plaintiff’s deposition
appear in the record as Defendant’s Exhibit 8 and Kruid Declaration, Exhibit 1;
excerpts from the transcript of Ronnie Livas’s deposition appear in the record
as Defendant’s Exhibit 9 and Kruid Declaration, Exhibit 2.) 
As part of the process of addressing the water damage, Defendant PWSE
was hired to perform certain work in the home. Defendant Jabbour was the
project manager.
Plaintiff and her husband testified that PWSE was hired to remove the
floor, the subfloor, and any asbestos. (Plaintiff’s Depo., at 19:18-22; Ronnie
Livas Depo., at 17:2-18.) PWSE was not hired to replace the flooring.
(Plaintiff’s Depo., at 21:7-9; Ronnie Livas Depo., at 24:9-11.)
PWSE and Ronnie Livas signed a contract dated July 12, 2021, for the
work. (Defendant’s Exhibit 2 [the “Contract”].) According to the Contract, PWSE’s
work in the kitchen was to include removing the tile floor, removing “asbestos
containing vinyl floor tile,” applying an “EPA approved fiberlock encapsulant
to remaining residue mastic on plywood subfloor,” and “[w]et wipe, HEPA vacuum
and clean horizontal and vertical surfaces in the work area.” (Contract, at p.
PWS 33; see also Jabbour Decl., ¶¶ 6-7; Transcript of Deposition of Michael
Jabbour [“Jabbour Depo.], at 25:3-7.) (Excepts from the transcript of Michael
Jabbour’s deposition appear in the record as Defendant’s Exhibit 7 and Kruid
Declaration, Exhibit 3.)
While PWSE was performing its work, Plaintiff and her husband stayed in
a recreational vehicle (“RV”) in their driveway. (Defendant’s Statement of
Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”], No. 10; Plaintiff’s Depo., at 20:17-24,
38:23-25; Ronnie Livas Depo., at 29:21-30:16.)
PWSE completed the work described in the Contract on July 21, 2021. (DSUMF,
No. 6.; Defendant’s Exhibits 3-5; Jabbour Decl., ¶ 8; Jabbour Depo., at 16:25-17:17.)
The fiberlock that PWSE applied to the subfloor was white. (Jabbour Depo., at 63:21-64:5,
81:8-11.) The next day (July 22), PWSE removed the containment that had been
placed around the work area. (DSUMF, No. 6; Jabbour Decl., ¶ 8; Jabbour Depo.,
at 84:17-21.)
PWSE did not, and was not hired to, replace the flooring or subflooring,
make any repairs to the subflooring, or place any screws or nails into the
subflooring. (Jabbour Decl., ¶¶ 7-8; Jabbour Depo., at 31:22-32:1.) 
On August 3, 2021, at approximately 10:00 in the morning, Plaintiff
went into the kitchen to retrieve some plates. (Plaintiff’s Depo., at 25:18-26:8.)
Plaintiff’s foot “caught on something,” and Plaintiff fell. (Plaintiff’s Depo.,
at 26:2-14.)
Later that day, Plaintiff inspected the kitchen and observed “screws or
… nailheads” sticking out of the subfloor, which “had been painted white.”
(Plaintiff’s Depo., at 33:17-19.) Plaintiff counted “three to five” of these
screws or nailheads. (Plaintiff’s Depo., at 34:13-17.) One was “in the exact
place where [Plaintiff] had fallen.” (Plaintiff’s Depo., at 34:18-20.) 
In her deposition, Plaintiff admitted that at the moment of her fall,
she did not know what had caused it. (Plaintiff’s Depo., at 26:9-14,
35:24-26:6.) Nonetheless, based on the inspection of the kitchen later that
day, Plaintiff testified that she was “100 percent sure” that an exposed nail
had caused her fall. (Plaintiff’s Depo., at 35:1-12.) When asked how she could
be so sure, Plaintiff explained:
“The location of the
nail, where I was standing, and when I turned. I hadn’t even taken a step. I
turned, and I went down. [¶] The only explanation I can think of is that the
nail got caught in my shoe. And when I went to turn, my body momentum was turning,
and my foot did not move, causing me to fall. And I did not trip. I just fell.”
(Plaintiff’s Depo., at 36:7-16.) She did not “trip” or “slip.”
(Plaintiff’s Depo., at 94:3-6.) “It was a straight, like a tree-timber fall.” (Ibid.) 
Ronnie Livas also testified that after the accident, “when I walked
over there [the accident site], my foot actually got stuck on one of the screws
as I was walking over.” (Ronnie Livas Depo., at 29:2-6.) “I did not fall, but
my foot did get snagged on one of the screws or nails that were sticking up.” (Ibid.)
Neither PWSE nor Jabbour placed the nails or screws in the kitchen subfloor.
(DSUMF, No. 11; Plaintiff’s Depo., at 47:7-12.) Rather, Plaintiff testified
that that when PWSE removed the flooring and completed its work, “all the
flooring and debris was supposed to be removed, including any protrusions.”
(Plaintiff’s Depo., at 51:1-6.) “That is common sense.” (Plaintiff’s Depo., at
51:7-10.)
PWSE’s Motion for Summary Judgment/Summary
Adjudication
In the FAC, Plaintiff asserts two causes of action against PWSE: (1) the
First Cause of Action for negligence; and (2) the Second Cause of Action for
negligent hiring, supervision, and retention.
First Cause of Action (Negligence)
The basic elements of a
cause of action for negligence are: (1) the existence of a legal duty; (2)
breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown
v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Romero v. Los Angeles Rams
(2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 562, 567.)
The existence and scope of duty are legal questions
for the court.¿¿(Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 213; Annocki¿v.
Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 36.)
“In a contract for services, a contracting
party may be liable for negligence in the performance of those services or
failure to perform.” (Bevis v. Terrace View Partners, LP (2019) 33
Cal.App.5th 230, 258.)
In its motion, PWSE makes essentially three
arguments as to the negligence cause of action: (1) that PWSE owed no duty to
Plaintiff against the risk of harm from screws or nails protruding from the subfloor
of the kitchen (Mem. at pp. 9-10); (2) that the allegedly dangerous condition
was trivial as a matter of law (Mem. at pp. 10-12); and (3) that any alleged
breach of duty did not cause Plaintiff’s injuries (Mem. at pp. 12-13).
Beginning with the issue of duty, the general rule governing duty is
set forth in Civil Code section 1714: “Everyone is responsible, not only for
the result of his or her willful acts, but also for an injury occasioned to
another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his
or her property or person, except so far as the latter has, willfully or by
want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or herself.” (Civ. Code,
§ 1714, subd. (a).) This establishes what the California Supreme Court has
described as the “default rule” that every person has a legal duty “to
exercise, in his or her activities, reasonable care for the safety of others.”
(Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 214.)
It is true that the written contract between
PWSE and Ronnie Livas did not contain any express provision obligating PWSE to
remove nails or screws protruding from the subfloor. (Contract, at PWS 32-39.)
But one of PWSE’s tasks was to remove the floor, which naturally exposes the
subfloor, and under Civil Code section 1714 PWSE had a general duty, in
performing its work, to exercise reasonable care – including not creating a
dangerous condition that exposes the homeowners or others to an unreasonable
risk of harm. When a defendant creates a dangerous condition, the defendant has
an obligation either to remedy the condition or to warn others of the
condition. (See Bridgman v.
Safeway Stores, Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.) 
On this record, viewing the
facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and drawing all
reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, the Court finds that
there are triable issues of duty and breach. PWSE had a legal duty to exercise
reasonable care in performing its work. A finder of fact could reasonably
determine that PWSE breached that duty by leaving behind, when it completed its
work, a dangerous condition (exposed nails or screws in the subfloor) that
posed an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff. PWSE may not have been obligated
by contract to repair any exposed defect in the subfloor, but it had a legal
duty under tort law to remedy the dangerous condition created by its work or
warn the homeowners of the dangerous condition. On this record, the finder of
fact could reasonably determine that it did neither.
Next, PWSE argues that the exposed nails or
screws were, as a matter of law, at most a trivial defect, and not a dangerous
condition. In making this argument, PWSE refers to a relatively large body of
law developed primarily with regard to defects in sidewalks and other walkways
in public and private spaces.
In the context of litigation
against a public entity, the Government Claims Act defines the term “dangerous
condition” as a “condition of property that creates a substantial (as
distinguished from a minor,¿trivial¿or insignificant) risk of injury when such
property or adjacent property is used with due care in a manner in which it is
reasonably foreseeable that it¿will be used.”¿(Gov. Code, § 830, subd. (a); see
also Thimon v. City of Newark (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 745, 754.)¿“The existence of a dangerous condition ordinarily is a
question of fact, but the issue may be resolved as a matter of law if
reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion.” (Peterson v. San
Francisco Comm. College Dist.¿(1984) 36 Cal.3d 799, 810; accord Stack v.
City of Lemoore (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 102, 110; Nunez v. City of Redondo
Beach (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 749, 757.)  
Plaintiff has the burden of proving the existence of a dangerous
condition. A court may not presume that there was a dangerous condition merely
because the plaintiff was injured. (Sambrano v. City of San Diego (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 225, 241 [describing such an argument as “reason[ing]
backwards”].)
“A condition is not
dangerous … unless it creates a hazard to those who foreseeably will use the
property ... with due care. Thus, even though it is foreseeable that
persons may use public property without due care, a public entity may not be
held liable for failing to take precautions to protect such persons.”¿(Matthews
v. City of Cerritos¿(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1380, 1384.) “The condition
of the property involved should create a ‘substantial risk’ of injury, for an
undue burden would be placed upon public entities if they were responsible for
the repair of all conditions creating any possibility of injury however remote
that possibility might be.”¿(Fredette¿v. City of Long Beach¿(1986) 187
Cal.App.3d 122, 130, fn.5; accord Nunez, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 758.) 
Related to the concept of a “dangerous condition” is the “trivial
defect” doctrine. In the Government Claims Act, Government Code section 830.2
provides that a condition is not a “dangerous condition”:
“if the
trial or appellate court, viewing the evidence most favorably to the plaintiff,
determines as a matter of law that the risk created by the condition was of
such a minor, trivial or insignificant nature in view of the surrounding
circumstances that no reasonable person would conclude that the condition
created a substantial risk of injury when such property or adjacent property
was used with due care in a manner in which it was reasonably foreseeable that
it would be used.” 
(Gov. Code, § 830.2.) 
It is impossible to
maintain public or private walkways in perfect condition. (Stack, supra, 91
Cal.App.5th at pp. 109-110; Nunez, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 758; Kasparian
v. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 11, 26.) In
general, the law does not make public or private landowners the “insurers”
against injuries arising from trivial defects. (Stack, supra, 91
Cal.App.5th at p. 109; Thimon, supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at p. 757.) Rather,
the trivial defect doctrine shields the owner from liability for “minor,
trivial, or insignificant” defects. (Huckey v. City of Temecula (2019)
37 Cal.App.5th 1092, 1104; Kasparian, supra, 156 Cal.App.4th at p. 27.) 
This is not to say that it
is impossible for someone to trip, fall, and sustain injuries as a result of a
defect that is trivial. (See Nunez, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at pp.
759-760.) But the duty of care of a public entity (or a private landowner) does
not extend to protecting pedestrians or others from minor or trivial defects. (Id.
at pp. 757, 759.)
“The trivial defect
doctrine is not an affirmative defense. It is an aspect of duty that a
plaintiff must plead and prove.” (Huckey, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p.
1104; accord Nunez, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 757.)   
“In appropriate cases, the
trial court may determine ... whether a given walkway defect was trivial
as a matter of law.” (Huckey, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1104.) “‘Where
reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion—that there was no
substantial risk of injury—the issue is a question of law, properly resolved by
way of summary judgment.’” (Id. at pp. 1104-1105 (quoting Caloroso v.
Hathaway (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 922, 929).) “If, however,
the court determines that sufficient evidence has been presented so that
reasonable minds may differ as to whether the defect presents a substantial
risk of injury, the court may not conclude that the defect is trivial as a
matter of law.” (Huckey, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1105.)  
In cases involving
allegedly dangerous conditions on a sidewalk or other walkway, courts often begin
their analysis by considering the size of the defect. The size of the height
differential, rise, or other defect is in many cases the “most important”
factor. (Stack, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 111; see also, e.g., Huckey,
supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1105 [stating that size of defect “may be one
of the most relevant factors”].) As the Court of Appeal has explained, however,
“[i]n determining whether a given walkway defect is trivial as a matter of law,
the court should not rely solely upon the size of the defect.”
(Huckey, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1105 [emphasis in original].) “[A]
tape measure alone cannot be used to determine whether the defect was trivial.”
(Caloroso, supra, 122 Cal.App.4th at p. 927.) Rather, a “court should
consider other circumstances which might have rendered the defect a dangerous
condition at the time of the accident.” (Huckey, supra, 37
Cal.App.5th at p. 1105.) 
“These other circumstances
or factors include whether there were any broken pieces or jagged edges in the
area of the defect, whether any dirt, debris or other material obscured a
pedestrian’s view of the defect, the plaintiff’s knowledge of the area, whether
the accident occurred at night or in an unlighted area, the weather at the time
of the accident, and whether the defect has caused any other accidents.” (Ibid.)
“In sum, ‘[a] court should decide whether a defect may be dangerous only after
considering all of the circumstances surrounding the accident that might make
the defect more [or less] dangerous than its size alone would suggest.’” (Huckey,
supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1105 [quoting Caloroso, supra, 122
Cal.App.4th at p. 927]; accord Nunez, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 757.) 
Here, of course, we are not
dealing with an offset in a walkway but with exposed nails or screws in a
kitchen subfloor. And Plaintiff is not alleging that she tripped
but that the exposed nail or screw caught her shoe, causing her to fall. (Plaintiff’s Depo.,
at 36:7-16, 94:3-6; see also Ronnie Livas Depo., at 29:2-6.) 
In a sidewalk defect case, courts have said, as noted above, that the size
of the defect is often the most important factor. It is unclear, however, that
the same principle applies when the alleged defect is a nail sticking out of a
subfloor. The nature of the hazard matters. In a sidewalk offset case, the size
of the defect is critical in assessing the magnitude of the danger A defect of
1/2 or 3/4 of an inch in a sidewalk offset might well be trivial as a matter of
law. The same is not true, however, when the alleged hazard is multiple nails protruding
out of the subfloor; a nail sticking out 1/2 or 3/4 of an inch above a subfloor
would likely not be trivial; in the case of the nail, a smaller protrusion
might well constitute a dangerous condition, particularly when the nail is sharp
and likely to catch on a person’s shoe and create a substantial risk of a fall
(as Plaintiff alleges here).
Although Plaintiff has the burden of proof at trial of showing that a
condition was dangerous, and not a trivial defect, on summary judgment the
moving party has the initial burden of presenting
evidence facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) On this
record, PWSE has not met that burden. PWSE has not produced evidence to show
that the protrusion was so small as to pose only a trivial or insignificant
risk of harm; Plaintiff and her husband, in contrast, both testified that the nails
in their kitchen were protruding significantly enough above the subfloor that
they caught in their shoes and materially restrict their movements. (Plaintiff’s Depo.,
at 36:7-16, 94:3-6; Ronnie Livas Depo., at 29:2-6.) Plaintiff might or might
not prevail on this point at trial, but the Court cannot conclude as a matter
of law that the allegedly dangerous condition in the kitchen was, at most, a
trivial defect.
Third, PWSE argues that even if the exposed nails or screws constituted
a breach of PWSE’s duty and a dangerous condition, Plaintiff cannot, as a
matter of law, establish any causal link between the condition and her fall.
Plaintiff’s own testimony, PWSE contends, is mere speculation.
It is true, as PWSE contends, that at the moment of her fall, Plaintiff
did not know the cause. (Plaintiff’s Depo., at 26:2-14, 35:24-26:6.) But that
does not mean that Plaintiff’s testimony about causation is speculative and
inadmissible. To the contrary, Plaintiff testified that shortly after the fall,
probably later that same day, she inspected the subfloor and personally
observed several screws or nails that had been painted white. (Plaintiff’s
Depo., at 33:17-19, 34:13-17.) One was precisely where she had fallen. (Plaintiff’s
Depo., at 34:18-20.) Based on that, and the nature of her fall, Plaintiff
testified that she was “100 percent sure” that a nail caused her fall. (Plaintiff’s
Depo., at 35:1-12, 36:7-16, 94:3-6.) Plaintiff also presented evidence from her
husband that shortly after the accident, he walked over the same part of the subfloor,
and his foot became “snagged” on “one of the screws or nails that were sticking
up.” (Ronnie Livas Depo., at 29:2-6.)
The trier of fact might or might not credit this evidence or find that
it is sufficient to satisfy the causation element of Plaintiff’s negligence cause
of action. But Plaintiff’s evidence is admissible and, if the trier of fact
believes it (and draws all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor), this
evidence is legally sufficient to support a finding of causation. On this
record, the Court cannot rule that, as a matter of law, Plaintiff is unable to
establish causation.
In sum, PWSE owed a duty of care to Plaintiff, and there are triable
issues of fact on the issues of breach, trivial defect, and causation. PWSE’s motion
for summary judgment, and its motion for summary adjudication of the issues of
duty and causation in the First Cause of Action, are denied.
Second Cause of Action (for Negligent Hiring, Supervision,
and Retention)
“California case law
recognizes the theory that an employer can be liable to a third person for
negligently hiring, supervising, or retaining an unfit employee.” (Doe v.
Capital Cities (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1054; accord Evan F. v.
Hughson United Methodist Church (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 828, 836.) “Liability
… is based upon the reasoning that if an enterprise hires individuals with
characteristics which might pose a danger to customers or other employees, the
enterprise should bear the loss caused by the wrongdoing of its incompetent or
unfit employees.” (Mendoza v. City of Los Angeles (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th
1333, 1339; accord Phillips v. TLC Plumbing (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1133,
1139.)
The elements for a cause of action for
negligent hiring are: (1) employer’s hiring or retention of an employee;¿(2)¿who
is incompetent or unfit;¿(3)¿employer had reason to believe undue risk of harm
would exist because of the employment; and¿(4)¿the harm occurs.¿¿(Federico
v. Super. Ct.¿(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1207, 1213-1214.)
Here, it is undisputed that PWSE hired Defendant
Jabbour, the project manager, in July 2015, and in the six years before
Plaintiff’s accident PWSE had not received any information that Jabbor’s work
was unsatisfactory in any way or that he was in any manner unfit to perform work
in the capacity as a project manager. (DSUMF, No. 17.) During this six-year
period, Jabbor never received a written reprimand of any kind relating to his
work begin unsatisfactory, he had not been named as a defendant in any lawsuit
relating to his work, and PWSE had never received any customer complaint
alleging that Jabbour’s work was unsatisfactory or that his unsatisfactory work
had caused anyone to suffer any injury. (DSUMF, No. 18.)
With this evidence, PWSE has met its initial
burden on summary judgment of presenting evidence that shows that Plaintiff
cannot establish that Jabbour was incompetent or unfit, one of the essential
elements of this cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) This
shifts the burden on summary judgment to Plaintiff to show that a “triable
issue of one or more material facts exists” as to Jabbour’s unfitness. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff has not done so. (See Opp. at p. 3 fn. 1.)
Accordingly, PWSE has shown that there are no
triable issues on the Second Cause of Action and that as to this cause of
action, it is entitled to a summary adjudication in its favor as a matter of
law. PWSE’s motion for summary adjudication as to the Second Cause of Action is
granted.
Defendant Jabbour’s Motion for Summary Judgment
In the FAC, Plaintiff asserts one cause of action against Jabbour, for
negligence. As noted above, the elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting
damages. 
Jabbour’s arguments on the
negligence cause of action are largely similar to PWSE’s. The Court incorporates
by this reference, but will not repeat, the Court’s discussion and resolution
of those arguments.
In addition, however, Jabbour
makes one separate argument: that he himself did not perform any work at
Plaintiff’s residence and therefore that he himself did not personally owe any
duty of care to Plaintiff with regard to the removal of the flooring. Indeed,
it is undisputed that Jabbour was not present at the residence on July 21 or
22, 2021, and that he did not perform any of PWSE’s work at the residence.
(DSUMF, No. 7.)
This undisputed fact is
critical. PWSE’s duty arises from its work at the residence. As set forth in
detail above, PWSE had a general duty under Civil Code section 1714 to exercise
reasonable care in performing that work – and there are triable issues of fact
with regard to whether PWSE breached that duty.
Jabbour, in contrast, did
not perform any work at the residence. As he did not himself perform any work,
he did not himself have any duty of care in relation to the work. Accordingly, Jabbour
has shown that, as a matter of law, he had no duty, and breached no duty, to
Plaintiff.
With this evidence, Jabbour has met his initial
burden on summary judgment of presenting evidence that shows that Plaintiff
cannot establish the elements of duty and breach on her negligence cause of
action against him. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) This shifts the burden
on summary judgment to Plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more
material facts exists” as to duty and breach. (Ibid.) Plaintiff has not
done so.
Accordingly, Jabbour’s
motion for summary judgment is granted.
