And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the motions to compel as moot because Metro has now served discovery responses. The judge also denied the motion for a deemed-admitted order. The judge granted the request for sanctions in part, imposing a mandatory sanction of $660 on Metro and its attorneys for their failure to timely respond to discovery requests. The judge found that Metro's counsel faced various issues, but the imposition of sanctions was mandatory due to the six-month delay in providing responses.
