Background
Three related cases arise out of a bus colliding with
another vehicle on September 7, 2022. 
 
In the first filed matter (Case No. 23STCV09010)
Plaintiff Jack Axelrod (“Axelrod”) filed a complaint on April 24, 2023, against
Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“Metro”)
and Does 1 through 25 (the “Axelrod Action”).
 
On August 16, 2023, Metro filed an answer.
 
On July 25, 2024, Axelrod amended the complaint to name
Susana Covian (“Covian”) as Doe 1.
 
On September 4, 2024, Covian filed an answer and a
cross-complaint against Metro and Roes 1 through 10.
 
In the second filed action (Case No. 23STCV12815) Azucena
Rojas and Efrain Mercado (collectively, the “Rojas Plaintiffs”) filed a
complaint on June 6, 2023, against Covian, Metro, and Does 1 through 50 (the
“Rojas Action”).
 
On October 26, 2023, Covian filed an answer and a
cross-complaint against Metro and Roes 1 through 10. 
 
On November 7, 2023, Metro filed an answer to the
complaint.  On January 16, 2024, filed an answer to Covian’s
cross-complaint.
 
In this action, the third filed action (Case No.
23STCV13913), Ana Belen Garcia (“Garcia”) filed a complaint on June 15, 2023,
against Metro, Doe Driver, and Does 1 through 100 (the “Garcia Action”).
 
On May 2, 2024, Metro filed an answer and a
cross-complaint against Roes 1 through 20.
 
On August 12, 2024, Garcia filed these
four discovery motions: (1) to compel Metro to respond to form interrogatories;
(2) to compel Metro to respond to special interrogatories; (3) to compel Metro
to respond to requests for production; and (4) for an order deeming Metro to
have admitted the truth of the matters specified in requests for admission.  Garcia filed amended motions on August 14. 
 
Metro filed oppositions on October 4,
and Garcia filed replies on October 11.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See Id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On February 27, 2024, Garcia served Metro with
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production, and Requests
for Admission. (Khorshidi Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.)  Metro did not serve timely responses.  (Id., ¶ 3.)  
Although not required to do so, Garcia
followed up with Metro about the responses. 
Metro requested extensions, which Garcia granted, but Metro repeatedly
failed to serve responses as promised.  (Ibid.)  At the time of filing the motions in August, almost
six months after the discovery was served, Metro had not responded to the
discovery.  (Ibid.)  
Finally, on September 30, 2024, Metro served
discovery responses.  (Brooks Decls., ¶¶
3, 5.)  
As the discovery responses have been served,
the motions to compel are denied as moot, and the motion for a deemed-admitted
order is denied.
As the three
motions to compel are denied (as moot), the Court also denies the requests for
sanctions.  The statutes at issue authorize
sanctions against any party, person, or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes” the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ § 2030.290,
subd. (c) & 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
Here, the motion is denied, and so Metro has not unsuccessfully opposed
the motion.
As to the motion for
a deemed-admitted order, the Court grants the request for sanctions in
part.  For this category of motions, the Legislature
has determined that sanctions are “mandatory” against the party or attorney “whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)  That is
plainly the case here.  The Court understands
that Metro’s counsel has faced a series of issues (including illness and
evacuation orders), but the imposition of sanctions is “mandatory,” and, given
the six-month delay in providing responses, the conduct of Metro and its
counsel is not substantially justified, and the imposition of sanctions would
not be unjust.
The Court sets
sanctions in the amount of $660, calculated based on two hours of attorney time
multiplied by a reasonable billing rate of $300 per hour for work of this
nature, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See
Khorshidi Decl., ¶ 5.)
