And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is to rule in favor of the plaintiff on all claims, but not to award punitive damages. The judge has found that the defense witnesses were not credible and is seeking clarification on several issues. Specifically, the judge wants the plaintiff to establish their burden of proof on all claims and specify the damages they are entitled to. The judge also wants the defendants to address questions about the credibility of their testimony, the sources of income for property purchases, and the reasons for transferring large sums of money between entities. Additionally, the judge is unclear about the defense being relied upon by the defendants and wants them to clarify whether they are seeking to revisit the legitimacy of the original judgment obtained by the plaintiff.
