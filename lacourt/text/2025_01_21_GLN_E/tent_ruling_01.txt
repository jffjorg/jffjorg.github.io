  Case Number:  EC065795    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  E The Court’s tentative is as follows:
 

to rule in favor of
     plaintiff on all claims 
not to award punitive
     damages.

 
The Court’s tentative is to find that the defense witnesses
were not credible.
 
The Court would like the plaintiff to address the following
questions:
 

Has the plaintiff
     established his burden on all claims?
If so, what damages has
     plaintiff established he is entitled to?

 
The Court would like the defendants to address the following
questions:
 

Was the testimony of the
     defendants credible?
Were the purported
     sources of income for purchases of the properties at issue credible?
What were the given
     reasons for the various transfers of large sums of money between the
     various entities that defendants were involved with? Were those given
     reasons credible?
How should the Court
     receive the testimony of the defendants that they either did not know why
     various amounts of money were being transferred between entities or simply
     did not care why the money was being transferred?
Is unclean hands a
     defense in this action? 
Is laches a defense?
What is the defense
     defendants are relying on? The Court is not clear on this.
Are defendants asking
     the Court to revisit the legitimacy of the original judgment obtained by
     plaintiff?
