And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling regarding a lawsuit between Kemechukwu Agu (plaintiff) and Win Chevrolet, Inc. and Hyundai Motor Financial (defendants). Agu alleges that the defendants breached their contract by overcharging him for the purchase of an automobile. The defendants have moved to compel arbitration, citing a provision in their contract that requires disputes to be resolved through arbitration. The court grants the motion, finding that the contract provision is binding and that Agu failed to meet his burden to establish grounds for refusing to enforce the agreement. The court also grants the defendants' joinder, finding that Agu agreed to the assignment of the sales contract from Win to Honda, which means that the arbitration clause governs his claims against Honda. The court sets a future hearing date for October 11, 2024, to consider the completion of the arbitration proceedings and potential dismissal of the lawsuit.
