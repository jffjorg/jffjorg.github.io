And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend the complaint filed by Julio Contreras, the plaintiff, against the City of Long Beach, the defendant. The motion seeks to add two third-party plaintiffs, Luis and Marco Bonilla, who were involved in the same automobile accident as the plaintiff, but whose claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the proposed amended complaint does not relate back to the original complaint and that the plaintiff cannot add new plaintiffs whose claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge has also criticized the plaintiff's attorney for failing to timely file and serve the motion, and has ordered the attorney to ensure that papers are filed and served in a timely manner in the future.
