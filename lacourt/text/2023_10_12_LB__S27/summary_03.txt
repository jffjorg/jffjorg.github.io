And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling begins by stating the facts of the case, including that the plaintiffs, Claudia and Josue Morales, filed a lawsuit against the defendants, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and Ali Khoynezhad, M.D., PhD, alleging negligence, hospital negligence, and loss of consortium. The defendants filed a demurrer to the complaint, contending that certain causes of action were duplicative, not sufficiently pled, or not supported by the facts.

The court began by analyzing the demurrer to the second cause of action for hospital negligence, finding that it was not duplicative of the fourth cause of action for corporate negligence. The court also overruled the demurrer to the seventh cause of action for willful and wanton misconduct, finding that it was a separate cause of action.

The court then turned to the demurrer to the fifth and eighth causes of action for intentional misrepresentation and fraud, finding that they were pled on the same basic set of facts and were not duplicative. The court overruled the demurrer to these causes of action, finding that the plaintiffs had pled sufficient facts to support their claims.

However, the court sustained the demurrer to the ninth cause of action for battery, finding that the claim did not sound in battery and that the plaintiffs had not pled sufficient facts to support their claim.

Finally, the court ordered the defendants to file an answer to the complaint, with the ninth cause of action deemed stricken, within ten days. The court also scheduled a case management conference for the same day as the hearing on the demurrer.
