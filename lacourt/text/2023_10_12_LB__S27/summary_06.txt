And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a discovery motion in a lemon law case. The Judge notes that there has been a significant increase in motions to compel further responses and PMK depositions in lemon law cases, and that attorneys have failed to meet and confer in good faith to resolve these disputes. The Judge finds that the attorneys are acting in a way that does not benefit their clients and is incurring unnecessary attorneys' fees. The Judge orders the parties to meet and confer in good faith, to file a joint statement of items in dispute, and to take the motions off calendar if resolved. If the parties are unable to resolve their issues, they must file briefs and declarations detailing their efforts to meet and confer and making any argument against the imposition of sanctions. The Judge will impose sanctions on attorneys who fail to meet and confer in good faith.
