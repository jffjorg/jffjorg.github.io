And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction and motion for reconsideration. The plaintiff sought an injunction that would prevent the defendants from taking adverse acts, including acts of retaliation, intimidation, harassment, or harm to the plaintiff or other owners. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's requested injunction was overbroad, vague, and generally phrased, and that the court could not possibly enforce it if it were entered.

The judge also found that the plaintiff's conduct, including the bolting of a fence and fumigation, did not constitute harassment as defined by CCP §527.6. The judge noted that the plaintiff's only contention that came close to meeting the definition of harassment was a question asked by another owner about whether the plaintiff was afraid to be on the premises, but the question was asked because the property was being fumigated and it was not safe to be on the property at that time.

The judge also denied the motion for reconsideration, finding that the plaintiff had failed to show that he was entitled to the relief he sought. The parties are reminded that there is a case management conference scheduled concurrently with the hearing on the motions.
