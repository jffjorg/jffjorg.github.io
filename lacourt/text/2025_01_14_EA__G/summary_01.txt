And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Gary Gang Guo and Sharon Ye's motion to amend their answer to Chuangwen Chen's second amended complaint. The amended answer will add a new affirmative defense of illegality of contract. Guo and Ye's counsel argue that this amendment is necessary and proper because it is a valid defense and the facts giving rise to this defense were discovered during depositions taken in August and September 2024. Chen argues that Guo and Ye failed to timely serve notice of the present motion and that the amendment is untimely and will cause prejudice. However, the court finds that Chen has waived any objection to the notice of the present motion and that Guo was aware of the allegedly illegal agreement and did not first discover this agreement in depositions during the fall of 2024 as initially suggested by counsel. The court also finds that Chen has not established prejudice and that the amendment will not cause significant delays or additional costs. As a result, the court grants Guo and Ye's motion and orders them to file the proposed amended answer to the second amended complaint separately with the court forthwith.
