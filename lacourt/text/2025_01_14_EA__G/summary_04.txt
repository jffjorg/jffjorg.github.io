And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the Ford Motor Company and Puente Hills Ford to the complaint filed by Sylvia V Ramirez and Osvaldo Huizar. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for negligent repair with leave to amend, and overruled the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent inducement through concealment.

The judge has determined that the economic loss rule bars tort recovery for purely economic losses, and that the plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead the allegations in the sixth cause of action. The judge has also determined that the plaintiffs have sufficiently pled the allegations in the fifth cause of action.

The judge has concluded that the Ford Motor Company and Puente Hills Ford have a duty to disclose material facts to the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants concealed material facts. The judge has also concluded that the plaintiffs have alleged facts that demonstrate a breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and fraudulent inducement.

The judge has granted the Ford Motor Company and Puente Hills Ford leave to amend their demurrer to the sixth cause of action, and has scheduled a hearing on the matter for January 14, 2025.
