And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant Crossroads Equipment Lease and Finance, LLC's demurrer to the plaintiff Eliazar Flores' complaint. The plaintiff alleges he sustained injuries and damages in a motor vehicle collision on November 15, 2022, and is suing multiple defendants for negligence and motor vehicle causes of action. The defendant Crossroads Equipment Lease and Finance, LLC demurs to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge denies the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain exhibits and finds that the demurrer should be overruled. The judge's basis for this ruling is that the plaintiff's complaint adequately alleges ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him, and that the defendant's arguments are extraneous to the face of the complaint and are improper for resolution on demurrer. The demurrer is overruled, and a case management conference is set for October 7, 2024.
