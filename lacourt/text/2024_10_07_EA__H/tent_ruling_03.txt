et al. v. Reliant Tank Division LLC, et al., Case No. 23PSCV02347
ORDER ON MOTION FOR PREFERENTIAL TRIAL SETTING


Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preferential
Trial Setting Pursuant to C.C.P. § 36(d) is GRANTED.
 
Background 
In this
wrongful death action, Plaintiffs Roselia Herrera and Jose Mendoza,
individually and as successors in interest to Juan Carlos Mendoza, deceased
(together, “Plaintiffs”) allege that their son died after his vehicle collided
with a tractor trailer parked on the shoulder of the I-210 westbound freeway.On December 4, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint, asserting causes of action against Reliant Tank Division LLC, Carl
Kenyon Parker, and Does 1-100 for (1) negligence (wrongful death) and (2) negligence
(survivor’s action).
 
Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion for
preferential trial setting. 
Legal
Standard
“In its
discretion, the court may also grant a motion for preference that is
accompanied by clear and convincing medical documentation that concludes that
one of the parties suffers from an illness or condition raising substantial
medical doubt of survival of that party beyond six months, and that satisfies
the court that the interests of justice will be served by granting the
preference.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 36, subd. (d).). 
Subdivision (c)(1) requires that all
essential parties be served with process or have appeared in the action. 
If a motion for preference is granted,
the Court must set a trial date not more than 120 days from the date that the
motion is granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 36, subd. (f).)
Discussion
Plaintiffs move the Court, per Code of
Civil Procedure § 36, subdivision (d), for an order granting trial preference
in this action.
Plaintiff Herrera represents that she
suffered a heart attack in 2008; that she has since had “persistent cardiac
issues requiring frequent, lengthy hospitalizations;” that she has been in and
out of the hospital at UCLA Medical Center (“UCLA”) for cardiac-related issues approximately
11 times since 2021; that her doctors have told her that she has end-stage
heart failure and that her condition is continuing to get worse; that her UCLA
health care providers have repeatedly told her that hospice care is a good
option for her but that she has instead chosen to receive a medication at home
through a portable pump in order to be close to her family; that she was being
considered by UCLA for an open-heart transplant before decedent passed away but
has since been told she no longer qualifies because she does not have
sufficient caregiver support; and that she was intubated during her most recent
hospitalization at UCLA, from July 3-22, 2024. (Herrera Decl., ¶¶ 3-6.)
Herrera’s counsel, Farnaz Salessi, has
provided the Court with copies of Herrera’s medical records, which he personally
downloaded directly from Herrera’s myUCLAhealth online medical record portal
using login information provided to him by Herrera’s daughter, Joelyn Mendoza.
(Salessi Decl., ¶¶ 2 and 3, Exhs. 1-13.) These records are comprised of various
discharge summaries reflecting hospitalizations on November 19, 2021-January
12, 2022, March 8, 2022-March 13, 2022, May 21, 2022-June 19, 2022, July 5, 2022-July
13, 2022, September 17, 2022-September 27, 2022, October 30, 2022-November 14,
2022, March 18, 2023-March 24, 2023, September 4, 2023-September 25, 2023,
November 23, 2023-December 9, 2023, April 17, 2024-April 29, 2024 and July 3,
2024-July 22, 2024, as well as a January 10, 2024 progress note and a July 2,
2024 admission note. (Id., ¶ 3, Exhs. 1-13.) Herrera was advised on
December 8, 2023 that “her treatment options are limited and her overall
condition continues to worsen despite aggressive medical treatment” and that
hospice care was “a reasonable option given her overall poor prognosis.” (Id.,
¶ 3, Exh. 9.) In a January 10, 2024 clinical note, Herrera’s physician noted
having conveyed to Herrera that “she has end stage heart failure” at “a high
risk of frequent hospitalizations,” and “is not a surgical transplant/VAD
candidate.” (Id., ¶ 3, Exh. 12.)
During Herrera’s most recent
hospitalization, doctors noted that she had “a high probability of sudden,
clinically significant deterioration, which requires the highest level of
physician preparedness to intervene urgently.” (Id., ¶ 3, Exh. 13.) The motion
was filed August 6, 2024. Defendants filed their answers on July 10, 2024. (Id.,
¶ 4.)
The Court
determines that Plaintiffs have provided clear and convincing medical
documentation reflecting that Herrera suffers from an illness or condition
raising substantial medical doubt of her survival beyond six months. Defendants
do not dispute as much.

The Court further determines that the interests of
justice will be served by granting preference. Herrera is decedent’s mother (Herrera
Decl., ¶ 2) and thus has a significant interest in presenting her claims and
testimony before a jury and in any settlement or judgment obtained in this
case. While Defendants contend that they will not have enough time to prepare a
defense if this motion is granted, they acknowledge that they have served, and
received responses to, written discovery (Hatch Decl., ¶¶ 7 and 8), and are in
possession of the decedent’s medical records following the accident (See Opp.,
2:16-17). Defendants also advise that Parker’s deposition is set for October 4,
2024. (Hatch Decl., ¶ 9.) The Court does not believe Plaintiffs have
unnecessarily delayed in filing the instant motion, as Herrera’s condition has
declined more significantly in recent months.
Accordingly,
the Court grants trial preference. The Trial and Final Status Conference dates
will be set at the time of the hearing.
