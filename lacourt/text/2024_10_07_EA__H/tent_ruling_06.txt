v. Gomez, et al., Case No. 24PSCV01698


ORDER
ON DEFENDANT’S DEMURRER
Defendant Crossroads Equipment Lease
and Finance, LLC’s Demurrer to Complaint is OVERRULED.
Background 
Plaintiff
Eliazar Flores (“Plaintiff”) alleges he sustained injuries and damages in a
November 15, 2022 motor vehicle collision. 
On
May 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting motor vehicle and
negligence causes of action against Luis Alberto Gomez, Red 1 Express, Inc.,
Juan Requena Montero (“Montero”), Crossroads Equipment Lease and Finance, LLC
(“Crossroads”), and Does 1-25. 
A
Case Management Conference is set for October 7, 2024. Pending before the Court
is Crossroads’ demurrer to the complaint.
Legal
Standard 
A demurrer
may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).) 
“A demurrer
tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or
are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole
v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not,
however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in
the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or
facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may take judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732
[citations omitted].)
Discussion
Crossroads demurs, per Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f), to Plaintiff’s complaint, on the
basis that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
and is uncertain.
At the outset, the Court denies Crossroads’ Request
for Judicial Notice as to Exhibit 1 (i.e., bill of sale), Exhibit 2 (i.e., lien
release), and Exhibit 3 (i.e., “Crossroads Equipment Lease and Finance, LLC
Master Vehicle Lease Agreement”). “The burden is on the party seeking judicial
notice to provide sufficient information to allow the court to take judicial
notice.” (Ross v. Creel Printing & Publishing Co. (2002) 100
Cal.App.4th 736, 744.)
Turning to the merits, Plaintiff alleges in the
complaint that at the time of the alleged accident, “Defendant Montero was under the course and scope of
employment of Defendant Crossroads Equipment Lease and Finance, LLC” (Complaint,
¶ GN-1) and that Crossroads “owned and entrusted the motor vehicle operated by
Montero” (Id., ¶ MV-2). While Crossroads asserts that it “was never Moreno’s employer” (Demurer, 2:17-18) and that it
only leased Montero’s truck and was no longer the lienholder on Montero’s truck
on the date of the alleged accident (Id., 2:15-17), these arguments are
extraneous to the face of the complaint and are improper for resolution on
demurrer.
The demurrer is overruled.
