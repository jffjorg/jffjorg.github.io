ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION
Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of

prejudice.
Background
Plaintiff
Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club (“Plaintiff”) seeks subrogation
against Defendant Santos Leal (“Defendant”) for damages sustained by its insured,
James Albert Chinchilla, in an April 9, 2021 motor vehicle collision.
On
April 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting a subrogation cause of
action against Defendant and Does 1-10.
On
June 27, 2024, Defendant’s default was entered.
Pending
before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defects are noted:
1.       Plaintiff
has not provided the Court with a summary of the case, as per California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(1). 
2.       Tara Murray
(“Murray”) represents that the total amount paid to Plaintiff’s insured was
$43,776.14 (Murray Decl., ¶ 3), which is comprised of $17,565.14 for collision
damages ($27,940.14 minus the salvage recovery of $10,375.00), plus $25,000.00
for bodily injuries sustained by the insured, plus $211.00 in towing and
storage expenses and plus $1,000.00 for the collision deductible assigned by
the insured to Plaintiff. Murray is directed to explain where the $1,000.00 and
$17,565.14 amounts are located on Exhibit B to her declaration or to otherwise
explain how these amounts are shown on Exhibit B. 
3.       The
medical bills attached as Exhibit G to Murray’s declaration total $6,270.00,
yet $25,000.00 was apparently paid to the insured for medical expenses. Murray
is directed to explain this discrepancy to the Court.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s application is denied without prejudice, and Plaintiff is directed
to submit a revised default judgment packet addressing the aforementioned
issues.
