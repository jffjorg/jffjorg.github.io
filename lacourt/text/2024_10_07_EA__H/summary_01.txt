Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Sunnyland's motion for summary judgment. Sunnyland had argued that Plaintiff, Yongyi Liu, cannot establish the elements of her causes of action and that there is no dispute as to the material facts. However, the judge found that there are triable issues of material fact, particularly with regards to whether Li's transfer of the subject property to Sunnyland was fraudulent.

The judge also found that Sunnyland failed to carry its burden of demonstrating no triable issues of material fact. The judge noted that the notarized grant deed showing that Li personally appeared before a notary in Texas, despite being allegedly incarcerated in China, provides a triable issue of fact as to whether the sale was fraudulent.

The judge ordered the parties to review the Department H Case Management Standing Order and to serve and file trial documents in accordance with that order. The case is set for a final status conference on November 4, 2024, and a bench trial is set for November 8, 2024.
