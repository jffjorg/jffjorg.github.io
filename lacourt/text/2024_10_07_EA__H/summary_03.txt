And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiffs' motion for preferential trial setting, citing Code of Civil Procedure § 36(d) and Code of Civil Procedure § 36(f). The motion was filed by Roselia Herrera, who is a heart attack survivor and has been experiencing persistent cardiac issues requiring frequent hospitalizations. Herrera's medical records show that she has been advised that her treatment options are limited and her condition continues to worsen. The Judge finds that Herrera's medical condition raises substantial medical doubt of her survival beyond six months and that the interests of justice will be served by granting preference.

The Judge notes that the Defendants do not dispute the Plaintiffs' medical documentation, and that Herrera's condition has declined more significantly in recent months. The Judge also considers the fact that Herrera is the decedent's mother and has a significant interest in presenting her claims and testimony before a jury.

The Court will set a trial date not more than 120 days from the date the motion is granted, and the Trial and Final Status Conference dates will be set at the time of the hearing.
