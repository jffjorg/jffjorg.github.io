The plaintiff filed a complaint on April 18, 2023, and the defendant's default was entered on June 27, 2024. However, the judge has identified several defects in the plaintiff's application for default judgment, including the lack of a summary of the case as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(1), and inconsistencies in the amounts paid to the plaintiff's insured. The judge has directed Tara Murray, the representative for the plaintiff, to explain the discrepancies and to submit a revised default judgment packet addressing these issues.
