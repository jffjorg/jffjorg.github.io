And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the receivership petition to April 11, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. B. The parties will be required to address the issue of compliance with Health & Safety Code § 17980.7, which requires notice of the petition to be posted in a prominent place on the substandard building at least three days prior to filing the petition. The judge is concerned that the notice was only served on the defendant via certified mail on January 22, 2024, and not physically posted on the property. As a result, the petition may not meet the requirements of the statute.
