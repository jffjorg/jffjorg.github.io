And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23TRCV03301, involving Vicki Ann Hutto and Green Hills Memorial Park. The plaintiff, Vicki Ann Hutto, alleges that she was confronted by security guards and police officers at Green Hills Memorial Park, where her daughter is buried. She claims that the security guard falsely accused her of bathing in the bathroom and leaving it a mess, and that the police officers questioned her about her presence and vehicle based on complaints made to them.

The defendant, Green Hills Memorial Park, has demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state a cause of action for intentional tort and negligence. The defendant argues that the alleged conduct by the security guard and police officers is not extreme and outrageous, and that the plaintiff has failed to allege any egregious conduct that would support an intentional tort claim.

The judge has sustained the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend, and has granted the motion to strike the claim for punitive damages. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to file an amended complaint in conformity with Rule of Court 2.101-2.112.

The judge has stated that a demurrer does not admit contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, and that a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. The judge has also stated that extreme and outrageous conduct is usually a question of fact, but can be determined as an issue of law.

The judge has concluded that the plaintiff's complaint fails to plead "extreme and outrageous conduct" for purposes of intentional infliction of emotional distress, and that the alleged conduct by the security guard and police officers does not qualify as such. The judge has also concluded that the plaintiff's general negligence claim fails, as the plaintiff has failed to allege any breach of a legal duty.
