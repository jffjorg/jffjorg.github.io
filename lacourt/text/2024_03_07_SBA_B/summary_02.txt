Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Jose Ramo Amador's motion to strike the punitive damages claim from the complaint. The motion was based on the argument that the only conduct alleged was negligence and that leaving the scene of the accident alone is insufficient to state a claim for punitive damages. The judge found that the allegations in the complaint, including the intentional tort and intentional infliction of emotional distress, are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages based on the "despicable conduct" prong of malice. The judge also found that the allegations of the intentional tort and intentional infliction of emotional distress, including the intentional abandonment of the scene of the accident, are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge therefore denied the motion to strike and allowed the punitive damages claim to proceed.
