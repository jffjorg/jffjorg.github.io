 Case Number:  23TRCV04188    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  B ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. vs SEJIN PARK
Case No. 23TRCV04188
This is an Unlawful Detainer action filed December 19, 2023.  Plaintiff filed an Application for Order to
Post on January 11, 2024.  For some
reason the Court failed to act upon this request.  (Presumably this failure was the result of
the fact that there was a change in the identity of the Judge assigned to
handle this case at about that point in time.)
Plaintiff has now filed this ex parte Application
seeking the Order to Post.  The request
is GRANTED.
