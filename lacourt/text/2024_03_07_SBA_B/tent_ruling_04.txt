 Case Number:  23TRCV03110    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  B Pursuant to the STIPULATION TO EXTEND HEARING ON
RECEIVERSHIP PETITION filed March 5, 2024, this hearing is continued to April
11, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. B.
At the continued hearing the parties should be prepared to
address the question of compliance with Health
& Safety Code § 17980.7.  That statute
appears to require that notice of the petition be “posted in a prominent place
on the substandard building . . . not less than three days prior to filing the
petition.” (Health & Safety Code § 17980.7(c).) It appears that Plaintiff
City has only provided proof that notice of the petition was served on
defendant via certified mail on January 22, 2024, and not by posting in a
prominent place on the Property. It appears that the petition therefore does
not meet the requirements of Health & Safety Code § 17980.7(c).
