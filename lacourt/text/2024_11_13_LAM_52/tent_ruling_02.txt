 Case Number:  22STCV39769    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Ruby Gomez’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
            Plaintiff Ruby Gomez moves for
$45,613.76 in attorney fees and
other costs from defendant Kia America, Inc.
Hourly Rates
Defendant
argues plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rates are excessive.  For hourly rates, “the trial court is in the
best position to value the services rendered by the attorneys.”  (569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry
Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436.)  Courts may rely on their “own knowledge and
familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and
reputation of the attorney requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the
litigation to which that skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys
regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate determinations in other
cases.” (Id. at p. 437, citations omitted.)
Based on
plaintiff’s counsel’s credentials and experience, the court finds their hourly
rates are reasonable.
Hours
In calculating the lodestar, the court must
determine whether the tasks performed by an attorney were necessary and whether
the amount of time billed for each task was reasonable.  (Baxter
v. Bock (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 775, 793.) 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of
work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the
specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the
evidence.  General arguments that fees
claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.  Failure to raise specific challenges in the
trial court forfeits the claim on appeal.”  (Premier Medical Management
Systems, Inc v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550,
564.) 
Plaintiff claims a total of 93.1 hours of billable
attorney fees.  With one exception, plaintiff
demonstrates the fees incurred were reasonable. 
Plaintiff presents detailed billing records with hundreds of entries,
few of which are for more than one hour. 
The billing entries show plaintiff’s counsel worked efficiently.  
Plaintiff did not reasonably incur the $800
in fees for 1.6 hours spent reviewing defendant’s motions in limine on March
13, 2024.  (Barry Decl., Ex. 4, p. 25.)  Plaintiff had already accepted defendant’s
settlement offer on February 7, 2024.  (Barry
Decl., ¶ 33, Ex. 3.)  Reviewing the
motions in limine was unnecessary.  
Defendant also argues the court should reduce
plaintiff’s lodestar for time spent traveling to the courthouse for
hearings.  “[A]ttorney’s fees for travel hours may be
awarded if the court determines they were reasonably incurred.”  (Roe v. Halbig (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th
286, 312.)  Plaintiff’s counsel reasonably
incurred these fees.  Plaintiff billed
for one attorney’s travel to and from the courthouse only three times: on
October 31, 2023 (Barry Decl., Ex. 4, p. 20), August 7, 2024 (id., p.
27), and for this hearing (id., p. 29). 
Such limited travel was not unreasonable.
The
court will reduce plaintiff’s lodestar by $800, resulting in $42,842.50 in
recoverable attorney fees.
Negative Multiplier
Defendant contends the court should apply a negative
multiplier of 40%.  Doing so is
unwarranted.
Other
Costs
            Plaintiff claims $1,971.26 in other expenses.  Defendant does not oppose the motion as to
those expenses.
Disposition
            Plaintiff Ruby Gomez’s motion for
attorney fees and costs is granted in part.  Plaintiff Ruby Gomez shall recover $44,813.76
in attorney fees from defendant Kia America, Inc.
