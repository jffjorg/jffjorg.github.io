And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court hereby grants plaintiff GKT-Wilshire-CA, LLC's motion for summary judgment as to possession of the property against defendant Wilko USA, Inc. The court finds that plaintiff has met its initial burden of proving each element of its sole cause of action for unlawful detainer, including that defendant failed to pay rent due under the lease agreement, was served with a three-day notice, and has not paid any rent after receiving the notice. The court also finds that defendant remains in possession of the property.

However, the court cannot determine plaintiff's damages on summary judgment due to a genuine dispute of triable fact on the fair market value of the property. The court will therefore enter an interlocutory judgment for possession of the property, but does not decide the issues of damages or attorney fees.
