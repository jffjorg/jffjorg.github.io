And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to continue the trial date from March to June 2025. The defendants, ABF Freight System, Inc. and Bob Hopkins, requested a continuance based on their alleged inability to complete discovery, but the judge found that they did not show good cause for the continuance. The judge noted that the defendants have not conducted any discovery since April 2024, despite having begun the plaintiff's deposition. Additionally, the judge found that the defendants' request to extend the discovery cutoff was unfounded, as they sought to complete discovery before moving for summary judgment. Despite these findings, the judge granted the motion to continue the trial, but only for three months, from March 12, 2025, to June 11, 2025. The judge also continued the final status conference from February 24, 2025, to May 26, 2025.
