Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies Michelman & Robinson, LLP's (M&R) motion for a protective order to appoint a discover referee to preside over the deposition of M&R's person most knowledgeable. The judge also denies Spitz Technologies Corporation's (Spitz) motion to compel the deposition of M&R's person most knowledgeable. The judge finds that M&R acted with a good faith belief that Spitz's counsel engaged in annoying or oppressive behavior during the deposition, but will not impose sanctions against either party.

The judge also rules on Carole Crotty's demurrer to M&R's cross-complaint for indemnity and contribution. The judge overrules Crotty's demurrer as to the first and second causes of action, but sustains it as to the third cause of action for declaratory relief without leave to amend. The judge finds that Crotty's duty of loyalty to Spitz limits her ability to defend herself against M&R's cross-claims and that the concerns about conflicts of interest and confidentiality are significant and require further development of the record.
