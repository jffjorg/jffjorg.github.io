 Case Number:  23STCV22910    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendants
ABF Freight System, Inc. and Bob Hopkins’s Motion to Continue the Trial Date
and All Related Deadlines
Defendants
ABF Freight System, Inc. and Bob Hopkins move to continue the trial from March
to June 2025.  “To ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases, the dates assigned for
a trial are firm.”  (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332(a).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring” it.  (Rule 3.1332(c).)  “A party’s excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts” indicates good cause.  (Rule
3.1332(c)(6).)
Defendants do not show good cause to continue the
trial.  They do not show diligent efforts
to complete discovery.  The record
indicates that defendants have not conducted any discovery since beginning (but
not completing) plaintiff’s deposition on April 29, 2024.  (Vicente Decl., ¶ 6.)  
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.714(b) provides that the trial court should manage its
unlimited cases so that 85 percent are disposed within 18 months.  On January 29, 2024, the court scheduled the
trial for this case on March 12, 2025, about 18 months after the complaint was
filed in September 2023.  In setting the
trial date, the court considered the factors set forth in California Rules of
Court, rule 3.729.
Moreover, even if defendants showed good cause to
continue the trial, they show no basis to extend the discovery cutoff.  They seek to continue the trial to give them more time to complete
discovery before moving for summary judgment—which must be done months before
the discovery cutoff.    
The parties did, however, stipulate to continue the
trial.  (Vicente Decl., Ex. A.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 595.2 provides, “In all cases, the
court shall postpone a trial, or the hearing of any motion or demurrer, for a
period not to exceed thirty (30) days, when all attorneys of record of parties
who have appeared in the action agree in writing to such postponement.”  The court will exercise its discretion to
continue the trial by three months.  
Defendants ABF Freight Systems, Inc. and Bob
Hopkins’s motion to continue trial is granted in part.  The court hereby continues the final
status conference from February 24, 2025, to May 26, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.  The court hereby continues the jury
trial from March 12, 2025, to June 11, 2025, at 10:00 a.m.  The court does not continue any pretrial
discovery deadlines.  All discovery
deadlines shall remain based on the initial trial date of March 12, 2025.
