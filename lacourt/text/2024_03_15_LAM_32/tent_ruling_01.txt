  order RE:
plaintiff’s demurrer defendant fred
  gregorian’s answer 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 4, 2023, Plaintiff Eastern
Funding LLC filed this action against Defendants G2 Business Group, Inc. and
Fred Oshin Gregorian, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of promissory
note and security agreement and (2) breach of guaranty. 
            The action stems from a 2016
promissory note (Note) that Plaintiff issued to Defendant G2. The note was
secured by certain personal property and guaranteed by Defendant Gregorian.
Plaintiff alleges that the Note was modified in May 2018, April 2019, March 2020,
and July 2020. Plaintiff alleges that G2 defaulted on the loan in February
2022. Through this action, Plaintiff seeks recovery of the remaining balance of
$793,512.92 plus interest, late charges, and attorneys’ fees. 
            On May 2, 2023, the Court entered
dismissal as against Defendant G2 per Plaintiff’s request. 
            On January 16, 2024, Defendant
Gregorian answered the complaint in pro per. The answer responds to each
allegation from the complaint and asserts 26 affirmative defenses. 
            On February 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant demurrer to Defendant Gregorian’s answer. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Plaintiff has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Alper Decl.)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff argues that the answer
fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a defense and is uncertain. However,
Defendant’s answer pleads ultimate facts sufficient to inform Plaintiff of the
nature of the affirmative defenses. Any remaining ambiguities may be resolved
in discovery. (See Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (2000) 82
Cal.App.4th 592, 608.) A pleading need not be a “model of clarity” to survive
demurrer. (A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc. (2019)
38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695.) 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s
demurrer is OVERRULED
