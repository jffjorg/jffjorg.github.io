And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the demurrer filed by the plaintiff, Eastern Funding LLC, to the answer of the defendant, Fred Oshin Gregorian, and has decided to overrule the demurrer. The judge notes that the answer pleads sufficient facts to inform the plaintiff of the nature of the affirmative defenses and that any remaining ambiguities may be resolved in discovery. The judge also finds that the pleading need not be a "model of clarity" to survive demurrer. The plaintiff had complied with the meet and confer requirement before filing the demurrer.
