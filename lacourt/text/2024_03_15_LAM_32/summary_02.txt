And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling is on the demurrer filed by Defendant Nadav Marciano to the complaint filed by Plaintiff American Builders & Contractors Supply Co., Inc. on April 26, 2023. The complaint alleges that Defendant Energy Roofing, Inc., of which Marciano is the principal, failed to pay for construction materials provided by the plaintiff. Marciano argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against him and that the plaintiff has not pled the second element of alter ego, that injustice would result from treating the entity as separate. The court holds that the complaint alleges sufficient ultimate facts demonstrating that Marciano is the alter ego of Energy Roofing, and therefore, the complaint adequately pleads claims against Marciano to survive demurrer. The demurrer is therefore overruled.
