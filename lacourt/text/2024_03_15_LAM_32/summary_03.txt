And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiffs' motion for trial preference. The plaintiffs, who are the guardians of four minor children, are seeking a trial preference under California Code of Civil Procedure section 36(b), which allows for a preference in cases involving minors under 14 years old. However, the court finds that the minor plaintiffs do not have a substantial interest in the case as a whole, as the majority of the damages would be suffered by the adult plaintiffs. The court notes that the statute does not define "substantial interest" and that there is no caselaw imposing a definition. The court also finds that the interest of the minor plaintiffs is tangential compared to the adult plaintiffs, who are the primary litigants. Therefore, the court denies the motion for trial preference.
