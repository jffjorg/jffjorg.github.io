The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for attorney's fees filed by both parties. The Plaintiff, Element436 Condominium Association, and the Defendant, Helen Pae and Moon B. Pae, Trustees of the 2021 Pae Family Trust, have argued that they are the prevailing party and are entitled to recover attorney's fees. However, the Court has denied both motions, finding that neither party is the prevailing party under the scenarios set forth in Code of Civil Procedure § 1032(a)(4).

The Court notes that the parties voluntarily settled the action and that neither party has recovered monetary relief. The Court also finds that the facts regarding fault are disputed, and therefore, neither party has established that they are the prevailing party.

The Court concludes that the parties should not be awarded attorney's fees, and the motions for attorney's fees are denied.
