BACKGROUND
 
On June 20, 2023, Plaintiff Flag &
Symbol, LLC sued Defendants Value Price, LLC, Maxwell Lapin, and Paul Goldman,
asserting causes of action for (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the
covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) fraud; and (4) negligent
misrepresentations. This action arises from Plaintiff and Defendants’ business
relationship. Plaintiff supplied Defendant with hoodie sweatshirts and souvenirs
for Plaintiff’s store. Plaintiff alleges Defendant breached agreements by
failing to timely comply with the agreement, falsely claiming products were
defective, etc.
 
On December 6, 2023, Value Price, LLC,
Maxwell Lapin and Paul Goldman filed a cross-complaint against Flag &
Symbol, LLC, Shragay Flags & Symbols Ltd., and James Taratin.
 
ANALYSIS
 
While trial continuances are generally
disfavored, pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332(c), circumstances that indicate good
cause for a continuance include “[a] party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(c)(6).) Factors the Court may consider include,
“[t]he proximity of the trial date,” “[w]hether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party,” and
“[t]he length of the continuance requested.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(d).)
 
Defendants/Cross-Complainants move to
continue the December 2024 trial date for at least six months. Defendants/Cross-Complainants
assert that a continuance is necessary to conduct sufficient discovery against
newly added parties Shagray Israel, Campaign Mobil,
LLC, and Quantum Solomon, Inc. Shagray’s motion to quash was denied on
September 13, 2024, and Defendants learned of Campaign Mobil, LLC and Quantum
Solomon, Inc. during recent discovery, also in September 2024. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff asserts Defendants/Cross-Complainants have
consistently sought to delay this action and should have served Shagray earlier.
 
The Court finds that a continuance is appropriate. The disputes over
jurisdiction and newly added parties necessitate additional time for discovery.
The motion is GRANTED.
