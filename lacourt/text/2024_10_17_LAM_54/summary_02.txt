The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for December 2024. The new trial date is set for June 16, 2025. The judge also continued the final status conference to June 6, 2025. The defendants requested the continuance to conduct additional discovery against newly added parties, and the judge found that this was necessary due to the disputes over jurisdiction and the need for further discovery.
