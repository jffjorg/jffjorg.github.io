et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 24STCV05150            
 
MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL (x2)

Kittrich Corporation and Robert Friedland.
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 09/16/24
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for employment discrimination and wrongful termination
that was filed on February 29, 2024. Plaintiff alleges that she was subjected
to pervasive discrimination and harassment based on her gender and medical
condition which ultimately forced her to resign her position. 
 
Attorney Cristina M. Saca, counsel
for Defendants Kittrich Corporation and Robert Friedland, moves to be relieved
as counsel. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Cristina M. Saca, counsel
for Defendants Kittrich Corporation and Robert Friedland, moves to be relieved
as counsel. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) as to both parties and filed proof of service by mail with the
Court. However, the attached declarations for both motions state that service
was made on the last known address of the individual and corporate Defendants,
without establishing how Moving Counsel confirmed that the addresses are
current. (See MC-052 ¶ 3.) The motions therefore fail to establish that
adequate notice was given on either Defendant Kittrich or Defendant Friedland
that their counsel seeks to withdraw from representation. 
 
Accordingly, Attorney Cristina M. Saca’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Kittrich Corporation is DENIED.
 
Accordingly, Attorney Cristina M. Saca’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Robert Friedland is DENIED.
 
This ruling is without prejudice to a procedurally
compliant and properly noticed motion to be relieved as counsel. This ruling is
also conditioned on Moving Counsel serving notice to all parties and filing
proof of service with the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
