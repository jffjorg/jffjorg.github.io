And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion filed by Attorney Cristina M. Saca, counsel for defendants Kittrich Corporation and Robert Friedland, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was denied because the moving party failed to establish that adequate notice was given to the defendants regarding the withdrawal of representation. The judge requires that the moving party serve notice to all parties and file proof of service with the court before a new motion can be considered. The ruling is without prejudice to a procedurally compliant and properly noticed motion to be relieved as counsel.
