English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The defendant, Bio Clarity, LLC, operates a website with interactive features and argues that it is a national website accessible from California. The plaintiff, Airsha Byars, asserts that the website is directed towards California residents and has purposefully availed itself of California's laws and jurisdiction. The court finds that the plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to demonstrate purposeful availment by the defendant and that the claim asserted arises out of those activities. The court also finds that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be unreasonable.
