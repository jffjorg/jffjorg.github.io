And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and granted summary adjudication of certain affirmative defenses. The court finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated as a matter of law that she was subjected to the adverse employment action of termination. The court also finds that Plaintiff has not established the extent of unpaid wages, which is an element of the third cause of action. The court has denied Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication of the third cause of action for unpaid overtime wages. The court has granted summary adjudication of the 38th and 58th affirmative defenses, which relate to legitimate nondiscriminatory purposes. The court has denied Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication of the 59th affirmative defense, which relates to whether Plaintiff engaged in protected activity. The court has also denied Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication of the fourth and fifth causes of action, which relate to inaccurate wage statements and waiting time penalties, respectively.
