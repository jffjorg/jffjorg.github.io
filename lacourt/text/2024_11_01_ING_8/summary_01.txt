```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant, Leo Ramsey, has failed to comply with several court orders and has imposed a terminating sanction of striking Ramsey's answer. The court found that Ramsey's failure to respond to discovery requests and pay monetary sanctions was willful and that less severe sanctions would not be effective in securing compliance. The judge also noted that the record reflects a history of discovery abuse by Ramsey and that he has abandoned his defense of the case. The court granted the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions and ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of the ruling.
