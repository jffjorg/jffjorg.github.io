BACKGROUND   A. Factual    On January 20, 2023, Plaintiff, Katelyn Dow Stepanyan  (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant, Florence W. Kelley, Eddie  Suber, and DOES 1 through 100. The complaint alleges causes of action for: (1)  Violation of California Civil Code §1942.4; (2) Tortious Breach of the Warranty  of Habitability; (3) Private Nuisance; (4) Business and Professions Code §  17200, et seq.; (5) Negligence; (6) Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; (7)  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (8) Negligence Per Se; (9)  Violation of Consumer Legal Remedies Act – California Civil Code § 1750, et  seq.; and (10) Disgorgement of Fees Paid for Unlicensed Contractor Services.    On July 8, 2024, Defendant, Florence W. Kelley asserts  that she propounded written discovery on Plaintiff in the form of Form  Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Admission, Set One. Defendant Kelley  contends that responses were due by August 8, 2024. Kelley argues that  Plaintiff did not request an extension to provide responses, and instead, on  August 8, 2024, served blanket objections to all written discovery served.  Further, Defendant Kelley states that Plaintiff has failed to provide any  substantive responses. As such, Defendant Kelley has filed these Motions to  Compel Plaintiff’s Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and  Requests for Production of Documents, Set One.    B. Procedural  On September 23, 2024, Defendant Kelley  filed these Motions to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set  One and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. On October 8, 2024,  Plaintiff’s counsel, Jacob O. Partiyeli filed a declaration in opposition to  the discovery motions indicating he has a pending motion to withdraw as counsel  for Plaintiff.    II. ANALYSIS    A.     Legal  Standard    A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after  service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom  interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting  party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also waives the right to make any  objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to  compel responses to interrogatories other than the cut-off on hearing discovery  motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Code  Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a  motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko  Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148  Cal.App.4th 390, 41.) “Unless otherwise limited by order  of the court in accordance with this title, any party may obtain discovery  regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter  involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in  that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears  reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code  of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) For discovery purposes, information is regarded as  relevant “if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case,  preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement thereof.” (City of Los  Angeles v. Superior Court (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 272, 288.)   A motion to compel further  responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be  brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate,  evasive, or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or  overly generalized objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) A  motion to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good  cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See Code Civ.  Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court  (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing  that there “a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the  discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to  other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.” If the  moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden  is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct  (2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) ¿  "The court shall limit the  scope of discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness  of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought  will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." (Cal. Code of Civ.  Proc. § 2017.020(a).) Generally, objections on the ground of burden require the  objecting party to produce evidence of (a) the propounding party's subjective  intent to create burden or (b) the amount of time and effort it would take to  respond. (See West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior Court In  and For Los Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) However, no such  evidence is necessary where discovery is obviously overbroad on its face. (See Obregon  v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.) B.     Discussion    Preliminarily, this court notes that in lieu of a tradition  opposition brief, Plaintiff’s counsel, Jacob O. Partiyeli filed a declaration  (“Partiyeli Decl.”) requesting this court continue the hearing of these  motions. (Partiyeli Decl., ¶ 2.) Partiyeli notes that he has filed a motion to  be relieved as counsel due to Plaintiff’s failure to comply with his  obligations under the California Discovery Act and other issues, which he notes  will not be disclosed because of the attorney-client privilege. (Partiyeli  Decl., ¶ 2.) Furthermore, Partiyeli has attested that he has had no wrongdoing  in attempting to fulfill his obligations under the California Discovery Act,  and asks this court pardon the violations in the motions to compel further  named against him. (Partiyeli Decl., ¶ 3.) Lastly, Partiyeli asserts that he  prepared objections to the discovery queries in an effort to protect his client  from the waiver of objections and hopes that the court can see his good faith  in the discovery issues. (Partiyeli Decl., ¶ 4.) As such, Partiyeli has requested  this court postpone the hearing on the discovery motions until he is relieved  as counsel. (Partiyeli Decl., ¶ 2.)   This court notes that it finds good cause to postpone the  hearing on Defendant Kelley’s motions to compel further until after withdrawal  of counsel for Plaintiff. The hearings on the discovery and sanctions motions  are continued to December 3, 2024, the same date and time  as the hearing on the motion by Plaintiff’s counsel to withdraw.        III. CONCLUSION    For  the foregoing reasons, Defendant Kelley’s Motions to Compel Further Responses are  CONTINUED.    Mr.  Partiyeli is ordered to give notice of the continued hearings and to file proof  of service of that notice with the court in advance of the continued hearing  date.  Even if Plaintiff does not have  new counsel by then, the Court will rule on the pending motions on December 3.
