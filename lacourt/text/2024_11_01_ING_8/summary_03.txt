Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants, Bay Crest Care Center, LLC, and Rita Simms. The defendants argue that the arbitration agreement executed by the decedent, James Meeks, requires arbitration of the claims brought by the plaintiffs, including the wrongful death claim. The judge is tentatively viewing the complaint as sounding in elder abuse rather than medical malpractice, which would suggest that the motion to compel arbitration of the non-signatory plaintiffs should be denied.

The judge is also considering whether the arbitration agreement applies to the non-signatory plaintiffs, who are bringing claims for elder abuse, negligence, violation of patient's bill of rights, and wrongful death. The judge notes that the arbitration agreement requires arbitration of all claims arising out of or relating to the decedent's stay at Bay Crest, including disputes regarding interpretation and/or enforceability of the agreement.

The judge is seeking oral argument on the issue of whether the complaint reads more as a failure to provide medical services versus substandard performance of medical services, which would affect the applicability of Code of Civil Procedure section 1295. The judge is also considering whether the arbitration agreement was explained to the decedent and whether he understood what he was signing, as well as whether the court should stay the superior court action pending arbitration.
