Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to compel further responses to plaintiff's requests for production of documents. The plaintiff, Ana Marilu Landaverde Rivera, is seeking to compel defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. to produce responsive documents and a privilege log. The judge grants the motion in part, ordering defendant to produce responsive documents and a privilege log within 20 days. The judge also denies the motion without prejudice in part, ordering the case to be bifurcated for both discovery and trial. The judge orders that phase one of the trial will focus on the basic Song Beverly Act claim arising from the claimed breach of the Song Beverly statutory obligations, and phase two will involve the plaintiff's claim to a civil penalty under Civil Code §1794(c) for a willful violation of the statute.
