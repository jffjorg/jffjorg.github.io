And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion of attorney Jacob Emrani, APC to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Brandon Reynolds. The attorney has submitted a declaration stating that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and a material breakdown in trust and communication between counsel and client, preventing effective assistance of counsel. The court finds that the attorney has shown sufficient reason why the motion to be relieved as counsel should be granted. The motion is granted, and the attorney is relieved as counsel of record for plaintiff Brandon Reynolds, effective upon the filing of the proofs of service of the signed "Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel â€“ Civil" upon the client.
