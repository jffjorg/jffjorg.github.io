Plaintiffs Elizabeth Taylor (“Taylor”) and Chasity Jones (“Jones”) (together,
“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows: 
 
Defendant Alkiviades David (“David”) was, at
all relevant times, the President, CEO and managing agent of Defendants Hologram

(“FilmOn TV”), FilmOn.TV Networks, Inc. (“FilmOn Networks”), Alki David
Productions, Inc. (“Alki David Productions”) and Anakando Media Group USA
(“Anakando”). In January 2015, Plaintiffs were hired by Defendants as account
executives on the company’s sales team. Throughout the duration of their
employment, Plaintiffs worked in a hostile, misogynistic workplace rife with
sexual innuendo and degrading behavior to women. David also sexually harassed,
assaulted and imprisoned Taylor and sexually harassed and assaulted Jones. In
May 2015, Defendants directed Taylor to falsify health insurance paperwork to
indicate a later hire date. On June 1, 2015, Taylor was terminated, which was
the same day she complained about sexual harassment and insurance fraud. In
October 2015, Defendants ordered Jones to sign a declaration against Taylor. On
November 15, 2016, Jones was terminated in retaliation for rebuffing David’s
sexual assault.

Discussion
 
Glaser Weil Fink Howard Jordan & Shapiro
LLP (“Firm”) seeks to be relieved as counsel of 
record for
David (“Client”).
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of 
justice. (See
Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
 
California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion
directed to the client (made on the Notice
of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
 
Attorney Fred D. Heather (“Heather”) represents that “there is a
genuine basis for withdrawal under California Rules of Professional Conduct,
Rule 1.16” and that the Client “and his new counsel have not consented to a
request to substitute counsel.” Heather requests that an in camera
hearing be conducted should the court desires further information. 
 
Heather states that he has served the Client by mail at the Client’s last known
address with copies of the motion papers served with this declaration and that
he has confirmed, within the past 30 days, that the address is current. Heather
advises that the Client “was served both by email and care-of his
counsel in Greece” and that the Client’s “Greek counsel has confirmed that [the
Client] can be served by email in connection with the service of all case
related documents.”
 
The court
determines that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated above

have been
sufficiently met. 
 
Accordingly, the
motion is granted, effective upon the filing of a proof
of service showing 
service of the signed order via
email upon the Client at the Client’s email address and via 
mail and email upon Themis Sofos
of Sofos & Partners.
