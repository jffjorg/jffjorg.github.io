And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Abkarian and Associates' motion to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiff, David Raymond Dauer, effective upon the filing of a proof of service showing service of the signed order upon the Client at the Client's last known address. The motion was granted because the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 have been met, including service of the notice of motion and motion on the Client and other parties, a declaration stating the reasons for the motion, and a proposed order relieving counsel. The court notes that while the attorney, Gregor Aleksanian, has failed to identify what options were available to confirm the Client's address, the proof of service reflects that the Client has been served via certified mail.
