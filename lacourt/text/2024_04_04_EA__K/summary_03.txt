And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied Vanessa Campa's motion to set aside the default entered against her in the case of Billy Jaite vs. Vanessa Campa (Case Number: 23PSCV01975). The case revolves around a romantic relationship between the plaintiff and defendant, during which the plaintiff paid the defendant's rent and established a trust for the defendant's daughter, Victoria. The defendant ceased communication with the plaintiff and failed to establish the trust. The defendant's motion to set aside the default was based on claims of improper service, lack of actual notice, surprise, and extrinsic fraud, but the motion was denied due to the lack of supporting evidence. The Judge granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice and scheduled a status conference for May 6, 2024.
