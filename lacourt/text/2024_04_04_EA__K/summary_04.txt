And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the service of summons and complaint in a civil case. The Judge notes that if personal service cannot be achieved, alternative methods of service may be used, such as leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of business, or usual mailing address, and mailing a copy by first-class mail to the same address. The Judge cites Code of Civil Procedure ยง 415.20, which outlines the specific procedures for alternative service. The Judge concludes that service of the summons and complaint is deemed complete on the 10th day after mailing.
