Discussion
Plaintiff applies for a right to attach order and writ of
attachment against Defendant. The amount to be secured by the attachment is $87,026.98,
which includes estimated costs of $600.00 and estimated allowable attorney fees
of $1,200.00.
Analysis
“Attachment is a prejudgment remedy which requires a court
to make a preliminary determination of the merits of a dispute. It allows a
creditor who has applied for an attachment following the statutory guidelines
and established a prima facie claim to have a debtor's assets seized and held
until final adjudication at trial.” (Lorber
Industries, Inc. v. Turbulence, Inc. (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 532, 535.) “A
purpose of the attachment statutes is to confine attachments to commercial
situations and to prohibit them in consumer transactions. The language, ‘trade,
business or profession,’ in section 483.010, subdivision (c) fulfills that
purpose by limiting the use of attachments to ‘commercial transactions’ and
precluding them in ‘consumer transactions.’” (Kadison, Phaelzer, Woodard, Quinn
& Rossi v. Wilson (1987) 197 Cal.App.3d 1, 4 [citation omitted].)
Attachment is
governed by Attachment Law, Title 6.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, sections
481.010-493.060. “[A]ttachment procedures are solely creatures of
statute and . . . such statutes must be strictly construed.” (Arcata Publications Group v. Beverly Hills
Publishing Co. (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 276, 279.)
Procedural Considerations: “Upon the filing of the complaint or
at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply…for a right to attach order and
a writ of attachment by filing an application for the order and writ with the
court in which the action is brought.”
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 484.010, 485.210, subd. (a).) “No order or writ shall be
issued. . . except after a hearing. At the times prescribed by subdivision (b)
of Section 1005, the defendant shall be served with all of the following:
(a) A copy of the summons and complaint. (b) A notice of application and
hearing. (c) A copy of the application and of any affidavit in support of the
application.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
484.040.)
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
“Notice and Acknowledgment of Receipt,” which reflected that Defendant’s
counsel acknowledged receipt of, inter alia, the summons and complaint.
On February 6, 2024, Defendant filed an answer.
On March 12, 2024, the instant
application and supporting documents were filed; the concurrently filed
proof of service reflects that Defendant’s counsel had been electronically and
mail-served with said documents that day.
The court determines that
adequate notice has been provided, based on the above and on the information
contained in the footnote.

Substantive Considerations: “At the hearing, the court shall
consider the showing made by the parties appearing and shall issue a right to
attach order, which shall state the amount to be secured by the attachment
determined by the court in accordance with Section 483.015 or 483.020, if it
finds all of the following:
1.         The claim upon which the attachment is
based is one upon which an attachment may be issued.
2.         The plaintiff has established the
probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based.
3.         The attachment is not sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.
4.         The amount to be secured by the
attachment is greater than zero.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 484.090, subd. (a).)
“The court's
determinations shall be made upon the basis of the pleadings and other papers
in the record; but, upon good cause shown, the court may receive and consider
at the hearing additional evidence, oral or documentary, and additional points
and authorities, or it may continue the hearing for the production of the
additional evidence or points and authorities.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.090, subd. (d).) “The court has the power
to determine disputed facts on the basis of a preponderance of the
evidence as disclosed in the affidavits and declarations… [Hobbs v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 80…].” (Weil & Brown,
et al., CAL. PRAC. GUIDE:  CIV. PRO.
BEFORE TRIAL (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 9:948 (emphasis theirs).)
“The following
property of the defendant is subject to attachment: (a) Where the defendant is
a corporation, all corporate property for which a method of levy is provided by
Article 2 (commencing with Section 488.300) of Chapter 8. (b) Where the
defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated association, all partnership
or association property for which a method of levy is provided by Article 2
(commencing with Section 488.300) of Chapter 8. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., §
487.010.)
Plaintiff must
provide a statement that the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than
the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based, a statement that
the applicant has no information or belief that the claim is discharged in a
proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code (Bankruptcy) or that the
prosecution of the action is stayed in a proceeding under Title 11 of the
United States Code (Bankruptcy). (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.020, subds. (c) and
(d).) Plaintiff has complied with these requirements.
Plaintiff must also
provide a description of the property to be attached under the writ of
attachment and a statement that the plaintiff is informed and believes that
such property is subject to attachment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.020, subd.
(e).) “Where the defendant is a corporation, a reference to ‘all corporate
property which is subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of
Civil Procedure Section 487.010’ satisfies the requirements of this
subdivision. Where the defendant is a partnership or other unincorporated
association, a reference to ‘all property of the partnership or other
unincorporated association which is subject to attachment pursuant to
subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010’ satisfies the
requirements of this subdivision. Where the defendant is a natural person, the
description of the property shall be reasonably adequate to permit the
defendant to identify the specific property sought to be attached.” (Id.)
Plaintiff has sufficiently complied with this requirement.
CLAIM:
“[A]n attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim
or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or
implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount
not less than five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and
attorney's fees.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
483.010, subd. (a) [emphasis added].)
“An attachment may
not be issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property
arising from agreement, statute, or other rule or law . . . [h]owever, an
attachment may be issued where the claim was originally so secured but, without
any act of the plaintiff or the person to whom the security was given, the
security has become valueless or has decreased in value to less than the amount
then owing on the claim . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010, subd. (b).) “If the
action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a claim which arises
out of the conduct by the defendant of a trade, business, or profession.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 483.010, subd. (c).)
The claim is for
money, and based upon four written rental agreements, whose total sum is more
than $500. (Haaker Decl., ¶¶ 4, 9, 14 and 19). Defendant, however, contends
that the alleged debt is not readily fixed or ascertainable. (See Campos
Decl.; see below.)
Probable Validity:
“A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely
than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on
that claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
481.190.)
The court determines that Plaintiff has not
shown the probable validity of its claim. Plaintiff’s
President, Robin Haaker (“Haaker”), has
attached copies of the four rental agreements and 
“VACTOR Rental Agreement HXX Walk-Around” for
each of the foregoing agreements as 
Exhibits “1”-“4” to her declaration. Haaker
attests that Defendant owes $30,324.49 under 
Agreement #1, $32,837.26 under Agreement #2,
$7,645.71 under Agreement #3 and $12,680.82 
under Agreement #4, plus interest (Haaker
Decl., ¶¶ 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 22 and 23), for a total 
principal owed of $83,488.28. Haaker does not
explain how these amounts were calculated. 
Haaker has also attached a copy of a
“Customer Statement as of 2023-08-10” as Exhibit “5” to 
her declaration. However, Exhibit 5 fails to
attach any of the specific invoices referenced therein. 
Plaintiff has not provided the court with any
breakdown as to how the balance for each invoice 
was calculated. Further, Exhibit 5 lists a
balance of $80,488.28, not $83,488.28.
 
Defendant is disputing the final balance
allegedly owed; more specifically, Defendant is 
challenging Plaintiff’s charges for alleged
overage hours and for certain repairs that 
were purportedly charged to it weeks after
the equipment was returned and a walkthrough was 
conducted. (Campos Decl., ¶¶ 10, 13, 14, 19,
20, 23 and 24). Defendant is also challenging 
whether it should be charged the daily rate
or the pro-rated monthly rate for equipment 
Defendant leased but returned after four days
at Plaintiff’s demand. (Id., ¶ 25).
 
RULING:
 
The application is denied.
