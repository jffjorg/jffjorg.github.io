And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained Defendant Jesus Camacho's demurrer to Plaintiff Brandy Camacho's complaint for damages. The court has determined that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court has also determined that the complaint is uncertain and fails to join a mandatory party, Gabriela Camacho, who is Plaintiff's mother. The court will hear from counsel for Plaintiff as to whether leave to amend is requested, and which cause(s) of action, and will require an offer of proof if so.
