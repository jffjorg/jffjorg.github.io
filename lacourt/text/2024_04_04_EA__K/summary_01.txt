And here is the English-text summary:

The judge grants Automotive Credit Corporation's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The plaintiffs, Katherine Camacho and Victor Venegas, had sued Automotive Credit Corporation and Sus Amigos Auto Center, Inc. for various causes of action related to the purchase of a defective 2016 Chevy Silverado. The plaintiffs had dismissed Sus Amigos with prejudice, which means they cannot sue them again. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' complaint does not state a cause of action against Automotive Credit Corporation because the Holder Rule does not create a cause of action. Instead, the plaintiffs would need to "borrow" a cause of action from another statute or common law source. The judge concludes that the motion is granted and the complaint is dismissed.
