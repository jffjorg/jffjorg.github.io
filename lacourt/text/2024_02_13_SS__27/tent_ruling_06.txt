          On June 10,
2022, Plaintiff Whitney Kim Anh Truong (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants
Cha Hee Choi (“Cha”), Una Choi (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 to 50 for
injuries arising from an auto accident on September 16, 2020.  On September 7, 2023, Plaintiff served
Request for Production of Documents, Set One on Defendants.  On October 9, 2023, Defendants served
responses.  On November 9, 2023,
Defendants served further responses.
          On December
6, 2023, an Informal Discovery Conference was held concerning these discovery
requests and others. On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to
compel Defendant Cha to provide further responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One.
          Legal
Standard — Compel Further Responses
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310,
subdivision (a), parties may move for a further response to requests for production
of documents where an answer to the requests are evasive or incomplete or where
an objection is without merit or too general.  
Notice of the motions must be given
within 45 days of service of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding
party waives any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., 2031.310,
subd. (c).) The motion must also be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (b).)    
Finally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1345 requires that all motions to compel further responses contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3)). 
Analysis
Timeliness
The Court finds that the motion is timely
made.  The declaration of Plaintiff’s
counsel indicates the parties had agreed to extend the deadline for this motion
to January 21, 2024, which was a Sunday.  (See Goncuian Decl., ¶ 26.)  Whenever a deadline falls on a weekend or a
holiday, such as Sunday, the deadline is automatically extended to the
following court day.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 10, 12, 12a, 12b; Gov. Code, § 6700, subd. (a)(1).)  Thus, the deadline for Plaintiff’s motion was
January 22, 2024.  Plaintiff served the
motion on January 19, 2024 and filed it on January 22, 2024.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is timely made.
