I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            This is a
consolidated case arising out a motor vehicle collision that occurred on July
14, 2021. 
 
On March 10, 2022, Artemio Aguilar (“Aguilar”) initiated
this lead case against Monica Guyumdzhyan (“Guyumdzhyan”), Christi Mkhsyan (“Mkhsyan”)
and Does 1 to 50 asserting one cause of action for negligence. 
            
On April 27, 2022, Guyumdzhyan initiated case number
22STCV13945 against Aguilar alleging causes of action for negligence and motor
vehicle.
 
On January 26, 2023, Tiroui Simonyan initiated case number
23VECV00353 against Aguilar alleging causes of action for negligence and motor
vehicle.
 
On October 1, 2023, the Court ordered the cases consolidated.
 
On December 28, 2023, Guyumdzhyan and Mkhsyan (collectively,
“Movants”) filed the instant three motions to compel Aguilar’s response to
their Demand for Inspection and Production of Documents, Form Interrogatories,
and Specially Prepared Interrogatories (collectively, the “Discovery Requests”).
Movants also request sanctions. 
 
As of February 7, 2024, the motions are unopposed. 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
            “Within 30
days after service” of a demand for inspection or interrogatories, the responding
party shall serve responses to the discovery unless the court has shortened or
extended the time for response. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a); 2031.260,
subd. (a).) 
 
Failure to serve timely responses to demands for inspection
and interrogatories results in the responding party waiving any objection to
the discovery requests, including those based on privilege and work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.300, subd. (a);
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
 
If a party fails to serve timely responses to interrogatories or
demands for inspection, the party making the demand or propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b);
2031.300, subd. (b).) 
 
            Monetary
Sanctions 
¿ 
            If the
court finds that a party has “unsuccessfully made or opposed” a motion to
compel discovery responses, the court “shall impose a monetary sanctions . . .
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)  
 
Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030 grants the Court discretion to
impose sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process.” Under Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.010, misuse of the discovery process includes failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery, making unmeritorious objections or
evasive responses to discovery and failing to confer with opposing counsel to
attempt to resolve discovery disputes informally.¿
 
If sanctions are sought, Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.040 requires
that the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are
sought and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the
points and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting
the amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel for
Movants served Aguilar with the Discovery Requests on September 19, 2023. (Eisaeian
Decls., ¶2, Exhs. A.) The Court has reviewed the requests attached to counsel’s
declarations and finds they seek relevant information.
 
Aguilar’s responses to those requests were due on October
23, 2023. (Mtn., 3:8-9.) On October 31, 2023, counsel for Movants asked that
Aguilar provide verified answers to the Requests by November 3, 2023. (Eisaeian
Decls., Exh. B.) Thereafter, at the request of Aguilar’s counsel, the deadline
was extended to December 8. (Id.) 
 
To date, movants’ counsel has not received Aguilar’s
responses to the Discovery Requests. Therefore, all objections to the Requests
are waived.¿
 
Aguilar has not opposed these motions. California Rules of
Court Rule 8.54(c) provides that a failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a
consent to the granting of the motion.
 
            As Movants
properly served the Discovery Requests and Aguilar failed to serve timely responses
and did not oppose these motions, Movants are entitled to an order directing Aguilar
to provide verified, objection-free responses to the Discovery Requests.¿
            
             Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Movants
request sanctions against Aguilar.
 
Sanctions are discretionary under Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c),
2023.010, and 2023.030. 
 
Movants request sanctions of $455.34 for each of the three
discovery motions, consisting of two hours of attorney’s fees to meet and
confer, review the motion and declaration and appear at the hearing, at $160.17
per hour; plus one hour of legal assistant time to reserve the hearing and
draft the motion, at $75 per hour, plus a $60 motion filing fee. (Eisaeian
Decls., ¶5.)
 
Because each of the three motions are straightforward and in
many respects duplicative of one another, the Court will reduce the requested
sanctions and order sanctions in the amount of $900.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The
unopposed motions are granted. Artemio Aguilar is ordered to provide verified,
objection-free responses to Monica Guyumdzhyan and Christi Mkhsyan’s Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of
Documents within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
            The request
for sanctions is granted. Plaintiff and his counsel are ordered, jointly and
severally, to pay sanctions in the amount of $900.00 to Movants’ counsel, Mark
R. Weiner & Associates within 20 days of this order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
