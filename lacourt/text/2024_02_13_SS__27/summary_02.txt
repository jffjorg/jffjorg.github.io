And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the unopposed motions to compel discovery responses filed by Monica Guyumdzhyan and Christi Mkhsyan against Artemio Aguilar. The motions sought to compel Aguilar to respond to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents. The judge finds that Aguilar failed to respond to the discovery requests and that the requests were properly served. As a result, all objections to the requests are waived.

The judge also grants the request for sanctions against Aguilar in the amount of $900. The sanctions are based on Aguilar's failure to serve timely responses to the discovery requests and his failure to oppose the motions.

The judge orders Aguilar to provide verified, objection-free responses to the discovery requests within 20 days of the date of the order. The judge also orders Aguilar and his counsel to pay the sanctions of $900 to Movants' counsel, Mark R. Weiner & Associates, within 20 days of the order.
