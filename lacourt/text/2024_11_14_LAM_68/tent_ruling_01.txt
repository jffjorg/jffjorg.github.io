REQUESTED
Motion
for Summary Judgment/Summary Adjudication
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Dwain Lammey requires the use of a wheelchair. On January 31, 2023, Plaintiff
sought to enter the premises of a “restaurant” (Cold Stone Creamery) owned
and/or operated by Defendants, but maintains non-compliant counters and tables
to accommodate protected persons entering public establishments. 
 
On
June 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a verified complaint for Violation of the
Americans with Disabilities Act, and Violation of the Unruh Act. On July 14,
2023, an answer was filed by Marlan Cooper, presumably in pro per, and
purportedly on behalf of Maresp Corporation. On July 21, 2023, GG LA Figueroa,
LLC, filed a verified answer to the complaint. On August 29, 2023, a default
was entered against Maresp Corporation. 
 
On
October 13, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the answer of GG LA
Figueroa, LLC, and denied the. motion to strike. GG LA Figueroa, LLC filed an
amended answer on November 3, 2023. On January 16, 2024, GG LA Figueroa, LLC
filed a cross-complaint against both Cold Stone Creamery, Inc. and Maresp
Corporation for Express Contractual Indemnity, Implied Indemnity, and Declaratory
Relief.

Plaintiff Dwain Lammey moves for summary judgment/summary
adjudication on grounds of violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act
based on the lack of accessibility due to the non-compliant design of certain
outdoor table amenities. Defendant GG LA Figueroa, LLC in opposition challenges
the motion as one based on a “state of mind” regarding the inability to find a
suitable table. Defendant additionally contends Plaintiff lacked any “bona fide
intent” to actually patronize the business, and only brings the case based on
“trivial” or illusory violations. Plaintiff in reply maintains Plaintiff
properly seeks injunctive relief, bona fide intent is irrelevant to the.
subject action, Plaintiff brings the case under the deterrent effect public
policy basis for prosecution of such claims, Plaintiff encountered barriers to
access of the premises, and Defendant lacks admissible evidence. 
 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)”  (Scolinos
v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A plaintiff or cross-complainant has met
his or her burden of showing that there is no defense to a cause of action if
that party has proved each element of the cause of action entitling the party
to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Plaintiff need not disprove all defenses, if
the elements of a cause of action are made. (Oldcastle Precast, Inc. v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. (2009)
170 Cal.App.4th 554, 564; WRI Opportunity
Loans II, LLC v. Cooper (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 525, 532.) “An issue of fact
can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)  
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
A Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)
requires three elements: “1) a
covered disability; (2) “the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases,
or operates a place of public accommodation; and (3) the plaintiff
was denied public accommodations by the defendant because of [the]
disability.” (Martinez v. San Diego County Credit Union (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1060.) Twelve categories
of public accommodation exist, with non-exclusive examples “falling into each
category.” (Ibid.) The subject ice cream shop qualifies as a place of public
accommodation. (42 U.S.C.A. § 12181(7)(B).) A violation of the ADA constitutes
a violation of the Unruh Act. (Munson v. Del Taco, Inc. (2009)
46 Cal.4th 661, 669-670.) A party proceeding under the Unruh Act Civil Code
section 51, subdivision (f) may obtain statutory damages on proof of an ADA
access violation without the need to demonstrate additionally that the
discrimination was intentional.” (Id. at p. 670.)
 
Plaintiff relies on the lack of ADA code compliant tables
and service counters. [Declarations of Randall Marquis, Celia Aguirre, and
Dwain Lammey.] Defendant presents qualified counter expert witness testimony
regarding compliance of the countertops and indoor tables as meeting ADA
qualifications. [Declaration of Jason James.]
 
ADA compliance constitutes at
least part of a basis for determining the validity of an ADA claim. “Whether a
facility is ‘readily accessible’ is defined, in part, by the ADA Accessibility
Guidelines.” (Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc. (9th Cir. 2011)
631 F.3d 939, 945.) The court finds the declaration of expert witness Jason
James establishes ADA compliance for the indoor tables and dining and service
counter. [James Decl., sec. 7-8.] The declaration however lacks any conclusion
regarding ADA compliance for the outdoor tables. James offers an opinion as to
the suitability of said outdoor tables for a wheelchair bound customer, but the
court finds no meaningful discussion and actual comparison for the wheelchair
utilized by Plaintiff. [James Decl., sec. 7.]
 
“Under the ADA, when a disabled
person encounters an accessibility barrier violating its provisions, it is not
necessary for standing purposes that the barrier completely preclude the
plaintiff from entering or from using a facility in any way. [¶] Of course, a ‘barrier’
will only amount to such interference if it affects the plaintiff's full and
equal enjoyment of the facility on account of his particular disability.
Because the ADAAG establishes the technical standards required for ‘full and
equal enjoyment,’ if a barrier violating these standards relates to a
plaintiff's disability, it will impair the plaintiff's full and equal access,
which constitutes ‘discrimination’ under the ADA. ...” (Chapman v. Pier 1
Imports (U.S.) Inc., supra, 631 F.3d at p. 947.) At a minimum, the court
concludes a lack of valid evidence establishing outdoor ADA compliance for said
outside tables. 
 
Plaintiff proactively challenges any defense of equivalent
or greater access based on the outdoor table design interfering with use for
the particular wheelchair. (Kohler v. Flava Enterprises, Inc. (9th
Cir. 2015) 779 F.3d 1016, 1020; Kalani v. Starbucks Corporation (N.D.
Cal. 2015) 117 F.Supp.3d 1078, 1087, aff'd in part, vacated in part,
remanded sub nom. Kalani v. Starbucks Coffee Company (9th Cir.
2017) 698 Fed.Appx. 883, 887.) “Where the barrier
is related to the particular plaintiff's disability, however, an encounter with
the barrier necessarily injures the plaintiff by depriving him of full and
equal enjoyment of the facility.” (Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc.,
supra, 631 F.3d at p. 947 (footnote 4).) Plaintiff represents a
preference for outdoor seating, and no such compliant table was made available
on the date in question. [Lammey Decl.] Again, the James declaration lacks any
address of the particular wheelchair to the table design. The court therefore
finds no basis evidence for the determination of a reasonable equivalent,
thereby excusing the table. No such defense was raised in the answer and
therefore waived either way.
 
Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment/summary adjudication, Defendant challenges the validity of the action.
Specifically, Defendant contends Plaintiff suffered no damages as a result of
discriminatory conduct in that Plaintiff as not a person with a “bona fide
intent” to use the particular services or facilities. (White v. Square, Inc. (2019)
7 Cal.5th 1019, 1024-1025, 1027-1030; Thurston v. Omni Hotels Management
Corporation (2021) 69 Cal.App.5th 299, 306-307.) While the cited
authority involves online business entities and the determination of any intent
to transact business with the entities, such as making a hotel reservation or use
credit card processing services, Defendant relies on a challenge at least in
part based on the consistency of the allegations regarding the ice cream
purchase. 
 
Paragraph 26 of the verified
complaint alleges: “When sales and service counters are provided, they must
also be provided at compliant heights. However, it is not enough to simply have
a lowered counter; all the services available at the counter must be available
at compliant height. Here, no lowered counter was provided and the plaintiff
was unable to order his ice cream and interact with the employee at a compliant
counter. This caused difficulty, discomfort, and embarrassment to Plaintiff.”
Paragraph 40c continues: “Plaintiff was interested in this particular business
because he wanted to get ice cream, and he in fact did make a purchase despite
the added difficulties, though he was unable
to eat it at the restaurant. Plaintiff additionally sought to confirm that the
business was in compliance with applicable access laws.”
 
The court appreciates the
purpose of the challenge in order to support the position of no actual intent
to patronize the establishment. Notwithstanding the pleading gaffe, Plaintiff
in opposition produced a copy of a receipt from the establishment. [Declaration
of Dwain Lammey, Exibit List, Ex. 12.] Thus, the court assumes a transaction
occurred, and therefore no bar under the bona fide intent standard. 
 
Defendant also takes up the
issue regarding the lack of any requested accommodation that could have been
rectified with a request. (Skaff v. Meridien North America Beverly Hills,
LLC (9th Cir. 2007) 506 F.3d 832, 839-840.) The court finds a lack of
sufficient evidentiary and legal support for reliance on this position as a bar
to the validity of the claim for accessibility issues as to the outdoor tables.
The court also finds the discussion regarding preventive versus mandatory
injunctive relief in no way undermines the validity of the complaint and
subject motion. Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief [Comp., ¶ 60], but also seeks
actual and treble damages as well [Comp., ¶¶ 61-62].
 
In the final section of the
motion, Plaintiff asserts no valid affirmative defenses prevent a grant of the
motion. Following the conclusive denial of the defenses, and lack of any
response in opposition, the court finds an effective concession by Defendant on
the subject items.
 
Nevertheless, a successful
motion for summary judgment by a Plaintiff requires proof of all elements,
including damages. Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) The court lacks any
evidence required to establish a basis for the incurrence and determination of
any amount of monetary and treble damages, a form of injunctive relief, and
“statutory minimum” damages, as pled, thereby allowing entry of judgment. The
court therefore finds triable issues of material fact as to the issue for monetary
damages, treble damages, potential injunctive relief, and statutory minimum
damages claims as part of an otherwise established claim for denial of proper
access and use of the facilities. [Declaration of Marlan Cooper; Lammey Decl.,
James Decl.]
