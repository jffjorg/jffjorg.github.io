for Judgment on the Pleadings
·        
3rd
Cause of Action: Negligent Repair
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Donald Stephenson alleges a 2020 Mercedes-Benz GT63C4S vehicle suffers from certain
defects not repaired by Defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. On September 27, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a complaint for Violation of Song-Beverly Act—Breach of Express
Warranty of Merchantability, and Violation of the Song-Beverly Act—Breach of
Implied Warranty, and Negligent Repair. On June 21, 2023, FCA US LLC answered
the complaint.
 
RULING: Granted.
Request
for Judicial Notice: Granted in Part/Denied in Part.
·        
The
court takes judicial notice of the existence of the lawsuit in the subject
action, but not for the truth of any asserted matter. 
·        
The
court cannot take judicial notice of unpublished court orders from other trial
courts. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.1115(a); Rittiman v. Public Utilities Com. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 1018, 1043 (footnote 18).)
 
Defendant LAD-MD, LLC dba Mercedes-Benz of Los Angeles
(Mercedes) moves for judgment on the pleadings as to the third cause of action
for negligent repair on grounds of a bar under the economic loss rule.
Plaintiff Donald Stephenson in opposition counters that the motion relies on
extrinsic reference, and denies any bar under the economic loss rule under the
defective component standard. Plaintiff alternatively requests leave to amend. Defendant
in reply reiterates the economic loss rule and failure to plead any fraud
exception. Defendant also notes the lack of any specific damages allegations
against moving defendant.
 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings serves the
function of a demurrer, challenging only defects on the face of the complaint…
[¶] The grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings must appear on the
face of the complaint or from a matter of which the court may take judicial
notice.” (Richardson-Tunnell v. School
Ins. Program for Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1056, 1061.)
In considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, courts consider whether
the factual allegations, assumed true, are sufficient to constitute a cause of
action. (Fire Insurance Exchange v.
Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452-453.)
 
A
demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from
either the face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly
construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because
ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v.
Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules, where the
complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently apprising
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for uncertainty
should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.]
 
Mercedes contends the economic loss rule bars any claim for
tort liability given the warranty claim arises in contract. Mercedes also
preemptively challenges any opposition on grounds of the component part
exception. Finally, Mercedes contends Plaintiff lacks the elements for
negligent repair even if the economic loss rule were not applicable. 
 
Because the complaint arises from the purchase agreement
(e.g. a contract), the addition of the negligence cause of action requires
consideration of the economic loss rule. “The economic loss rule requires a purchaser to recover
in contract for purely economic loss due to disappointed expectations, unless
he can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise.” (Robinson
Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004)
34 Cal.4th 979, 988.) A party may
recover tort damages in a contract case, but the conduct supporting must arise
in fraud and the claim must be “either completely independent of the contract or arises from conduct which is
both intentional and intended to harm.” (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 552.) “Damages available under strict products liability do not include
economic loss, which includes ‘damages for inadequate value, costs of repair
and replacement of the defective product or consequent loss of profits—without
any claim of personal injury or damages to other property.’” (Jimenez v. Superior Court (2002) 29
Cal.4th 473, 482) (internal quotation marks omitted) “Jimenez.”) 
 
The Jimenez Court
addressed damage caused by a defective window to other parts of the home. The
court expressly rejected any expansion of the doctrine “We have no occasion
here to consider whether defective raw materials should be treated in the same
manner as component parts or whether there may be situations in which the
economic loss rule would bar recovery for damages that a defective component
part causes to other portions of the finished product of which it is a part. We
hold only that, under California decisional law, the economic loss rule does
not bar a homeowner's recovery in tort for damage that a defective window
causes to other parts of the home in which it has been installed.” (Id.
at p. 484.)
 
Again, the basis of the operative complaint arises in
contract. The lack of fraud allegations supports a finding for a bar under the
economic loss rule. Plaintiff relies on an unpublished district court opinion
for support of expansion to vehicles. The court declines to consider
unpublished authority. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
8.1115(a); Rittiman v. Public Utilities
Com. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 1018, 1043 (footnote
18).) The court otherwise finds no published authority expanded this
basis of liability, and the court assumes the instant action in no way
represents a novel first time issue. 
 
The Song-Beverly Act addresses the entire vehicle as a
defective item. The attempted warranty repairs of the vehicle itself
constitutes the basis of the claim. The court finds no legal support for this
position regardless of unpublished district court authority.
 
The court finds no basis for amendment in order to
successfully plead the claim around the bar. The motion for judgment on the
pleadings is therefore granted with prejudice/without leave to amend. (Mendoza
v. Continental Sales Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1402.)
