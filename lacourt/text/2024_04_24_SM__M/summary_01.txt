The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Windows N' Things Corp. (WNT), to the cross-complaint filed by Westland Contracting Inc. The court has overruled the demurrer and has ordered the defendant to file an answer within 20 days. The court has determined that the cross-complaint states a cause of action for declaratory relief based on equity and an implied contract term. The court has also determined that the allegations of the cross-complaint are sufficient to state a claim for indemnity.
