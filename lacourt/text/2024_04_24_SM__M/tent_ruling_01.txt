Legal
Standard
 
            A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (CCP §§
430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie
(1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading,
or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations omitted.)
 
            A
special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where
the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s
of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if
the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)

 
            “Liberality in permitting amendment
is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to
show in what manner plaintiff can amend the complaint,
and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the
pleading. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendant/Cross-Defendant Windows N’ Things Corp. (“WNT”) demurs to the
fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth and ninth causes of action of the
Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Westland Contracting Inc.
In response, Westland filed a request for dismissal as to the fourth, fifth,
seventh, and eighth causes of action. This leaves only the ninth cause of
action for declaratory relief re: duty to indemnify.
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 provides that a person may
bring an action for declaratory relief if he or she “desires a declaration of
his or her rights or duties with respect to another, or in respect to, in, over
or upon property . . ..” To
state a declaratory relief claim, the plaintiff must allege a proper subject of
declaratory relief and an actual controversy involving justiciable questions
relating to the party’s rights or obligations. (Jolley v. Chase Home
Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909.) 
 
In general, indemnity refers to “the
obligation resting on one party to make good a loss or damage another party has
incurred.” (Rossmoor Sanitation, Inc. v. Pylon, Inc. (1975) 13 Cal.3d
622, 628.) Historically, the obligation of indemnity took three forms: (1)
indemnity expressly provided for by contract (express indemnity); (2) indemnity
implied from a contract not specifically mentioning indemnity (implied
contractual indemnity); and (3) indemnity arising from the equities of
particular circumstances (traditional equitable indemnity). (Ibid.; see PPG
Industries, Inc. v. Transamerica Ins. Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 310, 318.)
Although the foregoing categories of indemnity were once regarded as distinct,
California courts now recognize only two basic types of indemnity: express
indemnity and equitable indemnity. (See Bay Development, Ltd. v. Superior
Court (1990) 50 Cal.3d 1012, 1029–1030, fn. 10.) Though not extinguished,
implied contractual indemnity is now viewed simply as “a form of equitable
indemnity.” (Id. at 1029; see E.L. White, Inc. v. City of Huntington
Beach (1978) 21 Cal.3d 497, 506–507.)  
 
The elements of a cause of action for
indemnity are: (1) a showing of fault on the part of the indemnitor and (2)
resulting damages to the indemnitee for which the indemnitor is contractually
or equitably responsible. (Great Western Drywall, Inc. v. Interstate Fire
& Gas Co. (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1041.) In order for the doctrine
of equitable indemnity to apply, there must be some basis for tort liability
against the proposed indemnitor, which generally is based on a duty owed to the
underlying plaintiff; although vicarious liability, strict liability, and
implied contractual indemnity between the indemnitor and the indemnitee can
provide a basis for equitable indemnity. (BFGC Architects Planners, Inc. v.
Forcum/Mackey Construction, Inc. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 848, 852 [equitable
indemnity “applies only among defendants who are jointly and severally liable
to the plaintiff.”].) Unless the prospective indemnitor and indemnitee are
jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff there is no basis for indemnity.
(Columbus Line Inc. v. Gray Line Sight-Seeing Companies Associated Inc.
(1981) 120 Cal.App.2d 622, 628.) 
 
Westland alleges a duty to indemnify against WNT regarding liability for
Plaintiff’s complaint, arising from both equity and contract. (CC ¶¶ 10-13;
15-18, 61-63.) “Under the indemnity agreement identified above and as contained
in the written contracts[], the Cross-Defendants… are obligated to indemnify
Cross-Complainant from all liability, loss, or damage in this action relating
to matters embraced by the indemnity and arising out of the scope of work of
the Cross-Defendants[.]” (CC ¶ 61.) A dispute has arisen and an actual
controversy now exists between Cross-Complainant and the Cross-Defendants.
Cross-Complainant contends that it is entitled to indemnity from the
Cross-Defendants and Cross-Defendants deny such entitlement. (CC ¶62.) 
 
The allegations state a cause of
action for declaratory relief based on equity and an implied contract term. “In general, if a complaint for declaratory relief alleges
the existence of an actual controversy . . . , the court should not sustain a
general demurrer on the theory that any declaration would necessarily be
adverse to the plaintiff.” (See Teachers Management & Investment Cop. v.
City of Santa Cruz (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 438, 449 [only where it is “clear that the
order sustaining the demurrer amounted to a correct decision on the legal
merits of the case, a reversal is not required instead, the appellate court may
simply modify the judgment so as to declare that plaintiff was entitled to no
relief”].) As the cross-complaint states a claim for implied contractual
indemnity, the Court cannot say that Plaintiff is entitled to a negative
declaration as a matter of law. (CC ¶¶14-18.) Further, because such a cause of
action is rooted in equity and implied terms, rather than express terms, it
would be difficult to apply the pleading standard for written contracts cited
by Cross-Defendants. Moreover, Cross-Complainants plead the legal effect of the
contract, and that is all that is required. (See Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG
Specialty Insurance Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-99 [“[i]n an action
based on a written contract, a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the
contract rather than its precise language”].)
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED.
