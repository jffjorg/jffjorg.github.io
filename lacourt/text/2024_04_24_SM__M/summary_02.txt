**Summary of Tentative Ruling**

The court has granted the Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to restrain the Defendant from certain actions and to grant the Plaintiff access to financial documents. The Plaintiff seeks to inspect the corporate records and gain access to financial documents, which the Defendant has withheld. The court finds that the Plaintiff is likely to prevail on the merits of the case and that the Defendant has not shown any grounds to deny the preliminary injunction. The court also finds that the Defendant has failed to provide access to multiple records regarding the Company's Visa, American Express, authorize.net, and stock accounts. The court orders the Defendant to provide access to these records and declares the rights and obligations of the parties surrounding the inspection of corporate records.
