And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the unopposed motion to compel responses. The motion is granted, and the defendant is required to serve code-compliant, verified responses within 10 court days. The Judge has awarded sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $860 per motion, payable within 30 days. The Judge has also vacated a prior sanctions order due to valid objections to form interrogatories. The Judge notes that the defendant's failure to appear at the previous hearing was not appropriate and warns that further failure to respond to discovery will not be tolerated. The Judge suggests that the defendant consider allowing a default or settling the case, and that the plaintiff revise its discovery process to avoid similar issues in the future.
