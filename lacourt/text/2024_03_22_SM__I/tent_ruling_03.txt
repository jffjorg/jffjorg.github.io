 Case Number:  23SMCV01463    Hearing Date:   March 22, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to compel responses is GRANTED.  Defendant has 10 court days to serve
code-compliant, verified responses without objection other than privilege.  Any documents called for will be produced at
that time.  The court has previously
warned defendant, who did not appear at the last hearing, that this sort of
behavior is not appropriate.  If
defendant does not want to litigate, defendant can allow a default or settle.  If defendant needs reasonable additional time
to respond to discovery when it is propounded, defendant can request it and, if
plaintiff unreasonably refuses, defendant can request protection from this
court.  But defendant cannot refuse to
respond at all until plaintiff has gone to the expense of bringing a motion and
the court has gone to the effort of analyzing it.  Sanctions are awarded in the amount of $860
per motion (inclusive of the filing fee) against defendant, payable within 30
days.
 
That said, the court has reviewed the responses to form
interrogatories.  The court notes that
there were objections, but the court also has some sympathy for the
defense.  This is a property
dispute.  Given that, the court has to
say that it understands defendant’s position that the term in the form
interrogatories “INCIDENT” makes little or no sense as applied to this case and
objections to that extent are SUSTAINED and ALLOWED.  Plaintiff would be well advised to have the
discovery pass through some sort of thought process before propounding it.  Because of those valid objections—which do
render the form interrogatories non-sensical—the prior sanctions order is
VACATED.  Any sanctions actually paid
will be returned.
