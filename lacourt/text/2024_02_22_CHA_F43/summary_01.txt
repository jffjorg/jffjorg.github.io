And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiffs' request for punitive damages and attorney fees. The judge found that the plaintiffs' complaint does not adequately support their claims for punitive damages, as it only alleges negligence and does not provide clear and convincing evidence of malice or fraud. Additionally, the judge ruled that the plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney fees, as there is no contract, statute, or law that authorizes such recovery. The judge gives the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint and requires the defendant to provide notice to all parties.
