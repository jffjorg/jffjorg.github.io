TENTATIVE
RULING
            
            Plaintiff
Debbie Paperman’s Motion to Tax Costs is DENIED. Court reporter costs are
generally viewed as reasonable costs and additionally Court Reporter costs as
established by statute are specifically included in CCP § 1033.5(a)(11).
 
Under CCP § 1033.5(c), costs must
be “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation” and “reasonable in amount.” (Code
Civ. Proc § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2), (3).) “The determination of the necessity and
reasonableness of a particular expense was within the broad discretion of the
court.” (Perko's Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 238, 243.) “The trial court's exercise of discretion in granting or
denying a motion to tax costs will not be disturbed if substantial evidence
supports its decision. [citation] Whether a cost is reasonable presents a
question of fact for the trial court.” (Lubetzky v. Friedman (1991) 228
Cal.App.3d 35, 39, modified (Mar. 19, 1991).)
 
Plaintiff Debbie Paperman
(“Paperman”) argues that Defendants Sean Besser and Samantha Besser’s (“Besser
Defendants”) cost of $1,649.00 for the hiring of an allegedly “unnecessary”
court reporter, and failure to contract the Paperman ahead of the hearing to
confirm court reporter’s necessity. (Motion, pp. 4–5.) Paperman provides no
authority for the specific taxing of the court reporter’s expenses, nor for the
requirement that the Besser Defendants contact Paperman prior to the hiring of
the court reporter. 
 
Furthermore, the Court finds that
the hiring of a court reporter is reasonable in light of the circumstances
within this specific litigation. Additionally, court reporter fees are
generally viewed as reasonable, and CCP § 1033.5(c)(11) includes “’court
reporter fees as established by statute’ among the items allowable as costs.” (Chaaban
v. Wet Seal, Inc. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 49, 58, citing Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5, subd. (c)(11).) 
 
Paperman’s Motion to Tax Costs is
DENIED.
