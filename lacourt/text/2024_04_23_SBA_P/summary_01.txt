Summary:

The judge denied Godlewski's anti-SLAPP motion, holding that Godlewski failed to establish that Plaintiff's intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action arises from protected conduct under California Code of Civil Procedure §425.16(e)(3). The court found that Godlewski's statements were not made in connection with a matter of public interest, and that his statements about Plaintiff's moral character were not statements that could directly affect a large number of people beyond the direct participants. The court held that Godlewski's assertions of protected conduct were not supported by the evidence and that the dispute was not a matter of public interest.
