And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Ian Armstrong, filed a complaint against Murchison & Cumming, LLP (Defendant) for fraud and breach of contract. The defendant demurred to the complaint on two main grounds: (1) the complaint fails to set forth sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action, and (2) the litigation privilege bars the plaintiff's causes of action. The court agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer. The court finds that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for fraud and breach of contract. The court also finds that the litigation privilege bars the plaintiff's claims against the defendant. The court denies the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint.
