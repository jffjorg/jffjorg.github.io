 Case Number:  23TRCV04104    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  P Moving Parties: Defendant George CashmanResponding Party: Plaintiff Rolling Hills Community Association of Rancho Palos VerdesMOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONSRULINGThe Court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers. George Cashman Jr.’s Motion to Quash the Service of the Summons and Complaint is DENIED.BACKGROUNDOn December 11, 2023, the Rolling Hills Community Association of Rancho Palos Verdes (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint alleging three causes of action against George Cashman Jr. (Cashman/Defendant), Cynthia C. Makin, and the GFC Administrative Trust. The Complaint stemmed from an alleged breach of the “Declaration No. 150 of Establishment of Basic ProtectiveRestrictions, Conditions, Covenants, Reservations, Liens, Charges and Certain Local Restrictions” (CCRs), when Plaintiff discovered that a fence extends beyond Plaintiff’s permitted easement in violation of the CCRs.The motion before the Court is Cashman’s Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint (the Motion). Plaintiff opposes the Motion, and Cashman files a reply.DISCUSSIONLegal StandardCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure Sections 415.10, 415.20, 415.30, and 415.50 describe four methods of service within California: (1) personal delivery of copy of summons and complaint to person to be served; (2) delivery of a copy of summons and complaint to someone else at defendant’s usual residence or place of business; (3) service by mail coupled with acknowledgment of receipt of summons; and (4) service by publication.Complainants have the initial burden to evidence valid statutory service of a summons and complaint. (Dill v. Berquist Const. Co., Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439-40; Floveyor Internat. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 59 Cal. App. 4th 789, 794. Court findings as to conflicting proof regarding whether a summons and complaint were properly served are upheld if based upon substantial evidence. (Stafford v. Mach (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.)A trial court has discretion as to whether to accept a process server declaration, or contradictory evidence, in deciding whether service of a summons and complaint was validly accomplished. (Am. Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal. App. 4th 383, 390; Khourie, Crew & Jaeger v. Sabek, Inc. (1990) 220 Cal. App. 3d 1009, 1014) (“Sabek points out that it introduced evidence, in the form of declarations, that tend to contradict the declaration of Murray Woods…. The trial court, however, was entitled to believe Woods [the process server].”). “‘[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction.’” (Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544. Accord Renoir v. Redstar Corp. (2004) 123 Cal. App. 4th 1145, 1152.) A filed proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that service was proper, if it complies with applicable statutory requirements. (Floveyor Internat. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 59 Cal. App. 4th 789, 795.)AnalysisCashman alleges in his moving papers that only one attempt at service has been made, when the process server – Gabriele Melendez (Melendez) – attempted to serve Cashman at his residence located at 2 Crest Road East Rolling Hills, California 90274 on January 9, 2024. (Declaration of George Cashman, hereinafter, Cashman Decl., Exh. 1.) In that one attempt, Cashman alleges that Melendez left the papers with a security guard, who does not live at the residence, and that therefore service was improper pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 415.20(b). Cashman is correct. Although stopping by his residence is a valid attempt, this alone is improper service.However, Plaintiff alleges in their opposition papers that they have made prior attempts. On December 16, 2023, a separate process server – Scott Amundson (Amundson) – attempted to serve Cashman at a 28985 Palos Verdes Dr. E., Rancho Palos Verde, CA 90275, however, it appeared that Cashman did not reside there, and was therefore the incorrect address, which would not constitute a proper attempt. (Declaration of Scott Amundson, hereinafter Amundson Decl., ¶ 4-7.) Another attempt was made to serve Cashman in person on December 29, 2023 when Amundson traveled to Stanley Mosk Courthouse and attempted to serve Cashman while Cashman was appearing for a separate legal matter. (Id. ¶ 9.) Amundson states that he attempted to serve Cashman who “identified himself as George Cashman to me and immediately turned around and ran down the hallway.” Although service was not completed, this equates to a valid first attempt. This unsuccessful attempt, in combination with Melendez’s later unsuccessful attempt at Cashman’s residence, falls squarely within the definition of due diligence as defined by Espindola v. Nunez (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1389, 1392 (Espindola), the case Cashman cites in arguing that the sole attempt by Melendez was insufficient.Espindola held that “Ordinarily, ... two or three attempts at personal service at a proper place should fully satisfy the requirement of reasonable diligence and allow substituted service to be made.” Here, the Court finds two attempts of personal service at a proper place, the first at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse on December 29, 2023, and the second, at Cashman’s residence. Although Cashman’s opposition papers are silent as to the attempt at the Courthouse, the Court finds this a sufficient attempt. Melendez’s January 9, 2024 attempt at the Cashman’s residence was also proper. Accordingly, after these two attempts failed, Melendez then mailed the summons and complaint to Cashman’s residence, leaving Plaintiff in full compliance with Espindola, and Code Civ. Proc. §§ 415.10 & 415.20.CONCLUSIONTherefore, the George Cashman Jr.’s Motion to Quash the Service of the Summons and Complaint is DENIED.Prevailing party on motion is ordered to give notice of ruling.
