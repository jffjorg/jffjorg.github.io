And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers in George Cashman Jr.'s Motion to Quash the Service of the Summons and Complaint. The Court found that the plaintiff, Rolling Hills Community Association of Rancho Palos Verdes, had made multiple attempts to serve the defendant, including two attempts at personal service at a proper place. The defendant argued that only one attempt at service has been made, which is insufficient. However, the Court found that the plaintiff's attempts at service, including an unsuccessful attempt at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse and a subsequent attempt at the defendant's residence, demonstrate reasonable diligence and compliance with the statutory procedures for service of process. Therefore, the Court denied the defendant's motion to quash the service of the summons and complaint.
