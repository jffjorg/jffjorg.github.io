Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for trial preference under CCP §36(a). The plaintiff, Pamela Bazargan, is 74 years old and argues that her health may deteriorate in the future due to hypertension and discomfort from a fall she experienced in June 2023. The judge finds that the plaintiff's medical records from June 2023 do not provide sufficient evidence to justify trial preference. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's controlled hypertension and discomfort from the fall are insufficient to establish prejudice if trial preference is not granted.
