And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained, with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Greg Luna, had failed to attach charging allegations to his complaint, which alleges breach of contract. The complaint used a judicial council form, but it did not include the necessary elements to plead the elements of breach of contract. The judge finds the pleading defects persuasive and grants the defendant 20 days to file an amended complaint using the correct form.
