Luna v Fleischaker
[TENTATIVE]
ORDER:  Defendant Joseph Fleischaker’s
Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND.  
Introduction

Defendant
Joseph Fleischaker (Defendant) demurred to Plaintiff Greg Luna’s (Plaintiff)
Complaint.  The demurrer placed into
issue the sole cause of action (COA) for breach of contract.  Plaintiff’s opposition was due September 29,
2023.  Plaintiff did not file an
opposition.
Discussion  
Plaintiff
used the judicial council form to allege contract claims.  However, the Complaint failed to attach the
form that included the charging allegations to plead the elements for breach of
contract – contract, Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff’s performance or excuse,
Plaintiff’s damages  (i.e., Judicial
Council Form PLD-C-001(1).)  Because
Plaintiff failed to attach the charging allegations, there was no allegation as
to whether the contract at issue was written, oral, or implied in fact.  The pleading defects raised in the demurrer
are persuasive.
The
demurrer to the first COA is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.  Mr. Luna has 20 days to file an amended
complaint using form PLD-C-001.
IT IS SO
ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
