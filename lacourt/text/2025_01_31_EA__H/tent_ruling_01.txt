  Case Number:  22PSCV00679    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2025    Dept:  H Rodriguez, et al. v.
Ramirez,
Case No. 22PSCV00679
 
ORDER ON
DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION 
Plaintiffs
Rosalinda Rodriguez’s and Leslie Perez’s Application for Default Judgment is
DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
Plaintiffs Rosalinda Rodriguez
and Leslie Perez (“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:

          Plaintiffs
have been tenants at the property located at 1398 S. Gibbs, Pomona, CA 91766
(“subject property”) since on or about August 1, 2016. Defendant Emelia Ramirez
(“Ramirez”) was responsible for managing and maintaining the subject property,
but maintained same in a substandard condition and failed to make repairs,
despite Plaintiffs’ complaints. Plaintiffs were forced to move out of the
subject property. 
On July 6, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Ramirez and Does 1-50
for:
1.       Failure to Provide Habitable Dwelling,
2.       Breach of Covenant and Right to Quiet
Enjoyment, 
3.       Private Nuisance, and
4.       Negligence. 
On August 25, 2022, Ramirez’s
default was entered. 
Pending before the Court is
Plaintiffs’ Application for Default Judgment. 
Discussion 
Plaintiff’s Application for
Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted: 
          1.       Plaintiffs’ complaint states only that
Plaintiffs’ damages are “in excess of $25,000.00.” (Complaint, ¶ 39; see also,
¶ 46 [“Plaintiffs have suffered actual damages . . . in an amount to be
determined at trial but in any event [sic] $25,000.00 or over”] and ¶ 55
[“Plaintiffs have suffered damages . . . in an amount to be proved at trial are
[sic] $25,000.00 and over”].) Plaintiffs, however, seek damages of $75,000.00
via this instant default prove-up application. “[I]n all default judgments the
demand sets a ceiling on recovery.” (Greenup
v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 824; Code Civ. Proc. § 580, subd. (a) [“The
relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that
demanded in the complaint, in the statement required by Section 425.11, or in
the statement provided for by Section 425.115 . . .”].) 
          2.       Plaintiffs have not utilized the most
current form of Judicial Council Form CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023]. 
          3.       Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Judicial
Council Form CIV-100 (i.e., pertaining to the Memorandum of Costs and
Declaration of nonmilitary status) filed by Plaintiffs on December 5, 2024 are
incomplete.
          4.       Plaintiffs fail to attach any documentary
evidence to their respective declarations in support of their
claims, including but not limited to, a copy of the underlying lease agreement,
text messages, video recording(s), inspection report(s) and pictures, as
referenced in ¶¶ 5-8 of their respective declarations. Plaintiffs’ counsel
Khalil Ahmad (“Ahmad”) purports to attach such evidence to his declaration;
however, it does not appear to the Court that Ahmad has personal knowledge of
Exhibits A-D such that Ahmad can authenticate them.
          5.       Exhibit A to Ahmad’s declaration is of
poor quality. The Court requests that a more legible copy be provided.
          6.       The only date identified on the text
messages (Exhibit B) is “Tue, Sep 21”; no year is provided. Also, the identity
of the persons communicating on the text string is unclear.
          7.       It is unclear when the pictures (Exhibit
C) were taken and by whom.
          8.       Plaintiffs’ respective declarations
continue to be devoid of facts as to when they notified Ramirez of purportedly
defective conditions at the subject property, what these defective conditions
were, whether Ramirez was given a reasonable time to correct the deficiencies,
and what damages Plaintiffs sustained. It is unclear to the Court how
Plaintiffs’ damages have been calculated. It is also unclear when Plaintiffs
moved out of the subject property.
Accordingly, the Court denies
the application for default judgment and directs Plaintiffs to submit a revised
and complete default judgment application that addresses the aforementioned
issues.
