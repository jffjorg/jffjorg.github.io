And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' Application for Default Judgment. The court has denied the application without prejudice, citing several defects in the Plaintiffs' submission. Specifically, the court noted that the Plaintiffs' complaint only claimed damages of $25,000.00, but they are seeking $75,000.00 in this default judgment application. The court also pointed out that the Plaintiffs failed to attach documentary evidence to support their claims, including a copy of the underlying lease agreement and inspection reports. Additionally, the court noted that the exhibits attached to the Plaintiffs' declarations were of poor quality and lacked necessary information. The court has directed the Plaintiffs to submit a revised and complete default judgment application that addresses these issues.
