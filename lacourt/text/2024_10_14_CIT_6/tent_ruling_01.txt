BACKGROUND 
This is a medical malpractice action. On April 12, 2024, plaintiff
Maria Munguia aka Nena Munguia (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants
St. Jude Heritage Medical Group (St. Jude), Thomas Clayton Hughes, M.D.
(Hughes), Eric Joo-Hyung Lee, M.D. (Lee), Yoko Takashima Bean, M.D. (Bean)
(collectively, Defendants), alleging the sole cause of action for medical
negligence. On August 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint (FAC), alleging the same cause of action against the same Defendants.
On September 9, 2024, Hughes answered the FAC. 
On September 12, 2024, Lee and Bean (collectively, Moving Parties)
demurred to the FAC. On October 1, 2024, Plaintiff opposed the demurrer. On
October 7, 2024, Moving Parties replied. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
              A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of
other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or
content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 (Donabedian).) It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the
complaint are assumed to be true. (Id. at pp. 993-994.) 
A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,
supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].) 
A
demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete
or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of
the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are
incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s
Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as
surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits”].) 
A
demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire pleading, cause of
action, or affirmative defense. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd.
(a); Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong
v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency
(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046-1047.)  
DISCUSSION 
Meet and Confer 
Per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), Moving
Parties were required to meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference before bringing this demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The Court finds Moving Parties’ efforts to meet and confer sufficient.
(Lee Decl., ¶ 4.) 
First Cause of Action – Medical Negligence 
To state a cause of action for medical negligence,
the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating, “’(1) the duty of the
professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of his
profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach
of that duty; (3) a proximate
causal connection
between the negligent conduct
and the resulting injury;
and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the professional's negligence.’
[Citation.]” (Belfiore-Braman v. Rotenberg (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 234,
238.) 
“In an action for injury or death against a health
care provider based upon such person's alleged professional negligence, the
time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of
injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of
reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs
first. In no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed three
years unless tolled for any of the following: (1) upon proof of fraud, (2)
intentional concealment, or (3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no
therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of the injured
person.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.5, subd. (a).) 
“One of the primary functions of the demurrer is to
filter out actions which lack substantial basis without the time and labor of
trial. Where the complaint discloses that the statute of limitations bars the
action, the general demurrer has long been held an appropriate means to assert
such a facial defect. [Citations.]” (Saliter v. Pierce Bros. Mortuaries
(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 292, 300.) “While a demurrer based on statute of
limitations lies where the dates in question are shown on the face of the
complaint, if those dates are missing, there is no ground for a general
demurrer. [Citations.]” (United W. Med. Centers v. Superior Ct. (1996)
42 Cal.App.4th 500, 505, italics added.) 
Moving Parties demur to the First Cause of Action for
medical negligence on the grounds that it fails to state a cause of action
because it is barred by the statute of limitations. Moving Parties contend
Plaintiff was on inquiry notice by March 13, 2023, when she had surgery for
cancer and became aware that she had cancer possibly due to the alleged
failures of Moving Parties and other physicians to diagnose Plaintiff’s cancer,
but Plaintiff did not file this action until more than one year later on April
12, 2024. Moving Parties contend that Plaintiff’s claim she did not discover
the results from the June 4, 2021 ultrasound until May 16, 2023, does not reset
the statute of limitations. Moving Parties contend that before May 16, 2023,
Plaintiff underwent multiple surgeries and had been diagnosed with cancer, so
she knew she had cancer by that time. Moving Parties contend it is implausible
Plaintiff would not have been aware given the pathology report from January 25,
2023, which revealed cancer in Plaintiff’s right ovary, the same ovary which
had been visualized during the earlier ultrasound. 
Moving Parties also contend that Plaintiff continued
to receive treatment at St. Jude following the June 4, 2021 ultrasound, so she
had multiple opportunities to inquire, especially during the period between
January 25, 2023 and May 13, 2023, in which Plaintiff received treatments.
Moving Parties contend it is unreasonable that information regarding the prior
ultrasound test results would not have been communicated to Plaintiff during
this time period. Moving Parties also contend that the FAC only alleges having
served the notice of intent to commence action under Code of Civil Procedure
section 364 on St. Jude, and that there is no allegation of the notice of
intent having been served on Moving Parties. 
In opposition, Plaintiff contends her claim is timely
and subject to the delayed discovery rule. Plaintiff contends that the FAC
alleges Plaintiff did not know the results of her June 4, 2021 ultrasound until
speaking with her primary care physician on May 16, 2023, and therefore did not
suspect any wrongdoing regarding before then. Plaintiff contends she had no
reason to suspect Moving Parties were at fault until she learned about a test
result that her cancer may have developed two years earlier and that a
diagnostic test two years early may have showed the cancer. Plaintiff also
contends merely learning of the cancer diagnosis is insufficient to put her on
notice of her doctors’ negligence. Plaintiff further contends the demurrer
improperly assumes Plaintiff was aware that her right ovary was visualized in
the June 4, 2021 ultrasound, and that a healthcare provider informed her of her
ultrasound report before her May 16, 2023 appointment. 
The Court does not find the FAC alleges facts clearly
demonstrating Plaintiff’s claim is time-barred. Whether a cause of action is
barred by the statute of limitations is usually a question of fact, which is generally
not suitable for demurrer. (Carloss v. Cnty. of Alameda
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 116, 123; M.F. v. Pac. Pearl Hotel Mgmt.
LLC (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 693, 703.) The FAC alleges that
Plaintiff learned of her cancer diagnosis on January 25, 2023. (FAC, ¶ 15.) The
FAC then alleges Plaintiff underwent surgery for her cancer on March 13, 2024,
and that she subsequently received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. (FAC, ¶
16.) The Court agrees with Plaintiff that merely being diagnosed with cancer
and undergoing surgery by themselves do not clearly show that Plaintiff knew or
had reason to suspect Moving Parties’ alleged failures with respect to the June
4, 2021 ultrasound. The clearest demonstration of Plaintiff’s discovery of these
alleged failures is when Plaintiff’s primary care physician purportedly advised
her on May 16, 2023, of the results of her June 4, 2021 ultrasound, which showed
an ovarian cyst. (FAC, ¶ 17.) 
 The Court also
agrees with Plaintiff that Moving Parties are improperly assuming Plaintiff
must have talked with other physicians at St. Jude during the period in
question that would have apprised her of Moving Parties’ purported negligence,
as there is nothing in the FAC alleging any facts to support that inference. (See
FAC, ¶¶ 8-19; Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39
Cal.3d at p. 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994;
see also Code Civ. Proc., § 452 [“In the construction of a pleading, for
the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally
construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”]) Additionally,
regarding service of the notice of intent to commence action per Code of Civil
Procedure section 364, Moving Parties did not cite any authority, nor is the
Court aware of any authority, that requires the complaint to allege such compliance.
Thus, whether Plaintiff alleged compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section
364 as it pertains to Moving Parties is ultimately not dispositive for purposes
of this demurrer. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the
demurrer.      
CONCLUSION 
The Court OVERRULES the demurrer of Defendants Eric Joo-Hyung Lee,
M.D. and Yoko Takashima Bean to Plaintiff Maria Mungia’s First Amended
Complaint. Defendants Eric Joo-Hyung Lee, M.D. and Yoko Takashima Bean must
file an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 20 days of the Court’s
order. 
              Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
