Summary:

The court issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendants Eric Joo-Hyung Lee, M.D. and Yoko Takashima Bean to plaintiff Maria Munguia's First Amended Complaint. The demurrer was based on the argument that the plaintiff's claim is time-barred by the statute of limitations. However, the court found that the First Amended Complaint alleges facts that demonstrate the plaintiff's claim is not time-barred. The court overruled the demurrer and ordered the defendants to file an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 20 days of the order.
