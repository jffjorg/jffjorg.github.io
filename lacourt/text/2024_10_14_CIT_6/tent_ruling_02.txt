 Case Number:  24PSCV02518    Hearing Date:   October 14, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Armen  Sarafian v. Pomona Community Health Center, et al.  Defendants  Pomona Community Health Center dba Parktree Community Health and Ranjit  Theofile Shenoy, M.D.’s Motion to Stay Proceedings, or in the Alternative,  Extension to File Responsive Pleading  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court DENIES the motion of Defendants Pomona Community Health  Center dba Parktree Community Health and Ranjit Theofile Shenoy, M.D. to stay  proceedings, or in the alternative, extension to file responsive pleading,  without prejudice.                Defendants are ordered to give  notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a medical malpractice action. On August 5, 2024, plaintiff  Armen Sarafian (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Pomona  Community Health Center dba Parktree Community Health[1] (Hospital), Ranjit Theofile Shenoy, M.D. (Doctor) (collectively, Defendants)  and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for medical malpractice and  intentional infliction of emotional distress.  On September 13, 2024, Defendants moved to stay this action. The  motion is unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD  A  party can ask the court to stay an action  or proceeding based on the court's  inherent power to stay in the interest of  justice and to promote judicial efficiency. (See Cal. Const., art. VI, § 1;  Code Civ. Proc., § 128; Adams v. Paul (1995) 11 Cal.4th 583, 593; Smith  v. Jones (1900) 128 Cal. 14, 15; Koch-Ash v. Superior Ct. (1986) 180  Cal.App.3d 689, 696; see also Walker v. Superior Ct. (1991) 53 Cal.3d  257, 266-267.)   DISCUSSION  The Court notes that Defendants’ motion was electronically served  on Plaintiff, who is a self-represented litigant. (Motion, pp. 10-11 of pdf.)  Self-represented litigants must be served by non-electronic means unless they  affirmatively consent to receiving documents electronically. (First Amended  General Order, ¶ 3; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.253, subd. (b)(3); Code Civ.  Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (c).) There is nothing in the Court’s file to indicate  that Plaintiff has affirmatively consented to receiving service electronically.  Moreover, the motion includes the wrong address for the Court, which is located  at 1427 West Covina Parkway, West Covina, CA 91790, not at the address in Pomona. Further, given Plaintiff’s lack of  opposition to Defendants’ motion, it appears to the Court that Plaintiff did  not receive service of this motion.  Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the motion without  prejudice.  CONCLUSION  The Court DENIES the motion of Defendants Pomona Community Health  Center dba Parktree Community Health and Ranjit Theofile Shenoy, M.D. to stay  proceedings, or in the alternative, extension to file responsive pleading,  without prejudice.                Defendants are ordered to give  notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
