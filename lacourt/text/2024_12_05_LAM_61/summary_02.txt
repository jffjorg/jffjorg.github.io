And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Cong Chi Bui's motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against him. The Court finds that Defendant lacked actual notice of the action due to a flawed service of summons. Defendant claims that he was not personally served at the address on Hensel Street in Baldwin Park on June 26, 2022, and that he did not learn of the action until he consulted his attorney on September 4, 2024. The Court finds that Defendant's showing is more persuasive than Plaintiff's showing, which relies on another lawsuit for unlawful detainer filed against occupants of the property. The Court grants the motion and orders Defendant to file his proposed answer within 30 days.
