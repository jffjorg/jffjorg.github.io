And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Pinnacle Limousines Manufacturing, Inc. (Pinnacle) to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by Paul Bohn and Limo World, LLC (Plaintiffs). The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the SAC does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.

The court has determined that the contract alleged in the SAC is an oral contract, not a written contract. The invoices provided by Pinnacle do not constitute a written contract because they lack relevant terms, such as the completion date of the conversions, and do not bear the signatures of either party.

Additionally, the court has found that the work done by Pinnacle was for services, not the sale of goods. Therefore, the court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the 3rd cause of action for breach of written contract.

The court has also sustained the demurrer as to the 1st and 2nd causes of action for breach of express and implied warranties, respectively, because the work was for services, not goods, and therefore, no warranty applies.

The court has given leave to amend the SAC to address the deficiencies noted in the ruling.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Pinnacle Limousines Manufacturing, Inc. (Pinnacle) to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by Paul Bohn and Limo World, LLC (Plaintiffs). The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the 3rd cause of action (COA) for breach of written contract and the 1st and 2nd COAs for breach of express and implied warranties, respectively.

The court has determined that the invoices provided by Pinnacle do not constitute a written contract because they do not contain the essential terms of the agreement, such as the completion date of the conversions, and are not signed by either party. The court has also determined that the alleged contract is for services, not goods, and therefore, Plaintiffs are not entitled to rely on warranties.

The court has dismissed the first two COAs for breach of express and implied warranties, respectively, and has given Plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to restate their claims.

    - "DEMURRER OF DEFENDANT PINNACLE LIMOUSINES MANUFACTURING, INC. TO THE SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT OF PAUL BOHN AND LIMO WORLD, LLC is SUSTAINED in its entirety, with leave to amend"

english:
The tentative ruling by the Judge in case number 22PSCV0796, set for hearing on October 3, 2023 in department O, sustains the demurrer of defendant Pinnacle Limousines Manufacturing, Inc. to the second amended complaint of plaintiffs Paul Bohn and Limo World, LLC. The ruling is made based on the pleadings and judicially noticeable matters, and the defendant's demurrer is asserted on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the pleading is uncertain. The ruling is sustained with leave to amend.

The case is a contracts case involving plaintiffs Paul Bohn and Limo World, LLC, and defendant Pinnacle Limousines Manufacturing, Inc., as well as individual defendant Franklin Figueroa. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants breached express warranty agreements for the conversion of a Corvette and a Chevrolet Camaro into limo conversions. The conversions had numerous defects, and despite the plaintiffs notifying the defendants of the defects covered by the warranty, the defendants have not repaired the vehicles. The plaintiffs claim to be damaged in the amount of $182,776.90.

The defendant filed a demurrer with a motion to strike, and the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint, which was followed by a second amended complaint alleging five causes of action for breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, breach of written contract, violation of California Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., and violation of California Business and Professions Code section 12500 et seq. The defendant filed the instant demurrer, and the plaintiffs filed an opposition.

The court finds that the defendant's demurrer to the first through third causes of action is sustained. The defendant demurs to the first and second causes of action for breach of express warranty and breach of implied warranty on two grounds: (i) the contract was for services, not goods, and (ii) if the court determines that the contract was for a sale of goods, the contract is barred by the statute of limitations. The defendant demurs to the third cause of action for breach of contract on the grounds that it fails to set forth essential facts with reasonable precision and particularity.

The court finds that the invoices provided by the defendant do not constitute a written contract as they do not bear the signatures of either party, do not identify the parties in the contract, and do not bear certain material terms such as the completion date of the two conversions. The court also finds that the contract was for services, not goods, and that the allegations are uncertain or ambiguous. The court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend.
