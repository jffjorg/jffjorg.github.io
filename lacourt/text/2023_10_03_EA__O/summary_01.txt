And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Pinnacle Limousines Manufacturing, Inc. (Pinnacle) to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by Paul Bohn and Limo World, LLC (Plaintiffs). The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the SAC does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.

The court has determined that the contract alleged in the SAC is an oral contract, not a written contract. The invoices provided by Pinnacle do not constitute a written contract because they lack relevant terms, such as the completion date of the conversions, and do not bear the signatures of either party.

Additionally, the court has found that the work done by Pinnacle was for services, not the sale of goods. Therefore, the court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the 3rd cause of action for breach of written contract.

The court has also sustained the demurrer as to the 1st and 2nd causes of action for breach of express and implied warranties, respectively, because the work was for services, not goods, and therefore, no warranty applies.

The court has given leave to amend the SAC to address the deficiencies noted in the ruling.
