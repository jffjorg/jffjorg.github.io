And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses General Motors LLC's demurrer and motion to strike the original complaint. Since the plaintiff filed an amended complaint after the demurrer, both the demurrer and motion to strike are moot. The judge notes that the plaintiff's law firm, Quill & Arrow, LLP, has a pattern of filing amended complaints after defendants file demurrers, which suggests that certain arguments may be meritorious. The judge also criticizes the firm for not engaging in meaningful meet and confer efforts, which circumvents the rule of legal ethics requiring candor between counsel. The judge concludes that the demurrer and motion to strike are moot and warns that future motions will be scrutinized for good faith discussions between counsel.

## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a case involving a lemon law claim brought by Plaintiff against GENERAL MOTORS LLC (GM). The Judge finds the demurrer and motion to strike filed by GM to be moot because Plaintiff filed an amended complaint (FAC) after the initial filing.

However, the Judge takes the opportunity to comment on a concerning pattern observed with Plaintiff's law firm, Quill & Arrow, LLP. The firm regularly files amended complaints after GM files a demurrer, even after stating during meet and confer discussions that GM's arguments lack merit. 

This behavior suggests that the firm may be tactically amending the complaint in response to valid legal arguments raised by GM, rather than engaging in genuine good-faith discussions. The Judge expresses concern about this practice, highlighting the importance of candor between counsel as a fundamental tenet of legal ethics. 

The Judge concludes that while the demurrer and motion to strike are moot, they will be scrutinizing future motions filed by Plaintiff's firm to ensure that good faith discussions have taken place before resorting to filing motions with the court.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a lemon law case between Plaintiff and Defendant General Motors LLC. The judge has determined that General Motors' demurrer and motion to strike are moot because the Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC) after the demurrer, which now serves as the operative complaint.

The judge also comments on a pattern exhibited by Plaintiff's law firm, Quill & Arrow, LLP, of filing amended complaints after Defendant files a demurrer. The judge notes that this pattern appears to circumvent the rule of legal ethics requiring candor between counsel.

The judge suggests that in the future, the court will consider whether good faith discussions were met based on the declarations and supporting documents filed in support of any future motions.

English Summary:
The tentative ruling is for case number 23PSCV01130, scheduled for hearing on October 3, 2023, in department O. The ruling declares General Motors LLC's demurrer and motion to strike as moot, considering the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (FAC) after the demurrer. The court finds it necessary to comment on a pattern observed in recent cases where the plaintiff's law firm, Quill & Arrow, LLP, files amended complaints after General Motors files a demurrer. Although a party may file an amended complaint before the court's hearing on the demurrer, Plaintiff's firm appears to do so despite attesting that Defendant's arguments lack merit, suggesting that certain arguments are meritorious. The court highlights the need for reasonable and good-faith attempts at informal resolution and expresses concern about Plaintiff's firm's lack of engagement in meaningful discussions with GM's counsel. In conclusion, the court will ascertain whether good faith discussions were met in future motions filed with this court.
