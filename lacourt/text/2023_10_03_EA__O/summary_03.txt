And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses General Motors LLC's demurrer and motion to strike the original complaint. Since the plaintiff filed an amended complaint after the demurrer, both the demurrer and motion to strike are moot. The judge notes that the plaintiff's law firm, Quill & Arrow, LLP, has a pattern of filing amended complaints after defendants file demurrers, which suggests that certain arguments may be meritorious. The judge also criticizes the firm for not engaging in meaningful meet and confer efforts, which circumvents the rule of legal ethics requiring candor between counsel. The judge concludes that the demurrer and motion to strike are moot and warns that future motions will be scrutinized for good faith discussions between counsel.
