[1] Plaintiffs seek
judicial notice of the invoices pertaining the Corvette, which were
inadvertently omitted from the SAC. (See also Demurrer pp. 8-9 [arguing
inconsistent facts because Corvette invoice(s) not attached]. The court DENIES
the request for judicial notice because the invoices are not records of this
court. That said, as the court is unpersuaded that that the lack of the
Corvette invoice amounts to inconsistent factual allegations, the failure to
attach the invoices to the SAC was inapposite for purposes of this demurrer. Plaintiff
may use its opportunity for leave to amend to submit the Corvette invoices with
their third amended complaint.  
 


[2] As the parties
mainly focus on the invoice and not the warranty, the court’s analysis will
focus on whether the invoices are the written contract. 
 


[3] See Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title
Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38-39 [“The
courts of this state have ... long since departed from holding a plaintiff
strictly to the ‘form of action’ he has pleaded and instead have adopted a more
flexible approach of examining the facts alleged to determine if a demurrer
should be sustained.”]; see also Navarrete v. Meyer (2015) 237
Cal.App.4th 1276, 1283 [“We ignore erroneous or confusing labels in the pleading and
look to its gravamen to determine what cause of action is
stated.”].)
 


[4] Kreuzberger was
cited in India Paint. 
 


[5] Defendant also
argues that absent transfer of title, the sale is for services, not goods. 


[6] As
both parties dispute whether the UCC or common law applies, the court directs both parties
to the predominant purpose test as it would best resolve the issue. (See
Daniel P. O'Gorman, Contract Law's Predominant-Purpose Test and the
Law-Fact Distinction, 45 Fla. St. U. L. Rev. 443 (2019) . https://ir.law.fsu.edu/lr/vol45/iss2/3; see also 1 E. Allan Farnsworth,
Farnsworth on Contracts § 1.9, at 44 (3d ed. 2004) (“Courts usually determine
whether a transaction is one in goods, services, or land by looking for the
‘predominant factor’ of the contract.”); 1 Howard O. Hunter, Modern Law of
Contracts § 9:11, at 519–20 (2014) (“The general test for U.C.C. coverage is to
determine whether the primary purpose and main thrust of the contract is the
sale of goods or services.”). But as the issue was not brief by either party,
it is not the court’s obligation to do so.
