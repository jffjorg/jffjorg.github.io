And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint, with leave to amend. The Judge agrees with the defendant that the plaintiff's complaint does not state sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The Judge notes that punitive damages are only appropriate when the defendant has acted with malice, which means conduct intended to cause injury or despicable conduct with a conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. However, the Judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations of malice are insufficient, as they only state that the defendant was distracted, disabled, and/or impaired and aware of the probable consequences of being in such a state. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff has failed to provide specific facts to support its claims. The Judge has granted the motion to strike punitive damages, but has given the plaintiff leave to amend its complaint to provide sufficient facts to support its claims.
