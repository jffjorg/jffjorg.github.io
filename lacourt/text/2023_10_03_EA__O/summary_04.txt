And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint, with leave to amend. The Judge agrees with the defendant that the plaintiff's complaint does not state sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The Judge notes that punitive damages are only appropriate when the defendant has acted with malice, which means conduct intended to cause injury or despicable conduct with a conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. However, the Judge finds that the plaintiff's allegations of malice are insufficient, as they only state that the defendant was distracted, disabled, and/or impaired and aware of the probable consequences of being in such a state. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff has failed to provide specific facts to support its claims. The Judge has granted the motion to strike punitive damages, but has given the plaintiff leave to amend its complaint to provide sufficient facts to support its claims.

## English Summary:

The judge is tentatively granting the Defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the Plaintiff's complaint. 

The judge argues that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. Punitive damages are only available in cases where the Defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. The complaint alleges that the Defendant was distracted, disabled, or impaired, but it does not provide specific details about these factors or how they led to the accident. 

The judge also notes that the Plaintiff's opposition to the motion does not offer any new facts or arguments to support the claim for punitive damages. Therefore, the judge is granting the Defendant's motion with leave to amend, allowing the Plaintiff to try to strengthen their claim by providing more specific information.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint, with leave to amend. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiff's negligence claims arising from a motor vehicle accident. The judge found that the plaintiff's complaint does not state facts sufficient to plead the requisite allegations to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge noted that California Civil Code section 3294 requires proof of malice, defined as conduct intended to cause injury or conducted with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. The judge found that the plaintiff's complaint lacks specific allegations of malice or conscious disregard and therefore fails to meet the requirements for punitive damages. The judge granted the motion, allowing the plaintiff to amend their complaint to include the required allegations.
