And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute over the sale of a Corvette. The plaintiff seeks judicial notice of certain invoices related to the sale, but the judge denies this request because the invoices are not records of the court. The judge also finds that the failure to attach the invoices to the plaintiff's complaint was not a sufficient reason to sustain a demurrer (a motion to dismiss the complaint). The judge will instead focus on whether the invoices constitute a written contract. The court also directs both parties to apply the "predominant purpose test" to determine whether the sale is for goods (the Corvette) or services.

## English Summary

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendant. The key issue is whether invoices related to a Corvette sale constitute a written contract. The plaintiff initially omitted these invoices from their complaint, but the judge denies their request to judicially notice them.  

The judge finds the omission of the invoices doesn't automatically render the plaintiff's case weak and allows them to amend their complaint to include the invoices.  

The judge also notes that both parties dispute whether the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law applies to the transaction. The judge suggests using the "predominant purpose" test to determine which law governs, but ultimately leaves the burden of applying the test to the parties.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the parties' disputes. The judge denies the plaintiff's request for judicial notice of the invoices for the Corvette, which were inadvertently omitted from the SAC, because the invoices are not records of the court. However, the judge does not believe that the lack of the Corvette invoice amounts to inconsistent factual allegations, and the plaintiff may use its opportunity to amend its complaint to submit the invoices. The judge will analyze whether the invoices are a written contract, and will direct the parties to focus on the predominant purpose test to determine whether the sale is for goods or services. The judge notes that both parties dispute whether the UCC or common law applies, and will not resolve the issue without further briefs from the parties.

Summary:
The tentative ruling focuses on the dispute between the plaintiffs and the defendant regarding the invoices pertaining to the Corvette and whether they are the written contract. The court denies the request for judicial notice of the invoices because they are not records of this court. The court directs both parties to the predominant purpose test as it would best resolve the issue of whether the UCC or common law applies. The court is not obligated to do so as the issue was not brief by either party. The plaintiff may use its opportunity for leave to amend to submit the Corvette invoices with their third amended complaint. The court cites Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, Navarrete v. Meyer (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1276, and legal scholars for support.
