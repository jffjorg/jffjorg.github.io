And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute over the sale of a Corvette. The plaintiff seeks judicial notice of certain invoices related to the sale, but the judge denies this request because the invoices are not records of the court. The judge also finds that the failure to attach the invoices to the plaintiff's complaint was not a sufficient reason to sustain a demurrer (a motion to dismiss the complaint). The judge will instead focus on whether the invoices constitute a written contract. The court also directs both parties to apply the "predominant purpose test" to determine whether the sale is for goods (the Corvette) or services.
