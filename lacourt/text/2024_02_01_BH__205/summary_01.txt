And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant GTP Structures I, LLC. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' negligence claim. The Plaintiffs, Oliver Kabilka and Phillip Kabilka, allege that they suffered health problems and discomfort due to the installation of antennas and transmission equipment in their apartment complex. The Defendant GTP Structures I, LLC argues that the Plaintiffs' claim fails because they have not alleged any facts that would support a finding that GTP owed them a duty of care. The Judge agrees with the Defendant, finding that the Plaintiffs' complaint does not contain sufficient allegations to establish a duty of care on the part of GTP. The Judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend the complaint.
