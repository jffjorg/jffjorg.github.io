```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the complaint and defendants' demurrer, and has concluded that the demurrer is without merit. The complaint alleges that the landlord served a three-day notice to pay rent or quit on the tenants, and that the tenants failed to pay the demanded rent or quit the premises within the statutory period. The Judge finds that the notice was properly served by posting and mailing, and that the complaint states a cause of action for unlawful detainer. The Judge also rejects the tenants' argument that the notice should have been preceded by a notice to perform covenants to be cured, as this is only required for notices concerning violations that fall under Code Civ. Proc. §1161(3), and not for actions for failure to pay rent under §1161(2). Therefore, the Judge overrules the demurrer and allows the complaint to proceed.
