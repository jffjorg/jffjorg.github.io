And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff, Bliss Media US, LLC, is entitled to a default judgment against the defendants, SPD Intellectual Property, LLC, and SPD Productions LLC, in the amount of $1,498,807.12. The defendants failed to satisfy a previous judgment and failed to make required payments to the plaintiff, despite being served with a notice to cure the default. The plaintiff has complied with all the requirements for a default judgment, including submitting supporting declarations and evidence. The court has previously denied a request for faulty service and finds that default judgment is appropriate in this case, as the defendants have not responded to the complaint or appeared in court.
