And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages is granted. The plaintiff failed to allege specific facts to show that the defendant, a corporation, was guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud. The complaint also does not allege that an officer, director, or managing agent of the defendant had advanced knowledge of the habitability issues and chose to disregard them to the detriment of the plaintiffs. The court grants the plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint and continues the case management conference to February 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
