Background
 
On
August 25, 2023, Soledad Carranza; Luis Irving Flores; Angelo Steve Canseco;
Michelle Andrea Carrillo; Tiffany Vanessa Carrillo a minor by and through their
Guardian Ad Litem, Soledad Carranza; and Kendra Jaden Carrillo a minor by and
through their Guardian Ad Litem, Soledad Carranza (collectively “Plaintiffs”)
filed a Complaint against Laurel Tower Apartment Complex, LLC (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 to 100. 
 
The
operative Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) Violation of Civ. Code §
1942.4; (2) Tortious Breach of the Warranty of Habitability; (3) Private
Nuisance; (4) Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq.; and  (5) Negligence. 
 
On
November 26, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to strike Plaintiff’s Complaint.
Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Motion to
Strike[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and
upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court
rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz
(1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the
claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].)¿¿¿ 
 
“Where the defect raised by a
motion to strike or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend
is routinely and liberally granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the
defect in question.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿
 
II.        Discussion
 
Defendant moves to strike Plaintiff’s
request for punitive damages on the basis that the Complaint fails to allege
sufficient facts to support a request for punitive damages. 
 
Defendant moves to strike the following
from Plaintiff’s Complaint: 
 

Page 5:2-3 of
     Paragraph 14: “Furthermore,
     Defendant LAUREL TOWER APARTMENT COMPLEX, LLC, are personally guilty of
     oppression, fraud and/or malice against Plaintiffs.”
Page 8:23-24 of Paragraph 30:
     “Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to punitive damages in an amount to
     be proven at trial.”
Page 14:8 of the Prayer: “(7) For
     exemplary and punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial.”

 
A.        Request to Strike Punitive Damages 
 
To
state a claim for punitive damages under Civ. Code § 3294, a plaintiff must
allege specific facts showing that the defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression,
or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿
The basis for punitive damages must be pled with specificity; conclusory
allegations devoid of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Id.)¿¿When the
defendant is a¿corporation, “the oppression, fraud, or malice must be
perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by an officer, director, or
managing agent of the¿corporation.” (Wilson v. Southern California Edison
Company (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164; see Civ. Code, § 3294(b).)¿ 
¿ 
“Malice”
is defined in Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the
defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others.” “Oppression” is defined as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”
(Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in the case
law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (Shade Foods,
Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78
Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) Fraud means “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or
concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the
part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights
or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c) (3).) 
 
As
Defendant is a corporation, Plaintiff failed to allege specific facts to show
that an officer, director, or managing agent knew, authorized, or ratified the
wrongful conduct. Plaintiff does not state what conduct “Edwin Rosales, Mr. Lan
(first name unknown), Tony (last name unknown), Maria Covia, Juan Martinez, and
Hy Ly” engaged in that constituted a conscious disregard for the rights and/or
safety of Plaintiffs and that these individuals were an officer, director, or
managing agent of Defendant or that an officer, director, or managing agent of
Defendant authorized or ratified said conduct. The Complaint also does not
allege that the violations, citations, and orders to abate were sent to
Defendant’s legal address such that an officer, director, or managing agent had
advanced knowledge of the habitability issues but chose to disregard said issues
to the detriment of Plaintiffs. 
 
Therefore, Defendant’s request to strike
punitive damages from Plaintiff’s Complaint is granted with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s motion to strike is
granted.  Plaintiff is granted 10 days
leave to amend. The Court 
continues the Case Management
Conference to February 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and sets a Non-
Appearance OSC Re: Amended
Complaint for the same date and time.  Defendant
to give notice.
