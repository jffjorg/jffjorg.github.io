Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by Minaskanian Properties, LLC (Plaintiff) to deem the matters specified in their Request for Admissions, Set 1, admitted. The Plaintiff had served the Request for Admissions on Defendant Marlo Richardson on April 15, 2024, but Richardson failed to respond. The Plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to deem the admissions admitted and requested sanctions against Richardson and her counsel, Agnes Sullivan and Bita Goodman of the Goodman Sullivan Law Group, in the amount of $3,150.00. The judge finds that Richardson's failure to respond to the Request for Admissions entitles the Plaintiff to an order deeming the matters admitted, and also entitles the Plaintiff to an award of sanctions against Richardson and her counsel for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations. However, the judge reduces the amount of sanctions requested from $3,150.00 to $1,125.00, which is the amount of time spent by counsel preparing the motion and preparing for and appearing at the hearing, multiplied by the hourly rate of $375.00. The judge also warns counsel for the parties that failure to comply with the rule requiring electronic bookmarking of exhibits may result in sanctions.
