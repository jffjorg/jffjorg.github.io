  Case No.:  23STCV09930
  Hearing Date:  January 12, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants sammy zablen’s and sammy’s
  warehouse’s motion to quash service of summons  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 3, 2023, Plaintiff Alexander
Khazai filed this action against numerous Defendants, asserting 16 causes of
action arising from a business transaction. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
failed to properly compensate him for his services. 
            On November 20, 2023, Defendants
Sammy Zablen and Sammy’s Warehouse filed the instant motion to quash service of
summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.

LEGAL STANDARD
“[T]he court in which an action is pending
has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served on him as
provided by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10).” (Code Civ. Proc, §
410.50(a).) “[A] court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of
process or by that party's general appearance.” (In re Jennifer O.
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 539, 547.) Actual notice of a lawsuit is not a
substitute for proper service of process. (Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 1199, 1206.) A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to
quash service of summons on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) 
DISCUSSION
            “A summons may be served by personal
delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be
served.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) A summons may be served on a corporation
by delivering the summons and complaint to the designated agent for service of
process, a corporate officer, or a person authorized by the corporation to
receive service. (Id., § 416.10.) Alternatively, a summons may be served
by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s dwelling house,
usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address, in the
presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in
charge, at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents
thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the
same location. (Id., § 415.20.) 
            Sammy Zablen is the CEO of Sammy’s
Warehouse. (Zablen Decl. ¶ 2.) Zablen found a copy of the summons and complaint
on the doorstep of his residence on October 21, 2023. (Id., ¶ 3, Ex. A.)
The summons and complaint were not personally delivered to Zablen or left with
anyone at his residence. (Id., ¶¶ 4-5.) Zablen did not receive the
summons and complaint in the mail. (Id., ¶ 6.) Zablen denies that the
summons and complaint were personally delivered to an agent, officer, or other
authorized person of Sammy’s Warehouse. (Id., ¶¶ 7-8.) 
Plaintiff has not filed a proof of service
demonstrating service on the moving defendants and does not contest the motion.
The unrebutted evidence shows that Defendants were not properly served, either
personally or by substitute service.        
CONCLUSION
            The motion to quash filed by Defendants
Sammy Zablen and Sammy’s Warehouse is GRANTED.
