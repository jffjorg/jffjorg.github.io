And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in which it denies Plaintiff's motion to lift the stay pending the appeal of the Court of Appeal's decision. The Plaintiff has asked to lift the stay so that the parties can resume litigating the portion of the case involving JRK's claims for communicable disease coverage under the policy. The Court agrees with the Defendants that a stay remains justified because there are overlapping issues between the Plaintiff's claims under the Business Interruption and Civil Authority provisions and the claim under the Communicable Disease provision. The Court believes that if the Supreme Court determines that Plaintiff is allowed to proceed on the former, all of the claims should be tried together for the sake of judicial economy. The Court finds that duplicative litigation would cause greater prejudice to both parties and the Court, and therefore the stay should remain in effect.
