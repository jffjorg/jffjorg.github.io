Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendants Sammy Zablen and Sammy's Warehouse. The motion was filed due to lack of personal jurisdiction, as the summons was not properly served on the moving defendants. The evidence shows that Defendant Sammy Zablen found the summons on the doorstep of his residence, but it was not personally delivered or served by mail. Since the plaintiff has not filed a proof of service or opposed the motion, the judge concludes that the service of summons was not proper.
