  Case No.:  21STCV10900
  Hearing Date: January 12, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant bryan dameworth’s motions to
  compel further responses  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 22, 2021, Plaintiff Randall
Stewart initiated this action against Defendants Los Angeles Police Department,
City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, and Bryan Dameworth. The operative Second
Amended Complaint, filed January 18, 2023, alleges (1) battery, (2) assault,
(3) battery by peace officer, (4) negligent hiring, (5) negligence, (6)
negligent use of deadly force, (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress,
and (8) violation of the Bane Act. Plaintiff alleges that he was attending a
protest on May 30, 2020, in Los Angeles when Officer Dameworth fired a rubber
bullet, striking him. (SAC ¶¶ 10-12.) The incident allegedly left Plaintiff with
severe injuries and continued pain and suffering (Id., ¶ 30.) 
            On December 12 and 14, 2023,
Defendant Dameworth filed the instant three motions to compel further responses
from Plaintiff with respect to Requests for Admission, Form Interrogatories,
and Requests for Production. Plaintiff filed his oppositions on December 29,
2023. Defendant filed his replies on January 5, 2024.   
LEGAL STANDARD
Upon receiving responses to its discovery requests,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling further responses if the
responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without merit or too
general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a), 2033.290(a).) 
MEET AND CONFER
A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1), 2031.310(b),
2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Defendant has satisfied the meet and confer
requirement. (See Jeffery Decl.)  
DISCUSSION
I.
Requests for Admission
            “The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed shall sign the response under oath, unless the response
contains only objections.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240(a).) Plaintiff served
his original responses, consisting of only objections, on October 17, 2023. (Jeffery
Decl. ¶ 4; Park Decl., Ex. 1.) Plaintiff then served supplemental responses,
consisting of objections and responses, on October 23, 2023. (Jeffery Decl. ¶
5; Park Decl., Ex. 2.) Because the October 23 responses consisted of more than
just objections, Plaintiff was required to verify those responses. 
Upon serving the October 23 responses, Plaintiff
promised that “verifications will follow shortly.” (Jeffery Decl., Ex. A.) Defense
counsel attempted to follow up on October 31, November 17, and December 4, but
did not receive any response. (Id., ¶¶ 5-7.) As of the filing of this
motion, Plaintiff had not provided the promised verification. (Id., ¶
8.) Plaintiff executed a verification on December 18, 2023, after this motion
was filed. (Park Decl., Ex. 3.) Plaintiff has provided no substantial justification
for the delay in verifying the October 23 responses. 
II.
Form Interrogatories
            First, Plaintiff must verify the
responses, as discussed above. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.250(a).) Second, an
answer to an interrogatory must be as complete and straightforward as possible.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220(a).) Form Interrogatories are drafted and approved
by the Judicial Council and seek basic information fundamental to routine discovery.
(See Puerto v. Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1250.) A party
“is entitled to demand answers to its interrogatories, as a matter of right . .
. [and] the burden of justifying any objection and failure to respond
remains at all times with the party resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.) 
Plaintiff asserted boilerplate objections
to FROG No. 17.1 as it relates to RFA Nos. 14 and 19, both of which Plaintiff
objected to and then denied. Plaintiff argues that because RFA Nos. 14 and 19
were too vague to be answered, he properly refused to answer the associated
FROG No. 17.1 based on the same objections. RFA No. 14 asked Plaintiff to admit
that prior to being struck, nothing prevented him from leaving the area. Plaintiff
argues that RFA No. 14 is unclear about what it means for Plaintiff to have
been “prevented from” leaving the area. RFA No. 19 asked Plaintiff to admit
that a dispersal order was given over the public address system near the area
of the incident. Plaintiff argues that RFA No. 19 is unclear about what a “public
address system” or “dispersal order” are, or what is considered “near” the
subject area.
Plaintiff’s argument that these RFAs are unanswerable
is without merit because Plaintiff actually answered them by denying both. By
denying RFA No. 14, Plaintiff is contending that something prevented him from
leaving the area of the incident. By denying RFA No. 19, Plaintiff is
contending that a dispersal order was not given near the area of the incident.
Plaintiff must naturally provide the facts supporting these contentions, which
is precisely the purpose of FROG No. 17.1. The terms at issue are sufficiently
clear to warrant a response. 
III.
Requests for Production
            Plaintiff responded to the RFPs by
asserting boilerplate objections and then ending with the statement, “Plaintiff
will provide supplemental responses promptly.” (Jeffery Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. A.)
Plaintiff promised to provide responses first by October 20, then October 27,
but failed to do so by either date. (Id., ¶¶ 5-6.) Plaintiff did not respond
to subsequent follow-up communications. (Id., ¶¶ 7-8.) The boilerplate objections
are without merit, and Plaintiff did not provide the promised supplemental
responses until after this motion was filed. (Park Decl., Ex. 3.)   
IV.
Sanctions
            Plaintiff’s failure to timely and
properly respond to discovery is not supported by substantial justification.
The fact that Plaintiff only provided verifications and supplemental responses
after these motions were filed shows that the motions were necessary, and
Defendant is entitled to recover the attorneys’ fees incurred as a result of
Plaintiff’s actions. Sanctions are warranted in the amount of $1,625,
representing 5 hours at $325 per hour. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motions to compel are
GRANTED. Plaintiff shall provide verified responses to the subject discovery
within 10 days. The Court sanctions Plaintiff and his counsel in the total
amount of $1,625, to be paid within 30 days.
