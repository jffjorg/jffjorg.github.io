And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a future court hearing in a case brought by RANDALL STEWART against the LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT, BRYAN DAMEWORTH, and others. The case concerns an incident on May 30, 2020, in which STEWART was struck by a rubber bullet fired by DAMEWORTH during a protest. STEWART alleges that he suffered severe injuries and continued pain and suffering as a result.

The judge is ruling on three motions to compel further responses from STIEWART with respect to discovery requests. The motions were filed by DAMEWORTH and concern requests for admission, form interrogatories, and requests for production. The judge finds that STIEWART failed to timely and properly respond to these requests and that the motions were necessary to compel further responses.

The judge grants the motions to compel and orders STIEWART to provide verified responses to the subject discovery requests within 10 days. The judge also sanctions STIEWART and his counsel in the amount of $1,625, to be paid within 30 days, for their failure to comply with discovery requests.
