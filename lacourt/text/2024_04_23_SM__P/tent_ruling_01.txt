Stiffelman v.
Rubin et al., Case No. 19SMCV01908
Hearing Date: April
23, 2024
Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Further Responses from Defendant Stuart Rubin and Request for
Sanctions 
 
Plaintiff
Stiffelman served Stuart Rubin with form interrogatories, special
interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production on July
25 and August 23, 2023. Rubin served responses on September 5 and 22, 2023. Plaintiff
served a meet and confer letter on October 5, 2023. Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses, and sanctions of $3,930.00. There is no opposition. 
 
Plaintiff provides
a separate statement identifying each discovery item he desires further
responses to in compliance with CRC rule 3.1345(a)(2) and (3) and the
declaration of counsel Laquer, who declares plaintiff served a detailed meet
and confer letter to Rubin regarding the deficiencies with his responses
provided on September 5 and September 22, 2023. Laquer decl. ¶ 6-7. Plaintiff’s
counsel followed up on October 20 and 26 and received no responses. Id. ¶
8. Stuart Rubin responded, agreeing to provide supplemental responses to a few
identified items but refusing to respond to the majority of the identified
requests plaintiff noted as deficient. Id. ¶ 10; Ex. M. The parties later
met via videoconference to further discuss the discovery issues and Rubin’s
counsel agreed to provide supplemental responses to “each and every item
identified in Plaintiff’s meet and confer letter” by January 26. Id. ¶
11; Ex. N. Despite Rubin losing his legal representation, plaintiff continued attempting
to informally resolve the discovery issues. Id. ¶ 12. 
 
Special Interrogatories
Set Two Nos. 43, 46, 48-52 
Special
interrogatories 43, 46, and 48-52 request information about persons present
during discussions of the Okubo and HVS reports and the amounts of Rubin's
alleged contributions to the project on identified dates. Separate statement p.
1-7. Rubin generally objects to the interrogatories; however, Rubin indicates
that for interrogatories 43 and 46, he cannot identify every person involved in
the conversations about the reports. Id. p. 3-4. Rubin is not required to
respond further if he is unable to identify every person privy to the
conversation, but to comply with his discovery obligations, he must supplement
his response with a sworn statement that he is unable to recall or identify the
individuals present during the specific conversations. 
 
Rubin similarly objects
to interrogatories 48-52 on various grounds. The objections are unsatisfactory.
Each interrogatory requests the amount Rubin purports to have overfunded on
specific contribution dates. Rubin must provide further responses to special interrogatories
48-52.
 
Special
Interrogatories Set Three Nos. 53-79
Special
interrogatories 53-79 seek identification of records pertaining to the Okubo
and HVS reports, information about Rubin’s contributions, the project entity's
lease of a Bentley, communications with the Project’s general contractor, and Rubin’s
status as a trustee of the Stuart Rubin Children’s Trust Fund. Id. p.
8-11. Rubin essentially provided duplicative objections to the requested
interrogatories except for interrogatories 72, 73, 75, and 78. Id. p.
12-13. This is insufficient, as the information requested is not privileged;
the request specifies the information it seeks and would reasonably lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence related to the project that is the subject of
the litigation. Rubin must supplement, either by providing details and/or by
identifying specific responsive documents to special interrogatories 53-79.
 
Request for
Admissions Nos. 46-48, 51, 55-58 
The request for
admissions seeks the admission or denial of various issues, including Rubin’s
intent for the property development project, communication with Scott Eisner, whether
he signed a letter purporting he was trustee of the Stuart Rubin Children’s
Trust, and issues regarding vehicle lease and usage during the project. Id. p.
13-20. Rubin proffers only objections and refuses to admit or deny RFAs 46-48,
51, and 55-58. Id. The responses are insufficient. Rubin must admit or
deny. 
 
Form Interrogatory
No. 17.1; RFA Nos. 34-36,37,39,46-48,49,53,54
Form Interrogatory
No. 17.1 seeks information responsive to RFAs 34-36, 37, 39, 46-48, 49, 53, 54.
Id. p. 20-31. Nos. 34-36 seek information about Rubin’s position as manager
of Glenroy Coachella, LLC and Glenroy Coachella Holdings, LLC. Id. p.
20-30. Rubin’s responses to nos. 34-36 discuss members of entities, not the
managers. Id. p. 21-23. Nos. 34-39 contain responses that vaguely list
names and claim “countless documents in the possession of Gary Stiffelman
evidence this fact.” Id. p. 21-24. Nos. 46-48 contain no responses
despite Rubin’s responses to the RFAs not being unqualified admissions. Id. p.
25-26. Nos 49-53 allude to “witnesses from City National Bank” without
specifying who. Id. p. 26-29. Part b of Rubin’s response to request no
54 states that various individuals have served as trustees at Rubin’s behest. Id.
p. 30. The responses are insufficient. Rubin must supplement, either by
providing details and/or by identifying specific responsive documents. 
 
Request for
Production Set Three Nos. 86-89 
Request for
production nos. 86- 89 seek records concerning the loan agreements and
contributions that are in dispute. Id. p. 30-34. For each request, plaintiff
asserts Rubin testified about those issues during deposition, yet he refuses to
produce documents responsive to the request. Rubin generally objects. Separate
statement p. 30-34. This is insufficient, as the documents requested are not
attorney-client privileged and do not concern Rubin’s legal representation. Rubin’s
concern for privacy is contradicted by his previous testimony regarding the
loan agreements and contributions identified. Rubin must provide records responsive
to the identified loan agreements and contributions.  
 
Request for
Production Set Four Nos. 90-92 
Request nos. 90-92
seeks the records regarding the lease of a Bentley by the project entity. Id.
p. 34-37. Rubin blanketly objects. This is insufficient, as the documents
requested are not covered under attorney-client privilege and do not concern an
attorney-client relationship. Rubin’s concern for privacy is contradicted by
his previous testimony about the lease of the Bentley. Rubin must provide
records.
 
Request for
Production Set Four Nos. 95-100
Plaintiff’s request
for production nos. 95-100 asks for documents and communications that refer to Rubin’s
status as a trustee or co-trustee. Separate statement. p. 37-38. Mot. p. 9.
Rubin objects. Plaintiff contends Rubin claimed he would produce further
documents but has not done so. Plaintiff contends further responses are needed to
know Rubin’s status as a trustee because it speaks to plaintiff’s allegation
that Rubin made misrepresentations to induce plaintiff into taking out loans
and investing in the project. Thus, the court sees good cause in the production.
Rubin must provide responsive documents. 
 
Verified responses
are due as above within 20 days. 
 
Sanctions
Rubin’s failure to
properly respond to the discovery request is considered a misuse of the
discovery process. Notably, Rubin does not provide evidence he acted with
substantial justification or that sanctions would be unjust. Plaintiff requests
$3,930 in attorney’s fees. Laquer decl. ¶19. This figure includes 10 hours from
Laquer billed at $225 an hour, and 2 hours billed by Capozzola at $290 an hour
to review and prepare the motion. Id. ¶¶ 15, 17. Plaintiff’s request for
$3,930 in sanctions is excessive, considering there was no opposition or reply.
The court orders 10 hours at a blended rate of $240/hour, or $2,400, payable
within 30 days.
