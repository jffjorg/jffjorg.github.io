Wood v. Per Ove
Ericson, Case No. 24SMCV00315
Hearing Date: April
23, 2024
Defendant’s Motion
to Dismiss or Stay on the Grounds of Inconvenient Forum 
 
Plaintiff sues regarding
a real estate development project. Defendant files this motion for forum non
conveniens, as the parties’ contractual agreement contains a forum selection
provision, providing that disputes be litigated in Yucatan, Mexico. The motion
to dismiss is not opposed. The defendant served this motion by mail and email
on March 21, 2024 (03/21/24 proof of service).
 
Defendant’s request
for judicial notice of the complaint filed January 22, 2024 and Exh. A thereto is
GRANTED, as it is a court document under Evidence Code 452(d). The court
does admit the documents for their truth.
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 410.30 states: “(a) When a court upon motion of a party of
its own motion finds that in the interest of substantial justice an action should
be heard in a forum outside this state, the court shall stay or dismiss the
action in whole or in part on any conditions that may be just.”¿
 
A section 410.30
motion can be used to enforce contractual forum-selection clauses. (Grove v.
Juul Labs, Inc. (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 1081, 1090.) “California favors
contractual forum selection clauses so long as they are entered into freely and
voluntarily, and their enforcement would not be unreasonable.” (America
Online, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1, 11). When a section
410.30 motion is based on a mandatory forum clause, “the test is simply whether
application of the clause is unfair or unreasonable, and the clause is usually
given effect. Claims that the previously chosen forum is unfair or inconvenient
are generally rejected. (Berg v. MTC Electronics Technologies (1998) 61
Cal.App.4th 349, 358.) A forum selection clause is presumed valid; the party
seeking to void enforcement of a forum selection clause bears the burden of
establishing that enforcement would be unreasonable under the circumstances. (Id.;
See also Trident Labs, Inc. v. Merrill Lynch Commercial Finance Corp.
(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 147, 154).
 
The sixth clause
of the parties’ contract established states for all matters related to the
interpretation and enforcement of the contract the parties submit to the jurisdiction
of the competent judges and courts in the city of Merida, Yucatan and expressly
waive any other jurisdiction (Villamil Decl., para. 8). The ninth clause of the
contract confirms that neither party committed fraud, error, or bad faith that
would cast doubt on their consent (Villamil Decl. para. 9). The clause is mandatory
because it expressly mandates the litigation in Meridia, not Los Angeles. Plaintiff
does not submit opposition.  
 
Moreover, the
court finds no basis for the matter to be in Los Angeles. Yucatan provides an
adequate alternative forum, which both parties expressly agreed to in the
contract documents. The alleged conduct occurred in Yucatan; defendant and witnesses
reside in Yucatan, and all physical evidence is in Yucatan. The forum selection
clause is enforceable. GRANTED.
 
The matter is DISMISSED
without prejudice, and plaintiff may refile in the selected forum.
