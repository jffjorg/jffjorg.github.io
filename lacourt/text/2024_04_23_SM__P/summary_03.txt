Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for stay of proceedings pending adjudication of the claims in the Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) process. The plaintiff, California Physicians Service dba Blue Shield of California, has filed a complaint against the defendant, Advanced Orthopedic Center, Inc. (AOC), seeking declaratory relief and money had and received. The defendant argues that the IDR process is a binding arbitration process and the court has no role to play in resolving the dispute. The court finds that California law does not provide a "method" for determining disputes over quantifying reasonable value and therefore grants the stay of proceedings pending adjudication of the claims in the IDR process. The demurrer is MOOT.
