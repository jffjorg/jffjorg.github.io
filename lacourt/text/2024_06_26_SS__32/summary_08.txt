**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Weimin Chen's motion to seal the unredacted version of the parties' stipulation regarding good faith settlement and the unredacted version of the Confidential Agreement and General Release of All Claims.

The Court finds that there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the records, as the proposed information to be sealed pertains to personal financial information and is between private parties. The Court also finds that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and that there are no less restrictive means available to achieve the overriding interest.

The Court grants Defendant's motion to seal and orders that the following documents in their unredacted form be filed under seal: (1) Stipulation Regarding Good Faith Settlement of Defendant Weimin Chen; and (2) Confidential Agreement and General Release of All Claims between Nicole McClellan and Released Parties.

Defendant shall give notice of the Court's order and file proof of service of such.
