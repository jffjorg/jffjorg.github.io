MOTION
 
Defendant Vallarta Food Enterprises, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves to
continue trial. No opposition has been filed. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
The complaint was filed on February 8, 2022. 
 
Defendant’s answer was filed on May 31, 2023.  
 
On December 11, 2023, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued
trial and all related dates from March 8, 2024 to August 23, 2024. 
 
On May 7, 2024, Defendant filed and served its motion for summary
judgment. The hearing for summary judgment is currently scheduled for August
23, 2024.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Legal Standard
 
 “Continuances are
granted only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring a
continuance.”  (In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 814, 823.)  A trial court has broad discretion in considering
a request for a trial continuance.  (Pham v. Nguyen (1997) 54
Cal.App.4th 11, 13-18.)  California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332 sets forth
factors for the Court to consider in ruling on a motion to continue
trial. 
 
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases, the
dates assigned for a trial are firm. All parties and their counsel must regard
the date set for trial as certain.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(a).) 
 
“A party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial,
whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must make the
request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte application under
the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with supporting declarations. The
party must make the motion or application as soon as reasonably practical once
the necessity for the continuance is discovered.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(b).)
 
“Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each
request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits. The court may
grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance. Circumstances that may indicate good cause include:
 
(1)   The unavailability of an essential lay
or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;
(2)   The unavailability of a party because
of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;
(3)   The unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; 
(4)   The substitution of trial counsel, but
only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in
the interests of justice;
(5)   The addition of a new party if:
(A) The new party has not had a reasonable
opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or
(B)  The other parties have not had a
reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to
the new party’s involvement in the case;
(6)   A party’s excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts; or
(7)   A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.” 
(Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)
 
“In ruling on a motion or application for continuance,
the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to
the determination. These may include:
 
(1)   The proximity of the trial date;
(2)   Whether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;
(3)   The length of the continuance
requested;
(4)   The availability of alternative means
to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a
continuance;
(5)   The prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
(6)   If the case is entitled to a
preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need
for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay;
(7)   The court’s calendar and the impact of
granting a continuance on other pending trials;
(8)   Whether trial counsel is engaged in
another trial;
(9)   Whether all parties have stipulated to
a continuance;
(10)  Whether the interests of justice are
best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing
conditions on the continuance; and
(11)  Any other fact or circumstance
relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.
(Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)
 
A party may move for summary judgment “at any time after 60
days have elapsed since the general appearance in the action or proceeding of
each party against whom the motion is directed or at any earlier time after the
general appearance that the court, with or without notice and upon good cause
shown, may direct.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(1).)¿ Notice of the
motion and supporting papers must be served on all other parties at least 75
days before the time appointed for hearing.¿ (Id., subd. (a)(2).)¿ The
motion must be heard no later than 30 days before the date of trial, unless the
court for good cause orders otherwise.¿ (Id., subd. (a)(3).)¿¿¿ 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant requests the Court continue trial in this case to 30 or 60
days after the August 23, 2024 summary judgment hearing, which is also the
trial date. A
party that timely files a motion for summary judgment under Code of Civil Procedure
section 437c has a right to have their motion heard before the start of trial.
(Cole v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.) If served electronically, a motion for
summary judgment must be made at least 105 days before trial, plus two court
days. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(a)(2), (3).) Therefore, a motion for summary judgment in this case needed
to be filed by May 8, 2024. 
 
 Defendant timely served and filed
its motion for summary judgment on May 7, 2024. Defendant contends it
diligently completed discovery and did not have the facts for its summary
judgment motion until Plaintiff was deposed on April 23, 2024. (Derossi Decl. ¶
5.) Defendant argues that the earliest date available for a summary judgment
hearing was August 23, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6.) Since that date is on the trial
date, Defendant
requests that the Court continue the trial date to allow for the motion for
summary judgment to be heard. The parties have stipulated to continue trial and
all related dates to October 22, 2024. (Id. ¶ 1, Exh. A.) 
 
Therefore,
since Defendant has filed a timely summary judgment motion and the parties have
stipulated, the Court finds good cause to continue trial. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court grants the motion to continue trial.
