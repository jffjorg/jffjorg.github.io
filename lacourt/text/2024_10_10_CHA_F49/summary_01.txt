And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to deem admitted the truth specified in the Requests for Admission, Set One. However, the judge has granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in part, ordering the defendant to pay $511.65 in attorney's fees. The dispute arose from a commercial lease for the property at 10249 ½ Sepulveda Boulevard, Mission Hills, California 91345. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant on July 24, 2023, and the defendant failed to serve a timely response to the Requests for Admission, Set One. The plaintiff then filed a motion to deem admitted the truth specified in the Requests for Admission, Set One, and the defendant filed an opposition to the motion. The judge found that the defendant failed to serve a timely response to the Requests for Admission, Set One, but that the defendant subsequently served a response in substantial compliance with the code requirements. The judge also found that the parties reached an agreement to resolve the discovery dispute, with the defendant paying $1,186.65 in attorney's fees in exchange for the plaintiff's withdrawal of all pending motions to compel discovery responses.
