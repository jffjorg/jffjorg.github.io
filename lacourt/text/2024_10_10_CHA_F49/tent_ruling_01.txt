BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from disputes over a commercial lease for
the property at 10249 ½ Sepulveda Boulevard, Mission Hills, California 91345
(the “Leased Premises”).
 
On
July 24, 2023, Plaintiff S&R5k, LLC (“Plaintiff”
or “S&R5K”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Yahaira F. Kolb (“Kolb”),
Valley Goddess, Inc. (“Valley Goddess”) (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does
1 to 25, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach of Lease – Failure
to Timely Pay Rent, (2) Breach of Lease – Failure to Maintain Good Condition,
(3) Negligent Failure to Maintain Good Condition of Property, and (4)
Conversion. Subsequently, on September 8, 2023, Defendants filed their Answer
to the Complaint.
 
On May 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deem
the Truth of Matters Specified in Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted and
Conclusively Established (the “Motion”). Subsequently, Defendant Kolb filed her
Opposition to the Motion on October 1, 2024. 
 
No Reply papers have been received by the Court. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by
a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness of
specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion
relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission may
relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after service of requests for admission,
the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the
response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all
other parties who have appeared ....”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd.
(a).)¿
 
If a party to whom request for
admissions is served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for
monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The court shall
issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a
response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿
 
A.   
Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted
 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Ramshin
Daneshi (“Daneshi”), attests that the Requests for Admission (“RFA”), Set One,
was served on Defendant Kolb, via USPS first-class mail with return receipt
requested, on March 11, 2024. (Daneshi Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. “A.”) Responses to the
RFA was due on April 15, 2024; however, no responses were received on the due
date. (Id. ¶ 7.)
 
In the Opposition, Kolb’s
counsel, Gabriela Gevorkian (“Gevorkian”), declares that on September 25, 2024,
code-compliant responses to the RFA, without objection and with verifications,
were mailed to Plaintiff’s counsel’s office. (Gevorkian Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. “H.”)
Gevorkian further claims that her firm was retained by Kolb and substituted in
as counsel of record on May 31, 2024 (Id. ¶ 6.), after the responses
became due. The Motion was served upon Defendant on June 3, 2024. (Id. ¶
7.) Gevorkian has worked with Defendants diligently to gather facts and prepare
discovery responses. (Id. ¶ 8.)   
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Defendant Kolb failed to serve a timely response by
the April 14, 2024, due date. However, since responses to the RFA were
subsequently served, without objection, prior to the hearing, and Plaintiff did
not file a Reply to contest this claim, the Court deems the responses to be in
substantial compliance with code requirements, absent any evidence from
Plaintiff to the contrary.    
 
Accordingly, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), the Court DENIES the
Motion. The only remaining issue is the matter of sanctions. 
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Here, Gevorkian asserts that both
parties reached an agreement to resolve the discovery dispute, with her client
paying $1,186.65 in attorney’s fees in exchange for Plaintiff’s withdrawal of
all pending motions to compel discovery responses. (Gevorkian Decl. ¶ 13.) A
check for $1,186.65 was mailed on behalf of Defendant to Plaintiff’s counsel’s
office on September 25, 2024. (Id. ¶ 16.) However, on September 27,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel, in an email to Defendants’ counsel, claimed that the
sanction amount was not agreed upon. (Id. ¶
18, Ex. “G.”) Subsequently, Plaintiff’s counsel declined Defendant’s another offer
of $2,000.00 to resolve the matter. (Ibid.)  
 
The Court emphasizes that monetary
sanctions are mandatory under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (c). Utilizing the lodestar approach, and in view of the totality
of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount
of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the Motion is $511.65,
calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $450.00 for one hour reasonably
spent plus a $61.65 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff
S&R5K LLC’s Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters Specified
in Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted and Conclusively Established is
DENIED.
 
Plaintiff
S&R5K LLC’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
Defendant Yahaira F. Kolb is ordered to pay $511.65 in sanctions to
Plaintiff’s counsel within 20 days.
