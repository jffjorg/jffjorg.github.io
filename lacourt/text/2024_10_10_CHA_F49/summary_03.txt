And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the application of Brian Mead to appear as counsel pro hac vice for Paylocity Corp in the case of DrinkPAK LLC v. Paylocity Corp. The application was filed on September 12, 2024, and is unopposed. Mead is a member in good standing of multiple courts, but has failed to submit proof of payment of the $50.00 application fee. The court notes that Mead has previously applied for admission pro hac vice into California courts on multiple occasions, which may be a cause for denial of the application. The court also notes that the application fails to satisfy the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 9.40(d) and does not demonstrate the existence of any special circumstances to warrant not denying the application. Therefore, the court denies the application without prejudice.
