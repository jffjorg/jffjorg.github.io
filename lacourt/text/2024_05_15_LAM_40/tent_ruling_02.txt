 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
  Norberto Fregoso and Defendant Complete Industrial Repair, Inc.’s Motion for
  Sanctions Against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Abel Nevarez.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Abel Nevarez sues Defendant
Norberto Fregoso, Complete Industrial Repair, Inc., and Does 1-15 pursuant to a
September 8, 2022 First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging claims of (1) Breach
of Written Contract, (2) Breach of Oral Contract, (3) Breach of Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (4) Conversion, (5) Breach of
Fiduciary Duty, (6) Fraud and Deceit, and (7) Accounting.
(For ease of reference, the Court
refers to Abel Nevarez as Plaintiff Nevarez and Norberto Fregoso and Complete
Industrial Repair, Inc. as Defendants Fregoso and CIR.)
The claims arise from allegations
that Defendants failed to comply with the terms of the relevant agreements
between Plaintiff Nevarez and Defendant Fregoso relating to the establishment
of a thermal spray services partnership between them.
On October 13, 2022, Defendants
Fregoso and CIR filed an Answer to the FAC.
That same day, Defendant Fregoso
filed a Cross-Complaint suing Plaintiff Nevarez and Roes 1-20 pursuant to
claims of (1) Dissolution of Partnership, (2) Breach of Partnership Agreement,
(3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (4) Accounting, (5) Intentional Misrepresentation,
and (6) Negligent Misrepresentation.
B. Limited
Representation, Abel Nevarez
On November 4, 2022, Plaintiff
Nevarez filed a substitution of attorney, which substituted out counsel and
noticed Plaintiff’s appearance in pro per.
On December 12, 2022, Plaintiff
Nevarez filed a notice of limited scope of representation for the “01/23/2024”
hearing, with Cristina M. Saca, Esq. of the Law Office of Cristine M. Saca
substituting in.
On December 13, 2022, Plaintiff
Nevarez filed an Answer to the Cross-Complaint. The Answer to Cross-Complaint
is signed by Cristina Saca as counsel for Plaintiff Nevarez.
C. First Written Set of
Discovery and Related Court Order
On May 11, 2023, Defendant Fregoso
served on Plaintiff Nevarez a first set of written discovery comprised of form
interrogatories (FROGs, Set One), special interrogatories (SROGs, Set One), production
requests (RPDs, Set One), and admission requests (RFAs, Set One).
On August 28, 2023, due to
Plaintiff Nevarez’s nonresponse, Defendant Fregoso’s counsel emailed Plaintiff Nevarez’s
counsel—Cristina Saca—regarding the failure to respond to Defendant Fregoso’s discovery.
On September 1, 2023, Plaintiff
Nevarez’s counsel—Cristina Saca—responded by indicating that she was no longer
able to serve as Plaintiff Nevarez’s counsel and requesting 30 days for
Plaintiff to respond.
Defendant Fregoso’s counsel
ultimately assented to the request. However, neither Plaintiff Nevarez’s
counsel nor Plaintiff ever served responses or documents.
As a result, on November 3, 2023,
Defendant Fregoso filed motions to compel Plaintiff Nevarez’s initial responses
to FROGs, Set One, SROGs, Set One, and RPDs, Set One, and to admit the requests
for admission in RFAs, Set One. All four motions sought monetary sanctions from
Plaintiff Nevarez and were served on Plaintiff Nevarez and Cristina Saca by
mail at the addresses reflected in Plaintiff’s substitution of attorney filing
and the notice of limited scope of representation filing for Cristina Saca.
Plaintiff Nevarez failed to oppose
the four motions, which came before the Court on January 19, 2024.
On January 19, 2024, at a hearing
attended by Cristina Saca as counsel for Abel Nevarez, the Court granted Defendant
Fregoso’s four motions and granted monetary sanctions. The Court ordered
Plaintiff Nevarez to respond to FROGs, SROGs, and RPDs, Set One, within 21 days
of the Court’s order, deemed the truth of matters in RFAs, Set One, admitted,
and ordered Plaintiff Nevarez to pay Defendant Fregoso $2,346.60 within 21 days of
the Court’s order.
The Court also denied an oral
request by Cristina Saca to advance a hearing on her alleged motion to be
relieved as counsel, though the Court notes that no such motion appears in the
record, either before or after January 19, 2024.
D. Trial Setting
Trial in this matter was originally
set for January 23, 2024 at a hearing on August 9, 2022 but was continued to
May 21, 2024 at a hearing on November 6, 2023. At the latter hearing, Mr.
Nevarez appeared, representing himself. At that time, Mr. Nevarez was also specifically
admonished to file responses to the motions to compel, which he thereafter
failed to do.
E. Motion Before the
Court
On March 29, 2024, Defendant
Fregoso filed a motion for (1) terminating sanctions or, in the alternative,
issue and/or evidentiary sanctions, and (2) monetary sanctions in the amount of
$1,661.65 against Plaintiff Nevarez alone. The notice of motion sought both a
dismissal of Plaintiff’s Complaint, as well as striking the Answer and entering
default on the Cross-Complaint. Defendant Fregoso argues that as of the date
the motion was filed, Plaintiff Nevarez had completely failed to serve
discovery responses as ordered by the Court. The motion was served on Plaintiff
Nevarez at his Whittier, California address and via email, and was served on
Cristina Saca as counsel at her Upland, California address and via email.
The record fails to
reflect any opposition by Plaintiff Nevarez or declaration from Cristina Saca
in relation to the March 29 motion.
On May 7, 2024,
Defendant Fregoso filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion.
Defendant Fregoso’s
motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Motion for Sanctions: GRANTED
in part; MOOT in part.
A.
Legal Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 permits California courts to impose monetary,
issue or evidence, and terminating sanctions for discovery misuses, which are
defined by section 2023.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (See Peat,
Marwick, Mitchell & Co. v. Superior Court (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 272,
288 [The court’s inherent power to curb abuses and promote fair process extends
to the preclusion of evidence].)
Misuses
of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, failing to respond or
to submit to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to
provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); see, e.g., Vallbona
v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545 [the court imposed evidence
sanctions where defendants misused discovery process by not responding to
authorized method of discovery]; In re Marriage of Eustice (2015) 242
Cal.App.4th 1291, 1308-1309 [respondent was sanctioned for willfully violating
order to produce accounting and financial documents].)
“‘The
trial court has broad discretion in selecting discovery sanctions, subject to
reversal only for abuse. [Citations.] The trial court should consider both the
conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party seeking discovery and, in
choosing a sanction, should “‘attempt[] to tailor the sanction to the harm
caused by the withheld discovery.’” [Citation.] The trial court cannot impose
sanctions for misuse of the discovery process as a punishment. [Citation.] [¶]
The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,
starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of
termination. “Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction,
and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the
party entitled to but denied discovery.’” [Citation.] If a lesser sanction
fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of
the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the
sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.’” (Padron v. Watchtower Bible
& Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 1246,
1259-1260, quoting Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992; accord Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1202,
1217 [“Discovery sanctions must be tailored in order to remedy the offending
party’s discovery abuse, should not give the aggrieved party more than what it
is entitled to, and should not be used to punish the offending party”].) 
B.
Analysis
1. Terminating Sanctions
a. Relevant
Law
Terminating sanctions are drastic
sanctions that should be imposed sparingly and only when it is clear that the
party to be sanctioned has left no viable alternatives. (See Dept. of
Forestry & Fire. Prot. v. Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191,
disapproved on other grounds in Presbyterian Camp & Conf. Ctrs, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493; Lopez v. Watchtower Bible &
Tract Soc’y (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)
The court should consider the
totality of the circumstances before ordering terminating sanctions, including
(1) whether the conduct of the party was willful, (2) the detriment to the
party propounding discovery, and (3) the number of formal and informal attempts
to obtain the discovery. (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (Los
Defensores).) The Court is not required to find that a party acted
in bad faith before imposing terminating sanctions. (See Creed-21 v. City of
Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 703.)
If terminating sanctions are
warranted, the Court may make:
(1) An order striking all or parts
of the pleadings (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(1); Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992; Van Sickle v.
Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1519 [trial court struck defendant’s
answer]);
(2) An order staying proceedings
until a party obeys a discovery order (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d)(2); Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at
p. 992);
(3) An order dismissing all or part
of a party’s action (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(3); Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; see, e.g., Crawford
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1265, 1271 [dismissal proper
when party threatened to use pepper spray and taser on opposing counsel at
deposition and was openly contemptuous of trial court]); and
(4) An order rendering a default
judgment against a party (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(4); Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; see,
e.g., Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th
1161, 1183-1184 [defendant’s pervasive and consistent misuse of discovery
process supported court’s dismissal of answer and entry of default judgment];
but see Nickell v. Matlock (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 934, 943-944 [Code
Civ. Proc., § 764.010 prohibits court from rendering judgment by default as
discovery sanction in quiet title actions]).
b. Parties’
Arguments
Defendant Fregoso argues in
relevant part that terminating sanctions are warranted here because Plaintiff
Nevarez has failed to serve responses to FROGs, SROGs, and RPDs, Set One. Defendant
Fregoso elaborates that Plaintiff Nevarez’s conduct has directly and severely
prejudiced Defendant Fregoso’s ability to prepare for trial because the
discovery at issue goes directly to the substance of Plaintiff Nevarez’s claims
of both liability and damages, as well as Defendant Fregoso’s own crossclaims
against Plaintiff Nevarez. For example, Defendant Fregoso argues that he
remains unaware of what property Plaintiff Nevarez claims he contributed to the
business, what work Plaintiff Nevarez did for the business, what evidence
Plaintiff Nevarez has to support his claims, and what evidence Plaintiff
Nevarez has to defend against Defendant Fregoso’s claims. Under these
circumstances, Defendant Fregoso argues that terminating sanctions should be
granted.
No opposition appears in the
record.
c. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of
Defendant Fregoso as to terminating sanctions. 
As noted above, Plaintiff has
willfully failed to comply with this Court’s January 19, 2024, order by failing
to serve responses to FROGs, SROGs, and RPDs, Set One. There is a clear
detriment to Defendant Fregoso, who is unable to prepare for the trial that is
set on the continued date of May 21, 2024—six days from the hearing on this
motion—absent responses to this discovery. (See Sauer v. Superior Court
(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 213, 229 (Sauer) [“An important aspect of
legitimate discovery from a defendant’s point of view is the ascertainment, in
advance of trial, of the specific components of plaintiff’s case so that appropriate
preparations can be made to meet them”].) And Defendant Fregoso has employed
various formal and informal methods for seeking responses to FROGs, SROGs, and
RPDs, Set One, such as sending meet and confer letters, filing multiple motions
to compel further responses on November 3, 2023, and sending Plaintiff Nevarez
and counsel notice of this Court’s January 19, 2024, ruling. (Mot., Marchetti
Decl., ¶ 9; see 11/3/23 FROGs Mot., Marchetti Decl., ¶¶ 3-6.) These three factors
support terminating sanctions. (Los Defensores, supra, 223
Cal.App.4th at p. 390.)
Given the drastic remedy, and the
incremental approach appropriate to terminating sanctions, the Court would ordinarily
be inclined to deny terminating sanctions in favor of issue or evidence
sanctions. But here, the discovery at issue was served on May 11, 2023, and at
this time, more than a year later and past the discovery date, Plaintiff
Nevarez has completely failed to respond to FROGs, SROGs, and RPDs, Set One, in
contravention of this Court’s January 19, 2024, order, which ordered compliance
within 21 days.
Plaintiff Nevarez has otherwise also
failed to participate in these proceedings. Plaintiff Nevarez did not oppose
the four motions to compel filed by Defendant Fregoso on November 3, 2023, nor
did Plaintiff Nevarez file an opposition to Defendant Fregoso’s motion for
terminating sanctions. At the Court’s hearing on November 6, 2023, where he
confirmed he was representing himself, he was admonished to respond to the
motions to compel and the trial date was continued at that time because of the
pending motions to compel which were then scheduled to be heard just days
before the initial trial date. Thus there has already been a continuance
granted to him to allow him time to respond, but Mr. Nevarez failed to respond
in any way. Plaintiff Nevarez has failed to file declarations explaining his
nonresponse to FROGs, SROGs, and RPDs, Set One. Plaintiff Nevarez has not even
submitted trial documents. It thus appears that Plaintiff Nevarez has abandoned
these proceedings, particularly where a jury trial in this action is set for May
21, 2024, a mere six days after this hearing.
Next, the imposition of mere
evidence sanctions or issue sanctions instead of terminating sanctions may
result in an unmerited boon to Plaintiff Nevarez. Specifically, as compared to Sauer,
“[i]mposition of a lesser sanction [c]ould … allow[] [Plaintiff] to benefit
from his delay by forcing [Defendants] into the unfavorable position of
proceeding to trial ill-prepared to meet [Plaintiff’s] … damage[s] claim[s].”
(See Sauer, supra, 195 Cal.App.3d at p. 230.)
Last, the Court notes that even if
Plaintiff Nevarez were to blame Cristina Saca for the failure to respond to
discovery and to obey this Court’s January 19, 2024, order, an attorney’s
conduct is imputed to the client absent a showing of positive misconduct by the
attorney that effectively obliterates the existence of the attorney-client
relationship. (Id. at p. 231.) No positive misconduct has been
shown by Cristina Saca. Indeed, despite the ambiguity of Ms. Saca’s initial
limited scope notice and her subsequent general appearance by her filing of an
Answer, Mr. Nevarez appeared at the hearing on November 6, 2023 and confirmed
to the court that he was representing himself. There is no evidence before the
Court to show that Cristina Saca, not Plaintiff Nevarez, bears the blame for
non-response.
Terminating sanctions are thus
GRANTED.
Orders in relation to terminating
sanctions are set forth in the Conclusion below.
2. Issue
or Evidence Sanctions
 Because the Court has granted terminating
sanctions, the request for issue and evidence sanctions is MOOT.
3. Monetary
Sanctions
The Court adopts its discussion in
Section II.B.1.c. above to determine that because Plaintiff Nevarez has engaged
in disobedience of this Court’s January 19, 2024, order, monetary sanctions
against him are proper.
The Court also determines that
$1,661.65 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Nevarez is an eminently
reasonable sanction for work performed in relation to this motion.
Last, the Court notes that the
moving papers limit the sanctions request to Plaintiff Nevarez and do not
mention Cristina Saca in relation to sanctions.
Monetary sanctions are thus GRANTED
in the amount of $1,661.65 as against Plaintiff Nevarez alone. 
III. Conclusion
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Norberto Fregoso and Defendant Complete
Industrial Repair, Inc.’s Motion for Sanctions Against
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Abel Nevarez is GRANTED in part and MOOT in part as
follows:
(1) GRANTED as to terminating sanctions;
(2) MOOT as to issue or evidence sanctions; and
(3) GRANTED as to monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,661.65.
The Court STRIKES Plaintiff Nevarez’s September 8, 2022, First Amended
Complaint, STRIKES Plaintiff Nevarez’s December 13, 2022, Answer to
Cross-Complaint and ENTERS DEFAULT on the Cross-Complaint as against Plaintiff
Nevarez.
