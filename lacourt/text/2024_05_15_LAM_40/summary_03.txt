Here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrers of Defendant State Farm General Insurance Company and Defendant Peter Geoffrey Bullen, as well as the motion to strike of Defendant State Farm General Insurance Company.

As to the demurrer of Defendant State Farm General Insurance Company, the Court finds that the Complaint's fifth cause of action (breach of contractual duty to pay a covered claim) fails to allege that Plaintiff Stalley has performed or was excused from performing his obligations under the contract with State Farm. The Court also finds that the Complaint's sixth cause of action (breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing) fails to plead performance or excuse of contractual obligations.

As to the demurrer of Defendant Bullen, the Court finds that the lease agreement attached to the Complaint contradicts the allegations in the body of the Complaint, and that no contractual relationship is alleged between Plaintiff Stalley and Defendant Bullen.

The Court does not reach Defendant State Farm's other arguments based on this result. The Court finds that the seventh cause of action (bad faith) is not duplicative of the sixth cause of action, and therefore overrules the demurrer.

The Court denies Defendant State Farm's motion to strike punitive damages alleged against it in the Complaint.

In conclusion, the Court sustains Defendant State Farm's demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action, with leave to amend, and overrules the demurrer to the seventh cause of action. The Court sustains Defendant Bullen's demurrer to the first cause of action, with leave to amend.

The Plaintiff is to file any amended pleading within 14 calendar days.
