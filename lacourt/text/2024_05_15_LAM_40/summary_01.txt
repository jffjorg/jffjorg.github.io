And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the motion to consolidate the two cases, citing concerns about the timing of the motion and the potential confusion and prejudice that may arise from consolidating the cases at this late stage in the proceedings. The judge also denied the request to continue the trial, finding that the moving parties have not shown good cause for the continuance and that the trial date has been firm for some time. The judge noted that the moving parties have not acted diligently in bringing their claims and that there is no reason to delay the trial further.
