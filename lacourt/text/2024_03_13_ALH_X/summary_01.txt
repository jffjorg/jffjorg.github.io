Summary in English text:

Judge Joel L. Lofton has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Darrene Triplett and Debra Thompkins v. Choice Hotels Insurance, Inc., et al. The case involves allegations of bedbug bites suffered by the plaintiffs while staying at a hotel operated by the defendants. The defendants have moved to compel further responses to their discovery requests, which were served on September 30, 2022. The court has denied the motion, finding that the defendants failed to attach a separate statement as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subdivision (a). Additionally, the court found that the motions were procedurally deficient because they were filed after the 45-day window for filing a motion to compel further responses.
