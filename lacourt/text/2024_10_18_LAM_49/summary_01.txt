And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Truck Insurance Exchange to the Seventh and Eighth Causes of Action in the First Amended Complaint. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that Plaintiff Marco Aiello cannot re-file the same claims. The judge's ruling is based on the argument that Plaintiff does not have a cause of action against Defendant Truck Insurance Exchange because he is not a named insured in the policy and a non-insured cannot sue the carrier directly for breach of contract, unless and until he obtains a judgment against the other Defendants. The judge notes that Plaintiff may still have a cause of action against the other Defendants, but only if he obtains a judgment against them. The judge's ruling is subject to change if any party submits written opposition or other arguments before the hearing.
