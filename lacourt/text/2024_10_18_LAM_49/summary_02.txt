```

The Judge's Tentative Ruling is that the Defendant's Demurrer to the Seventh and Eighth Causes of Action is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. The court finds that the Plaintiff does not have a cause of action against the Defendant, as the Plaintiff is not a party to the insurance policy and does not have the status of a third-party beneficiary. The court notes that if the Plaintiff obtains a judgment against the other defendants, it may be considered a third-party beneficiary of the policy.
