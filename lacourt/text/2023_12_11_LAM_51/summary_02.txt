This tentative ruling addresses a summary judgment motion filed by the Moving Defendants in a case related to hazardous materials. The court notes that the Court of Appeal recently emphasized the importance of drafting a compliant separate statement when filing a summary judgment motion. The Moving Defendants argue that the parties agreed that the ruling on this motion would apply to the Plaintiffs in other related cases. However, the court declines to address certain arguments related to the Firefighter's Rule, which concerns knowledge of hazardous materials. The court finds that Mr. Lee, an agent of the Moving Defendants, has knowledge that would be imputed to the Moving Defendants, citing California Civil Code ยง 2332.
