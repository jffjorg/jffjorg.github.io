And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Ford Motor Company's demurrer to the Clarks' First Amended Complaint will be continued to a date to be determined at the hearing. The judge finds that Ford's counsel did not adequately meet and confer with the Clarks' counsel regarding the demurrer. Ford's counsel filed a declaration stating that they met and conferred telephonically on November 28, 2023, but they did not describe any code-compliant attempts to meet and confer after the Clarks filed the operative FAC on January 3, 2024. The judge orders Ford's counsel to meet and confer with the Clarks' counsel regarding the demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing.
