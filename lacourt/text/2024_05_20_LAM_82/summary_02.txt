And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is denying the petition, regardless of whether it challenges the original hauler license fee of 11%. The court finds that the claim is untimely, as it was not subject to the publication and posting requirement under Government Code section 36933. Additionally, the court is striking a brief submitted by the petitioner's counsel because it was not properly authenticated and filed. The court will not consider the unauthenticated documents. The court also finds that the claim would be untimely even if the four-year "catchall" limitations period applies.
