```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the cross-defendants' ex parte application in part and denies it in part. The court orders the parties to grant full access and control over certain facilities, financial accounts, and records to Rabbi Darzan Levihim and/or his designee(s). The court also orders the parties to provide access to security and surveillance equipment and utility accounts. The court does not intervene in religious matters, but rather puts control of the temple in the hands of the religious leaders. The court assumes that the leaders will proceed in a manner consistent with the temple's policies and procedures, as well as the law. The court orders the parties to meet and confer on a proposed order and sets a date for an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.
