**Case Summary:**

The tentative ruling denies the petition for writ of mandate filed by Key Disposal & Recycling, Inc. (Petitioner) against the City of Commerce (Respondent). The petition challenges the City's decision to increase the hauler license fee from 11% to 15% and alleges that the City failed to comply with the publication and posting requirements of Government Code section 36933.

The court finds that the petition is untimely, as the three-year statute of limitations under Code of Civil Procedure section 338(a) has expired. The court also finds that Petitioner lacks standing to challenge the increase in the hauler license fee, as it was not subject to the increased fee.

Regarding the merits of the petition, the court finds that the hauler license fee is exempt from Article XIII C of the California Constitution, which requires a vote by the electorate before imposing a tax. The court cites the California Supreme Court's decision in Zolly v. City of Oakland (2022) 13 Cal.5th 780, which held that a franchise fee is exempt from the requirements of Article XIII C if it is paid in exchange for a specific use of government property.

In this case, the court finds that the hauler license fee was paid in exchange for a specific use of government property, namely, the privilege to use the City's public streets in a way that is not available to the general public. The court concludes that the fee is exempt from the requirements of Article XIII C and that the City did not violate Government Code section 36933.
