[1] Regardless, even
if this petition encompasses a challenge to the original hauler license fee of
11 percent, the court would deny the writ. 
As will be discussed, the claim would be 
untimely and Resolution 18-21 was not subject to the publication/posting
requirement under Government Code section 36933. 
 
 


[2] Inexplicably, after briefing was completed and the court
posted a tentative order, Petitioner’s counsel submitted a “brief statement of
true fact correcting this court’s tentative order dated 5/8/2024,” arguing that
Petitioner paid the higher tax.  The
brief was accompanied by no declaration and two unauthenticated documents.  The court strikes this brief and shall not
consider the unauthenticated documents. 
This argument should have been made in the reply brief—in response to a
clear argument in the opposition brief—and the documents should have been
authenticated and filed with that brief, which was due 15 days before the
hearing.  As such, it is improper.  


[3] Petitioner’s
claim would be untimely even if the four-year “catchall” limitations period
applies.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 343.)
