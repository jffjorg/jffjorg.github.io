Pursuant to CCP §§ 430.41 and 435.5(a), Defense
counsel’s efforts meet and confer requirement with Plaintiff’s counsel were unsuccessful.
(Omar Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. A.) “Any
determination by the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient
shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).) As
the failure to meet and confer does not constitute grounds to overrule a
demurrer, the court continues to the merits.
