And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for leave to intervene in the action brought by NTS Technical Systems, LLC. NTS is seeking to intervene in the action to assert its own claims against the defendants for the explosion that occurred at its facility. The judge finds that NTS has a direct and immediate interest in the action and that intervention will not enlarge the issues in the litigation. The judge also finds that the reasons for intervention outweigh any opposition by the parties. The judge orders NTS to electronically file a copy of its complaint in intervention following the hearing. The parties are ordered to attend the hearing to provide updates on the status of any other lawsuits regarding this matter.
