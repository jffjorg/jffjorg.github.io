And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, and financial elder abuse. The judge has found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged bad faith and financial elder abuse by the defendant. The judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer as to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action.

The judge has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the allegations for punitive damages, but with 20 days leave to amend. The judge has ruled that the allegations for punitive damages are insufficient and do not meet the requirements of Civil Code ยง 3294.

The judge has given notice of this order to the defendant and granted the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint if necessary.
