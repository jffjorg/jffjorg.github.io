**Background**

* Plaintiff alleges that he was involved in an automobile accident on September 19, 2018, while working for FedEx
* Plaintiff alleges that FedEx and Protective Insurance Corporation failed to disclose UMBI coverage, which led to a settlement with the other party's insurance company

**Demurrer**

* FedEx demurs to all causes of action, arguing that they are barred by the litigation privilege and exclusive remedy in workers' compensation

* The demurrer is sustained as to the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th causes of action for declaratory relief, breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and violation of Business & Professions Code, ยง 17200 et seq., respectively, without leave to amend
* The court will hear oral argument regarding whether leave to amend is proper
* Defendant shall give notice of this order

**Significant Statements**

* The litigation privilege applies to the facts of the FAC, as FedEx's discovery responses were produced in the Norris/Haddad underlying cases to achieve the objects of the litigations and had some connection or logical relation to the actions
* The exclusive remedy in workers' compensation is the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee or his or her dependents against the employer, except as specifically provided in the Workers' Compensation Act
* Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to show that FedEx committed fraud against him that would take this action outside the scope of workers' compensation
