  [TENTATIVE] order RE:
petition to confirm contractual arbitration award
 



            
BACKGROUND 
A.   
Petition Allegations 
Petitioner Forward Financing, LLC filed a Petition to Confirm
Contractual Arbitration Award against Respondents Special Effects Unlimited,
Inc. dba Special Effects Unlimited (“Special Effects”) and Pamela Elliot
(“Elliot”).  According to the petition,
the parties entered into a written Future Receipts Sales Agreement on August 8,
2022, which included an arbitration provision at section 10.  (Pet., Attachment 4(b).)  The underlying dispute was based on
Respondents’ alleged breach of the agreement whereby the parties agreed
Petitioner would purchase $106,400 worth of future receivables for $69,005 from
Respondents.  Respondents had allegedly failed
to pay Petitioner the weekly rate of $3,325 until the $106,400 was paid.  (Pet., ¶5.) 

The matter went to arbitration on July 21, 2023 in Boston,
Massachusetts before Arbitrator Anne W. Larkin. 
(Pet., ¶¶6-7.)  The Award of
Arbitrator was made that same day, which required Respondents to pay to
Petitioner the amount of $60,160.  (Pet.,
¶8; Attachment 8(c).)  Petitioner alleges
that a signed copy of the award was served on July 21, 2023.  (Pet., ¶9(b).)  
Petitioner filed this petition on August 14, 2023.  It now requests that the Court confirm the
award and enter judgment according to the Award of Arbitrator.
DISCUSSION
A.   
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timeliness of the
Petition 
            CCP § 1288 states: “A petition to confirm an award shall be served and filed not later than four
years after the date of service of a signed copy of the award on the
petitioner. A petition to vacate an award or to
correct an award shall be served and filed not later than 100 days after the
date of the service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.”  “No petition may be served and filed under
this chapter until at least 10 days after service of the signed copy of the
award upon the petitioner.”  (CCP
§ 1288.4.) Under CCP § 1290.2, no less than 10 days’ notice must be provided to
the responding party before any hearing on the confirmation petition.  
The arbitration took place on July 21, 2023.  (Pet., ¶7.) 
The Award of Arbitrator was entered on July 21, 2023, which required
Respondents to pay Petitioner the amount of $60,160.  (Pet., ¶8; Attachment 8(c).)  In the letter attached to the Award of
Arbitrator, a signed copy of the award was actually served on July 21, 2023.  (Pet., ¶9; see Attachment 8(c).)  
On August 28, 2023, Petitioner filed a proof of service of the petition
papers on Defendant Special Effects by personally serving Elliot on August 25,
2023 at 12:38 p.m. at 8942 Lankershim Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 91352.  Although Elliot was personally served with
the documents on behalf of Special Effects, the proof of service indicates that
the service was completed as to Special Effects only.  While service has been properly made on
Special Effects, a separate proof of service has not been filed with respect to
Elliot.  
At this time, since there is no proof of service regarding the petition
documents on Elliot, the Court cannot ascertain whether the petition was timely
filed and served as to Elliot. 
B.    
Merits of Petition 
            The petition includes
a copy of the Future Receipts Sale Agreement (i.e., the underlying written
agreement between the parties), which is attached as Attachment 4(b) to the
petition.  Section 10 includes the “Mandatory
Arbitration of Disputes / Waivers” term. 
Section 10(a) states that the parties agree that any court with
jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator’s award, which will be
final and binding.    
The arbitration was conducted by Anne W. Larkin on July 21, 2023 with
the AAA in Boston, Massachusetts.  (Pet.,
¶¶6-7.)  According to the Award of
Arbitrator, Petitioner appeared through its in-house counsel and Respondents
failed to appear through their attorney to the arbitration hearing.  The arbitrator reviewed the evidence and
determined that Respondents owed to Petitioner $60,160, which included $58,975 in
damages, $47.50 in a financing charge, and $1,137.50 for administrative fees
and arbitration costs.  Pursuant to the
agreement, Respondents were jointly and severally liable for the amount
awarded.  
             According to the petition, Petitioner seeks
confirmation of the Award and entry of judgment according to its terms.  (Pet., ¶10.) 

            Thus, there is substantive merit to
granting this petition.  However, the
Court would like to verify Elliot was served with the petition documents and is
aware that the case is against not only Special Effects but Elliot as an
individual as well.  As such, the Court
will continue the hearing on this petition. 

CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Petitioner Forward
Financing, LLC’s petition to confirm the arbitrator’s Award of Arbitrator is continued
to December 1, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. in order to provide time for Petitioner to
serve Respondent Pamela Elliot with the petition papers or file a proof of
service of the petition.  The parties’
opposition and reply briefs, if any, shall be filed and served pursuant to code
deadlines.  
Petitioner shall provide notice of this order.
