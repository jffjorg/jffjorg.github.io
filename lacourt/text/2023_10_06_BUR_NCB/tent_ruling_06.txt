[1] The Protective
Declaration Page names FedEx as the insured. 
Coverage C is for Uninsured and Underinsured Motorists and states under
the “Included” section “SEE ENDORSEMENT NO. 4.” 
The full language of Endorsement No. 4 and the rest of the insurance
policy terms are no provided.  Thus, it
cannot be ascertained whether FedEx only opted for an Uninsured Motorist
policy, Underinsured Motorist policy, or both.
