 Case Number:  23STCP01654    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  68 Motion to Amend Judgment to Correct a Clerical Error
Labor Commissioner, State of California vs. Elissa
Brassfield, et al., 23STCP01654

Moving Party: Plaintiff Labor
Commissioner, State of California

Background
            Plaintiff
Labor Commissioner, State of California (Plaintiff) filed this motion to amend
judgment to correct a clerical error pursuant to CCP § 473(d). Because of the
Labor Commissioner’s clerical error, an incorrect total judgment amount was included
on the Request that Clerk Enter Judgment and Judgment filed with the Court on
March 4, 2023.
            The amount
on those documents that was entered was $596.102.13. This was based on the
citation that was originally issued to Defendants. However, Defendants appealed
the citation, and the Findings and Order issued by the administrative hearing
officer after the appeal modified the amount. The correct amount, based on the
Findings and Order, should be $189,594.19. (Motion at p. 2.)
            Due to an
error of the Officer Technician handling the case, the wrong amount was put on
the Request for Judgment documents. Plaintiff became aware of the error when it
was reported by Defendants’ counsel. (Motion at p. 3.)
            Plaintiff
now seeks to correct the judgment to reflect the correct amount.
Analysis
            The court
is authorized to amend judgments to correct clerical mistakes pursuant to CCP §
473(d). It states: 
“The court may, upon motion of the
injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or
orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may,
on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void
judgment or order.”
            In this
case, Plaintiff has provided evidence that due to a clerical error, the wrong
judgment amount was entered against Defendants. The judgment currently states
that the amount is $596.102.13, but it should be $189,594.19.
            The Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion to amend the judgment to correct this error.
Order
            Plaintiff’s
motion to amend the judgment to correct a clerical error is GRANTED. The
correct judgment amount is $189,594.19.
