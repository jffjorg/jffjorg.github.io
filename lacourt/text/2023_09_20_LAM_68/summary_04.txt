The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendants William Hernandez, dba Aspire Property Management, and H&K Management LLC, and a motion to strike filed by defendants. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint in stating causes of action for tortious breach of the warranty of habitability and breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment. The court has ruled that the plaintiff has pled facts sufficient to maintain these causes of action and has therefore overruled the demurrer. The motion to strike, which sought to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages, was denied due to the defendants' failure to comply with the Rules of Court. The defendants are ordered to file an answer within 15 days.

The judge specifically rejects Defendants' arguments that Plaintiff's claims for breach of warranty of habitability and breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment lack sufficient evidence.  The judge states that Plaintiff's allegations about numerous problems with the property, including infestations, mold, and dysfunctional systems, are enough to support these claims.

Additionally, the judge denies Defendants' motion to strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages because Defendants did not properly follow the court's rules when filing their motion.
