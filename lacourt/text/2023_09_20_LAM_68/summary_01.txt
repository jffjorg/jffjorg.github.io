And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside a default. The defendant, Miguel A. Lopez, filed the motion on August 9, 2023, arguing that the default should be set aside due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The defendant claimed that he attempted to file an answer with the court on February 15, 2023, but it was never received. The court notes that the defendant is a self-represented litigant and recognizes that he may not have been familiar with the rules of civil procedure.

The court concludes that the defendant's motion was timely, as it was filed within the six-month period allowed by CCP ยง 473(b). However, the court denies the motion without prejudice because the defendant failed to comply with the requirement to file a copy of the proposed answer with the application for relief. The court notes that while some cases have given this requirement a more liberal interpretation, the defendant has not filed any responsive pleading. Therefore, the court denies the motion and allows the defendant to refile with a proposed answer.
