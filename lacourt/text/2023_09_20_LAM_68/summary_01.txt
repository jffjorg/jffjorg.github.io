And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside a default. The defendant, Miguel A. Lopez, filed the motion on August 9, 2023, arguing that the default should be set aside due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The defendant claimed that he attempted to file an answer with the court on February 15, 2023, but it was never received. The court notes that the defendant is a self-represented litigant and recognizes that he may not have been familiar with the rules of civil procedure.

The court concludes that the defendant's motion was timely, as it was filed within the six-month period allowed by CCP § 473(b). However, the court denies the motion without prejudice because the defendant failed to comply with the requirement to file a copy of the proposed answer with the application for relief. The court notes that while some cases have given this requirement a more liberal interpretation, the defendant has not filed any responsive pleading. Therefore, the court denies the motion and allows the defendant to refile with a proposed answer.

## English Summary:

The tentative ruling in this case concerns a Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default filed by Defendant Miguel A. Lopez. Defendant argues that the default judgment against him should be vacated due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. He claims he attempted to file an answer on February 15, 2023, but it was not received by the court. 

The Judge acknowledges Defendant's status as a self-represented litigant and considers his lack of knowledge of court procedures. The Court finds that Defendant's delay in filing the motion was lengthy but likely within the permissible timeframe. However, the crucial issue is Defendant's failure to attach a copy of the proposed answer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b). 

Despite the Judge's recognition of Defendant's effort to participate in the litigation, the lack of a proposed answer leads to the denial of the motion without prejudice. This means Defendant can refile the motion if he provides the required proposed answer.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to set aside a default judgment without prejudice. The defendant, a self-represented litigant, filed the motion on August 9, 2023, arguing that the default should be set aside due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The defendant claimed that he attempted to file an answer with the court on February 15, 2023, but it was not accepted. However, he failed to provide evidence of the answer he allegedly tried to file and did not attach a proposed answer to his motion.

The judge recognized that the defendant is not familiar with the rules governing civil cases and viewed his conduct through that lens. The judge concluded that the defendant's motion was timely, as it was filed within six months of the default judgment being entered. However, the judge denied the motion because the defendant failed to comply with the requirement that a proposed answer be filed with the application for relief. The judge also noted that the defendant did not participate in the litigation until after the default judgment was entered and did not file a proposed answer until after the motion was filed.

The judge cited several cases to support the requirement that a proposed answer be filed with the application for relief, including Nevada Bank of California v. Dresbach and Bailiff v. Hildebrandt. The judge also noted that while the defendant's delay in filing the motion was lengthy, the defendant's motion was made within the six-month period required by the statute. However, the judge denied the motion because the defendant failed to comply with the mandatory requirement that a proposed answer be filed with the application for relief.

The Judge's tentative ruling is to deny Defendant Miguel A. Lopez's motion to set aside default without prejudice because he failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of filing a proposed answer or other responsive pleading. Although the Court recognizes Defendant's delay in filing the motion was lengthy and he is a self-represented litigant, his conduct does not excuse him from the obligation to file a proposed answer. The Court held that a motion for relief from default may substantially comply with section 473 if a proposed answer is filed sufficiently in advance of the hearing, but Defendant has filed nothing. Therefore, based on the failure of Defendant to have filed any responsive pleading, the Court shall deny the motion without prejudice.

## English Summary:

The judge has tentatively decided to deny the defendant's motion to set aside a default judgment against him.  The judge acknowledges that the defendant, representing himself in court, may not be familiar with proper procedures. However, the judge finds that the defendant did not follow the rules for filing an answer to the lawsuit, and he did not include a proposed answer with his motion, which is a mandatory requirement under California law. 

While the judge recognizes that the defendant attempted to file an answer and participated in a previous court hearing, the lack of a proposed pleading and the delay in filing the motion ultimately lead to the denial. The denial is "without prejudice," meaning the defendant can refile the motion if he provides a proposed answer and addresses the other issues raised by the judge.

English-text summary:
The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to set aside/vacate default filed by Defendant Miguel A. Lopez shall be denied without prejudice. The reason for the denial is that Defendant failed to comply with the mandate of Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b), which requires that a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed accompany the application for relief. Although Defendant's motion was timely and he participated in the Case Management Conference, he failed to include a proposed answer with the motion or at any time after the motion was filed. The Court recognizes that Defendant is a self-represented litigant and views his conduct through that lens, but ultimately concludes that the failure to comply with the mandatory requirement of Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) is the basis for the denial of the motion.
