And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant, Islick Trading LLC, argues that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because it does not have sufficient minimum contacts with California. The plaintiff, Matevosian Enterprises, Inc. dba Nationwide Distributor, argues that the court has general and specific jurisdiction over the defendant.

The judge finds that the court does not have general jurisdiction over the defendant because the defendant does not have offices, employees, bank accounts, or real property in California. The judge also finds that the court does not have specific jurisdiction over the defendant because the defendant has not purposefully availed itself of the forum benefits. The judge notes that the defendant's contacts with California are limited to its business with the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff has not presented evidence of any other contacts.

As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons, finding that the court does not have jurisdiction over the defendant.
