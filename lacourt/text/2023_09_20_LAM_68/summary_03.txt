And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant, Islick Trading LLC, argues that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because it does not have sufficient minimum contacts with California. The plaintiff, Matevosian Enterprises, Inc. dba Nationwide Distributor, argues that the court has general and specific jurisdiction over the defendant.

The judge finds that the court does not have general jurisdiction over the defendant because the defendant does not have offices, employees, bank accounts, or real property in California. The judge also finds that the court does not have specific jurisdiction over the defendant because the defendant has not purposefully availed itself of the forum benefits. The judge notes that the defendant's contacts with California are limited to its business with the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff has not presented evidence of any other contacts.

As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons, finding that the court does not have jurisdiction over the defendant.

## English Summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant, Islick Trading LLC, in a breach of contract lawsuit brought by Plaintiff, Matevosian Enterprises, Inc. Defendant argues that the California court lacks personal jurisdiction over them because their contacts with California are insufficient.

The Judge agrees with Defendant. The ruling states that Defendant, a New Jersey corporation, lacks the "substantial, continuous, and systematic" contacts with California necessary for general jurisdiction.  

The Judge also finds that Defendant's contacts with California, primarily through their business relationship with Plaintiff, are not sufficient to establish "purposeful availment" of the forum, which is required for specific jurisdiction. The fact that the parties' contract negotiations allegedly occurred remotely does not suggest Defendant intentionally directed their activities towards California.

Therefore, the Judge grants Defendant's motion to quash service of summons, meaning the lawsuit cannot proceed in California at this time.

The Judge's tentative ruling is to grant Defendant's motion to quash service of summons because the court does not have general or specific jurisdiction over Defendant. The Judge states that Plaintiff has not provided evidence of Defendant's offices, employees, bank accounts, or real property in California and that Defendant does not appear to have contacts that are substantial, continuous, and systematic. Additionally, the Judge states that any contract between the parties would not be enough to establish purposeful availment, and there is no indication that the action arises out of conduct in California.
