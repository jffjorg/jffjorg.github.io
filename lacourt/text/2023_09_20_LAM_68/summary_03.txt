And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The defendant, Islick Trading LLC, argues that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because it does not have sufficient minimum contacts with California. The plaintiff, Matevosian Enterprises, Inc. dba Nationwide Distributor, argues that the court has general and specific jurisdiction over the defendant.

The judge finds that the court does not have general jurisdiction over the defendant because the defendant does not have offices, employees, bank accounts, or real property in California. The judge also finds that the court does not have specific jurisdiction over the defendant because the defendant has not purposefully availed itself of the forum benefits. The judge notes that the defendant's contacts with California are limited to its business with the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff has not presented evidence of any other contacts.

As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons, finding that the court does not have jurisdiction over the defendant.

## English Summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant, Islick Trading LLC, in a breach of contract lawsuit brought by Plaintiff, Matevosian Enterprises, Inc. Defendant argues that the California court lacks personal jurisdiction over them because their contacts with California are insufficient.

The Judge agrees with Defendant. The ruling states that Defendant, a New Jersey corporation, lacks the "substantial, continuous, and systematic" contacts with California necessary for general jurisdiction.  

The Judge also finds that Defendant's contacts with California, primarily through their business relationship with Plaintiff, are not sufficient to establish "purposeful availment" of the forum, which is required for specific jurisdiction. The fact that the parties' contract negotiations allegedly occurred remotely does not suggest Defendant intentionally directed their activities towards California.

Therefore, the Judge grants Defendant's motion to quash service of summons, meaning the lawsuit cannot proceed in California at this time.

## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Islick Trading LLC. The Defendant argues that the California court lacks personal jurisdiction over them because they are a New Jersey-based company and their contacts with California are insufficient. 

The Plaintiff argues that the court has both general and specific jurisdiction over Defendant because of their ongoing business relationship spanning over five years. However, the judge finds that Plaintiff has not provided enough evidence to demonstrate that Defendant's activities in California are substantial, continuous, and systematic, which is necessary for general jurisdiction. 

Additionally, the judge finds that the Plaintiff has not shown that the Defendant purposefully availed themselves of the benefits of the California forum, which is required for specific jurisdiction. 

Therefore, the judge grants the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons, meaning the lawsuit cannot proceed in California at this time.

**Motion to Quash Service of Summons**

**Parties:**
- Matevosian Enterprises, Inc. dba Nationwide Distributor (Plaintiff)
- Islick Trading LLC (Defendant)

**Key People & Companies:**
- Matevosian Enterprises, Inc.
- Islick Trading LLC

**Factual Background:**
- Defendant Islick Trading LLC filed a motion to quash service of summons on June 14, 2023, arguing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendant.

**Legal Standard:**
- CCP § 418.10(a)(1) allows a defendant to challenge jurisdiction by a motion to quash.
- Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing factual bases for jurisdiction.
- A plaintiff must present competent evidence showing that the defendant's contacts related to the causes of action are sufficient to constitute minimum contacts justifying jurisdiction.

   - Defendant is a New Jersey corporation headquartered in New Jersey.
   - This Court has no general jurisdiction over Defendant.
2. **Specific Jurisdiction:**

   - Defendant has interjected itself into California only through its business relationship with Plaintiff.
   - No indication that the action arises out of conduct in California.
   - This Court does not have specific jurisdiction over Defendant.
