And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to continue the City of Pomona's motion for the appointment of a receiver in a nuisance abatement action against the Passport Inn. The City had alleged that the motel was a public nuisance and sought the appointment of a receiver to abate the nuisance. However, the Judge found that the data provided by the City was insufficient to justify the appointment of a receiver. The Judge noted that the motel had generated a total of 11 calls for service from April 18, 2024, to August 11, 2024, but only 2 of those calls related to prostitution. The Judge also found that the City had failed to provide sufficient data to compare the volume of calls for service at the Passport Inn against other motels and/or businesses in the area. As a result, the Judge ordered the City to provide additional data, including the number of calls for service to the Pomona Police Department from 2020 to present for each motel/hotel along Holt Avenue in the City of Pomona. The Judge also admonished the defendants' counsel not to make unsupported or unsubstantiated assertions or representations of fact in a pleading without proper evidentiary support. The hearing on the motion will be continued to a date to be determined.
