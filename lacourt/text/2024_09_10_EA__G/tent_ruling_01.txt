  Case Number:  23PSCV02585    Hearing Date:   September 10, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Orlando Garcia’s Application for Default  Judgment Respondent: NO OPPOSITION FINAL RULING Plaintiff Orlando Garcia’s Application for Default  Judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $7,826.19. BACKGROUND This  is a disability rights action. Plaintiff Orlando Garcia is physically disabled  and relies on mobility devices such as wheelchairs to ambulate. Defendant  Hideco Investment LLC (Hideco) allegedly owns a property in Covina upon which Defendant  Country Liquor Market 2, Inc. (Country Liquor) operates a liquor store. In June  2023, Garcia visited Country Liquor for the purpose of making a purchase and  conducting disability access testing. Garcia alleges the following barriers to  access existed, including narrow paths of travel and non-compliant door  hardware. On August  23, 2023, Garcia filed a complaint against Hideco, Country Liquor, and Does 1-50,  alleging (1) violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA) and (2) violation of  the California Disabled Persons Act (DPA). On September 5, 2023, Garica served  Country Liquor with substitute service in Covina. On September 11, 2023, Garica  served Hideco with substitute service in Long Beach. On  March 4, 2024, Garcia dismissed Hideco from the present action. On  April 16, 2024, the court entered default against Country Liquor after they  failed to file an answer. On June 26, 2024, Garcia submitted an application for  default judgment. On August 12, 2024, Garcia submitted the present application  for default judgment. An OSC Re: Default Judgment  is set for September 9, 2024. LEGAL STANDARD Code  of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a  party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on  the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a  brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in  support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)  a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a  dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application  for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for  each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees  if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of  Court 3.1800.) ANALYSIS Garcia  seeks default judgment against Country Liquor in the total amount of $11,268.69,  including $4,000.00 in damages, $5,445.00 in attorney fees, and $1,823.69 in  costs. Because the Court finds Garcia has submitted sufficient evidence, the Court  GRANTS Garcia’s application for default judgment with the following  modification. While Garcia requests the court award $5,445.00 in attorney fees,  the court finds this amount excessive and unreasonable considering the routine  and default nature of the present action. Instead, at the request of plaintiff and after further consideration of the oral argument at the hearing on September 9, 2024, the court utilizes the Loadstar method and awards reasonable attorney fees in  the amount of $2,002.50 (1.1 hrs for investigation, 1.0 hrs for drafting the complaint, and 6.80 hrs for drafting the default judgment package at $225/hr),  which reduces the total judgment awarded to $7,826.19. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Garcia’s  application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $7,826.19.Plaintiff is ordered to file a judgment consistent with the court's ruling.
