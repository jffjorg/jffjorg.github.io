The judge's tentative ruling indicates that Moving Defendants failed to adequately demonstrate that they engaged in a meaningful meet and confer discussion with the Plaintiff. The declaration submitted by Moving Defendants is unclear about the details of the discussion, including whether the Plaintiff answered the telephone call, whether Moving Defendants tried to meet and confer on multiple occasions, and whether they sent follow-up letters. The judge also found that Moving Defendants' reliance on Butler-Rupp v. Lourdeaux is misplaced, as the issue in that case involved negligent infliction of emotional distress and negligent misrepresentation, and the jury found no such claims.

## English Summary

The judge is reviewing a motion filed by the "Moving Defendants" in a case (CIV-140). The defendants claim they met and conferred with the plaintiff, as required by law, but their declaration lacks important details about the meeting. 

The judge finds that a previous legal case cited by the defendants, Butler-Rupp v. Lourdeaux, is not relevant to the current situation. The judge seems skeptical about whether the meet and confer requirement was truly fulfilled and will likely require more information from the defendants before making a final ruling.

The judge is also considering the moving defendants' reliance on a case called Butler-Rupp v. Lourdeaux, but notes that the issue in that case involved negligent infliction of emotional distress and negligent misrepresentation, which is different from the current dispute. The judge is seeking clarification on the details of the meet and confer discussion and the moving defendants' reliance on the case law.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the upcoming court hearing. The Moving Defendants had filed a document (CIV-140) stating that they had met and conferred with the Plaintiff by telephone at least five court days before the hearing. However, the judge finds that the submitted declaration lacks clarity on whether the Plaintiff actually answered the call, whether the Moving Defendants made multiple attempts to meet and confer, or any other details about the discussion. The judge also disagrees with the Moving Defendants' reliance on a previous case (Butler-Rupp v. Lourdeaux) as it is not relevant to the current issue. The judge is questioning the validity of the Moving Defendants' meet and confer efforts and is not convinced by their argument.
