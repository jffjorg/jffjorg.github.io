And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling indicates that Moving Defendants failed to adequately demonstrate that they engaged in a meaningful meet and confer discussion with the Plaintiff. The declaration submitted by Moving Defendants is unclear about the details of the discussion, including whether the Plaintiff answered the telephone call, whether Moving Defendants tried to meet and confer on multiple occasions, and whether they sent follow-up letters. The judge also found that Moving Defendants' reliance on Butler-Rupp v. Lourdeaux is misplaced, as the issue in that case involved negligent infliction of emotional distress and negligent misrepresentation, and the jury found no such claims.
