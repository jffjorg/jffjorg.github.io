[1]Here,
Moving Defendants filed CIV-140 indicating counsel met and conferred “by
telephone” with Plaintiff at least five court days before the hearing. (Decl.
of Dem. Party Meet and Confer.) However, the submitted declaration is unclear
as to whether Plaintiff answered the telephone call, whether Moving Defendants
tried to meet and confer on multiple occasions, whether Moving Defendants sent
Plaintiff follow-up letters, or any other details about the meet and confer
discussion itself. 
 


[2] Moving
Defendants reliance on Butler-Rupp v. Lourdeaux (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th
1220, 1229 is misplaced since the issue there involved negligent infliction of
emotional distress and negligent misrepresentation since the jury found no
IIED.
