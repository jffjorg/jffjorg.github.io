And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Veda Scott v. John Stewart Company. The ruling sustains the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action of the complaint with leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff will have to refile the complaint and address the issues raised by the defendant's demurrer.

The judge also denied the defendant's motion to strike as moot, since the demurrer has been sustained. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve an amended pleading within 20 calendar days of the order.

The complaint alleged causes of action for elder abuse, breach of implied warranty of habitability, and retaliatory eviction. The judge found that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for elder abuse because it did not allege that the defendant took or retained any property belonging to the plaintiff. The complaint also failed to state a cause of action for breach of implied warranty of habitability because it did not allege that the defendant had notice of the allegedly dirty living conditions and had an opportunity to cure them.

The judge also found that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for retaliatory eviction because it did not allege that the plaintiff involuntarily vacated the premises due to the defendant's conduct. The plaintiff will need to refile the complaint and address these issues in order to state a valid cause of action.
