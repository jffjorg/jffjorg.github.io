[1]Â The Court also notes that the proof of service attached
to the demurrer only indicates that the notice of demurrer and demurrer were
served on Plaintiff; it does not list the memorandum of points and authorities
or the declaration of Jinny A. Cain. (See Proof of Service attached to
Demurrer.) The Court infers this was a typo considering that the notice,
demurrer, memorandum, and declaration are all one document and the proof of
service attached to the motion to strike lists all of the documents served for
the motion to strike. (See Proof of Service attached to the Motion to Strike.)
