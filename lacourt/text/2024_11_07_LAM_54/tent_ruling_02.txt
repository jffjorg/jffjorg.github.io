COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
The Court may issue an order allowing
an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.) 
The attorney may withdraw from representation when the withdrawal would
not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—that is, counsel cannot
withdraw at a critical point in the litigation. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see
California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Payam Tishbi, Esq., counsel of record
for Plaintiffs Jesus Gabriel Aguilar Corado and Claudia Alejandra Aguilar
Corado, seeks to withdraw from representation of Plaintiffs. Counsel state that
the attorney-client relationships have broken down. Trial is not yet set; no
prejudice will result from counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel has complied with CRC
3.1362. 
 
There is good cause for counsel’s
withdrawal. The motions are GRANTED.
