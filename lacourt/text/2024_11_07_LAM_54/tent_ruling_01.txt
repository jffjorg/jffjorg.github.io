“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement.”  (CCP § 664.6.) 
 
Plaintiff moves to enforce the
settlement executed by Plaintiff and Defendant Jenae J. McDonald on February 9,
2022, and enter judgment according to its terms. The settlement provides that
Defendant will make two hundred consecutive monthly payments to
Plaintiff of $200.00 per month, beginning on February 28, 2022, and continuing each
month thereafter through September 28, 2038, and a final payment of $201.67 on
or before October 28, 2038. The
Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, which also allows for an
award of attorney’s fees in the event of enforcement proceedings. 
Plaintiff represents that Defendant defaulted
on September 28, 2023. The total amount outstanding is a principal
amount of $40,201.67, plus attorney’s fees in the amount of $1,305.00, plus
costs in the amount of $557.66, less payments totaling $3,801.67, and less
credits totaling $2,800.00, for a total judgment in the amount of $35,462.66. Defendant has not opposed this motion
to show why it should not be granted. 
 
The motion to enforce settlement is
GRANTED.
