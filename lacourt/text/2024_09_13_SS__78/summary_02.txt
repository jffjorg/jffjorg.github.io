Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to compel third-party compliance with a deposition subpoena and grants the request for sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $1,200.00. The Plaintiff, Narek Vardanyan, failed to comply with the deposition subpoena and failed to respond to meet and confer correspondence from the Defendant's counsel. The Defendant, Christopher Mandalian, seeks sanctions against the Plaintiff for their failure to comply with the subpoena and for their failure to respond to the correspondence. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the subpoena and to respond to the correspondence warrants sanctions, but reduces the amount sought by the Defendant.
