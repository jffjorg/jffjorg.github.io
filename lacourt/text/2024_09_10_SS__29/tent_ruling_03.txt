22STCV20863
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff Chavez
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff Harrison
Tentative
The motions are DENIED without prejudice.
Background
On June 27, 2022, Plaintiffs Jennifer Chavez and
Johnish Harrison (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint against
Jacqueline Tuggle (“Defendant”), Keishia Caldwell, and DOES 1 through 50, for
negligence.
On October 30, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On December 27, 2023, Defendant filed a
cross-complaint against Jennifer Chavez. On May 8, 2024, the cross-complaint
was dismissed.
On August 6, Defendant filed these
two motions to compel the deposition of each of the two Plaintiffs.
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a
party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd.
(a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
Discussion
On April
1, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiffs with notice of depositions, setting the
deposition of Plaintiff Harrison for May 1 and the deposition of Plaintiff Chavez
for May 13. (Goodwin Decls., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff Harrison’s deposition was noticed
a second time for July 18, 2024. (Goodwin Decl., ¶ 5.) Plaintiffs did not
appear for their depositions. (Goodwin Decls., ¶ 9.)
 
Defendant
has shown that she properly noticed Plaintiffs’ depositions and Plaintiffs have
failed to proceed with their depositions. But the moving papers are silent on
any effort by the moving party to meet and confer or inquire after the deponent
failed to appear.  This is required under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (b).
 
Accordingly,
the Court must deny these two motions without prejudice.
 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES, without prejudice, Defendant’s motions to
compel Plaintiff Chavez and Plaintiff Harrison to appear for deposition.

Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
