And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial is granted. The plaintiff, Lucinda Manera, filed a complaint against the City of Santa Monica and others for a trip and fall that occurred on August 14, 2021. However, the plaintiff failed to timely demand and post jury fees, waiving the right to a jury trial. The judge notes that the waiver was inadvertent and that no opposition has been filed. The judge exercises its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g) to grant relief from waiver and to allow a trial by jury. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's motion is granted and orders the moving party to give notice.
