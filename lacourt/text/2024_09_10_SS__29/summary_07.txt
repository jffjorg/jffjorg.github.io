And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial date to December 2, 2024. The defendant argued that additional nonparty fact discovery and expert discovery must be completed, and the judge found that this is a valid reason for the continuance. The judge noted that the defendant has been reasonably diligent in pursuing discovery and that the outstanding discovery is directly relevant to the plaintiff's claims. The judge also found that the requested continuance is short and reasonable, and that the prejudice to the plaintiff associated with a further continuance is outweighed by the prejudice that the defendant would suffer from not being able to complete the discovery. The judge has reset the final status conference and all deadlines based on the new trial date.
