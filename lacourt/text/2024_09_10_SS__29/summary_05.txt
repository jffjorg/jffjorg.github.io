And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to enforce a settlement agreement. The defendants, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Restaurants, Inc. and Universal Studios, LLC dba Universal Citywalk Hollywood, had filed the motion after mediation on April 9, 2024, resulted in a mediator's proposal that was accepted by both parties. However, the defendants' written settlement agreement was refused by the plaintiff, Dora Lida Cazarez-Acosta. The judge ruled that the summary enforcement procedures of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 are not available to the defendants because there is no writing signed by the plaintiff or her counsel. The judge did not take a position on whether the settlement agreement is legally binding under general principles of contract law, but instead focused on the procedural requirements of section 664.6. The defendants will need to take other action to enforce the settlement agreement, if it is legally binding.
