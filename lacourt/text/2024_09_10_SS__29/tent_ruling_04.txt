Background
On July 13, 2022,
Carmit Burstyn (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Bed Bath & Beyond and
Does 1 through 30 for general negligence and premises liability arising out of an
incident on October 30, 2021, in which Plaintiff was allegedly struck by a
metal rod.
On September 16,
2022, Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc. (“BBB”) filed an answer. On May 30, 2023, BBB
filed notice of stay of proceedings due to bankruptcy. 
On November 20,
2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Studio City East 93K, LLC
(“Studio”) as Doe 1. On March 8, 2024, Studio filed an answer and a
cross-complaint against BBB, Bed ‘N Bath O Studio City, Inc, and Roes 1 through
50.
On August 14, 2024, Studio filed these
four motions: motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, and a motion for a deemed-admitted
order as to the Requests for Admission.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet
and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
On May 7, 2024, Studio served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Demand for Production, and Requests
for Admission. (Arquell Decls., ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff
has not served responses to the discovery. (Id., ¶ 8.) 
Studio need show nothing more.
Studio’s motions to compel Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and Request for Production are
GRANTED.
Studio’s motion for a deemed admitted order
as to the Requests for Admission is GRANTED.  
The requests for sanctions in connection with the
motions to compel responses to the interrogatories and requests for production
are DENIED.  
In the chapters of the Civil Discovery Act governing
interrogatories and requests for production, the Legislature has authorized
sanctions in the context of a motion to compel initial responses “against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion to compel.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) &
2031.300, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff has not
opposed the motion, and therefore no sanctions are authorized.
The
request for sanctions in connection with the motion for a deemed-admitted order
is GRANTED IN PART.  The chapter in the
Civil Discovery Act governing requests for admission provides for a “mandatory”
imposition of sanctions “on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion [for a deemed-admitted
order].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
The Court sets sanctions in the amount of $520, based on two hours
of attorney time multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $230 per
hour plus a $60 filing fee. (See Arquell Decl., ¶ 11.)
