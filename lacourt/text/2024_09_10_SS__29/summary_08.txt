And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Jerry Renteria, who is alleged to be the owner of the dog that bit the plaintiff. The defendants contend that liability is disputed and that the cross-complaint arises out of the same set of facts as the plaintiff's complaint. The judge finds that it is in the interest of justice for the defendants to be granted leave to file their cross-complaint. The motion is granted, and the defendants are given 14 days to file the cross-complaint.
