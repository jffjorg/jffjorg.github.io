And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has denied, without prejudice, the Defendant's motions to compel the deposition of both Plaintiffs, Jennifer Chavez and Johnish Harrison. The Defendant had properly noticed the depositions, but failed to show any effort to meet and confer with the Plaintiffs or inquire about their non-appearance. The Plaintiffs failed to appear for their scheduled depositions, and the Defendant is seeking monetary sanctions against them. The Judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
