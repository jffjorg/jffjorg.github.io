22STCV26406
Defendants’ Motion to Enforce Settlement
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On August
15, 2022, Dora Lida Cazarez-Acosta (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Restaurants, Inc., Universal Studios
Hollywood, and Does 1 through 50 for premises liability and general negligence arising
out of an incident on August 7, 2021.
 
On September 16, 2022, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Restaurants,
Inc. and Universal Studios, LLC dba Universal Citywalk Hollywood (collectively
“Defendants”) filed their answer.
 
On August 12,
2024, Defendants filed a motion to enforce settlement. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on August 27. No reply has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides: 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent
who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf. 
Because of the summary nature of a proceeding to enforce a
settlement agreement under section 664.6, and because settlement of a lawsuit
implicates a substantial right of a litigant, strict compliance with the
statutory requirements is required.  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985; Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) 
Before the Legislature amended the statute effective as of January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the litigants
themselves, not their attorneys.  (See Levy v. Superior Court
(1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.)  In any event, however, for a settlement
agreement to be enforceable under section 664.6, all “parties” (as that term is
defined in the statute) must sign, including the party seeking to enforce the
agreement and the party against whom enforcement is sought.  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 985.) 
If the settlement leaves material terms wanting, or confusing, the
settlement cannot be enforced through the section 664.6 summary
proceeding.  (Compare Terry v. Conlan (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1445
[finding parties never agreed to the means that were material to the
settlement, including what role an independent manager was to play regarding
management of a trust property, and whether the trust should be qualified as a
QTIP, thereby indicating that there was no meeting of the minds as to the
material terms] with Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355
[holding trial court’s decision to extend closing date for vendor’s agreement
to repurchase house did not create a material term and was within court’s power
because the closing date had passed by the time the motions came on for hearing
and a new closing date was necessary to grant the relief sought by both
parties].) 
Nonetheless, when the “parties
intend that an agreement be binding, the fact that a more formal agreement must
be prepared and executed does not alter the validity of the agreement.” (Blix St.
Records, Inc. v. Cassidy (2010)
191 CA4th 39, 48.)  
It is possible for parties to have an
enforceable settlement agreement that is not subject to the summary enforcement
proceedings of section 664.6 (including, for example, an
enforceable oral agreement to settle or an agreement that is signed by an
authorized representative who has the power to bind the party but is not listed
in subdivision (b) of the statute).  In
those circumstances, a party seeking to enforce the agreement must proceed
through other means, such as a separate civil action, an amendment to the
answer to add a new affirmative defense, and/or a motion for summary judgment,
rather than through the summary procedures of section 664.6.  (See generally Weddington Productions v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809 [“Section 664.6 was enacted to provide
a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without the
need for a new lawsuit.”].)
In ruling on a motion brought under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6, the court acts as a trier of fact.  The court may consider any admissible
evidence, including documents, declarations, and oral testimony.  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533; 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (2024), ¶¶ 12:977-12:978.6.)
Discussion
The parties attended mediation on April 9,
2024.  (Benson Decl., ¶ 4.)  Following the mediation, the mediator issued
a mediator’s proposal.  (Id., ¶ 4 &
Exh. B.)  
On April 25, 2024, the mediator informed the
parties that both sides had accepted the mediator’s agreement.  (Id., ¶ 4 & Exh. C.)  Defendants prepared a written settlement
agreement, but Plaintiff has refused to sign it.  (Id., ¶ 5 & Exh. D.)
Defendants now move to enforce the settlement
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
What is missing from the motion, however, is a writing signed by
Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s counsel.  Without
such a signed writing, the Court cannot grant Defendants’ motion.
The Court expresses no views on whether there
is a legally binding settlement under general principles of contract law.  It is enough for present purposes for the
Court to conclude that the summary enforcement procedures of section 664.6 are
not available to Defendants.  (If
Defendants contend that this is one of those circumstances in which there is a
legally binding contract under general principles of contract law that cannot
be enforced under section 664.6, Defendants would need to amend their answer or
take other action to raise this issue.)
The motion is denied. 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES the motion to enforce the
settlement agreement. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
