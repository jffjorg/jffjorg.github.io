 Case Number:  22STCV20615    Hearing Date:   September 10, 2024    Dept:  29 Robles
v. City of Los Angeles
22STCV20615
Demurrer of Defendant Caltrans.
Tentative
The
demurrer is sustained with leave to amend
Background
On June
24, 2022, Rodolfo Robles (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los
Angeles (“City”), California Department of Transportation, and Does 1 through
50, asserting causes of action for general negligence and premises liability/dangerous
condition of public property, arising out of incident near Figueroa Street and
17th Street in Los Angeles on November 18, 2021, in which, Plaintiff alleges,
he was riding an electric scooter on the sidewalk, his front tire “went into a
drainage ditch where [the] cover was broken/misplaced,” causing him to fall off
the scooter and sustain injuries. 
On April
17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against the same
defendants.  In the FAC, Plaintiff
asserts two causes of action: (1) for negligence and negligence per se under
Government Code sections 815.2, 815.6, 820, 830 and 835, and (2) premises
liability under Government Code sections 835, 835.2(a), and 835.2(b).
On June
23, 2023, City filed its answer to the FAC.
On July
17, 2023, the Court, at the request of Plaintiff, dismissed all causes of
action in the FAC against California Department of Transportation without
prejudice.
On
November 16, 2023, City filed a cross-complaint against California Department
of Transportation and Roes 1 to 10. 
On
January 3, 2024, The People of the State of California, acting by and through
the Department of Transportation, erroneously sued as California Department of
Transportation (“Caltrans”), filed its answer to City’s cross-complaint.
 
On May
13, 2024, Plaintiff amended the FAC to bring California Department of
Transportation back into the FAC, naming it as Doe 1.
On
August 9, 2024, Caltrans filed this demurrer to the FAC.  Plaintiff filed an opposition on August 27,
and Caltrans filed a reply on September 3. 
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10 provides:
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been
filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
A
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint or other pleading.  In ruling on a demurrer, the Court accepts as
true “all material facts properly pleaded,” along with “matters that may be
judicially noticed.”  (Centinela Freeman
Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California (2016) 1 Cal.5th
994, 1010; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court need not, however, accept the truth
of contentions or conclusions of law contained in the pleading.  (Centinela, supra, 1 Cal.5th at p.
1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)  
A demurrer may address only
defects that appear on the face of the pleading; other than judicially
noticeable facts, no other extrinsic evidence may be considered.  (Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Guardian
North Bay, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.)
It is not the function of
the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the properly pleaded allegations
of the complaint.  The Court accepts as
true “even improbable alleged facts” as a demurrer is not the correct
procedural posture to address “plaintiff’s ability to prove the factual
allegations.”  (Marina Pacific Hotel
and Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 96,
104-105; accord Hacker v. Homeward Residential (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th
270, 280.)  
Courts must “liberally
construe the pleading with a view to substantial justice between the parties”
and must “give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in context.”  (Marina
Pacific, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 105.)
A
demurrer may be sustained only if it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of
Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
“When
the ground of demurrer is based on a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice …, such matter shall be specified in the demurrer, or in the
supporting points and authorities for the purpose of invoking such notice
….”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.70.)
Before
filing a demurrer, the demurring party must meet and confer with the opposing
party to determine “whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)
Leave to amend should be
granted when “there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Centinela, supra, 1
Cal.5th at p. 1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Shaeffer v.
Califia Farms (2020) 44 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1145.)
Discussion
The meet
and confer requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 has been
satisfied. (Han Decl., ¶¶ 5 & 6.) 
Caltrans
demurs to the First Cause of Action (only) in the FAC, which is labelled as a cause
of action for “Negligence and Negligence Per Se” and references Government Code
sections 815.2, 815.6, 820, 830, 835. 
Caltrans argues that the FAC fails to allege facts to support the First Cause
of Action.
The
Court begins its analysis with Government Code section 815, which states:
“Except
as otherwise provided by statute:
(a) A
public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an
act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.
(b) The
liability of a public entity established by this part (commencing with Section
814) is subject to any immunity of the public entity provided by statute,
including this part, and is subject to any defenses that would be available to
the public entity if it were a private person.”
“Under
the Government Claims Act, a tort action cannot be maintained against a
government entity unless the claim is premised on a statute providing for that
liability.”  (Tansavatdi v. City of Rancho
Palos Verdes (2023) 14 Cal.5tha 639, 652. 
(Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792,
798.) 
In the First Cause of
Action, Plaintiff identifies five statutes upon which Plaintiff bases his
claim: Government Code sections 815.2, 815.6, 820, 830, 835.  The Court addresses each of these statutes,
although not in numerical order.
First, Government
Code section 835 establishes that, subject to certain limitations, a public
entity is liable for injuries proximately caused by a dangerous condition of
public property.  (Gov. Code, §
835.)  But Plaintiff has already alleged a
cause of action in the FAC based on a dangerous condition of public property –
that is the Second Cause of Action. 
There is no reason for Plaintiff to allege the same cause of action
twice.  The demurrer is sustained to the
extent that the First Cause of Action is duplicative and also based on
Government Code section 835. 
Second, Government
Code section 830 is a definitional section, defining (among other things) the
terms “dangerous condition” and “property of a public entity.  (Gov. Code, § 830.)  It does not, itself, establish any
independent basis for the liability of a public entity.  The demurrer is sustained to the extent that the
First Cause of Action is based on Government Code section 830.
Third,
Government Code section 820 states that, subject to exceptions, “a public employee
is liable for injury caused by his act or omission to the same extent as a
private person.”  (Gov. Code, § 820,
subd. (a).)  But in this cause of action
against Caltrans, Plaintiff is seeking to hold Caltrans liable, not a public
employee.  The demurrer of Caltrans is sustained
to the extent the First Cause of Action is based on Government Code section
820.
Fourth,
Government Code section 815.2 provides: 
“A public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an
act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his
employment if the act or omission would, apart from this section, have given
rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal representative.”  
(Gov. Code, § 815.2, subd. (a).)  Under
this statute, Plaintiff may seek to hold Caltrans liable for the tort of an
employee that occurs within the scope of employment, but only if the tort “would,
apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that
employee.”  Nothing in the FAC sets forth
facts that would, apart from section 815.2, give rise to a cause of action
against a Caltrans employee.  (See Yee
v. Superior Court (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 26, 40.)  The demurrer of Caltrans is sustained to the
extent the First Cause of Action is based on Government Code section 815.2.
Fifth, Government Code section
815.6 provides for the liability of a public entity, under certain circumstances,
when an entity fails to discharge “a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment
that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury,” and
the failure proximately causes “an injury of that kind.”  (Gov. Code, § 815.6.)  In a cause of action under section 815.6,
however:
 “Duty cannot be alleged simply by
stating “defendant had a duty under the law”; that is a conclusion of law, not
an allegation of fact. The facts showing the existence of the claimed duty must
be alleged. … Since the duty of a governmental agency can only be created by
statute or “enactment,” the statute or “enactment” claimed to establish the
duty must at the very least be identified.” 
(Searcy
v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792, 802.)  Nothing in the FAC identifies the mandatory
duty on which Plaintiff bases his First Cause of Action – unless it is Government
section 835, which, as noted above, is already the subject of the Second Cause
of Action.  Accordingly, the demurrer of
Caltrans is sustained to the extent the First Cause of Action is based on Government
Code section 815.6.
Finally,
the Court notes that Plaintiff alleges that the demurrer of Caltrans is
defective because it challenges only one cause of action in the FAC, rather
than the entire FAC.  Plaintiff cites no
authority for this proposition, and the Court is aware of none.  The demurrer of Caltrans is not defective
procedurally.
The
Court SUSTAINS the demurrer of Caltrans to the First Cause of Action in the
FAC.
As this
is the first demurrer brought to the pleading in this matter, and as the basis
for the Court’s order is a deficiency in pleading that could possibly be cured,
the Court sustains the demurrer WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
Conclusion
The
Court SUSTAINS the demurer of The People of the State of California, acting by
and through the Department of Transportation, to the First Cause of Action in
the First Amended Complaint.
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff LEAVE TO AMEND within 15 days of notice.
Moving Party is to give notice.
