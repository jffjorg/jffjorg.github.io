And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's motion to reclassify the case to limited jurisdiction is granted. The plaintiff, P Cotenescu, alleged 21 causes of action arising out of her employment at Esthetic Eyes, et al.'s medical office as a front desk receptionist/personal assistant. However, the plaintiff failed to provide specific evidence or argument as to how her claims could exceed the jurisdictional limit of $35,000 or less. The defendant met its burden of showing that an amount in excess of the jurisdictional limits is "virtually unattainable". The Judge notes that the plaintiff's opposition to the motion lacked specific evidence or argument and that the plaintiff was unable to provide information about the potential value of her claims at a prior court hearing.
