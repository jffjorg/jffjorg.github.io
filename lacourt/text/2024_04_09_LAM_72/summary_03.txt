And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has ruled on Plaintiff Carlos Drepic's motion to compel the deposition of a Person Most Qualified (PMQ) on certain categories. The court grants the motion in part, requiring Defendant General Motors LLC to produce a PMQ for deposition on categories 1-4, 7, and 10 of the deposition notice. The court denies the motion as to the other categories, requiring Plaintiff to file a separate statement in support of the motion. The court also notes that Plaintiff's failure to address the objections raised by Defendant on a category-by-category basis deprives the court of the ability to rule on the substance of the other categories.
