And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has decided to take off the calendar a motion by Paul Frank Limited (Petitioner) to compel China Brands Group (Defendant) to arbitrate their claims in Los Angeles County. The judge's decision is based on two reasons: firstly, the Defendant's notice of removal to Federal Court divests the court of jurisdiction; and secondly, the court previously granted the Petitioner's motion to compel arbitration in November 2023. The court concludes that the current motion appears to be moot and that the court does not have jurisdiction to consider it.
