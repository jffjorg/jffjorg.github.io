And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel binding arbitration in the case between plaintiff Keith Scoggins and defendant Hyundai Motor America. The case involves a dispute over a 2021 Hyundai Palisade purchased by Scoggins, which was delivered with defects and nonconformities. Hyundai Motor America is seeking to compel arbitration based on two arbitration agreements: one in the retail installment sale contract (RISC) and one in the owner's handbook and warranty information.

The judge has found that both arbitration agreements are enforceable and that the court should grant the motion to compel binding arbitration. The judge has disagreed with plaintiff's arguments that the arbitration agreements are not enforceable and that the court should not grant the motion.

The judge has also noted that the arbitration agreements are valid and irrevocable, and that the party moving to compel arbitration must establish the existence of a written arbitration agreement between the parties. In this case, Hyundai Motor America has established the existence of the two arbitration agreements and has also established that the plaintiff has refused to arbitrate the controversy.

The judge has ordered that the prevailing party on the motion is to give notice of the ruling.
