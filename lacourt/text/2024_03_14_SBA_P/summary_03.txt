And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Ford Motor Company and Autonation Ford Torrance, have moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff, Maria Aranda, has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendants are liable for defects in a 2013 Ford Escape that she purchased, but the defendants argue that the statute of limitations has run on the claims.

The court has considered the moving and opposing papers and has granted the motion in its entirety. The court finds that the statute of limitations has run on the plaintiff's claims, and that the fifth cause of action for negligent repair is not adequately pled.

The court has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified in the ruling. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
