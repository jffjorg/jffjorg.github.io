  Case Number:  22TRCV01289    Hearing Date:   March 14, 2024    Dept:  P TENTATIVE RULINGJUDGE DAVID K. REINERTTORRANCE DEPARTMENT PHearing Date: Thursday, March 14, 2024Case Name: CALSAFE RESEARCH CENTER, INC. v. PANOS BRANDS, LLC, et al.Case No.: 22TRCV01289Motion: Motion to Approve Proposition 65 Settlement and Stipulated Consent JudgmentMoving Party: Plaintiff Calsafe Research Center, Inc.Responding Party: None as of March 12, 2024Notice: OKRuling: Plaintiff Calsafe Research Center, Inc.’s Motion to Approve Proposition 65 Settlement and Stipulated Consent Judgment is GRANTED.BACKGROUNDOn November 18, 2022, Plaintiff CalSafe Research Center, Inc. filed this action alleging violation of the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, codified at Health and Safety Code §25249.6, et seq. (“Proposition 65”). Plaintiff alleges Defendant Panos Brands, LLC violated Proposition 65 by failing to warn citizens of the State of California about the presence of Lead in its Walden Farms, Chipotle Ranch Dressing offered for sale throughout California.On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed the present motion to approve the proposed Consent Judgment. Plaintiff moves this court, per California Health & Safety Code §25249.7(f), for an order approving and entering the terms of A Proposed Stipulated Consent Judgment submitted with the moving papers. No opposition or reply papers have been filed.APPLICABLE LAWThe Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, colloquially known as Proposition 65, was passed as a ballot initiative by the California voters, and was designed to prevent the contamination of drinking water with, and generally protect the public from unknowing exposure to, harmful chemicals. (12 Witkin, Summary of California Law (11th ed. 2017) Real Property, §967.) Health & Safety Code (“H&SC”) § 25249.7 governs the enforcement of Proposition 65. Proposition 65 has both public and private enforcement mechanisms. (H&SC § 25249.7(c), (d).) Violations are punishable by injunction (H&SC § 24259.7(a)) and civil penalty (H&SC § 24259.7(b)). In the case of private enforcement actions, parties may also recover attorney’s fees, pursuant to the provisions in CCP § 1021.5, governing actions concerning important rights affecting the public interest.Health & Safety Code § 25249.7(f) governs the role of the Court in approving settlements and consent judgments for private actions to enforce Proposition 65. Section 25249.7(f)(4) provides, in relevant part, that:“If there is a settlement of an action brought by a person in the public interest under subdivision (d), the plaintiff shall submit the settlement, other than a voluntary dismissal in which no consideration is received from the defendant, to the court for approval upon noticed motion, and the court may approve the settlement only if the court makes all of the following findings:(A) The warning that is required by the settlement complies with this chapter.(B) The award of attorney’s fees is reasonable under California law.(C) The penalty amount is reasonable based on the criteria set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b).” (Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. v. Kintetsu Enterprises of America (2006)141 Cal.App.4th 46, 61 (“To stamp a consent agreement with the judicial imprimatur, the court must determine the proposed settlement is just….In the context of Proposition 65 litigation,necessarily brought to vindicate the public interest, the trial court also must ensure that its judgment serves the public interest.”).)APPLICATION TO FACTSCompliancy of WarningHealth & Safety Code section 25249.6 states, in relevant part: “No person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual, except as provided in Section 25249.10.” (Health & Safety Code, § 25249.6.) “Health and Safety Code section 25249.6 (the central warning provision) requires that there be no ‘knowing and intentional’ exposure ‘without first giving clear and reasonable warning.’” (Consumer Defense Group v. Rental Housing Industry Members (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1185, 1214.) In order for a warning to be clear and reasonable, the manner of transmission must be reasonable, the message employed must be sufficiently clear to communicate the warning. (Environmental Law Foundation v. Wykle Research, Inc. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 60, 67 fn. 6.)The Consent Judgment provides that sixty days from the Effective Date, Defendant will be permanently enjoined from manufacturing for sale in the State of California, or directly selling in the State of California, any Covered Product that exposes a person to a “Daily Lead Exposure Level” of more than .5 micrograms of lead per day, unless it meets the warning requirements under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the Consent Judgment.For those Covered Products that were packaged, distributed, shipped or sold by Defendant before the Compliance date, all claims are released. Any Covered Products that are not exempt under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the Consent Judgment shall be accompanied by a warning as provided in Section 3.4 of the Consent Judgment. The acceptable warnings set forthin Section 3.3 must be displayed in a reasonably conspicuous manner and they adequately inform the reader of the potential exposure to lead, which is known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. The warnings reference Prop 65 and provide a website to obtain more information.The Consent Judgment satisfies the “clear and reasonable warning” requirement under Section 25249.6.Reasonableness of Civil PenaltyHealth & Safety Code § 25249.7(b)(1) states, in relevant part: “A person who has violated Section 25249.5 or 25249.6 is liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per day for each violation in addition to any other penalty established by law.” Section 25249.7(b)(2) states: “In assessing the amount of a civil penalty for a violation of this chapter, the court shall consider all of the following: (A) The nature and extent of the violation. (B) The number of, and severity of, the violations. (C) The economic effect of the penalty on the violator. (D) Whether the violator took good faith measures to comply with this chapter and the time these measures were taken. (E) The willfulness of the violator’s misconduct. (F) The deterrent effect that the imposition of the penalty would have on both the violator and the regulated community as a whole. (G) Any other factor that justice may require.”The Consent Judgment imposes a civil penalty of $1600 on Defendant, with 75% earmarked for California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and the remaining 25% earmarked for Plaintiff in accordance with Health & Safety Code §25249.12(c)(1) & (d). Parties entered into the Consent Judgment after arm’s length negotiations. As indicated by Plaintiff, the amount is reasonable given that (1) the amount is sufficient to remind Defendant to comply with Prop 65; (2) the Consent Judgment already ensures that Defendant’s products will carry the Prop 65 warning; (3) Defendant claims it did notintentionally ignore its obligations under Prop 65 and it immediately took action to withdraw the non-conforming product and will ensure that it complies with Prop 65 in the future; (4) Defendant sold very few nonconforming products prior to receiving Plaintiff’s notice and sold no such products since receiving Plaintiff’s notice; (5) Plaintiff believes the sale of products in violation of Prop 65 is a severe violation; and (6) payment of the penalty provides further incentive for Defendant to comply with Prop 65.Reasonableness of Attorney’s FeesPursuant to 11 Cal. Code Regs. § 3201(b)(1), “a settlement that provides for the giving of a clear and reasonable warning, where there had been no warning provided prior to the sixty-day notice, for an exposure that appears to require a warning, is presumed to confer a significant benefit on the public.”The fees setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. A computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award. The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value of the legal services provided. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.) Such an approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id. at 48, n.23.) After the trial court has performed the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether the total award so calculated under all of the circumstances of the case is more than a reasonable amount and, if so, shall reduce the section 1717 award so that it is a reasonable figure. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-96.)Defendant agrees to pay attorney’s fees in the amount of $14,400 as complete reimbursement for Plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees and costs. The amount of attorney’s fees is reasonable given that Plaintiff’s counsel attests to spending 50 hours for a total of $31,025.69 in fees and costs.Proposed Consent Judgment Proper under Health & Safety Code § 25249.7(f)(4)For the aforesaid reasons, the Proposed Consent Judgment attached as Exhibit B to the Manning Declaration is approved. The court finds the Consent Judgment provides for warnings in compliance with Prop 65, the civil penalty provided for reasonable per Health & Safety Code §25249.7(b)(2) and the attorney’s fees included as part of the Consent Judgment are reasonable. The Consent Judgment is just and serves the public interest.CONCLUSIONPlaintiff’s Motion to Approve Consent Judgment is GRANTED. The Consent Judgment is entered pursuant to CCP §664.6 and the Court retains jurisdiction pursuant to CCP §664.6 to enforce the judgment.
