Plaintiff alleges that defects manifested themselves within the applicable express warranty period including engine defects, transmission defects, and electrical defects among others. (Complaint, ¶ 12.) Plaintiff alleges that after several repair attempts Defendant FMC failed to conform the Vehicle to the warranty and failed to offer to repurchase the Vehicle. Attempts at repairs by presentation to an authorized repair facility included the following dates:· May 12, 2014;· January 17, 2015;· July 18, 2017;· October 7, 2017;· June 5, 2018;· July 17, 2019;· April 4, 2020; and· June 21, 2022(Complaint, ¶¶ 23-30.)Plaintiff then filed suit. The motion before the Court is the Defendants’ Motion for Judgement on the Pleadings (the Motion). Plaintiff opposes the Motion, and Defendants file a reply.DISCUSSIONLegal Standard“The grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings must appear on the face of the complaint or from a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.” (Richardson-Tunnell v. School Ins. Program for Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App. 4th 1056, 1061, disapproved on other grounds by Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Prot. Dist. (2019) 7 Cal. 5th 798, 815 n.8. Accord Bufil v. Dollar Financial Group, Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1202, disapproved on other grounds by Noel v. Thrifty Payless, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal. 5th 955, 986; Saltarelli & Steponovich v. Douglas (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1, 5.)A motion for judgment on the pleadings involves the same type of procedures that apply to a general demurrer. (Richardson-Tunnell v. School Ins. Program for Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App. 4th 1056, 1061, disapproved on other grounds by Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Prot. Dist. (2019) 7 Cal. 5th 798, 815 n.8; Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal. App. 4th 1057,1064.) In considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, courts consider whether properly pled factual allegations, assumed to be true and liberally construed, are sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (Stone Street Capital, LLC v. Cal. State Lottery Com'n (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 109, 116; Fire Ins. Exchange v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 116 Cal. App. 4th 446, 452-53.) A motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie as to only part of a cause of action. (Fire Ins. Exch. v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) “[A] motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the office of a general, not a special, demurrer...” Fabbro v. Dardi & Co. (1949) 93 Cal. App. 2d 247, 252.)AnalysisIn their moving papers, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s first four causes of action are all time-barred because the statute of limitations on actions under the Song-Beverly Act is four years. Additionally, Defendant argues that the fifth cause of action for negligent repair fails to plead damages. The Court agrees and grants the Motion.A. The first four causes of action are time-barredDefendants’ primary argument is that the Vehicle at issue was purchased in 2013, and the initial claim was not presented until ten years later, when Plaintiff filed her Complaint on May 15, 2023. Plaintiff counters in their opposition papers that the Complaint does not affirmatively show a statute of limitations defense. The Court is not persuaded.On the face of the Complaint, it is clear that: (a) the Vehicle was purchased in 2013, (b) there were several repair attempts, and (c) the Complaint was filed in 2023. As explained more fully below, the discovery rule states that the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or through diligence, when a reasonable person should suspect that wrongdoing has occurred. Neither the Complaint nor the opposition papers provide justification for Plaintiff waiting six years after the statute of limitations had run to file her Complaint.Within the Complaint Plaintiff asserts four different defenses to an attack of the statute of limitations: class action tolling, discovery rule tolling, the repair doctrine, and fraudulent concealment tolling. However, the Complaint does little to establish how each applies, nor does Plaintiff elaborate in their opposition papers. The Court will take each in turn.i. Class Action TollingPlaintiff argues that the class action tolling rule articulated in American Pipe applies here. The Supreme Court explained the rule: “…under limited circumstances, if class certification isdenied, the statute of limitations is tolled from the time of commencement of the suit to the time of denial of certification for all purported members of the class who either make timely motions to intervene in the surviving individual action [Citation] or who timely file their individual actions [Citation].” (Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co. (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1103, 1119.) However, at no point does the Complaint identify the related class action that was pending certification. Therefore, American Pipe is inapplicable here.ii. Discovery Rule TollingUnder the general rule, a cause of action accrues when the wrongful act is done, not when a plaintiff discovers they have a cause of action to pursue. (Moreno v. Sanchez (2003) 106 Cal.App. 4th 1415, 1423.) “Under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by wrongdoing, that someone has done something wrong to her.” (Jolly, supra, at 1110.) Here, the Complaint demonstrates that there were several attempts at repair during the ten year prior to the filing of the Complaint in 2023. The first four attempts occurred on (1) May 12, 2014; (2) January 17, 2015; (3) July 18, 2017; and (4) October 7, 2017. The Complaint fails to explain after four separate attempts, how Plaintiff was still unsuspecting that an issue was caused by wrongdoing, nor why there was a two-year gap between the second and third attempt at repair.iii. The Repair DoctrinePlaintiff asserts the repair doctrine citing Aced v. Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co. (1961), 55 Cal.2d 573 (“Aced”) which states that “The statute of limitations is tolled where one who has breached a warranty claims that the defect can be repaired and attempts to make repairs.” (Aced, supra, at 587.) Plaintiff argues this doctrine specifically as to the fourth cause of action for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. Plaintiff cites Aced which holds that if a warranty relates to a future event, where the defect cannot be discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence then the statute of limitations does not run until the discovery of the defect. (Aced, supra, at 584.) However, under the discovery rule cited above, it is still unclear how after four attempts at requesting Defendants to repair the Vehicle, Plaintiff remained unsuspecting, “…the limitations period begins once the plaintiff ‘has notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry’”. (Jolly, supra, at 1110, citing Gutierrez v. Mofid (1985) 39 Cal.3d 892, 896-897.) Here, it took eight attempts before a Complaint was filed.iv. Fraudulent Concealment TollingFraudulent concealment can also toll the statute of limitations. However, “To take advantage of this doctrine ‘ “the plaintiff must show ... the substantive elements of fraud ... and ...an excuse for late discovery of the facts.” (Britton v. Girardi (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 721, 734.) The plaintiff must plead that due to fraud, the plaintiff was hindered in bringing the action within the statutory period. (Ibid.) The Complaint fails to plead fraud with the requisite specificity; therefore, Plaintiff cannot avail themselves to the doctrine of fraudulent concealment to toll the statute of limitations.B. Negligent repair is not adequately pledFinally, Plaintiff contends Defendant AFT is liable for negligent repair, however, the element of damages has not been plead sufficiently. According to the Complaint, there is no allegations that the repairs were paid for out-of-pocket, nor that the repairs were not covered under warranty. Plaintiff alleges in the Complaint that the Vehicle’s value is de minimis, however, it is unclear how Defendants’ actions caused this.Leave to AmendLeave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”]. As there is reasonable possibility of successful amendment, Plaintiff is granted 20 days leave to amend.CONCLUSIONDefendants’ Motion for Judgement on the Pleadings is GRANTED in its entirety. Plaintiff is granted 20 days leave to amend.Prevailing party on motion is ordered to give notice of ruling.
