And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the Demurrer filed by Defendant Vortex Alliance, Inc. to the Plaintiff's Unlawful Detainer Complaint. The Plaintiff, Jack Cheung dba Three-C Co., is granted 20 days leave to amend the Complaint to address defects related to fictitious business name laws, the absence of a lease agreement, and the failure to allege proper service of a Notice to Quit. The Judge agrees with Defendant's arguments that the Complaint fails to demonstrate compliance with Business and Professions Code § 17918, fails to attach a copy of the lease, and fails to allege proper service of the Notice to Quit. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with fictitious business name laws is unclear, and that the Complaint lacks a lease agreement and proper service of the Notice to Quit. The Judge grants leave to amend, citing the possibility of successful amendment, and orders the prevailing party to give notice of the ruling.
