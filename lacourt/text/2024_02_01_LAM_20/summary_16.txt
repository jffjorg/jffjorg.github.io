And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this medical malpractice action. Defendant Shuo Steven Wang seeks to bifurcate the issue of the statute of limitations from all other matters in the case. The Plaintiffs do not oppose bifurcation in general, but would oppose it if the only statute of limitations argument being asserted by Wang is the propriety of the doe amendment, which the Court has already ruled upon.

The Court notes that bifurcation of trials is within its discretion and can be used to "expedite and simplify the presentation of evidence" and "avoidance of the waste of time and money caused by the unnecessary trial of damage questions in cases where the liability issue was resolved against the plaintiff."

The Court has previously denied Wang's motion to quash the doe amendment, which was filed on July 17, 2023. Wang's motion to bifurcate is pending. The Court will consider granting bifurcation if there is some other statute of limitations issue at play, per Code Civ. Proc. § 597.5. The matter will be discussed further at the motion hearing.
