Ruling:   If the only issue that Wang seeks to have tried separately is the propriety of the doe amendment, the Motion to Bifurcate is denied because that issue has already been conclusively determined.  If there is some other statute of limitations issue, then the Motion to Bifurcate will be granted per Code Civ. Proc. § 597.5.  This matter will be further discussed at the Motion hearing.   Moving party to give notice.   If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
