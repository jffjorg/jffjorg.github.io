And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Employers Assurance Company's motion for summary judgment against E and J Wood Finish. The dispute centers around a breach of contract claim, where Employers Assurance Company alleges that E and J Wood Finish failed to pay an additional $81,194.12 in premium for the 2020 Policy. The Judge finds that the Defendant's opposition fails to demonstrate the existence of triable issues, and that the Plaintiff has sufficiently shown that a variable policy existed between the parties, an audit was done, and that the audit showed that the Defendant owed the additional premium. The Judge notes that the Defendant's declaration, provided by Elizabeth Aparicio, does not explain what was incorrect about the audit and does not provide sufficient evidence to create a triable issue. As a result, the Judge grants the motion for summary judgment and orders a proposed judgment to be filed within 10 days.
