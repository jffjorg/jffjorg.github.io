And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to seal exhibits in support of the opposition to the summary judgment/adjudication motion, without prejudice. The exhibits were marked as confidential by the defendant, but the judge finds no reason to substantiate a confidentiality interest. The judge notes that sealing the exhibits would be narrowly tailored and it is highly improbable that every word of the 36 exhibits should be redacted. The judge also finds that sealing the exhibits would not be necessary to protect confidentiality, as jurors are specifically instructed not to conduct extraneous investigation. As a result, the motion to seal is denied, and the documents will remain lodged under seal for the time-being, unless the plaintiff does not pursue another motion to seal. The judge orders that the parties email all redacted documents filed to the court's research attorney and notes that counsel are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
