And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by defendant EF Mortgage and has made the following tentative ruling. The judge has granted plaintiff's counsel Shapero's motion to be relieved as counsel for Sunset Group and Campbell. The judge has also granted defendant EF Mortgage's request for judicial notice of certain documents related to the foreclosure of the mortgaged property.

As for the demurrer, the judge has sustained with leave to amend the demurrer as to the breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims against defendant EF Mortgage. The judge has denied the demurrer as to the UCL claim.

The judge has also denied the demurrer's request for judicial estoppel against plaintiff Campbell, finding that there is a question of fact as to whether Campbell intended to fraudulently conceal his alleged claims against defendant EF Mortgage.
