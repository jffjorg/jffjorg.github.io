And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for an order assigning all rights to payment to the defendants. The plaintiff, Blue Rider Media Finance, LLC, sued the defendants for breach of contract and settled the case via a stipulated money judgment. However, the plaintiff has not received payment and is seeking an order assigning all accounts, account receivables, and other rights to payment to the defendants. The defendants did not file an opposition to the motion. The judge noted that the plaintiff is due payment, which is owed, and that the defendants failed to comply with the court's order for post-judgment discovery, making it impossible for the plaintiff to accurately identify the specific amounts each defendant ought to be paying. Based on these factors, the judge granted the motion.
