And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Jordan James' motion to set aside the deemed admissions in this case. James failed to respond to Phillip Rowley's requests for admissions, and the court deemed those requests admitted on April 25, 2024. James is now seeking to set aside those admissions, which would effectively roll back the clock on Rowley's motion for summary judgment and months of litigation. The court finds that this would cause unacceptable prejudice to Rowley and is contrary to both the law and equitable principles.
