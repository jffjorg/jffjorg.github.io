  Case Number:  21SMCV00336    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  P Tentative RulingRowley v. James, Case No. 21SMCV00336Hearing date October 1, 2024Defendant and Cross-Complainant’s Motion to Set Aside Deemed AdmissionsPlaintiff and cross-defendant Phillip Rowley sued defendant and cross-complainant Jordan James following Rowley’s attempts to be removed as a guarantor from a lease entered into by James. James brought a cross-complaint against Rowley for breach of oral contract, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress and libel. Rowley served requests for admissions, which James did not respond to. The court deemed those requests admitted on 4/25/2024. Rowley moved for summary judgment on James’ fourth amended cross-complaint, which the court granted on 9/18/2024, ruling in part that James was bound by the deemed admissions and that if the admissions resulted from mistake or inadvertence, a motion to withdraw the admissions should have been filed and heard. Code Civ. Proc. §2033.300. James now moves to set aside the deemed admissions. A party may withdraw or amend an admission made in response to a request for admission only on leave of court granted after notice to all parties. Code Civ. Proc. §2033.300(a). The court may permit withdrawal or amendment of an admission only if it determines the admission was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and that the party who obtained the admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits. Code Civ. Proc. §2033.300(b).The court has already established that if James’ failure to respond to the 3/4/2024 request for admissions was the result of mistake or inadvertence, as James asserts, then James should have filed a motion to withdraw the admissions before Rowley’s 7/3/2024 MSJ was heard on 9/18/2024. James now seeks to set aside the deemed admissions, effectively rolling back the clock on Rowley’s MSJ and months of litigation. To do so would cause unacceptable prejudice to Rowley in contradiction of both Code Civ. Proc. §2033.300(b) and equitable principles. DENIED.
