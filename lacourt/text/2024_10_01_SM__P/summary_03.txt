And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge in the case of Farmers Insurance v. McCarthy has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to set aside a default judgment entered against him. The default was entered on February 28, 2024, after the Defendant failed to file an answer to the complaint. The Defendant argues that he did not understand the nature of the documents and therefore did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit. The Plaintiff, however, provides evidence that the Defendant was personally served on November 10, 2023, and that his previous counsel, Erika Prager, was aware that the Defendant had not been served. The Judge concludes that the Defendant's lack of understanding is not a sufficient excuse for failing to file an answer and that the default should be set aside. The Judge also imposes a penalty of $800 on the Defendant under California Code of Civil Procedure §473(c)(1)(A) for failing to avoid the initial default. The motion is granted, and the penalty is payable within 30 days.
