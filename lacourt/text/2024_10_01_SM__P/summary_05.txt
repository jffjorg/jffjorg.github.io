Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Cho v. Trader Joe's, Case No. 24SMCV01152. The case involves a breach of contract and tortious breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim by plaintiff Cho against defendant Trader Joe's. The defendant has demurred to the claims and moved to strike requests for attorney's fees, costs, and punitive damages.

The judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the claims for breach of contract and tortious breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with leave to amend. The judge has also struck the requests for punitive damages and attorney's fees.

The judge has found that plaintiff failed to plead particular facts sufficient to establish a claim for breach of contract and tortious breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The judge has also found that plaintiff's claims for punitive damages and attorney's fees are duplicative and without merit.

The judge has granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of a July 16, 2024 Order Sustaining Demurrer in the matter entitled Jorge Rodriguez v. Trader Joe's, Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number 24SMCV01221.

The judge has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to cure the deficiencies.
