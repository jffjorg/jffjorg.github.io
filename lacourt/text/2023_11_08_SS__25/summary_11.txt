The judge is issuing a tentative ruling regarding an application for service of process. The application is incomplete, lacking information on the date, time, department number, and courthouse location of the hearing. Furthermore, the Register of Actions does not indicate a hearing date was ever reserved for the application. Additionally, there is a discrepancy between the service addresses listed in the Non-Service Report and the declaration of Nima Heydari. The judge is unable to determine if this is a typographical error or if service was attempted at an incorrect address. The judge intends to clarify the situation further before making a final decision.
