   [1] The  Application does not set forth the date, time, department number, or courthouse  location on the Application. Moreover, there is no indication in the Register  of Actions of a hearing date on the Application being reserved. The Proof of  Service on the Application shows that it was served on Defendant Samo  Enterprises via mail at the Doric Street Address.    [2] There  exists a discrepancy between the September 27, 2023 Non-Service Report which  states that service was attempted at “11575 Moorpark St.” and the October 24,  2023 declaration of Nima Heydari which states that service was attempted at an  address of “115775 Moorpark St.” Those addresses are not the same and,  therefore, the Court cannot ascertain whether this is a typographical error or  if service was attempted at an address not received from the skip trace.    [3] As  stated above, the Application does not set forth the date, time, department  number, or courthouse location as to the Application. Moreover, there is no  indication in the Register of Actions of a hearing date ever being reserved for  the Application.
