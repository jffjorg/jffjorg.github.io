ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
A.               
Request for Production & Interrogatories and Sanctions
A party must
respond to interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30
days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) The party also waives the right to make any objections, including one
based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for
a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or production of documents
other than the cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) No
meet and confer efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses
to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)   
Monetary sanctions are mandatory
against an unsuccessful moving or opposing party unless they acted with
substantial justification or imposition of sanctions would be unjust. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (j).)
II.        Discussion 
As a preliminary matter, it is noted that, even though two
separate motions were filed, they are all identical in so far as they rely on
the same legal arguments and exhibits. Thus, for citing purposes, the Court
shall reference just one motion.  
 
On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff served
Defendant by mail with Plaintiff’s First Set of Special Interrogatories and
First Set of Requests for Production of Documents.  Plaintiff has not received any
responses.  There is no indication before
the Court that Defendant complied with Plaintiff’s discovery requests.  The Court notes that Plaintiff did not submit
a proof of service indicating the proposed order was served on Defendant, as
required by Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.510(a). 
As Defendant failed to comply with
Plaintiff’s discovery demands, the Court awards sanctions to Plaintiff in the
reduced total amount of $620.00 (1 hour in preparing the motions at $500 an
hour; $60 filing fees for each motion) due to the simplicity of the motion and
non-opposition.  
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel Responses to (1) First Set
of Special Interrogatories and (2) First Set of Requests for Production of
Documents are GRANTED.  Defendant is
ordered to provide compliant responses and requested documents without
objection within twenty (20) days of the Court’s order.  The Court also GRANTS Plaintiff’s requests
for sanctions in the amount of $620.00 against Defendant, to be paid within
thirty (30) days of the Court’s order. 
 
Moving party is ordered to
