And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition for declaration of abandonment of a mobilehome located at 45131 28th Street E, Space 27, Lancaster, CA 93535, described as 1965 Baron Majestic, Decal Number AAS1557, Serial No. S440. The petitioner, Sun-West Properties and Investments, Inc., is seeking a declaration that the mobilehome is abandoned, as well as rent, utilities, attorneys' fees and costs, and other charges.

The court previously continued the hearing on the petition to August 9, 2023, to allow the petitioner to correct deficiencies in the petition. However, the petitioner has not done so and has not submitted any admissible evidence in support of the petition.

The court finds that the petitioner has not made a showing under Civil Code section 798.61(a)(1) that the mobilehome is abandoned. The petition alleges that no rent has been paid to the park management for the preceding 60 days, but the petitioner has not submitted declarations or other admissible evidence to support this allegation.

The court also finds that the petitioner has not complied with Civil Code section 798.61(b), which requires the posting of a notice of abandonment and the mailing of a copy to the homeowner and any known registered owner or holder of a security interest in the abandoned mobilehome.

Therefore, the court denies the petition without prejudice, meaning that the petitioner can re-file the petition and provide the required evidence to support its claims.
