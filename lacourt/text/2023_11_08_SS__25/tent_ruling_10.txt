    BACKGROUND   On April  27, 2023, Plaintiffs Moises Cruz and Sandy Toribio (“Plaintiffs”) filed a  complaint against Defendants Samo Enterprises, Inc. dba Western Motor Sport  (“Samo Enterprises”), JB Financial, a partnership consisting of Susan Demirci  and Igya Demirci (“JB”), and Hudson Insurance Company (“Hudson”) (collectively,  “Defendants”), alleging causes of action for: (1) violation of the Consumers  Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”) pursuant to California Civil Code section 1750 et  seq.; (2) violation of California Business and Professions Code section  17200 et seq.; (3) claim against dealer bond; and (4) violation of Code  of Civil Procedure sections 1281.97 and 1281.99. The complaint arises from the  sale of an allegedly defective used 2010 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 (the “Subject  Vehicle”).    On May 11,  2023, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration and for the Court to Pick  Arbitration Forum and Request for Stay (the “Motion”), seeking an order compelling  Defendants Samo Enterprises and JB to arbitrate the controversy pursuant to the  Retail Installment Sale Contract (“RISC”).    On June  23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Proof of Service indicating that Defendant JB had  been served with the summons, complaint, and Motion by substituted service.    On June  23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Non-Service Report as to Defendant Samo  Enterprises which sets forth attempts to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises at  17477 Doric St., Los Angeles, CA 91344 (the “Doric Street Address”).    On July  10, 2023, the Court issued a minute order noting that Plaintiffs had filed a  defective Notice of Motion, which did not list the address of the Spring Street  Courthouse, where the hearing on the Motion would take place. (See July  10, 2023 Minute Order.) Plaintiffs also failed to file proof that the moving  papers were served on Samo Enterprises or Hudson. (Id.) The Court  continued the hearing on the Motion to August 10, 2023 and ordered “Plaintiffs  to file and serve a corrected Notice of Motion and to serve all parties in the  case.” (Id.)    On July  7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed and served a Notice of Continued Motion, listing the  Spring Street Courthouse Address. On July 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Proof of  Service indicating that Defendant Hudson had been served with the summons,  complaint, and Motion.    On July 19,  2023, Plaintiffs filed the Declaration of Nima Heydari in response to the  Court’s July 10, 2023, Order.    On July  25, 2023, Defendant Hudson filed an Answer to the Complaint.    On August  1, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Non-Service Report as to Defendant Samo  Enterprises.    On August  10, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion to allow Plaintiffs  additional time to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises with the Complaint and  moving papers. (See August 10, 2023 Minute Order.) The Court continued  the hearing on the Motion to November 8, 2023 and ordered Plaintiffs “to file  supplemental papers addressing the issues discussed [in the Court’s order] at  least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may  result in the Motion being placed off calendar or denied.” (Id.)    On  September 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Non-Service Report as to Defendant Samo  Enterprises.    On  September 28, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an Application to Serve Defendant Samo  Enterprises through the California Secretary of State (the “Application”).[1] The Application is made on the grounds that Defendant Samo  Enterprises cannot with reasonable diligence be found at the addresses listed  for personally delivering service and is likely avoiding service. On September  28, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a declaration from Nima Heydari in support of the  Application.    On  October 24, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a declaration from Nima Heydari re: an Order  to Show Cause as to Service of Defendant Samo Enterprises.  This declaration appears to be in response to  the Court’s August 10, 2023 Order.    No opposition  brief was filed. Any opposition brief was required to have been filed and  served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc. §  1005(b).)    MOVING PARTY  POSITION               Plaintiffs  contend that the controversy is covered by the arbitration provision in the  RISC. Plaintiffs assert that the parties do not agree on the forum of  arbitration. Plaintiffs indicate that they elect the American Arbitration  Association (“AAA”) or, in the alternative, JAMS as the arbitration forum.    OPPOSITION               No  opposition brief was filed.        ANALYSIS   I.          Compelling  Arbitration    A.                 Legal Standard  “A party who claims that there is a  written agreement to arbitrate may petition the superior court for an order to  compel arbitration” pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section  1281.2. Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th  348, 356. “California law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid  arbitration agreements.” Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services,  Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97. “On petition of a party to an arbitration  agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a  controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that  controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to  arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the  controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel  arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for  rescission of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.) A party opposing a  petition to compel arbitration “bears the burden of proving by a preponderance  of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.” Banner Entertainment,  Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356.  Where a motion to compel arbitration  is granted, a court “shall, upon motion of a party to such action or  proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in  accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court  specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.4.)   B.        Discussion   On September 27, 2023, Plaintiffs  filed a Non-Service Report as to Defendant Samo Enterprises. The Non-Service  Report shows attempts to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises at 11575 Moorpark  St., Apt. 204, North Hollywood, CA 91602 on August 18, August 22, August 27,  and August 30, 2023.  On October 24, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the  Declaration of Nima Heydari (“Heydari”) re: order to show cause as to service  of Defendant Samo Enterprises. Such declaration sets forth service efforts as  to Defendant Samo Enterprises. Plaintiffs’ attorneys have been diligently  trying to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises; however, they have not been  successful because Defendant Samo Enterprises is no longer a functioning  business and is listed as a suspended corporation on the California Secretary  of State website. (Heydari Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) Plaintiffs sent the summons and  complaint to Onelegal—the process service company that counsel typically does  business with—who attempted to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises at Basil Daniel  Jurdi’s (the Agent for Service of Process for Defendant Samo Enterprises) at  the address listed in the Secretary of State filings for the business, which is  the Doric Street Address. (Id., ¶ 5.) A process server has made five  attempts to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises at the Doric Street Address. (Id.,  ¶¶ 5-6.) Counsel has attempted to obtain change of address information from the  local post office, but has not yet received any response to their request. (Id.,  ¶¶ 7-8.) Counsel obtained a skip trace of Mr. Jurdi but the skip trace was  unsuccessful in locating Mr. Jurdi at the address of 115775 Moorpark St., Apt  204, North Hollywood, CA 91602.[2]  (Id., ¶ 9.) Heydari states that an application to serve Defendant Samo  Enterprises by way of the Secretary of State was filed on September 28, 2023,  and such application is waiting to be heard by the Court.[3]  (Id., ¶ 10.) Plaintiffs request that the Court either grant the Motion  or continue the hearing for 90 days to allow for service of Defendant Samo  Enterprises. (Id., ¶ 11.)  The Court continues the hearing on the  Motion to allow Plaintiffs additional time to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises  with the summons, complaint, and Motion. Plaintiffs are also ordered to reserve  a hearing date on the Application and properly notice the Application. Defendant  Samo Enterprises is entitled to notice of this action, as well as the instant Motion,  to comport with due process.    II.        Conclusion                           The hearing on the Motion scheduled for November 8, 2023  is CONTINUED to Thursday, February 8, 2024 at 10:00 A.M. in this department. At  least sixteen (16) court days before the next scheduled hearing, Plaintiffs are  ordered to file supplemental papers addressing any additional service efforts.  Failure to do so may result in the Motion being placed off-calendar or denied.                Moving party is ordered to give  notice.
