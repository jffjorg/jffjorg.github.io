Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendants' motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the Complaint. The Judge finds that the Defendants failed to prove the existence of a valid arbitration agreement that is enforceable by them. Specifically, the Judge found that the Defendants failed to authenticate the signature on the arbitration agreement and provide sufficient evidence to support a finding that the electronic signature was the act of the Plaintiff. The Judge relies on the case law, including Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc., to support their decision.
