[1] Plaintiff owes this Court $300 in filing fees.  Only one discovery request is to be filed for
each motion to compel.  Plaintiff’s
single motion involves six discovery requests: request for admissions, form interrogatories,
special interrogatories, request for production, motion to compel the
deposition of Defendant’s PMK, and motion to compel the deposition of Jorge
Cuervo-Vela.  
 
Further, Plaintiff’s
notice does not properly specify the type of written discovery sought in this
motion; Plaintiff cannot move for a motion to compel “written discovery.” A
motion to compel each type of discovery request is subject to an individual statute.
