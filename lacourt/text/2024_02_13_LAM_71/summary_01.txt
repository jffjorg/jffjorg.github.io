And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied all of plaintiff Adan Gomez-Rivera's motions to compel discovery responses from defendants ADB Global Trade LLC and Cosentino Group. The motions included requests to compel the deposition of PMK, the deposition of Cuervo-Vela, and responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents. The judge found that plaintiff failed to make the requisite showing on a motion for an order compelling the attendance and testimony of PMK, and that the discovery was not likely to lead to the production of evidence of jurisdictional facts. The judge also found that plaintiff failed to show a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion. As a result, the motions are denied, and plaintiff is ordered to pay $300 in filing fees to the clerk of the court.
