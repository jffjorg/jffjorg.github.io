          Plaintiff
Adan Gomez-Rivera (“Gomez-Rivera”) (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel Specially Appearing Defendant Cosentino Group (“Cosentino
Group”) to provide responses to Plaintiff’s written discovery, person most
knowledgeable deposition, and deposition of Jorge Cuervo-Vela.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P §§2030.220,
2030.300, 2017.010, 2019.010 et seq., 2025.010 et seq.)[1]
 
Meet and Confer
C.C.P. §2025.450(b)(2) requires that a
motion to compel a party deponent to appear or produce documents “shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when
the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance.” 
(C.C.P. §2025.450(b)(2).)  The attempt to resolve informally may be made
either by conferring “in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing
party or attorney.”  (C.C.P.
§2023.010(i), [failure to make such attempt constitutes “misuse of discovery
process”].)
Plaintiff’s counsel declares she noticed the January
31, 2024, depositions of Specially Appearing Defendant’s custodian of
records (“PMK”) and Jorge Cuervo-Vela on January 3, 2024.  (Decl. of Young ¶¶13,
23-24, Exhs. J, K.)  Plaintiff’s counsel
also declares on November 8, 2023, she served Requests for Admission, Set One
(“RFA”), Form Interrogatories, Set One (“FROG”), Special Interrogatories, Set
One (“SROG”), Request for Production of Documents, Set One (“RFP”), and a declaration
for additional discovery.  (Decl.
of Young ¶¶9, 14-18, Exhs. A-E.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel declares Defense counsel stated that they
would be serving objections only to the written discovery and that they will
not produce the PMK or Mr. Cuervo-Vela until after the hearing on the Motion to
Quash.  (Decl. of Young ¶11.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel declares on December 12, 2023, Defendant served
Objections to Plaintiff’s RFAs, FROGs, SROGs, and RFPs.  (Decl. of Young ¶¶12,
19-22, Exhs. F-I.)

Plaintiff’s counsel’s meet and confer
efforts are sufficient per the requirements to meet and confer by telephone.  (C.C.P. §2023.010(i).)  However, Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration
does not state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.  (C.C.P. §2016.040.)
 
Discussion
1.     Motion to Compel Deposition of PMK

Having reviewed Plaintiff’s motion to
compel Specially Appearing Defendant’s PMK to attend and produce documents at
deposition, the Court rules as follows.
          On
January 3, 2024, Plaintiff noticed the deposition of Specially Appearing Defendant’s
PMK to occur on January 31, 2024.  (Decl.
of Young ¶¶13, 24, Exh. K.)  
          Plaintiff
cannot request discovery from a defendant, including noticing a deposition, without
leave of court until after the defendant is served with summons.  (C.C.P. §§2025.210(b).)  Specially Appearing Defendant has filed a
motion to quash service of summons, which is the appropriate mechanism to
determine if Specially Appearing Defendant’s PMK is subject to Plaintiff’s
deposition notice.
          Plaintiff
has failed to make the requisite showing on a motion for an order compelling
Specially Appearing Defendant’s PMK’s attendance and testimony for deposition “that
discovery is likely to lead to the production of evidence of facts establishing
jurisdiction.”  (In re Automobile
Antitrust Cases I & II (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 100,
127, citing Beckman v. Thompson (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 481, 486-487.)  Plaintiff fails to suggest that
discovery was likely to produce evidence of additional California contacts by
Specially Appearing Defendant relating to its supply of artificial stone
products to the state.  Plaintiff merely argues he has a
“good-faith belief that the jurisdictional discovery as propounded will elicit
further information regarding Cosentino’s extensive contacts with California.”  (Motion, pg. 7.)
          The
Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel Specially Appearing Defendant’s PMK
to attend and produce documents at deposition.
 
2.     Motion to Compel Deposition of
Cuervo-Vela, FROGs, SROGs, RFPs, and Deem RFAs Admitted
For the same reasons stated with regard
to Plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of Specially Appearing
Defendant’s PMK, Plaintiff’s motion to compel the deposition of Cuervo-Vela,
and Specially Appearing Defendant’s answers to FROG, SROG, and RFP, and deem
RFA admitted is denied,
 
Conclusion

motion to compel the deposition of Specially Appearing Defendant’s PMK is
denied.
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel the deposition of Cuervo-Vela is denied.
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel answers to FROG is denied.
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel answers to SROG is denied.

Plaintiff is
ordered to pay $300 in filing fees to the Clerk of this Court within 20 days of
this ruling.
