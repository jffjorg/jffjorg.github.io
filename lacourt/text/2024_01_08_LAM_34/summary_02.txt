And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has decided to dismiss the case due to the plaintiff's failure to serve the defendants with the complaint and the plaintiff's inability to represent LA Fitness, a business entity. The plaintiff has been attempting to represent LA Fitness pro se, but this is not allowed. The judge believes that the case is not viable and that the plaintiff's claims are "fantastic" and "delusional". The judge also notes that each time the case is called, it costs the taxpayers of California more money. The judge is exercising its discretion to strike the complaint and dismiss the case.
