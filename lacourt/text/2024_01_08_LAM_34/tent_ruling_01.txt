ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“This part shall
be known and may be cited as the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of
2004.” (Lab. Code, § 2698.)
 
“Notwithstanding
any other provision of law, any provision of this code that provides for a
civil penalty to be assessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards,
agencies, or employees, for a violation of this code, may, as an alternative,
be recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf
of himself or herself and other current or former employees pursuant to the
procedures specified in Section 2699.3.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (a).)
 
In bringing an action pursuant to the Labor
Code Private Attorneys General Act of (2004) (“PAGA”), “the aggrieved employee
acts as the proxy or agent of state labor law enforcement agencies,
representing the same legal right and interest of those agencies, in a
proceeding that is designed to protect the public, not to benefit private
parties.” (Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Super. Ct. (2009)
46 Cal.4th 993, 1003, citations omitted.)
 
        PAGA claims, as well as
settlements of PAGA claims, involve multiple statutory requirements. (Lab.
Code, § 2699, et seq.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
The Court considers below the various
statutory requirements of PAGA, as well as whether the settlement meets the
fair, reasonable, and adequate standard.

Legal Standard
 
“A civil action by an aggrieved employee pursuant to subdivision
(a) or (f) of Section 2699 alleging a violation of any provision listed in

within 10 days following commencement of a civil action pursuant to this part,
provide the Labor and Workforce Development Agency with a file-stamped copy of
the complaint that includes the case number assigned by the court.” (Lab. Code,
§ 2699, subd. (l)(1).)
 
“The superior
court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action filed
pursuant to this part. The proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency
at the same time that it is submitted to the court.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(l)(2).)
 
2.         
Discussion
 
Plaintiff filed causes of action for various
labor code violations, including violations of Labor Code sections 201, 202,
203, 1174, subdivision (d), and others. These sections are covered by Labor
Code section 2699.5, and thus the pre-complaint notice requirement to the Labor
Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) applies here. (Lab. Code, § 2699.3, subd.
(a).)
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel declares that Plaintiff
sent a notice letter to LWDA on November 19, 2021. (Decl. Messrelian, ¶ 5.) The
Court finds that this meets the notice requirement under Labor Code sections
2699.3 and 2699.5. 
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel declares that a copy of
the Complaint has since been filed with the LWDA on November 13, 2023. (Supp.
Decl. Messrelian, ¶ 4 and Exh. 1.) The Court finds that this meets the notice
requirement under Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(1).
 
Plaintiff provides email evidence of
submission of a copy of the proposed settlement to LWDA at the same time that
it submitted the proposed settlement to the Court. (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(l)(2); Decl. Messrelian, Exh. 2.) The Court finds that this meets the notice
requirement under Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2).
 
B.         
The PAGA Settlement
 
1.         
Legal Standard
 
“For all provisions of this code except those for which a civil
penalty is specifically provided, there is established a civil penalty for a
violation of these provisions, as follows: . . . (2) If, at the time of the
alleged violation, the person employs one or more employees, the civil penalty
is one hundred dollars ($100) for each aggrieved employee per pay period for
the initial violation and two hundred dollars ($200) for each aggrieved
employee per pay period for each subsequent violation.” (Lab. Code, § 2699,
subd. (f)(2).)
 
“For purposes of
this part, whenever the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, or any of its
departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, has
discretion to assess a civil penalty, a court is authorized to exercise the
same discretion, subject to the same limitations and conditions, to assess a
civil penalty.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (e)(1).)
 
“In any action by
an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty available under
subdivision (a) or (f), a court may award a lesser amount than the maximum
civil penalty amount specified by this part if, based on the facts and
circumstances of the particular case, to do otherwise would result in an award
that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.” (Lab. Code, § 2699,
subd. (e)(2).)
 
“Except as
provided in subdivision (j), civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees
shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws, including the administration
of this part, and for education of employers and employees about their rights
and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated to
supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes; and
25 percent to the aggrieved employees.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).)
 
“Except as
provided in paragraph (2), an aggrieved employee may recover the civil penalty
described in subdivision (f) in a civil action pursuant to the procedures
specified in Section 2699.3 filed on behalf of himself or herself and other
current or former employees against whom one or more of the alleged violations
was committed. Any employee who prevails in any action shall be entitled to an
award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, including any filing fee paid
pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) or
subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 2699.3. Nothing
in this part shall operate to limit an employee’s right to pursue or recover
other remedies available under state or federal law, either separately or
concurrently with an action taken under this part.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(g)(1).)
 
2.         
Highlights of the Proposed PAGA Settlement
 
Among other things, the following are the
highlights of the proposed PAGA settlement:
 
(1)       Defendant KAM
Enterprises LLC will pay a gross settlement amount of $25,000.00 (the “Gross
Settlement Amount”). 
 
(2)       PAGA Counsel (who
are Plaintiff’s Counsel) will be paid up to 33.33% of the Gross Settlement
Amount (which would be $8,333.33), plus up to $2,000.00 in costs (the “Costs”),
which is an additional 8% of the Gross Settlement Amount.
 
(3)       ILYM Group, Inc.
(the “PAGA Administrator”) will be paid up to $2,900.00, except for a showing
of good cause and as approved by the Court. This is 11.6% of the Gross
Settlement Amount. 
 
(4)       LWDA and the
Aggrieved Employees (including Plaintiff, who will be receiving her pro rata
share of the PAGA penalties) will receive 75% and 25%, respectively, of the
remaining $11,766.67.
 
(5)       The settlement
agreement does not clearly address the issue of whether Plaintiff’s non-PAGA
claims have also been settled, whether as part of this agreement or as part of
a separate agreement. 
 
(6)       There are estimated
to be 142 Aggrieved Employees who worked a total of 1,109 of PAGA-relevant pay
periods. The Aggrieved Employees will receive payments from the PAGA
Administrator based on a division of the employee share of the PAGA penalties
that is multiplied by each employee’s number of PAGA-relevant pay periods. 
 
(7)       Aggrieved Employees
will have up to 180 days to cash their settlement checks, after which those
checks will be voided, and the funds represented by such checks will be sent to
the California State Controller’s Office — Unclaimed Property Fund. Defendant
has agreed to not receive any reversion from the Gross Settlement Amount. 
 
(Decl. Messrelian, Exh. 1.)
 
        The proposed PAGA settlement
also includes other terms, such as for distribution of the settlement and
release from claims. (Ibid.)
 
3.         
Attorneys’ Fees and Attorneys’ Costs
 
PAGA Counsel requests $8,333.33 in attorneys’
fees, which is approximately 33.33% of the Gross Settlement Amount. PAGA
Counsel further requests $1,641.25 in costs, which is an additional 6.57% of
the Gross Settlement Amount. 
 
PAGA Counsel explains that $8,333.33 in attorneys’
fees is less than the reasonable amount of attorney’s fees incurred in this
matter, which is approximately $12,375.00 (22.5 hours at $550.00 per hour).
(Supp. Decl. Messrelian, ¶ 5.) 
 
PAGA Counsel further outlines the costs
incurred, which are: (1) $462.27 in case filing costs; (2) $75.00 in initial
PAGA notice costs; (3) $1,000.00 in expert data analyst costs; (4) $61.54 in
motion filing costs; and (5) $42.33 in miscellaneous court filing costs. (Supp.
Decl. Messrelian, ¶ 6.)
 
The Court finds that the fees and costs
requested are reasonable here. 
 
4.         
PAGA Administrator Costs
 
PAGA Counsel requests that the PAGA
Administrator be paid up to $2,900.00 (which is 11.6% of the Gross Settlement
Amount) for expenses incurred in administering the settlement.
 
PAGA Counsel has provided an invoice that
shows the expected costs for administering the settlement. (Decl. Mullins, Exh.
C.) The total expect amount is $2,773.00, which is close to the $2,900.00
requested. 
 
The Court finds this amount of administration
costs to be reasonable. The Court also finds it appropriate that the agreement
contains a provision in which any unused portion of this amount would go to
LWDA and Aggrieved Employees in their proportionate amounts. 
 
5.         
Remaining Civil Penalties for LWDA and Aggrieved
Employees
 
PAGA Counsel requests that LWDA and the
Aggrieved Employees receive 75% and 25%, respectively, of the “Net Settlement
Amount (i.e., the Gross Settlement Amount, less the Attorneys’ Fees, Attorneys’
Costs, and PAGA Administrator Costs). 
 
This division of the civil penalties is
required pursuant to Labor Code §2699(i).
 
PAGA Counsel claim that the Net Settlement
Amount is estimated to be $11,766.67. 
 
A division of $8,825.00 to LWDA (i.e., 75% of
the Net Settlement Amount), and $2,941.67 (i.e., 25% of the Net Settlement
Amount) would be appropriate, with any further savings from the PAGA
Administrator’s Costs being split similarly. 
 
6.         
Reversion of Funds
 
The settlement agreement gives Aggrieved
Employees up to 180 days to cash their settlement checks, after which those
checks will be voided. Further, the funds represented by such checks will be
sent to the California State Controller’s Office — Unclaimed Property Fund. Defendant
KAM Enterprises LLC has forgone any reversion interest. 
 
The Court finds that these terms are
appropriate. 
 
7.         
Enhancement Award
 
The Court is unaware of any provision in the
settlement agreement that awards (or does not award) Plaintiff any “bonus” or
enhancement award for bringing this case. 
 
However, Plaintiff’s Counsel declares that
Plaintiff has made a separate settlement with Defendant KAM Enterprises LLC
that covers her non-PAGA claims. (Decl. Messrelian, ¶ 22.) According to
Plaintiff’s Counsel, this amount was in the four figures and did not in any way
impact the amount allocated to the PAGA claims. (Ibid.)
 
The Court finds that this separate settlement
agreement and foregoing of a bonus or enhancement award to be reasonable. 
 
8.         
Notice of Release of Claims
 
PAGA Counsel provide a revised proposed
notice to the Aggrieved Employees, which includes the following notice. (Supp.
Decl. Messrelian, Exh. 2.) 
 



BY CASHING THIS CHECK,
  YOU ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY RIGHT TO SUE FOR ANY ALLEGED GRIEVANCES THAT YOU
  HAVE AGAINST KAM ENTERPRISES, LLC (d.b.a. FARMER BOYS)



 
The Court is satisfied with the revised
proposed notice. 
 
C.         
The Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate Standard
 
1.         
Legal Standard
 
The Court of Appeal has held “that a trial court should evaluate a PAGA
settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in view of
PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future ones,
and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.” (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc.
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77, citations omitted.)
 
“Despite the fact
that a representative action under PAGA is not a class action, and is instead a
type of qui tam action, a standard
requiring the trial court to determine independently whether a PAGA settlement
is fair and reasonable is appropriate. . . . Because many of the factors used
to evaluate class action settlements bear on a settlement’s fairness—including
the strength of the plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the proceeding,
the complexity and likely duration of further litigation, and the settlement
amount—these factors can be useful in evaluating the fairness of a PAGA
settlement.” (Moniz, supra, at pp. 76–77.)
 
2.         
Discussion
 
PAGA Counsel provide a detailed explanation
of the Parties’ settlement negotiations, including: (1) the discovery and
investigation that occurred in this matter; (2) the Parties’ negotiations; and
(3) consideration of the merits of the case. (Decl. Messrelian, ¶¶ 20.)
 
Upon the Court’s request, PAGA Counsel
provide a supplemental explanation regarding the settlement. (Supp. Motion, pp.
5–8; Supp. Decl. Messrelian, ¶¶ 8–10.)
 
The Court finds that the settlement meets the
fair, reasonable, and adequate standard. 
 
II.       
Conclusion
 
The Supplemental
Unopposed Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement is GRANTED.
