And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint. The demurrer was filed by Cross-Defendant Jeffrey Silverman and argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the dispute regarding the 2011 loan made by Jeffrey to Arrow Tools, Fasteners & Saw, Inc. The Court finds that the loan was made with community property funds and that the Family Code states that community assets not previously adjudicated in a divorce proceeding remain under the continuing jurisdiction of the Family Court. Therefore, the Court sustains the demurrer to the fifteenth cause of action for conversion and the sixteenth cause of action for declaratory relief. The Court orders Cross-Defendant Jeffrey Silverman to file and serve an answer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint within 20 days of notice of the ruling.
