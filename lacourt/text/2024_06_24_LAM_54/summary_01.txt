And here is an English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike certain portions of the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The defendant had sought to strike the plaintiff's prayers for indemnification, arguing that the plaintiff cannot state claims for equitable indemnity against the defendant because of the worker's compensation exclusivity rule. However, the judge found that the plaintiff is not seeking equitable indemnity against the defendant, but rather express indemnity under the parties' Master Services Agreement. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations that it has no share of liability must be treated as true. As a result, the defendant's motion to strike was denied.
