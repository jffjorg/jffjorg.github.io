And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the plaintiffs, Arman Yegiyants and 10415 Commerce, LLC, against the defendant, Hratchia Bardakjian. The plaintiffs seek to have the court rule that Hratchia Bardakjian does not have an interest in the properties at issue in the case. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs are judicially estopped from taking the position that Hratchia Bardakjian does not have an interest in the properties, as they previously opposed the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the same issue.

The judge notes that the defendant's argument is unconvincing and that the court is not clear as to the thrust of the defendant's argument regarding the one final judgment rule. The judge also expresses confusion as to why Hratchia Bardakjian stated he has an economic interest in 10415 Commerce, LLC, and asks the plaintiffs to clarify how they have proven each element of a quiet title cause of action.

The judge is considering granting the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, but will hear argument from both parties at the hearing to determine the outcome.
