[TENTATIVE
RULING ON MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES] 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED 
Attorneys for Mark S. Adams, Former Receiver, moves to approve and confirm
award of attorneys fees and costs incurred after October 23, 2020.
 
Former Receiver’s counsel, Ervin
Cohen & Jessup LLP (ECJ), requests that the Court approve and confirm an award
of attorneys fees in the amount of $134,515.00, and costs in the amount of
$10,277.92, which represents the actual fees and costs incurred by ECJ since
entry of the First ECJ Payment Order. In addition, ECJ requests that the Court
order the approved fees and costs to be paid as an administrative expense of
the receivership estate by the Replacement Receiver. ECJ’s request for this
supplemental order approving and confirming its fees and costs as general
counsel to the Former Receiver is made pursuant to California Rule of Court
3.1184, which requires a receiver or an attorney employed by a receiver to
state in detail what services have been performed and whether previous
allowances have been made and the amounts. In support of its request for
approval and confirmation of fees and costs, ECJ has attached copies of its
billing statements since October 23, 2020, through and including June 30, 2023.

Background According to Movant
The following Background was
provided by Movant:
 
On or about December 15, 2017, the
Former Receiver was appointed as the receiver in this matter for the real
property located at 1001 Las Lomas Drive, Duarte California (the “Property”)
pursuant to a Stipulation between the City of Duarte, and Levon H. Bardakjian
and Sylvia R. Bardakjian (the “Bardakjians”). (Adams Decl. ¶3, Ex. 1.) Miken
Construction Company, Inc. (“Miken”) was the contractor retained by the Former
Receiver to complete the emergency corrections at the Property. (Id.)
 
On or about April 15, 2020, the
Former Receiver filed an Ex Parte Application outlining the issues caused by
the lack of funding and the then-month-old pandemic. (Id. ¶4.) The
Application was submitted after (and because) attempts to negotiate interim
funding with the Bardakjians and Chase Bank failed. (Id.) That same day,
the parties (the City of Duarte, the Bardakjians, and lender Chase Bank) filed
a Joint Stipulation for Order Appointing Eric Beatty as Replacement Receiver
(the “Replacement Stipulation”) wherein the Former Receiver would be replaced
by the current Receiver, Eric Beatty (the “Replacement Receiver”). (Id.)
On April 17, 2020, the Court entered its Order appointing the Replacement
Receiver over the Property (the “Replacement Order”). (Id.) After entry
of the Court’s Replacement Order, the Former Receiver transferred possession
and control of the Property to the Replacement Receiver. (Id.)
 
Due to the statements set forth in
the Replacement Stipulation, and the parties having informed the Former
Receiver that they intended to oppose his final account and report, the Former
Receiver determined that he required the services of general counsel that was
experienced in receivership matters to assist him in generally carrying out his
court-imposed duties, including but not limited to preparing the Former
Receiver’s final account and report, and responding to any opposition thereto.
(Id. ¶5.) The Former Receiver believed that retention of counsel
possessing substantial experience in receivership matters was critical to the
efficient administration of the receivership estate. (Id.) Therefore,
and subject to the approval of this Court, on or about April 24, 2020, the
Former Receiver retained Byron Z. Moldo, Esq. of ECJ to serve as the Receiver’s
general counsel. (Id.)
 
On August 5, 2020, the Former
Receiver prepared and filed an ex parte motion to approve and confirm the
retention of ECJ as general counsel, effective April 24, 2020. (Id. ¶6.)
On August 13, 2020, this Court filed its order granting the Former Receiver’s
ex parte motion, and approved and confirmed the retention of ECJ as general
counsel to the Former Receiver, effective April 24, 2020. (Id.)
 
On October 23, 2020, this Court granted
the Former Receiver’s motion for an order discharging him and approving the
Former Receiver’s fees and costs. (Id. ¶7.) Also on October 23, 2020,
the Court granted ECJ’s Motion to approve award of attorneys’ fees and costs,
in part, and awarded a total award of $30,226.50 to ECJ, representing fees and
costs incurred through and including October 23, 2020, to be paid by the
Replacement Receiver (the “First ECJ Payment Order”). (Id.) ECJ received
the awarded funds on or about October 28, 2021. (Moldo Decl. ¶5.) Notably,
ECJ’s accrued but unpaid fees and costs prior to October 23, 2020 total
$17,984.85. (Id.) Thereafter, the Bardakjians filed their Motion for
leave to file a complaint against the Former Receiver, which the Receivership
Court granted on December 18, 2020. (Adams Decl. ¶7.)
 
After the Replacement Receiver was
appointed, Miken was not paid amounts it was due. (Id. ¶8.) Thereafter,
on September 24, 2020, Miken filed its Complaint for: 1. Breach of Contract;
and 2. Foreclosure of Mechanic’s Lien against the Replacement Receiver, the
Former Receiver, and the Bardakjians, thereby commencing the action entitled
Miken Construction Company, Inc. v. Eric Beatty, et al., LASC Case No.
20GDCV00769 (the “Miken Action”). (Id.) On January 26, 2021, the
Bardakjians filed their Complaint for Damages against the Former Receiver,
thereby commencing the action entitled Levon H. Bardakjian, et al., v. Mark S.
Adams, et al., LASC Case No. 21GDCV00118 (the “Bardakjian Action”). (Id.)
 
The parties attended a Court-ordered
mediation to attempt to resolve their claims in this matter, the Miken Action
and the Bardakjian Action on October 11, 2023. (Id. ¶9.) The parties did
not settle their claims in the Bardakjian Action, but the Miken Action was
settled. Miken filed its request for dismissal in the Miken Action on February
1, 2023. (Id.) Currently, trial in the Bardakjian Action is set to begin
on April 8, 2024. (Id.)
 
On February 25, 2022 this Court
entered its Order regarding the distribution of the sale proceeds from the
Replacement Receiver’s sale of the Property, pursuant to which Order the
Replacement Receiver was ordered to retain the sum of $613,691.00. (Id.
¶10, Ex. 2.) Thereafter, this Court entered its Order on December 7, 2022
authorizing the Replacement Receiver to pay $67,500.00 to Miken based on the
parties’ settlement agreement. (Id., Ex. 3.) Accordingly, it is
estimated that there is not less than $546,191.00 in the receivership estate at
this time. (Id.)
 
Subsequently, the Bardakjians filed
a Motion requesting that the Court partially release and refund to them “unused
funds reserved for payment to Miken” on or about January 27, 2023. (Id.
¶11.) Specifically, the Bardakjians requested that the Replacement Receiver be
ordered to release the sum of $59,500.00 to the Bardakjians immediately. (Id.)
The Court denied the Bardakjians’ Motion on April 14, 2023. (Id.)
 
(Adams’ Mot. p. 4-7.)
 
Former Receiver’s Arguments
ECJ argues as follows:
 
ECJ requests that the Court approve
and confirm an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $134,515.00, and costs
in the amount of $10,277.92 incurred after October 23, 2020, through and
including June 30, 2023. Previously, this Court approved ECJ’s retention as the
Receiver’s counsel on August 13, 2020. Since the Court’s initial October 23,
2020 Order awarding ECJ its fees and costs issued almost three years ago – ECJ
has been required to defend the Former Receiver in related actions commenced by
the defendants in this case and Miken Construction Company, Inc; respond to
requests in this main receivership action regarding the distribution of sale
proceeds; and continue to monitor and attend status conferences in this
receivership action and the related actions. Accordingly, ECJ requests that the
Court approve and confirm an award of ECJ’s attorney’s fees and costs incurred
after October 23, 2020, through and including June 30, 2023. In addition, ECJ
requests that the Court order the approved fees and costs to be paid as an
administrative expense of the receivership estate by the Replacement Receiver.
 
(Adams’ Mot. p. 4.)
 
ECJ cites to CRC 3.1184 entitled
“Receiver’s final account and report”, subsection (d), which states, “If any
allowance of compensation for the receiver or for an attorney employed by the
receiver is claimed in an account, it must state in detail what services have
been performed by the receiver or the attorney and whether previous allowances
have been made to the receiver or attorney and the amounts.” (CRC 3.1184(d).)


TENTATIVE RULING
The
Court tentatively plans to GRANT Movant’s request for attorney fees and costs.
As noted by Plaintiffs’ Opposition, “There is no authority
offered to support the continued payment of attorneys’ fees and costs following
the former receiver’s conclusion of his court appointed duties and his
discharge from acting as the receiver.” (Pl. Oppo. p. 1.)
ECJ’s citations to People v. Riverside University
(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 572 and Southern California Sunbelt Developers, Inc. v.
Banyan Limited Partnership (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 910 in the reply brief appear
to support the proposition that a receiver can continue, in some circumstances,
to be entitled to payment of fees after discharge. 
In the 04/17/2020 Joint Stipulation for Order
Appointing Eric Beatty as Replacement Receiver Order, this Joint Stipulation
noted in relevant part:
5. Receiver Adams
is directed to immediately file with the Court and serve on the parties his final
accounting on a noticed motion basis in accordance with the requirements in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1005. 
 
6. Any fees owed
to Receiver Adams that have been approved by the Court shall be paid from the
receivership estate. Receiver Adams may not incur any additional fees from
those necessary to transition the receivership to Replacement Receiver and file
his final accounting. 
 
7. All of the
parties in this Receivership Action agree to this Stipulation. There are no
other parties in the Receivership Action.
 
(04/17/2020 Joint
Stipulation)
 
Further, in the
10/23/2020 Minute Order, the Court noted in relevant part:
 
Motion for Order
of Discharge and Exoneration of Surety is GRANTED. Pursuant to CRC Rule
3.1184(a), the Court grants the Receiver’s request for discharge of the
Receiver and for exoneration of the Receiver’s surety. 
 
Motion of Former
Receiver for Payment of Fees, Costs and Advances is GRANTED, as modified. The
Court finds pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1184 (d) that the Final Account and Report
supports with sufficient detail an allowance of compensation for the Former
Receiver and for advances in the sum requested of = $387,090.89, less
deductions established by the City of: $100,163.88 and less deductions
established by defendant Chase of: $19,323.00, for a total award of
$267,604.01.
 
Motion of Ervin
Cohen & Jessup LLP, Attorney for Receiver, to Approve Award of Attorneys’
Fees and Costs is GRANTED in part. The Court finds that the fees and costs
appropriately supported by the motion are $24,564.50 in fees and $912 in costs,
for a total award of $25,476.50. This sum will be approved and awarded by the
Court.
 
Motion to
Surcharge Former Receiver for Unauthorized Attorney’s Fees and Any Improper,
Excessive and Unaccounted Expenses is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to defendants
seeking such relief in a separate civil action, pursuant to an appropriate
request to for leave to sue the Receiver, which the Court would likely grant.
If leave is granted to sue the Receiver and defendants opt to file a separate
civil action, the Court will also consider staying the payment of the fees and
advances awarded to the Former Receiver this date. The Court will not in any
case delay the payment of attorney’s fees ordered to be paid to Ervin Cohen
& Jessup.
 
(Min. Order
10/23/2020, p.9-10.)
 
The Former
Receiver notes that his continued involvement in this case is as a result of
the Bardakjians suing him based on his actions taken as a court-appointed
receiver.  While the Bardakjians argue
that “[a] receiver has no official dues and is not a proper party to any
action after being discharged by the court” they also are currently maintaining
a lawsuit against that same Former Receiver. 
The Bardakjians’ argument appears to be a heads-I-win, tails-you-lose
one.
 
The Court will
hear further argument at the hearing on these issues, but, as noted, the
tentative is to GRANT the motion. 
Neither the Bardakjians nor the City of Duarte raised any issues with
the amount sought or the billing breakdowns in their short briefs in opposition
to this motion.
