And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's Motion to Compel Plaintiff's Responses to Interrogatories and requesting sanctions in the amount of $940.00. The Defendant, Glendale Adventist Medical Center dba Adventist Health, filed the Motion on October 23, 2023, which is unopposed. The Plaintiff, Knarik Gharakhanian, failed to serve timely responses to interrogatories propounded by the Defendant on May 11, 2023, despite being given an opportunity to do so. As a result, the Defendant is seeking to compel the Plaintiff's responses and impose sanctions. The Court has determined that the Plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses waives all objections and sanctions will be imposed. The Court will take up the issue of sanctions at the hearing scheduled for November 17, 2023.
