**Tentative Ruling**

The Court will grant the Cross-Defendants' motion to strike the second and third causes of action from the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) for Quiet Title, Nuisance, and Trespass, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 (the "anti-SLAPP" statute).

The Court finds that the gravamen of the contested causes of action is not the Geragoses' constitutionally protected activities, such as filing pleadings with the court or communicating in anticipation of court proceedings, but rather the Friedlands' allegations of nuisance and trespass. The Geragoses' acts underlying these allegations are those pertaining to nuisance and trespass, not acts in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.

The Court also finds that the allegations referring to the Geragoses' protected activity are only incidental to the causes of action, and do not subject the causes of action to the anti-SLAPP statute. The Court will strike the second and third causes of action, as they do not arise from protected activity.

**Summary of the Case**

The case involves a dispute between the Geragoses and the Friedlands over the ownership of a property. The Geragoses filed a complaint for quiet title and a statutorily mandated lis pendens, and the Friedlands filed a cross-complaint for quiet title, nuisance, and trespass. The Geragoses argue that the Friedlands' causes of action are subject to the anti-SLAPP statute, while the Friedlands argue that the causes of action are not protected by the statute.

**Key Points**

* The Geragoses argue that the FACC implicates the anti-SLAPP statute because it arises out of the Geragoses' constitutionally protected activities.
* The Friedlands argue that the gravamen of the contested causes of action is the Geragoses' filing of a complaint for quiet title and a statutorily mandated lis pendens.
* The Court finds that the Geragoses' acts underlying the Friedlands' allegations are those pertaining to nuisance and trespass, not acts in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.
* The Court strikes the second and third causes of action, as they do not arise from protected activity.

**Procedural Background**

* The Geragoses filed a complaint for quiet title and a statutorily mandated lis pendens.
* The Friedlands filed a cross-complaint for quiet title, nuisance, and trespass.
* The Geragoses filed a special motion to strike the Friedlands' causes of action, alleging that they are subject to the anti-SLAPP statute.
* The Court will hear the motion and make a tentative ruling.

**Legal Analysis**

* The anti-SLAPP statute, California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, provides a procedural remedy to dispose of lawsuits that are brought to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights.
* To qualify for the anti-SLAPP statute, a cause of action must "arise from" protected activity, which includes acts in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.
* The Court must focus on the substance of the plaintiff's lawsuit in analyzing the first prong of a special motion to strike.
* The Court finds that the Geragoses' acts underlying the Friedlands' allegations are those pertaining to nuisance and trespass, not acts in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.

**Conclusion**

The Court will grant the Cross-Defendants' motion to strike the second and third causes of action from the FACC. The Geragoses' acts underlying the Friedlands' allegations are those pertaining to nuisance and trespass, not acts in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech. The Friedlands' causes of action are not subject to the anti-SLAPP statute.
