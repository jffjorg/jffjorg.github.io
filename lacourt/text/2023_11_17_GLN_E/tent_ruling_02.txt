Adventist Health Glendale (“Defendant”). (Complaint, ¶ Prem.L-1.) Plaintiff filed the initial Complaint on January 6, 2023.           Defendant has filed the instant Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Interrogatories (“Motion”) on October 23, 2023. The Motion is unopposed.      ANALYSIS: Legal Standard If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (b), (c).) Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2030.290, subds. (a)(1), (a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.) If a motion to compel responses to interrogatories is filed, the Court may impose a monetary sanction against the losing party “unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c).) Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)DiscussionDefendant provides the Declaration of Kylie A. Schofield (“Schofield Dec.”) which states that Defendant propounded and electronically served written discovery on Plaintiff on May 11, 2023, in the form of Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories. (Schofield Dec., ¶ 3.) The deadline to respond was June 12, 2023, however, no responses were received. (Id.) After following up with Plaintiff’s counsel, Defendant did not receive responses. (Id. at ¶ 5.) Pursuant to CCP § 2030.290 all objections are waived, and sanctions will be imposed. Defense counsel provides the following calculations:·      Counsel’s hourly rate is $220.00·      Counsel spent two hours drafting the instant Motion and anticipated another two hours reviewing opposition briefs and drafting a reply.·      Additionally, counsel incurred a $60.00 filing fee. The issue of sanctions will be taken up at the hearing. Conclusion The Motion is GRANTED.  The issue of sanctions will be taken up at the hearing.
