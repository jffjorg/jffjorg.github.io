  CASE NO.: 21STCV19858
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 23, 2024



 
William
L. Niu, counsel of record for Defendants Wenjie Chen, Hongmei Zhao, and Speedship
Logistics Inc., seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that there has been
a breakdown in communication between counsel and clients, and the clients have been
unable to meet their financial obligations to counsel.  No party opposed the motions.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  No trial date has been set, and there is no prejudice
to Defendants.
The
proposed orders do not include Wenjie Chen’s or Speedship Logistics Inc.’s current
or last known telephone numbers.  Counsel
must provide this information at the hearing.
Subject
to the provision of Wenjie Chen’s and Speedship Logistics Inc.’s phone numbers,
the unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof
of service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on Wenjie
Chen, Hongmei Zhao, Speedship Logistics Inc., and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for Speedship Logistics Inc. is scheduled for 04/22/2024 at
8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.  Speedship Logistics Inc. must retain new counsel
by that date or the Court may place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 23rd day of January 2024
