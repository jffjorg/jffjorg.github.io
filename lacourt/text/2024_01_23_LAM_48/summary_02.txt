And here is the English-text summary:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the defendants. The plaintiff, Sarah M. Strandberg, filed this action against the defendants, Inmaung F&M Corporation and Chavalit Inmaung, on April 11, 2023. The Court granted the plaintiff's unopposed motions to compel discovery on October 10, 2023, and ordered the defendants to serve verified responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff filed a motion for terminating sanctions on November 27, 2023, alleging that the defendants willfully failed to comply with the Court's discovery orders. The defendants did not file an opposition. The judge finds that the defendants' failure to comply with a single discovery order does not demonstrate a history of abuse that justifies terminating sanctions. The motion is denied without prejudice, and the parties are instructed to submit any objections to the tentative ruling by email.
