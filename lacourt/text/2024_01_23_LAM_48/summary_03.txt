The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the City of Los Angeles. The Plaintiff, Casa Golondrina, Inc., filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and covenant of good faith and fair dealing against the City, UNITE HERE Local 11, and Kevin De Leon. The City filed a demurrer and motion to strike, arguing that the Plaintiff did not adequately allege a breach of contractual obligations.

The Judge sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, finding that the Plaintiff did not adequately allege a breach of contract. The Judge also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, finding that the Plaintiff did not adequately allege a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The Judge denied the motion to strike in part, finding that some of the paragraphs alleged by the Plaintiff were relevant to the dispute. The Judge granted the motion to strike as to Paragraph 43, which alleged that the City was liable for the actions of UNITE HERE Local 11, which had been dismissed from the case.

The Judge gave the parties 30 days' leave to amend their pleadings and scheduled a hearing for January 23, 2024.
