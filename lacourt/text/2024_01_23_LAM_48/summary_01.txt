And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motions of counsel William L. Niu to be relieved as counsel for defendants Wenjie Chen, Hongmei Zhao, and Speedship Logistics Inc. The motions were unopposed, and the judge finds that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The judge notes that a corporation cannot represent itself in court, and therefore, Speedship Logistics Inc. must retain new counsel by April 22, 2024, or face the possibility of being placed in default. The judge also orders the parties to provide the current or last known telephone numbers of Wenjie Chen and Speedship Logistics Inc. by the hearing date.
