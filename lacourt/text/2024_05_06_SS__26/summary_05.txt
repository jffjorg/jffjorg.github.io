And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies plaintiff Joseph Ariel Hazani's motion for summary judgment. Hazani brought the action against defendant Deeann Dickson on March 20, 2024, and filed the motion for summary judgment on April 12 and 17, 2024. Dickson filed an answer on April 22, 2024. The court rules that the notice period for the motion was insufficient, as it was served only 43 days prior to the hearing date. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure, ยง 437c, which requires a 75-day notice period for personal service. The court also cites McMahon v. Superior Court and Yanez v. Vasquez, which hold that a defective service or shortened notice may be waived if the opposing party files an opposition on the merits and does not object to the shortened notice. Since there was no waiver in this case, the court denies the motion for summary judgment.
