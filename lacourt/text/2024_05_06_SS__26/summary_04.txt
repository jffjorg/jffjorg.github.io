And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant Antonio Vidal Victoria's motion to vacate judgment and quash bench warrant. The plaintiff, Midway Rent a Car, Inc., filed the lawsuit on July 7, 2022, and a default judgment was entered in their favor on February 21, 2023. A bench warrant was issued when the defendant failed to appear at a judgment debtor examination. The defendant filed a motion to vacate the judgment and quash the bench warrant, citing the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code. However, the court found that the defendant's bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed on December 4, 2023, and the bench warrant has since been recalled and quashed, making the request to quash the warrant moot.
