The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the lawsuit. The lawsuit was dismissed on November 14, 2023, after the plaintiff failed to appear in court.

The judge has reinstated the lawsuit and set a hearing for June 10, 2024, to show cause for the failure to file proof of service of summons and complaint.
