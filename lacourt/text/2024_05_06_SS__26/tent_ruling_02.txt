v. Velasquez, et al.DEEM
PLAINTIFF VEXATIOUS LITIGANT (CCP §§ 391.1, 391.3)
TENTATIVE RULING:

for Order Requiring Plaintiff to Post Security Pursuant to CCP 391.1 as a
Vexatious Litigant, or in the alternative, for an Order Dismissing the
Consolidated Cases is DENIED.
 
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
On October 29, 2021, Plaintiff Alejandro Diaz (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action against Defendants
Victor A. Velasquez and Melissa Vargas (“Moving
Defendants”), among others. The Complaint alleges a single violation of
section 51 of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. (Compl., ¶7.) 
 
The Court overruled Moving Defendants’ demurrer to the
Complaint on February 16, 2022 and they filed an answer the next day. On May
23, 2023, Moving Defendants filed a notice of related case with respect to Diaz
v. Velasquez, et al., LASC Case No. Case No. 23STLC01386 and a
Motion to Consolidate Cases. The Court granted the Motion to Consolidate on
August 2, 2023, designating this case as the lead case. (Minute Order,
08/02/23.) 
 
Moving Defendants filed a Motion for Order Requiring Plaintiff to
Post Security Pursuant to CCP 391.1 as a Vexatious Litigant, or in the
alternative, for an Order Dismissing the Consolidated Cases which was set for
hearing on February 28, 2024. The day before the hearing, February 27, 2024,
Defendants took that motion off calendar and filed the instant Motion for Order Requiring Plaintiff to Post
Security Pursuant to CCP 391.1 as a Vexatious Litigant, or in the alternative,
for an Order Dismissing the Consolidated Cases. Plaintiff filed an opposition
on March 12, 2024. 
 
Discussion

 
Defendants move for a vexatious
litigant designation on the grounds that Plaintiff meets the criteria of Code
of Civil Procedure section 391, subdivision (b)(1), as someone who “in the
immediately preceding seven-year period has commenced, prosecuted, or
maintained in propria persona at least five litigations ...(ii) unjustifiably
permitted to remain pending at least two years without having been brought to
trial or hearing,” and is therefore required to post security in order to
maintain this action absent a showing of a reasonable probability of
prevailing.
 
In support of this argument,
Defendants point to Plaintiff’s admission in both Complaints that he has filed
more than seven actions in the preceding year. (Compl., filed 10/29/21, ¶8;
Compl., filed 02/24/23, ¶8.) Defendants contend that at least five of those
cases— 21STLC06541, 18STLC09851, 18STLC10745, 18STLC10863, 18STLC11046, 18STLC11343,
18STLC13248, and 18STLC14009—unjustifiably remained pending for more than two
years as demonstrated by the fact that they were dismissed the week before
trial. None of these cases, however, were filed by Plaintiff in propria
persona, a fact of which the Court takes judicial notice. 
 
Therefore, Defendants have not
demonstrated that Plaintiff meets the definition of vexatious litigant under
Code of Civil Procedure section 391, subdivision (b)(1).
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Victor A. Velasquez and Melissa Vargas’ Motion
for Order Requiring Plaintiff to Post Security Pursuant to CCP 391.1 as a
Vexatious Litigant, or in the alternative, for an Order Dismissing the
Consolidated Cases is DENIED.
