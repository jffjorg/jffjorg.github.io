TENTATIVE RULING:

HEREBY VACATED.
 
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE FAILURE TO

ANALYSIS:
 
On May 17, 2022, Plaintiff Hyung
Ho Park filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendant
Connie M. Cordero (“Defendant”). No proof of service of the Summons and Complaint
have been filed. The case came for trial on November 14, 2023, at which time
Plaintiff failed to appear and the Court dismissed the action without
prejudice. (Minute Order, 11/14/23.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal on April
15, 2024. No opposition to the Motion has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b). Under this statute, an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the moving
party’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
143.) When based on attorney fault with respect to entry of default, default
judgment, or involuntary dismissal, a timely request for relief must be
granted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) When brought pursuant to the
provision for discretionary relief based on party fault, the request must have
been filed within a reasonable amount of time. 
 
The motion was timely filed five
months after dismissal of the action and is supported by an attorney affidavit
of fault. Plaintiff’s counsel declares that they mis-calendared the date of the
trial. (Motion, Choi Decl., ¶6.) Therefore, the case must be reinstated under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 

 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Hyung Ho Park’s Motion to
Vacate Dismissal is GRANTED. THE DISMISSAL ENTERED ON NOVEMBER 14, 2023 IS
HEREBY VACATED.
 
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE
FAILURE TO FILE PROOF OF SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT IS SET FOR JUNE 10,
