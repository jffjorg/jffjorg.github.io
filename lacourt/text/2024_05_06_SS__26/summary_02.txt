And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Victor A. Velasquez and Melissa Vargas, have moved for an order requiring the plaintiff, Alejandro Diaz, to post security as a vexatious litigant or, in the alternative, for an order dismissing the consolidated cases. The plaintiff has filed multiple lawsuits in recent years, including at least five cases that remained pending for more than two years. However, the defendants have not demonstrated that the plaintiff meets the definition of a vexatious litigant under the California Code of Civil Procedure section 391, subdivision (b)(1). Therefore, the defendants' motion is denied.
