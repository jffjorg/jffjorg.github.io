And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied S&D Drywall's motion to compel a second deposition of Plaintiff Hector Hugo Salazar Mata. S&D Drywall argued that it needed to investigate further Plaintiff's medical and psychological claims, including PTSD, major depressive disorder, and suicidal ideations, which were disclosed only weeks before the initial deposition. However, the judge found that S&D Drywall was already aware of these claims and that Plaintiff had disclosed them in a timely manner. The judge also noted that S&D Drywall could have continued the deposition to a future date to allow for further discovery, but instead chose to proceed with the deposition on the originally noticed date. As a result, the judge concluded that S&D Drywall had not demonstrated good cause for a second deposition and denied the motion.
