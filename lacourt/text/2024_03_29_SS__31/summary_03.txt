And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by plaintiff Luis Romero Aguilar's attorneys, Robert B. Gibson and Michael Wieser. The motion was unopposed, and the judge found that the relief is necessary due to fundamental differences in the management of the case between the plaintiff and the attorneys. The judge ordered that the ruling is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order. The trial is currently set for June 4, 2024, and the plaintiff has sufficient time to seek new counsel or prepare for trial. The judge encouraged the parties to meet and confer before the hearing and noted that the parties should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.
