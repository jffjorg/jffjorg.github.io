MOTION
 
On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff Jameelah Budhan (Plaintiff) filed a form complaint
for negligence against Defendant City of West Hollywood (Defendant) based on a
motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff alleges the incident took place on July 24,
2022.
 
On March 12, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s former counsel’s
motion to be relieved. 
 
Defendant now demurs to the second cause of action in Plaintiff’s
complaint, for general negligence. No opposition was filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
The primary function of a pleading is to give the other party notice
so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in a pleading that
otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect substantial
rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.) “A demurrer tests the
legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v.
Bank of America, N.A. (2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form
or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury
Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function of the
demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of
the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to
be true.  (Donabedian, 116
Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the
face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that
are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.)  No other extrinsic evidence can
be considered.  (Ion Equip. Corp. v.
Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts
asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States
Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other
grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d
287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].) A
demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete
or discloses some defense that would bar recovery.  (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-72.) 
 
Additionally, courts can sustain a demurrer where one cause of action
is duplicative of another and adds nothing to the complaint by way of fact or
theory of recovery. (See Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v.
Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290.)
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
Defendant’s counsel, David M.
Ferrante-Alan, submits a declaration that he sent a meet and confer
correspondence to Plaintiff’s last known address as indicated on the
Plaintiff’s counsel motion to be relieved. No response was received.
(Ferrante-Alan Decl. ¶ 3.) Therefore, the meet and confer requirement is
satisfied. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Government Code section 815 provides that “[a] public entity is not
liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of
the public entity or a public employee or any other person” except as provided
by statute. (Gov. Code, § 815, subd. (a); see Hoff v. Vacaville Unified
School Dist. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 925, 932.) “[D]irect tort liability of
public entities must be based on a specific statute declaring them to be
liable, or at least creating some specific duty of care, and not on the general
tort provisions of Civil Code section 1714. Otherwise, the general rule of
immunity for public entities would be largely eroded by the routine application
of general tort principles.” (Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority
(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183.) Consequently, “public
entities may be liable only if a statute declares them to be liable.”  (Tuthill
v. City of San Buenaventura (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1088 (emphasis in
the original). It has been recognized that it is impermissible to sue a public
entity for common law negligence. (Torres v. Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 844, 850.)   
 
Moreover, to state a cause of action [for government tort
liability] every fact essential to the existence of statutory liability must be
pleaded with particularity, including the existence of a statutory duty.” 
(Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792,
802.)  
 
 As an initial matter, the Court on
its own motion takes judicial notice that Defendant is a public entity as
defined by the California Government Code.  (Gov. Code § 811.2 [“’Public
entity includes . . . a county city, district, public authority,
public agency, and any other political subdivision or public corporation in the
State.”].)
 
            Here,
Defendant argues the second cause of action is duplicative of the first cause
of action for motor vehicle liability and asserts a non-statutory cause of
action for general negligence. 
 
Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that
on July 24, 2022, Defendant Tasia Dawn Sanchez Dorado collided with his
vehicle. Plaintiff alleges that Sanchez was under the scope of employment with
the public entity Defendants, and thus they are liable under Government Code
section 815.2 and Vehicle Code section 17001. Viewing the complaint, the Court
finds that the allegations in the two causes of action are identical. Therefore,
since the second cause of action adds no additional facts or a separate theory
of recovery, it is duplicative and subject to demurrer. (See Palm
Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th
268, 290.) 
 
Plaintiff does not oppose the demurrer and therefore fails to meet his
burden to show how the complaint can be amended. However, since the second
cause of action is duplicative, the Court does not find that Plaintiff would be
prejudiced since the first identical cause of action remains. 
 
Therefore, Defendant’s demurer to the second cause of action in
Plaintiff’s complaint is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court sustains Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s second
cause of action in the complaint without leave to amend.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
