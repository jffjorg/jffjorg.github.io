And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge sustains the Defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action in the Plaintiff's complaint, which alleges general negligence. The Judge finds that the second cause of action is duplicative of the first cause of action for motor vehicle liability and does not add any additional facts or a separate theory of recovery. The Defendant demurs to the second cause of action, and the Plaintiff does not oppose the demurrer. The Judge therefore sustains the demurrer and does not grant leave to amend. The Defendant shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such.
