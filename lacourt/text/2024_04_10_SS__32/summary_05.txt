And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the Defendant's motion to continue the trial date from September 18, 2024 to October 18, 2024. The Defendant had requested the continuance to allow for its summary judgment motion to be heard before trial. The Court finds good cause for the continuance, as the Defendant has a right to have its motion heard before the start of trial. The Final Status Conference is rescheduled for October 3, 2024, and all discovery and related deadlines are associated with the new trial date.
