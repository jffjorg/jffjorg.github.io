And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

"The Court has reviewed the parties' submissions and has concluded that terminating sanctions are not appropriate at this time. The Court finds that the Defendant has failed to show that the Plaintiff's actions were willful and preceded by a history of abuse. Therefore, the Defendant's motion for terminating and monetary sanctions is DENIED. The Defendant shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service of such. The Court declines to award further monetary sanctions and notes that the remedy to enforce payment of monetary sanctions is to obtain and levy a writ of execution on the assets of the debtor."
