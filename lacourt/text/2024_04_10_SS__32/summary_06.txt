And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Ross Dress for Less, Inc.'s motion for judgment on the pleadings, which was based on the deemed admitted requests for admissions. The judge ruled that the complaint sufficiently alleges causes of action for negligence and premises liability, and therefore, the defendant's motion was denied. The judge also took judicial notice of the Court's November 20, 2023 ruling and denied the request for judicial notice of Plaintiff's responses to the request for admissions.
