  Case Number:  22SMCV00067    Hearing Date:   October 18, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to compel is GRANTED.  The request for sanction is GRANTED in the
reduced total amount of $1925 as against defendant but not counsel.  Defendant will provide verified responses,
without objection (other than privilege) within 30 days of today.  Responsive documents will be provided at the
same time.  If a document is withheld on
the basis of privilege, a log will be provided when the documents are due.  The log must be sufficient to establish a prima
facie case as to why the document is privileged. 
 
Plaintiff served special interrogatories and requests for
production on April 24, 2023.  Defendant
has not provided any responses.  When the
motion to compel was brought, no opposition was filed.  Under those circumstances, the court sees no
reason not to grant the motion. 
Sanctions are reduced, however, because the two motions are essentially
one and the same.
