And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel, which means the defendant must provide verified responses to the plaintiff's special interrogatories and requests for production. The defendant must also provide responsive documents at the same time. The defendant is allowed to withhold documents based on privilege, but must provide a log that establishes a prima facie case for why the document is privileged. The judge also grants the request for sanction in the reduced total amount of $1925, but only against the defendant and not against their counsel. The defendant has 30 days to provide the required documents.
