And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel, requiring the defendant to present their witness in person at the deposition. The judge also grants the request for sanctions, ordering the defendant and defense counsel to pay $2625 within 30 days. The judge finds that the defendant's reading of the statute regarding remote appearances is incorrect and that the statute only allows remote appearances for parties and attorneys, not for the deponent. The judge also criticizes the meet and confer process, finding that it was not properly conducted. The judge orders the parties to set a new deposition date and procedure, allowing for remote appearances for parties and attorneys, but not for the deponent. The judge also orders the parties to take breaks during the deposition and to conclude it by 5:00 pm each day.
