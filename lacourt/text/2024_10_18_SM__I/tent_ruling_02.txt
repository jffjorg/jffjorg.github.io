 Case Number:  22SMCV01644    Hearing Date:   October 18, 2024    Dept:  I The court will continue the hearing.  Prior counsel is ordered to be present in
court physically, as are the four deponents, at the date and time of the
continued hearing.  At that hearing, the
court will inquire of prior counsel as to precisely why prior counsel believed
that he had authority to accept service of process, assuming that he did so
state to plaintiff’s counsel.  From the
court’s perspective, any attorney/client privilege on the subject of prior
defense counsel’s authority has been waived by virtue of this ex parte
application and the declaration of the four declarants.  The court reserves the right to hear live
testimony.  For the same reason,
plaintiff’s counsel should also be physically present in court.  Until then, the warrant will be stayed.  However, the court warns all parties that if
the court finds that one or more parties has lied, the court will impose very
significant sanctions.  If the person not
telling the truth is counsel, the matter may be to be referred to the Bar.  Plaintiff will provide notice of this order
to the judgment debtors and to prior counsel.
