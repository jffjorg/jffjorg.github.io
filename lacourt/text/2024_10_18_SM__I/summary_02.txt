And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing in this case. Prior counsel, who accepted service of process, and the four deponents must be physically present at the continued hearing. The judge will question prior counsel about why they believed they had authority to accept service, and may hear live testimony. The court is concerned that any attorney/client privilege on this matter has been waived due to the ex parte application and the declaration of the four deponents. The judge warns that if any party is found to have lied, they will face significant sanctions, which could even lead to referral to the Bar if the lying counsel is found to be at fault. The plaintiff must notify the judgment debtors and prior counsel of this order.
