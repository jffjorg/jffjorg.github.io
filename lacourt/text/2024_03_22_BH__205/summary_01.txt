**Summary of Tentative Ruling**

This tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Christina Lamport's request for default judgment against Defendants Primo's Donuts, LLC and Ralph Primo, Jr. in the amount of $231,316.79. The case arises from a breach of contract and failure to make payments under a written promissory note. The note provides for a principal amount of $206,458 and interest accruing at a rate of 7.5% per annum. Despite multiple attempts to serve the Defendants, they failed to respond to the complaint and request for default judgment. The Plaintiff has properly complied with the requirements for a default judgment and has provided sufficient evidence to support the requested relief. As a result, default judgment is granted in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendants, and the Court awards the Plaintiff immediate possession of the collateral as well as judgment for the sale of the collateral.
