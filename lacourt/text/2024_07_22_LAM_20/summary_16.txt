And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses the motion filed by Defendant Rafael Castillo to compel further responses to his interrogatories from Plaintiff Loomis Armored US, LLC. Castillo seeks to uncover information about Loomis' cash delivery service, employee investigations, and procedures for preventing theft. The Court grants the motion in part, compelling Loomis to provide further responses to certain interrogatories, but denies it in part, finding that some of the requested information is overbroad or overburdensome. The Court also denies Castillo's request for sanctions and sets a deadline for Loomis to provide the requested information.
