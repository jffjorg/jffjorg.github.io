TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


November
  3, 2023




CASE NUMBER:


19STCV40369




MOTIONS:  


Requests
  for Admission, Set One Deemed Admitted  




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant/ Cross-Complainant Ben Behzadi




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant/Cross-Complainant Ben
Behzadi (Behzadi), moves to deem admitted Requests for Admissions, Set One
against Cross-Defendant Jonathan Pae’s (Pae). On November 1, 2023, Counsel
David Browne filed a declaration regarding the motion.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to
respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party
relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently
served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to
respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court “shall”
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Where
a party fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Behzadi represents that he served Requests for Admission, Set
One on Pae on June 15, 2023. (Takaloo Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. 1.) Pae’s responses were
due on July 18, 2023, but he failed to respond by the deadline. (Id. ¶ 3.)
Although not required, Behzadi sent Pae an email on July 24, 2023, to inquire
about the responses. (Id. ¶ 4.) An associate of Pae’s responded but did not indicate
if Pae would respond. Behzadi sent another email on August 1, 2023, but did not
receive a response. (Id. ¶ 6.) Pae did not file an opposition to this motion. 
 
On November 1, 2023, counsel David Browne filed a declaration that he
became counsel of record for Pae as of October 31, 2023. (Browne Dec. ¶ 3.) His
declaration attached verified responses to requests for admission, dated
October 30, 2023. Accordingly, the motion to deem admitted is denied as moot.
 
Behzadi
requests $4,141.65.00 in monetary sanctions against Pae, representing an hourly
rate of $680.00 for 2 hours preparing this motion, 4 hours to read an
opposition, prepare a reply, and attend the hearing. This amount also includes
the $61.65 filing fee for this motion. The Court finds sanctions are warranted
because Pae has failed to respond. However, the amount requested is excessive
due to the type of motion at issue, the fact no opposition was filed, and
because Behzadi can appear remotely. Therefore, the Court awards sanctions in
the amount of $741.65 (1 hour of attorney time to file and appear at hearing,
plus the $61.65 filing fee). 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to have Request for Admissions, Set
One Deemed Admitted, is DENIED.
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Jonathan Pae in the reduced amount of $741.65. Said monetary sanctions are to
be paid to counsel for Defendant/ Cross-Complainant Ben Behzadi within 30 days
of the date of this order.
 
Moving
party to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
