English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants the unopposed motion of Plaintiffs Connor Diep, Mason Diep, and Huitong Wu to set aside the dismissal of the case without prejudice. The dismissal was entered on July 14, 2023, after Plaintiffs failed to appear at an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal (Settlement). The Plaintiffs contend that they were unable to appear due to a scheduling mistake and attempted to appear via court-call but were unsuccessful. The Court finds that the motion is timely and grants relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), citing a scheduling mistake and failure to appear via court-call as excusable neglect. The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re Dismissal (Settlement) for December 11, 2023, and orders Plaintiffs to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
