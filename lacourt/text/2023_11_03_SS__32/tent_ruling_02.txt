RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


November
  3, 2023




CASE NUMBER:


21STCV25742




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Set Aside Dismissal




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiffs Connor Diep, a minor, through
  his guardian ad litem Hung Kim Diep, et al.




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
BACKGROUND
 
On July 14, 2023, this case was called for an Order to Show Cause Re:
Dismissal (Settlement). Counsel for Plaintiffs Connor Diep, Mason Diep, and
Huitong Wu, all minors appearing by and through their guardian ad litems (Plaintiffs)
did not appear. As a result, the Court ordered the complaint dismissed without
prejudice. (Minute Order Dated 7/14/23.) 
 
On August 2, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion to set aside
the dismissal. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake
is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party
failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the burden of
demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a
court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)   
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision
does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals
for failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted],
dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted],
and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].”
(Id.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Procedurally,
the present motion is timely because it was filed within six months after the
case was dismissed. The Declaration of Edward Y. Lee states that due to a
scheduling mistake, he was unable to appear for the July 14, 2023 hearing. (Lee
Decl. ¶ 11.) He also states that he attempted to appear via court-call but was
unsuccessful. (Id. ¶ 12.) Based on counsel’s declaration, the Court grants the
motion to set aside the dismissal. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside the dismissal.
 
 
The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re Dismissal (Settlement) for December
11, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Plaintiffs to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
