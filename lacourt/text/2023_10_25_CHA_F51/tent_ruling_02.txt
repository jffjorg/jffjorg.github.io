Plaintiff further requests that the Court order monetary sanctions against Defendant  in the amount of $360.00.   TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is granted. The  Court deems each of Plaintiff’s RFAs, Set One as admitted. The Court imposes  sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $360.00.    Defendant is reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended  General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing  documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set  forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First  Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly  bookmarking declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply  with these requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected,  matters being placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be  resubmitted in compliance with these requirements, documents not being  considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.   BACKGROUND   This is a collections action in  which Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to pay a debt for monies owed  relating to charges and/or cash advances in the amount of $55,528.32. (Pl.’s  Mot. 4:1–2.)  On 3/9/23, Plaintiff filed  its complaint, alleging against Defendant three causes of action for Common  Counts. On 4/20/23, Defendant filed her answer.   On 5/31/23, Plaintiff served  Defendant with its RFAs, Set One by mail. (Decl. of Kambrie L. Keith ¶ 2.) On 7/25/23,  Plaintiff filed the instant motion to deem its RFAs as admitted. No opposition  has been filed to date.   ANALYSIS   Legal Standard   A responding party must respond to  each propounded request for admission with either a substantive answer or an  objection to the particular request. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.210.)  A propounding party may move for an order deeming the genuineness  of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be  deemed admitted if the responding party fails to serve a timely response within  30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd. (b); 2033.250, subd. (a).)  Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve a timely response “waives  any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the  protection for work product” unless the Court grants it relief upon motion.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order,  unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been  directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to  the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section  2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).)   Here, as Plaintiff served its RFAs  on Defendant by mail on 5/31/23, the last day for Defendant to serve her  responses was 7/5/23. (Code Civ. Proc. §§  2030.260, subd. (a), 1013, subd. (a).) Defendant has not served any responses  to date, nor has she filed any opposition to the instant motion. (Keith Decl. ¶ 3.) As Defendant failed  to timely serve any response to Plaintiff’s RFAs, Defendant has consequently  waived any objections thereto. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) Based  on the foregoing, the Court grants Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to deem its  RFAs, Set One to Defendant as admitted.   Sanctions    “It is mandatory that the court  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to  requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280,  subd. (c).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering  that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney  advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including  attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ.  Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).)   Here, Plaintiff requests monetary  sanctions in the total amount of $360.00 to be imposed on Defendant. This  amount includes: (1) 1 hour of Plaintiff’s attorney’s time spent working on  this motion, at her hourly billing rate of $300.00 per hour; and (2) a $60.00  filing fee. (Keith Decl. ¶  4.) In granting the instant motion, the Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiff  sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $360.00. // // // CONCLUSION    The unopposed motion is granted. The  Court deems each of Plaintiff’s RFAs, Set One as admitted. The Court imposes  sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $360.00.
