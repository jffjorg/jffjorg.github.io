Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the Plaintiff, Bank of the West, against the entire cross-complaint filed by the Defendants, Gary G. Topolewski and Topolewski America, Inc. The Judge finds that the cross-complaint fails to state a cause of action for Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing. The Judge grants the Defendants 30 days leave to amend their cross-complaint to cure the defects. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has cited to legal authority finding that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot be read to prohibit a party from doing that which is expressly permitted by an agreement.
