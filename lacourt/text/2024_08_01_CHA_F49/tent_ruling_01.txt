  Case Number:  23CHCV02469    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    8/1/24     Case    Name: 3-D Engineering & Manufacturing Inc. v. Schmidt Industries, Inc.    d/b/a Prime Plating; and Does 1 through 10     Case No.    23CHCV02469      LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    AUGUST 1, 2024    MOTION TO RECLASSIFY  Los Angeles Superior  Court Case No. 23CHCV02469    Motion  filed: 5/2/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendant Schmidt Industries, Inc.  d/b/a Prime Plating (“Defendant”)  RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff 3-D Engineering &  Manufacturing, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) NOTICE: OK.   RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order reclassifying this unlimited case as a limited civil case and transferring  the matter to limited jurisdiction.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is DENIED.   BACKGROUND   This case is a breach of contract action.   On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this action.  Subsequently, Plaintiff filed its First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) and the  operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on November 13, 2023, and April 9,  2024, respectively. The operative SAC alleges two causes of action: (1) Breach  of Contract, and (2) Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing.  Defendant filed its Answer to the SAC on May 2, 2024.     On the same day, May 2, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Reclassify  (the “Motion”). Subsequently, Plaintiff filed its Opposition to the Motion on  July 24, 2024.   No reply papers have been received by the Court.   ANALYSIS “Whether an action qualifies as a limited or unlimited civil  action is determined initially from the prayer or demand for relief in the  plaintiff's complaint. Once classified as limited or unlimited that  classification normally continues throughout the litigation. If, however, a  matter has been designated as an unlimited action, and yet the amount of  controversy is $25,000 or less [the limit at the time of the Ytuarte  case, which has been increased to $35,000 effective January 1, 2024], the  statutory scheme authorizes ‘reclassification’ of the case as a ‘limited’  action and transfer of the matter to a superior court presiding over such  actions.” (Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal. App.4th 266,  274 (Ytuarte), citing Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).)   A.     Timeliness  of the Motion Code of Civil Procedure section  403.040, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part, “The defendant or cross-defendant may file a motion for  reclassification within the time allowed for that party to respond to the  initial pleading.”   Here, the  case records indicate that Plaintiff served its operative SAC and Summons upon  Defendant on April 15, 2024, establishing the deadline for Defendant to respond  as May 15, 2024, excluding any extensions applicable due to the method of  service.   The  Motion was filed on May 2, 2024, within the time allowed for Defendant to  respond to the SAC, thereby satisfying the timeliness criteria set forth by  Code of Civil Procedure section 403.040, subdivision (a).  B.      Motion to  Reclassify If a party files a motion  for reclassification  of an action within the time allowed for that party to amend the initial  pleading, the court shall grant the motion and order the case reclassified,  regardless of fault or lack of fault, if the case has been classified in an  incorrect jurisdictional classification. Ytuarte, supra, 129 Cal. App.4th at p. 275, citing Code Civ. Proc., §  403.040, subd. (a).)   In Walker v. Superior  Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257 (Walker), our Supreme Court held that a matter may  be reclassified as a limited civil action “when (i) the absence of jurisdiction  is apparent before trial from the complaint, petition, or related documents, or (ii) during the course of pretrial litigation, it  becomes clear that the matter will ‘necessarily’ result in a verdict below the  superior court's jurisdictional amount....” (Id. at p. 262.) This  standard involves an evaluation of the amount fairly in controversy, not an  adjudication of the merits of the claim, and according to Walker, requires a “high level of certainty that [the]  damage award will not exceed $25,000.” (Walker, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 269.) The Supreme  Court explained: “The [trial] court may believe it highly unlikely that  plaintiff will recover the amount demanded, but this is not enough to defeat  jurisdiction, unless it appears to a legal certainty that plaintiff cannot  recover the amount [of the] demand[. ]” (Id. at p. 270.)   The Court “must  deny the motion to reclassify  the case as limited (and thus keep the matter in the unlimited civil court) unless it appears to a legal certainty that the  plaintiff's damages will necessarily be less than $25,000.” (Ytuarte, supra,  129 Cal.App.4th at p. 277.) (Italics in original.) This standard of “legal  certainty” is not met when it appears a verdict within the unlimited court's  jurisdiction is “possible.” (See Maldonado v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 397, 402.)   In its Motion,  Defendant relies on the purported Statement of Policy signed by both parties on  June 21, 2018. The terms of the Statement of Policy limit Defendant’s liability  “to the cost of direct labor and material of the product directly damaged by  our processing or three times our processing charges on such material,  whichever is lesser. Charges for our services are based on this policy which  limits our liability.” (Schmidt Decl. Ex. “A.”) Defendant argues that, pursuant  to the terms of the Statement of Policy, Plaintiff can recover from Defendant,  for any cause, only $1,321.63, the amount billed under the contract in dispute,  thereby making a verdict “necessarily” fall short of the limit required for an unlimited  civil case. (Mot. at pp. 4-5.)   Conversely,  Plaintiff contends that its SAC alleges an amount in controversy in excess of  $80,000, surpassing the minimal jurisdiction of this court. (Opp’n. at p. 7.)  Furthermore, Plaintiff argues that there is no clear or unequivocal reference  to, or incorporation of, the Statement of Policy in the subject contract, noting  that the Statement of Policy predates the subject contract by nearly five  years. (Id. at p. 8.) Additionally, Plaintiff maintains that the  Statement of Policy is unenforceable on the grounds of unconscionability. (Ibid.)   Following the  standards set in the Walker case for reviewing a motion to reclassify,  the Court does not adjudicate the merits of the issue regarding the  enforceability of the Statement of Policy at this stage. However, based on the arguments  and evidence presented in the moving and opposing papers, the Court finds that  Defendant has not met its burden to establish that the matter will  ‘necessarily’ result in a verdict below this Court’s jurisdictional amount. Instead,  the Court concludes that a verdict within the unlimited court’s jurisdiction is  possible, leading to the denial of the Motion.   Based on the  foregoing, the Court DENIES the Motion.   CONCLUSION   Defendant’s  Motion to Reclassify is DENIED.   Moving  part to give notice.
