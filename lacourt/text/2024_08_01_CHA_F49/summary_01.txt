Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Schmidt Industries, Inc. d/b/a Prime Plating, has filed a motion to reclassify this unlimited civil case as a limited civil case and transfer the matter to limited jurisdiction. The defendant argues that the amount in controversy is less than $25,000, citing a Statement of Policy signed by both parties in 2018. The plaintiff, 3-D Engineering & Manufacturing, Inc., opposes the motion, arguing that the amount in controversy is more than $80,000 and that the Statement of Policy is unenforceable.

The court finds that the defendant has not met its burden to establish that the matter will necessarily result in a verdict below the court's jurisdictional amount. Instead, the court concludes that a verdict within the unlimited court's jurisdiction is possible, leading to the denial of the motion. The motion is denied.
