English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a demurrer to a cross-complaint filed by Metro Investments Group, Inc. and Anthony Nowaid against the People of the State of California, acting by and through the Department of Transportation (CalTrans). The demurrer is based on sovereign immunity, which bars claims against public entities. The judge rules that the first cause of action, based on a quasi-contract theory, fails because the parties have an express contract on the subject. The second cause of action, for intentional interference with contract, is allowed to proceed. The judge grants CalTrans' request for judicial notice of a lease agreement between CalTrans and Metro Investments Group, Inc. The ruling is subject to change pending further briefing and argument.
