And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion to expunge the second lis pendens recorded by the plaintiff, Soca, LLC. The plaintiff had recorded the first lis pendens on October 11, 2023, but it was expunged on May 8, 2024. Without obtaining leave of court, the plaintiff recorded a second lis pendens on May 17, 2024, which is in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 405.36. The judge finds that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification and therefore grants the defendants' motion to expunge the second lis pendens.

The judge also awards the defendants $4,000 in attorney fees and costs for prevailing on their motion. The defendants had requested an additional $10,000 in monetary sanctions, but the judge finds that this is not permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 405.38, which only allows for the award of attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party.
