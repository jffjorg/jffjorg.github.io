 Case Number:  23STCV24605    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendants NVSI Inc. and FLS Realty LLC’s Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens and
Request for Monetary Sanctions

Defendants
NVSI Inc. and FLS Realty LLC move to expunge the second lis pendens plaintiff Soca,
LLC recorded against real property at 1930 Nadeau Street, Los Angeles, CA 90001.  Code of Civil Procedure section
405.36 provides, “Once a notice of pending action has been expunged,
the claimant may not record another notice of pending action as to the affected
property without leave of the court in which the action is pending.”  
On
February 27, 2024, the court issued a minute order granting NVSI and FLS’s
motion to expunge the notice of pendency of action plaintiff recorded on
October 11, 2023.  On May 8, 2024, the
court issued a signed order expunging the notice of pendency of action.  (RJN, Ex. B.) 
On May 17, 2024, plaintiff served a second notice of pendency of action
on defendants.  (Silverman Decl., ¶ 7, Ex.
7.)  Plaintiff also filed the notice with
the court the same day.  Plaintiff did so
without leave of court in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 405.36.  
Plaintiff’s
opposition argues its operative complaint contains a real property claim as required
by Code of Civil Procedure section 405.31 and presents evidence supporting the
probable validity of that claim under section 405.32.  But it does not address the basis for this
motion.  The court expunged plaintiff’s first
notice of pending action.  Under section
405.36, plaintiff could not record another one without first getting leave of
court.  Plaintiff did not get leave of
court for its second notice of pending of action.  The court will therefore expunge the second
notice.  
Sanctions
            NVSI and FLS move for $4,000 in
sanctions against plaintiff.  “The court
shall direct that the party prevailing on any motion under this chapter be
awarded the reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of making or opposing the
motion unless the court finds that the other party acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of attorney’s
fees and costs unjust.”  (CCP § 405.38.) 
NVSI
and FLS prevailed on their motion to expunge plaintiff’s lis pendens.  Plaintiff did not act with substantial
justification.  Sanctions are just under
the circumstances.  NVSI and FLS
reasonably incurred $4,000 in attorney fees making this motion.
            NVSI and FLS also seek “an
additional $10,000 of monetary sanctions” because of “egregious bad faith
actions.”  (Memo, p. 6.)  They provide no authority permitting extra
sanctions as a penalty.  Section 405.38 only
provides for awarding attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party.  It does not permit penalizing an unsuccessful
party.  
Disposition
            Defendants
NVSI Inc. and FLS Realty LLC’s motion to expunge lis pendens is granted.  The court hereby expunges plaintiff
Soca, LLC’s notice of pendency of action dated May 16, 2024 and filed with the
court on May 17, 2024.  
Defendants NVSI Inc. and
FLS Realty LLC shall recover $4,000 in attorney fees and costs from plaintiff
Soca, LLC.
