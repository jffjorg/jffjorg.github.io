And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling lifts the stay of the action against Dalya Eilat, Veetahl Eilat Rachel, and Aaron Eilat, who had moved to stay the action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The court previously stayed the action against them on November 16, 2023, finding that Israel is the more suitable place for trial. However, at the last hearing on March 25, 2024, the moving defendants argued that the new defendants named via Doe amendments are unimportant and were only named to defeat this motion. Despite this argument, the moving defendants did not provide any evidence in support of their claim, and the court finds that they have not shown all other defendants are either subject to jurisdiction in Israel or of no real importance to the outcome of the case. Therefore, the doctrine of forum non conveniens does not apply, and the stay is lifted.
