  Case Number:  21STCV26552    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendants
Dalya Eilat, Veetahl Eilat Rachel, and Aaron Eilat’s Motion to Stay for Forum
Non Conveniens
Defendants Dalya Eilat, Veetahl Eilat Rachel, and
Aaron Eilat moved to quash service of summons or, in the alternative, to stay
this action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.  They later
consented to personal jurisdiction and withdrew the motion as to quashing
service of summons.  On November 16, 2023, the court stayed the action
against them based on forum non conveniens.  The court found Israel is the
more suitable place for trial as to plaintiff and the three moving defendants.
On January 12, 2024, plaintiff named 11 new
defendants to the action via Doe amendments.  “[A] moving defendant
seeking to establish an alternative forum is suitable must show that all
defendants are subject to jurisdiction in the proposed alternative forum.” (David
v. Medtronic, Inc. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 734, 743.)  ) But “a
plaintiff cannot defeat a motion” based on forum non conveniens “merely by
naming a nominal defendant who is not subject to jurisdiction in the”
alternative forum or “by including as a defendant a party who … is of no real
importance to the outcome of the case.” (Id. at p. 744.)  
At the last hearing on March 25, 2024, the moving
defendants argued the new defendants are unimportant and were only named to defeat
this motion.  They did not submit any
brief or evidence in support of this argument. 
The moving defendants have not shown all other defendants are either (a)
subject to jurisdiction in Israel or (b) of no real importance to the outcome
of the case.  The doctrine of forum non
conveniens therefore does not apply.
The court hereby lifts
the stay of this action.
