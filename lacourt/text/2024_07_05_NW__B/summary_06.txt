And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to consolidate the instant action with the State Farm Action for all purposes, including trial. The two actions arise from the same February 16, 2020 automobile collision and involve some of the same parties. The judge finds that consolidation is appropriate to promote judicial economy, convenience of witnesses, and to avoid unnecessary costs or delay. The motion is unopposed, and all interested parties have conceded to the defendants' arguments.
