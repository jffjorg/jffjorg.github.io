English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash or modify six subpoenas seeking medical records, billing records, and diagnostic imaging from Kaiser Foundation Hospital and Kaiser Permanente Normandie North Medical Office. The plaintiff, Glendis Beker, filed the motion, arguing that the subpoenas are overly broad and seek categories/records which are irrelevant, confidential, and protected from disclosure by her constitutional right to privacy. The defendant, The Hertz Corporation, countered that the requested records are relevant to the instant lawsuit as the plaintiff has placed her medical condition at issue. The judge denied the motion to quash the subpoenas but granted the motion to modify them, ordering the plaintiff to produce the requested records from five years before the subject accident to present. The judge also denied a request for sanctions against the defendant.
