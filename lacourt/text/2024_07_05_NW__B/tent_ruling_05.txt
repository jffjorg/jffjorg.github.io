 Case Number:  21STCV30738    Hearing Date:   July 5, 2024    Dept:  B TENTATIVE RULING
 
Cross-Defendant B&D Transportation Services, LLC
(“B&D”) attorney of record, Kelsey Maxwell of Murchison & Cumming, LLP
(“Counsel”), filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel, contending
relief is necessary because Counsel learned that B&D is a suspended
corporation. Because B&D is a suspended corporation, Counsel declares their
office is unable to represent it pursuant to California Revenue and Taxation
Code Section 19719. Additionally, Counsel declares B&D’s conduct has made
it unreasonable difficult for Counsel to carry out representation effectively. 
 
The Court heard Counsel’s first motion to be relieved on May
28, 2024, and denied it because proofs of service were insufficient. The Court
also ordered Counsel to serve the Clerk of Court because B&D’s current
address could not be ascertained. (See 05-28-2024 Minute Order, p. 2.)
 
Counsel refiled papers on May 29, 2024. The newly filed
papers attach a Proof of Service by Mail of the Motion, Declaration, and Order
on B&D and on the Clerk of Court on May 30, 2024, sufficient to give notice
of a July 5 hearing.
 
The deficiencies having been corrected, the motion is
granted.  Counsel will be relieved upon proof of service of the Order
after hearing.
