BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an automobile
collision that occurred on February 16, 2020 at Fullerton Road in Rowland
Heights, CA 91748. On October 5, 2021, Plaintiff Guadalupe Alcala (“Plaintiff”)
filed a Complaint against Defendants Xiaoyuan Ren (“Ren”), Lu Yue
(collectively, the “Defendants”), and Does 1 to 30, alleging causes of action
for: (1) Motor Vehicle; and (2) General Negligence. 
 
On June 2, 2022, Defendant Yue Lu
(erroneously sued as Lu Yue) (“Lu”) filed an Answer to the Complaint.  
 
On June 16, 2022, Defendant Ren filed
an Answer to the Complaint.  
 
On May 7, 2024, Defendants filed a
Notice of Related Case indicating that the instant action was related to State
Farm Automobile Insurance Company v. Xiaoyuan Ren, LASC Case No.
23STLC00403 (the “State Farm Action”), which was filed on January 19, 2023. Non-Jury
Trial in the State Farm Action is set to begin on July 18, 2024. 
 
On May 8, 2024, the Honorable Michelle
C. Kim, sitting in Department 31 at Spring Street Courthouse, deemed this
action and the State Farm Action as related. (05/08/24 Minute Order.) Both
cases were assigned to the Honorable Michelle C. Kim sitting in Department 31
at Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes. (05/08/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On June 6, 2024, Defendants filed and
served the instant Motion to Consolidate Related Matters (the “Motion”). Defendants
move to consolidate the instant action with the State Farm Action for all
purposes, including trial. Defendants seek an order deeming the instant action
as the lead case.  
 
On June 7, 2024, this action was
reassigned from the Honorable Michelle C. Kim to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz
sitting in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East effective June 24, 2024.
 
As of July 1, 2024, the Motion is
unopposed. Any opposition was required to have been filed and served at least
nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP § 1005(b).) 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
The Court GRANTS
Defendants’ Motion to Consolidate Related Matters (the “Motion”). 
 
DISCUSSION
“When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending
before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the
matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and
it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid
unnecessary costs or delay.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).)
“Coordination of civil actions sharing a common question of fact or law is
appropriate if one judge hearing all of the actions . . . will promote the ends
of justice taking into account whether the common question of fact or law is
predominating and significant to the litigation; the convenience of the
parties, witnesses, and counsel; the relative development of the actions and
the work product of counsel; the efficient utilization; the calendar of the
courts; the disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent rulings, orders, or
judgments; and, the likelihood of settlement of the actions without further
litigation should coordination be denied.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 404.1.) 
“The purpose of consolidation is merely to promote trial convenience and
economy by avoiding duplication of procedure, particularly in the proof of
issues common to both actions.” (Estate
of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 485 [citation omitted].) “A
consolidation of actions does not affect the rights of the parties.” (Ibid.) Consolidation does not require
identical causes of action in each case, absolute identity of the parties, or
identical allegations. (Ibid.) Where
common issues are present in two cases then consolidation is appropriate. (Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants
Trust (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978-79.) 

Los Angeles County Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g)(1)
provides that “[c]ases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same
department. A motion to consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and heard
after the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been related in
a single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that department.”

Appropriateness of
Consolidation
Tina C. Park (“Park”), who is counsel for Defendants,
presents a declaration in support of the Motion. Ms. Park attaches the
complaint from the State Farm Action to her declaration. (Park Decl., ¶ 6; Ex.
B.) The State Farm Action arises from the same February 16, 2020 automobile
collision that gives rise to the instant action. (Id.) Moreover,
Defendant Ren is a party to the State Farm Action. (Id.) The complaint
in the State Farm Action is a subrogation complaint for damage incurred to the
vehicle of non-party Pamela Sue Crawford. (Id.) 
The Court finds that consolidation of the two actions is
appropriate. The instant action and the State Farm Action both arise from the
same February 16, 2020 automobile collision and involve some of the same
parties. The actions have already been deemed related by the Court. Given that
Defendant Ren is a party to both actions, consolidation is appropriate for
convenience of the witnesses and to promote judicial economy. The crux of both
actions is the February 16, 2020 automobile collision. 
 Also, given that
the Motion is unopposed, the other parties in the instant action and the State
Farm Action have conceded to Defendants’ arguments raised herein. (Moulton
Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215.) All
interested parties were served with the Motion yet failed to file an opposition
thereto. 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the Motion
is GRANTED. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
