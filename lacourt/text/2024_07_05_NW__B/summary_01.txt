```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a second amended complaint without prejudice. The plaintiffs had previously filed a complaint and two amended complaints, but were denied leave to file a third amended complaint. The judge found that the plaintiffs' declaration failed to meet the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324, which requires that a declaration explain the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and why the request was not made sooner. The judge also found that the plaintiffs' memorandum did not provide any legal argument, facts, or discussion and/or analysis pertaining to the instant matter. As a result, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the plaintiffs to re-file the motion and provide the necessary information.
