And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Peter Paul Borja's motion to allow the submission of a tardy expert witness designation. The deadline for exchanging expert witness information was June 4, 2024, but Defendant Borja's counsel, Jennifer T. Tseng, failed to serve a fourth expert witness designation on that date due to an unexpected medical emergency. Despite this, Tseng attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel on June 5, 2024, and filed the motion the same day. The judge has granted the motion on the condition that the tardy designated expert witness be made immediately available for deposition, and that Plaintiff is given leave to designate additional expert witnesses or to elicit additional opinions from those previously designated. The judge has also granted a continuance of the trial to a later date.
