And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to disqualify the defendant's current attorney, Christopher J. Hamner, and his law firm, Hamner Law Offices, APLC, from representing the defendants in the instant action and any related actions. The judge finds that the defendants' current attorney has a conflict of interest because he is representing both the corporation (Cardea Hospice & Palliative Care) and one of its shareholders (Zoya Vladimirskaya) who have adverse interests. The judge notes that the defendants have failed to oppose the motion, and therefore grants the unopposed motion.
