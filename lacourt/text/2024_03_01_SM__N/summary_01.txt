Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Yuan Shi aka Henry Shi, AI List Capital GP 1, LLC, and AI List Capital 1, LP, have moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the grounds that the plaintiff, David Carter, had access to the defendants' email account and associated Google Workspace containing the AI List presentation decks containing Carter's image from 2017, when the decks were created and published, until the lawsuit was filed in February 2022. The defendants argue that the single-publication rule bars the plaintiff's claims and that the limitations period expired in late 2019.

The plaintiff contends that the single-publication rule does not apply to private email distributions of confidential presentation decks and that the claims are not barred by the statute of limitations. The court finds that the single-publication rule may not apply to private email distribution of a presentation deck and that the defendants have failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their motion.

Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is denied.
