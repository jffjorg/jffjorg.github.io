And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has ruled on the Plaintiffs' motion to tax costs, which was filed in response to the Defendants' memorandum to recover costs of $3,079.31. The Plaintiffs argued that certain filing fees were unnecessary or not incurred, but the Judge found that the Defendants were entitled to recover costs as the prevailing parties. The Judge also considered the specific items of costs claimed by the Defendants, including filing fees for declarations and a motion for summary judgment. The Judge denied the Plaintiffs' motion to strike certain filing fees and found that the costs claimed by the Defendants were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.
