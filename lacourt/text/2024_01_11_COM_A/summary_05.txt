And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a motion to strike the defendant's answer to the verified complaint. The plaintiff, Pencor, Inc., purchased a residential real property at a foreclosure sale and served a three-day notice quit on the defendant, Sharon Sperling, and others. The defendant filed an answer on November 29, 2023, which contains only a general denial. The plaintiff moves to strike the answer as it is defective. The court rules that the answer is indeed defective and grants the motion to strike without leave to amend, meaning the defendant cannot cure the defect and must file a new answer.
