And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court hereby grants Plaintiff Tabitha Patton's motion for terminating sanctions against Defendant Ramona King. The Defendant has failed to comply with the Court's discovery orders, including failing to provide further responses to written discovery propounded in June 2023. Despite efforts to meet and confer about discovery issues, the Defendant has not shown an interest in defending the litigation and has not responded to correspondence sent by Plaintiff's counsel. The Court finds that the Defendant's actions are willful and intentional, and therefore, terminating sanctions are warranted. The Court strikes the Defendant's second amended answer and enters the Defendant's default. Additionally, the Court imposes monetary sanctions of $2,700 in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant for expenses incurred to prepare the motions and costs of filing fees.
