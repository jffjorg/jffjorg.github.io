[TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION, FILED DECEMBER 14, 2023, FOR TERMINATING
SANCTIONS, OR ALTERNATIVELY, FOR ORDER COMPELLING FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND FOR SANCTIONS
 
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
      The verified, first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleges that
Defendant, Ramona King (“King”), forged Plaintiff’s signature on a quitclaim
deed purporting to transfer Plaintiff’s 50 percent interest in real property to
Defendant, leaving Defendant as the sole owner of the property. Plaintiff
alleges claims for (1) forgery, (2) cancellation of instrument, (3) quiet
title, (4) slander of title, (5) fraudulent concealment, (6) theft, (7)
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (8) declaratory and
injunctive relief.         
II.      DISCOVERY
AT ISSUE
Motion 1:
      On November 2, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to
compel Defendant to further respond to supplemental responses to special
interrogatories, set one. The Court imposed monetary sanctions in favor of
Plaintiff for both motions. 
Motion 2: 
      Also on November 2, 2023, the Court compelled Defendant to provide
further responses and production of documents within 10 days and imposed
monetary sanctions.
Motion 3:
      On November 17, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s three
discovery motions and ordered Plaintiff to provide further responses within 10
days to special interrogatories, set three; request for production of
documents, set three; and form interrogatories, set four; all within 10 days. 
      Plaintiff argues that despite efforts to meet and confer,
Defendant did not fully comply with any of the foregoing orders. Defendant, who
is now self-represented, did not file opposition to any of the foregoing
motions.
II.   DISCUSSION
      With respect to the first motion and second motions, which arise
from the November 2 order, defense counsel Mr. Backus provided second
supplemental responses to the special interrogatories in response to the order.
(Motion filed 11/22/23, Ex. D and Motion filed 12/14/23, Ex. D.) Mr. Backus
also responded to Plaintiff’s email requesting more information, stating that
Defendant would comply but requested more specifics about the precise
information at issue. Defense counsel also suggested that Plaintiff take the deposition
testimony of Defendant and Leo King. (Id.) 
      While Defendant
did not fail to comply with the Court’s November 2 order, neither Defendant,
nor her former counsel responded to Plaintiff’s numerous efforts to meet and
confer from November 28 through December 14, 2023, about issues that
Plaintiff’s counsel found deficient. (Id., Little Decl., ¶ 6.) Nor
has Defendant responded to correspondence sent to Defendant. (Id.) 
      The third motion arises from a November 17 order for Defendant to
provide further responses to various written discovery propounded in June of
2023.  Despite efforts to meet and confer
about Defendant’s deficient responses, Plaintiff was required to bring the
motions to compel further responses which the Court granted. (Little Decl., ¶
10.) Mr. Backus paid the sanctions in full but failed to comply with the
November 17 order and failed to meet and confer about the discovery on many
occasions between November 28 and December 14, 2023. Plaintiff has not been
able to contact Defendant at all as Defendant’s voice mailbox was not set up, nor
has Defendant responded to correspondence sent by Plaintiff’s counsel. (Id. ¶ 14.)
      Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed
for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery
to prevent unfairness resulting from the lack of information. (Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203
Cal.App.3d 57, 64.) The
type of sanction imposed should be “appropriate to the dereliction,” and
tailored to accomplish the discovery sought. (Do It Urself Moving & Storage, Inc.
v. Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 35.) There are two prerequisites for
the imposition of a discovery sanction: “(1) there must be a failure to comply
[with a valid discovery order] . . . and (2) the failure must be willful.” (Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal. App. 3d 96, 114.)
      Abuses of the discovery process include employing
a discovery method that causes unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or
oppression, or undue burden and expense; making unmeritorious objections or
evasive responses to discovery; and failing to meet and confer in good faith.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)
      Plaintiff’s counsel has incurred considerable time in pursuit
of discoverable information and sending packages by Federal Express to no
avail. Defendant has not contacted Plaintiff’s counsel and has not shown an
interest in defending this litigation. The absence of any cooperation by
Defendant in fulfilling her discovery obligations indicates a willful refusal
to provide information sought by Plaintiff. 
      Accordingly, terminating sanctions are warranted under the
circumstances. The court strikes Defendant’s second amended answer filed on
October 30, 2023, and enters Defendant’s default. While the Court granted
Defendant leave to file a cross-complaint by December 29, 2023, the Court’s
file does not reflect that Defendant complied with the Court’s order,
supporting the conclusion that Defendant no longer seeks affirmative relief in
this action. 
      Additionally, the Court imposes monetary sanctions of $2,700 in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant, Romona King aka Ramona King, for
expenses incurred to prepare all three motions and costs of $184.95 ($61.65 x
3) incurred in filing fees, payable within 10 days. The Court finds that $450
per hour and two hours to prepare each of three motions are reasonable.
