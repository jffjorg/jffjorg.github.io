[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING  PLAINTIFFS’
 MOTION TO TAX COSTS
 
       The
Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) alleges that Defendants vaccinated Plaintiff’s
daughter, Bella King-Harvey, against COVID-19 without King’s permission. Plaintiffs
alleged 14 causes of action for negligence, intentional infliction of emotional
distress, fraudulent concealment, failure to obtain informed consent, and other
tort and statutory violations. 
       On August
11, 2023, the Court entered judgment in favor of Defendants after sustaining
Defendants’ demurrers without leave to amend.  On September 5, 2023, Defendants filed their
memorandum to recover costs of $3,079.31, consisting of filing and jury fees. 
       Plaintiffs
move to strike certain filing fees for documents that Plaintiffs contend were
not necessary or were never incurred. Defendants did not file an opposition by November
13, 2023 (nine court days before the hearing). (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005 (b).) 
       On November 28, 2023, the Court continued
the hearing to permit Plaintiffs to serve the motion again at defense counsel’s
correct address. The Court has considered the supplemental declaration of
Vincent Unuorakpor confirming that the motion was served at an e-mail address
confirmed by defense counsel. No opposition has been filed.
       As the parties in whose favor dismissal
was entered, Defendants are the prevailing parties and are entitled to recover
costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) Section 1032 of the Code of Civil
Procedure “is the fundamental statutory authority for awarding costs in civil
actions.” (Leiper
v. Gallegos (2021) 69
Cal.App.5th 284, 297.) Section
1033.5 “is a list of what is, and is not, allowable as a cost, [and] similarly
is trial-court-oriented, with items exclusively related to trial court
proceedings (e.g., references to jury fees, taking depositions, process
servers, etc.).” (Stratton
v. Beck (2018) 30
Cal.App.5th 901, 910.)” 
       However, items not expressly mentioned as
a recoverable cost "and items assessed upon application may be allowed or
denied in the court's discretion, subject to the limitation that costs allowed
“shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd., (b)(4), 5.) Accordingly, broad discretion is conferred on
the trial court to determine whether costs should be allowed. 
DISCUSSION
Item 1.c.
Declaration in Support of Automatic Extension: $57.20 and $44.15
       Plaintiffs contend that Defendants unnecessarily
filed more than one declaration in support of an automatic 30-day extension to
respond to a pleading, while only one was necessary. However, Defendants were
required to file the declarations affirming their efforts to meet and confer
prior to filing a demurrer or motion to strike a pleading or amended pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5.) 
       Thus, defense counsel filed the required
declaration on November 9, 2022, prior to demurring to the complaint on behalf
of Venice Family Clinic (“Clinic”); on July 3, 2023, two declarations on behalf
of Defendant Mendez prior to filing the demurrer and motion to strike the third
amended complaint; and on July 11, 2023, two declarations on behalf of the
Clinic prior to its demurrer to Plaintiff’s third amended complaint and motion
to strike. As the declarations were statutorily required, the request to strike
this item is DENIED. 
 
Item 1.c.
Attachment 1g. Motion for Summary Judgment reservation $413.75
       Plaintiffs contend that Defendants did
not file a Motion for Summary Judgment, therefore, this was an unnecessary
cost. Defendants incur filing fees at the time a motion is reserved. Filing
fees are expressly recoverable, and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation if Defendants intended to preserve their right to timely file a
dispositive motion pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 437c. Code Civ. Proc., § 1032(a).

       Plaintiffs do not cite any authority for
the proposition that filing fees are recoverable only if the motion was
actually heard. The cost memorandum is prima facie evidence of
the propriety of costs. It is the opposing party’s burden to demonstrate the
costs are unreasonable or unnecessary. (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266.) Accordingly, this item is recoverable. 
       Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’
motion to tax costs is DENIED.
