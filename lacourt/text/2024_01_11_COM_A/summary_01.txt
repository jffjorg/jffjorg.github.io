And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has reviewed the case and has made a tentative ruling on the petition for approval of the compromise of a claim for a person with a disability. The plaintiff, Apolonio Garcia, was injured in an accident on December 14, 2018, and has reached a settlement with the defendants. The settlement involves a payment of $9,825,000 from Lincoln Transportation Services, Inc., and a contribution of $25,000 from West Coast Management.

The plaintiff is seeking approval of the settlement, and the court has granted the petition in part, approving the terms of the settlement. The court has also awarded attorney's fees of $3,930,000 to the plaintiff's counsel, Gary Dordick, which is 40% of the gross settlement.

The court has also ordered the plaintiff to lodge an unredacted version of the petition and proposed order with the Probate Division at Mosk after the hearing. Additionally, the court has set an Order to Show Cause hearing for February 23, 2024, to review the trust terms and approve the distribution to the proposed trust.
