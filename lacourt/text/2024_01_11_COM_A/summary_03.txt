And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a complaint filed by John Doe against Doe #1, a public entity, and others. The complaint alleges six causes of action, including childhood sexual abuse, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, failure to report suspected child abuse, and negligent supervision of a minor.

The demurrer argues that AB 218, which revived childhood sexual abuse claims, is unconstitutional because it provides a gift of public funds and creates liability for past acts of negligence. The judge disagrees, finding that AB 218 serves a public purpose and does not create new liability. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's claims are adequately alleged and that the defendant's demurrer is OVERRULED in part.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for failure to report suspected child abuse, finding that the statute requiring reporting did not exist at the time of the alleged events. The judge overrules the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for negligent supervision of a minor, finding that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to support the claim.

The judge orders the defendant to file its answer within 10 days.
