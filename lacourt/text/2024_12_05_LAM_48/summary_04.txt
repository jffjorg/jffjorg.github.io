The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Parvin Hashemi, Sean Hash, and Raymond Hash against Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre LLC.

The court also finds that the arbitration agreement is binding on Sean Hash in his individual capacity. However, the court denies the motion as to Parvin Hashemi and Raymond Hash, finding that they are not bound by the arbitration agreement. The court stays the remainder of the action pending the conclusion of the arbitration of Sean Hash's individual claim. A status conference is scheduled for December 4, 2025, to discuss the arbitration.
