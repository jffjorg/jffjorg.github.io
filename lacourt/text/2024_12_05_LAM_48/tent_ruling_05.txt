[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO ENFORCE
  SETTLEMENT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 5, 2024



 
On November 4, 2024, Plaintiff Luis Larraburu filed a motion
to enforce a settlement with Defendants The Energy Company LLC and Ahmed Owiess.

Courts
may enter judgments pursuant to written settlements signed by the parties.  (Elyaoudayan v. Hoffman (2003) 104 Cal.App.4th
1421, 1428; Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  Strict
compliance with the statutory requirements is necessary before a court can enforce
a settlement agreement.  (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
30, 37.)  The party seeking to enforce a settlement
“must first establish the agreement at issue was set forth ‘in a writing signed
by the parties’ (§ 664.6) or was made orally before the court.  [Citation.]” 
(Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304.)
The
Settlement Agreement required Defendants to pay Plaintiff a total of $35,000.00,
payable in 12 monthly installments of $2,916.67, beginning on October 1, 2024.  (Ruddell Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. A at p. 2, ¶ 2(A).)  If any of the payments remain due and owing five
business days after Plaintiff’s notice to Defendants, Defendants shall be deemed
to be in default and the total unpaid balance shall become immediately due.  (Ruddell Decl., Ex. A at p. 3, ¶ 2(C).)  The prevailing party seeking to enforce the settlement
is also entitled to attorney fees and costs. 
(Ruddell Decl., Ex. A at p. 13, ¶ 18.) 
To date, Defendants have not made any payments.  (Ruddell Decl. ¶ 6.)
The
unopposed motion to enforce settlement is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to submit a proposed judgment
($35,000.00 settlement balance plus $3,501.70 attorney fees and costs) within five
days.
A
Non-Appearance Case Review Re: Submission of Proposed Judgment is scheduled for
December 13, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
