And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to strike certain costs. The defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part. The defendants' motion is granted as to $2,727.26 in "Other" costs, but denied as to all other costs.

The judge found that the costs for filing, service of process, and models and photocopies were recoverable, but the costs for "report fees/courier fees/miscellaneous fees" were not. The judge noted that the defendants did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that these costs were actually and reasonably incurred, and therefore denied the motion to strike these costs.

The judge also noted that the parties had agreed to try the issue of reformation through briefing and in briefing this issue to the Court, and that the unused exhibit costs were recoverable in the discretion of the trial court.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing. If all parties submit, the court will adopt this tentative as the final order.
