Defendants’
motion to strike is GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN PART. Defendants’ motion is
GRANTED as to $2,727.26 in “Other” costs, but DENIED as to all other costs.
 
On 4/9/2021,
Plaintiff Ave I Group, LLC (Plaintiff) filed suit against Equity Partners, LTD
and Christopher Lee, alleging: (1) breach of lease and (2) breach of guaranty
of lease. 
 
Defendants
asserted a Cross-Complaint for: (1) Breach of Lease; and (2) Detrimental
Reliance. 
 
            On 9/6/2024, Defendants/Cross-Complainants (Defendants)
moved to tax costs. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendants move to tax the following costs: 
 
-        
Item 1: Filing & Motion Fees
-        
Item 5: Service of Process
-        
Item 12: Models, enlargements, and
photocopies
-        
Item 14: E-Filing or Service Fees
-        
Item 16: Other, Miscellaneous
 
As
for Item 1, Defendants move to tax $1,950.00 in costs. Defendants argue that
these costs are duplicative because Plaintiff did not “need to file separate
actions against Mr. Richie and Richie Litigation, P.C., and Mr. Lee and Equity
Partners, Ltd.” (Motion, 2: 14-15.) However, the two separate actions, which
were eventually related and consolidated into one action here, concerned
distinct leases with unique obligations for two different units. The costs
claimed were actually incurred, and Defendants did not set forth any legal
authority suggesting that the consolidation of these actions defeats
Plaintiff’s statutory entitlement to recovery of its costs. As such, the Court
finds these costs to be recoverable.
 
As
for Item 5, Defendants move to tax $719.83 in costs. Defendants contend that
Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs does not specify the manner in which service
was conducted, and thus it cannot be determined whether the items are proper.
In opposition, Plaintiff submitted a breakdown showing the registered process
service fees incurred totaling $719.83. (Saccuzzo Decl., Exh. A., pg. 2, No.5.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff has shown these costs were actually incurred. 
 
As
for Item 12, Defendants move to tax $2,286.12 in costs. Defendants argue that
Plaintiff did not rely on many of the numerous exhibits cited, and many of the
costs would have been avoided had Plaintiff cited to the same documents in the
record for its previous motion for summary adjudication. See also, Rojas v.
HSBC Card Services Inc. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 860, 891-892.). However, as
noted by Plaintiff:
 
In
accordance with the Los Angeles Superior Court’s Local Rules and the Department
Rules for this Court, Ave I appeared ready for trial on March 2, 2023, along
with copies of its trial exhibits. (Id.) After appearing ready for
trial, the parties discussed the phasing of trial given Ave I’s equitable
reformation cause of action. (Id.) The Court suggested, and the parties
agreed, that the issue of reformation would be tried first by “motion,” which
due to the filing requirements for the Los Angeles Superior Court was labeled
as a “Motion for Summary Adjudication.” (Id.) However, despite the
labeling of this “Motion” the parties effectively agreed to try the issue of
reformation through briefing and in briefing this issue to the Court the trial
exhibits previously prepared in advance of trial call were used. (Id.)
 
            (Opp., 6:14-20.) 
 
Moreover,
as the Supreme Court observed in Segal v. Asics America Corp. (2022) 12
Cal.5th 651, 667, unused exhibit costs are recoverable in the discretion of the
trial court. After review, the Court finds these costs to be recoverable.
 
As
for Item 14, Defendants move to tax $2,080.79 in costs. Defendants argue that “[f]iling
fees per electronic service providers are substantially lower than this per
transaction and this is not a reasonable amount requested and in violation of
CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).” (Motion, 2: 23-25.) However, this assertion is conclusory.
Moreover, Defendants do not contend that this amount was not actually incurred.
As such, the Court finds these costs to be recoverable.
 
As
for Item 16, Defendants move to tax $2,727.26 in costs. These costs are
characterized as “report fees/courier fees/miscellaneous fees. Without further
elaboration, these costs are characterized as: (1) CBRE Records: $246.60; (2)
Hearing: $900; (4) Secretary of State certified copy: $5.00; (5) Minute Order:
$8.60; (6) Advanced Attorney Service: $667.06. (See Saccuzzo Decl., Exh.
A., pg. 4.) Plaintiff’s opposition does not elaborate on the meaning, or
necessity, of any of these costs but rather argues that the costs were
“reasonable and incurred as part of the complex litigation process….” (Opp.,
8:1-2.) The Court finds an insufficient basis to conclude that these costs were
actually and reasonably incurred, rather than merely convenient. (Ladas v.
California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) 
 
Based
on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to strike is granted in part, denied in
part. Defendants’ motion is granted as to $2,727.26 in “Other” costs, but
denied as to all other costs. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
