And here is the English-text summary:

The Court denies the motion for summary adjudication filed by the defendants/cross-complainants SPI Holdings, LLC, Verbena WRC 9901 LP, Verbena 9901 GP LLC, and Lincoln BP Management, Inc. (collectively "Verbena"). Verbena sought to adjudicate its claims for implied indemnity, express indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief against Fiesta, Inc. dba Fiesta Blinds & Drapery (Fiesta Blinds). The Court finds that there is a triable issue as to whether Fiesta Blinds owed Verbena a duty to defend it in this action. The Court also finds that Verbena's claims for declaratory relief are not proper because the controversy is not ongoing. Additionally, the Court finds that Verbena's motion for summary adjudication is denied as to its claims for implied indemnity, express indemnity, and contribution because the amount of damages is disputed and Verbena has failed to provide evidence that Plaintiffs' claim against it is not the result of Verbena's own negligence.
