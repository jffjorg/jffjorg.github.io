And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Dylan Jahanbiglou's motion for a protective order reducing the number of special interrogatories that Defendant must respond to. The Plaintiff, Miriam Saadia, may propound a revised first set of no more than 35 special interrogatories. The Judge finds that the number of interrogatories propounded by the Plaintiff is unwarranted due to the lack of complexity in the case and the failure to provide specific information in the declaration. The Judge also denies Defendant's request for monetary sanctions, as the Plaintiff has not opposed the motion and has not acted unjustifiably.
