```

And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of the Person Most Qualified of Google, LLC. The Plaintiffs had requested the deposition to obtain basic information about the Google account that was used to electronically forge the Plaintiffs' name on a lease agreement. Google had refused to produce a witness, citing that the certificate of authenticity for the documents produced was sufficient. The Judge found that the certificate of authenticity did not obviate the need for a live witness and that the Plaintiffs had demonstrated that the answers sought were subject to discovery. The Judge also denied the Plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions against Google, finding that Google had acted with substantial justification.
