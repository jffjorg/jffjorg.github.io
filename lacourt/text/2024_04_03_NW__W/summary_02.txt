And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Raul Ulises Segovia, brought a motion to compel further responses to the defendant, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.'s, objections to the plaintiff's request for production of documents. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's objections were not code-compliant and that the defendant failed to provide adequate responses to the plaintiff's requests. The court granted the plaintiff's motion, in part, finding that the defendant was substantially justified in initially raising its objections. The court also found that the plaintiff's requests were overbroad and ordered the defendant to produce the requested documents in a more limited and focused manner.
