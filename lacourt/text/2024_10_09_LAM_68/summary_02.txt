And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel further responses to their request for production of documents, set two. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff had promised to produce all non-privileged documents, but had only produced a limited number of documents. The plaintiff had acknowledged the promise, but claimed that additional time was needed to produce the remaining documents due to the volume of requests.

The judge found that the plaintiff had produced over 3,700 pages of documents, but it was unclear when these documents were produced. The judge also found that the plaintiff's objections to producing further documents were invalid, as there was no written agreement to support the extension of time.

The judge imposed sanctions on the plaintiff and their counsel in the amount of $1,000, payable within 30 days. The judge also denied the motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents, but left open the possibility of ordering further production if necessary.

The judge also scheduled a case management conference for November 15, 2024, and a motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents (set one) for October 14, 2024.
