BACKGROUND
 
“Safe-Guard provides vehicle
service contracts (‘VSCs’), which are agreements to repair and/or replace
covered parts of leased vehicles.” 
(2/5/24 Ruling Re: Motion to Strike Re: First Amended Complaint, p. 1.)
 
“[Plaintiff] alleges that he
obtained a VSC from Safe-Guard for his leased Rolls Royce.”  (Id. at p. 2.)  “He claims the VSC required Safe-Guard to
replace the vehicle’s tires, and charge him a $100 deductible, regardless of
the number of tires that need to be replaced during a service visit.”  (Ibid.) 
“He alleges that Safe-Guard breached the VSC on multiple occasions by
charging him $100 per tire instead of the $100 deductible.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 10/30/23, [Plaintiff’s]
motion for class certification came on for hearing.”  (Ibid.) 
“[Plaintiff] sought to certify a putative class and subclass.”  (Ibid.) 
“The Court denied the motion without prejudice as to the putative class
because it was not alleged in the complaint.” 
(Ibid.)  “In addition, the Court
denied the motion without prejudice as to the putative subclass because
[Plaintiff] ‘fail[ed] to show predominating common questions, typicality, and
superiority.’”  (Ibid.)  “[Plaintiff] received leave to file the
[first amended complaint (‘FAC’) to allege the putative class and subclass, and
the Court granted Safe-Guard leave to file a pleading challenge.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 11/20/23, Plaintiff filed the
FAC.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 12/20/23, Safe-Guard demurred
and moved to strike.”  (Ibid.)
 
On 2/5/24, the Court overruled
the demurrer and granted the motion to strike in part.
 
Here, Plaintiff moves to compel
further responses to:
 
– document request (second set)
numbers 32 through 44;
 
– special interrogatory (second
set) numbers 15 through 19;
 
– request for admission (first
set) numbers 1 through 9 and 14 through 31; and 
 
– form interrogatory (first set)
number 17.1.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendant contends Plaintiff
failed to meet and confer in good faith. 
(See Opposition, pp. 10-11.)
 
The Court is inclined to rule on
the discovery requests now.  The
meet-and-confer history is summarized in Plaintiff’s moving brief.  (See Motion, pp. 5-9.)  Ultimately, the Court held a discovery
conference with the attorneys and granted Plaintiff leave to file the instant
motion.  (See id. at p. 7.)  The record indicates that Plaintiff did not
make every effort to respond to Defendant’s correspondence and inquiries (see,
e.g., Opposition, pp. 9-10, 11), but the Court doubts an additional
meet-and-confer round would make a difference.
 
Plaintiff’s Separate
Statement
 
Defendant objects to the format
of Plaintiff’s separate statement. 
Defendant claims the separate statement fails to comply with Rule of
Court 3.1345 since it “group[s] and addresse[s]” the discovery requests together.  (Id. at p. 11.)
 
The Court intends to allow the
separate statement.  While the Court
prefers that the requests be listed in “numerical order[,]” it is not a
requirement.  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update)
¶ 8:1154.)  They can be indexed by
subject matter.
 
Unconscionable Pricing
 
Defendant moved to strike
Plaintiff’s unconscionable-pricing allegations.
 
The Court denied the motion.  (See 2/5/24 Ruling Re: Motion to Strike Re:
First Amended Complaint, p. 1.)
 
Nevertheless, Defendant contends
the motion to compel should be denied as to the unconscionable-pricing requests
(document request numbers 32 through 39 and special interrogatory numbers 15
through 19) because the Court only authorized certification discovery, and the
unconscionable-pricing allegations only apply to Plaintiff’s individual
claims.  As a result, Defendant claims
the unconscionable-pricing requests amount to merits discovery. (See
Opposition, pp. 11-12.)
 
Plaintiff asserts that he
intended the unconscionable-pricing allegations to pertain to the class
claims.  If necessary, he says he is
willing to amend the complaint to make this clear.  (See Reply, p. 4.)  
 
Defendant’s argument is based on
the class definitions alleged in the FAC. 
Two putative classes remain alive. 
The first is the Tire and Wheel Overcharge Class: 
 
All
California residents who, from August 20, 2017 to the present (both dates
inclusive), were or are holders of a vehicle service contract administered by
Safe-Guard (or as to which Safe-Guard is the obligor) which contains a tire and
wheel protection provision and were charged fees, other than deductibles, in
excess of the amount provided for by their vehicle service contract. 
 
(2/5/24
Ruling Re: Motion to Strike Re: First Amended Complaint, p. 3, emphasis
added.)  The second is the Single
Deductible Subclass:
 
All
California residents who, from August 20, 2017 to the present (both dates
inclusive), were or are holders of a vehicle service contract administered by
Safe-Guard (or as to which Safe-Guard is the obligor) which contains a tire and
wheel protection provision, and, which contains a provision stating that the
customer will be charged a single deductible per visit or claim for the
replacement of any tires or wheels, regardless of the number of tires or wheels
replaced at the time, who were charged multiple deductibles on a per
tire/wheel basis in connection with a single visit or claim. 
 
(Id. at
pp. 3-4, emphasis added.)  Defendant
contends the emphasized language shows that the unconscionable-pricing
allegations do not fall within the class definitions.  (See Opposition, pp. 7-8.)
 
Because the
case is still at the certification stage, the Court is inclined to permit
Plaintiff to amend to incorporate the unconscionable-pricing allegations into
the class definitions.
 
The next
question is whether Defendant should be ordered to provide further responses.  The Court rules as follows:
 
DOCUMENT
REQUEST NO. 32: Documents sufficient to set forth the terms of All
agreements that You have and/or had with Any Vehicle Brands Concerning VSCs,
Including All agreements Concerning the pricing of and/or price terms of VSCs.
 
The
request is overbroad.  The class
definitions limit the putative classes to customers who had VSCs that had “tire
and wheel protection provision[s]” whereas the request does not include the
limitation.  (2/5/24 Ruling Re: Motion to
Strike Re: First Amended Complaint, pp. 3-4.)
 
The Court
finds that the request should be modified to add the limitation and that Defendant
should provide a further response to the modified request.
 
There is
a caveat.  During the October 4th
hearing, the Court will ask defense counsel for an estimate of the number of
agreements to which this request applies. 
If the number is burdensome, the Court may order Defendant to produce a
random sampling rather than all agreements.
 
To the
extent Defendant asserts attorney-client, work-product, and/or trade-secret
privileges, the Court orders Defendant to produce a privilege log for documents
covered by these privileges.
 
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 33:
Documents sufficient to set forth the terms of Any agreements that You have
and/or had with Any manufacturers Concerning VSCs, Including Any agreements
Concerning the pricing of and/or price terms of VSCs.
 
Same analysis as document request

DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 34:

software, formulas, metrics, factors, rubrics, systems, models, and/or
predictive analytics tools that You utilize, implement, or use in Any manner in
connection with negotiating, determining, and/or setting the pricing and/or
price terms of VSCs.
 
The motion is denied.  This request goes more to the merits than
certification and seems to seek proprietary information.  
 
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 36:
All Documents, Communications and ESI Concerning the design, creation of,
and/or decision to implement, use, and/or utilize Any algorithms, programs,
software, formulas, metrics, factors, rubrics, systems, models, and/or

DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 37:

groups within Safe-Guard that has or had Any role in the determination of,
setting of, and/or negotiations Concerning, the pricing and/or price terms of

DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 38:

externally by and between Safe-Guard and Any third party, Concerning the

number 32.
 
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 39:
All Documents, Communications, and ESI Concerning Any scripts, policies,
procedures, protocol, manuals, and/or instructions Concerning the marketing,
promotion of, and sales of VSCs, Including Any statements, representations, and
marketing and/or promotional materials Concerning VSCs.
 
Same analysis as document request
number 32 (the request should be modified to limit the request to marketing
documents related to fees, deductibles, and pricing, and Defendant should
provide a further response to modified request).
 
SPECIAL INTERROGATY NO. 15: Identify
All Persons that, on behalf of Safe-Guard, were or are involved in Any manner
in negotiating, determining, and/or setting the pricing and/or price terms of
VSCs during the Class Period, Including the dates of All such Persons’
employment with Safe-Guard.
 
Same analysis as document request
number 32.
 
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 16:
Identify All Vehicle Brands that, during the Class Period, You have or had Any
agreement(s) with, whether formal or informal, Concerning VSCs, Including Any
agreements Concerning the pricing of and/or price terms of VSCs.
 
Same analysis as document request
number 32.
 
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 17:
Identify All Persons that, on behalf of any Person other than Safe-Guard, are
or were involved in Any manner in negotiating, determining, and/or setting the
pricing and/or price terms of VSCs during the Class Period.
 
Same analysis as document request
number 32.
 
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 18:
Describe All algorithms, programs, software, formulas, rubrics, systems,
models, metrics, and/or predictive analytics tools that, during the Class
Period, You utilized, implemented, and/or used in Any manner in connection with

VSCs, Including the dates upon which such use of each commenced and ended.
 
Same analysis as document request
number 35.
 
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 19:
Identify All Persons that, during the Class Period, are or were responsible for
choosing, designing, and/or setting forth Any algorithms, programs, software,
formulas, rubrics, systems, models, metrics, and/or predictive analytics tools
that You utilize, implement, or use in Any manner in connection with
negotiating, determining, and/or setting the pricing and/or price terms of
VSCs.
 
Same analysis as document request
number 35.
 
Document Request Numbers 40
through 44
 
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 40:
All Documents, Communications, and ESI Concerning All occurrences of the
“system malfunction” referenced in ¶35 of the Complaint and/or the “system
issue where previously in some corner cases when a claim needed to be modified
in CMS, CMS would apply additional deductibles incorrectly” as described by
Jonathon Archer in his deposition in this Action.
 
The motion is denied without
prejudice.  Defendant’s supplemental
response states: “Safe-Guard states that it will produce all responsive
non-privileged documents to the extent they exist.”  (Defendant’s Separate Statement, p. 13.)  The response is a sufficient statement of
intent to comply, but Plaintiff is free to bring a renewed motion if Defendant
ends up failing to produce responsive documents.
 
Again, to
the extent Defendant asserts attorney-client, work-product, and/or trade-secret
privileges, Defendant is ordered to provide a privilege log for documents
covered by these privileges.
 
DOCUMENT
REQUEST NO. 41: All Documents, Communications and ESI Concerning Any
actions You took or are currently undertaking to address the “system
malfunction” referenced in ¶35 of the Complaint and/or the “system issue where
previously in some corner cases when a claim needed to be modified in CMS, CMS
would apply additional deductibles incorrectly”, as described by Jonathon
Archer in his deposition taken in this Action, Including All Documents,
Communications and ESI Concerning the results of Any such actions.
 
The
motion is denied.  The request appears to
seek merits discovery.
 
DOCUMENT
REQUEST NO. 42: All Documents Concerning Any policies, procedures,
protocols, or instructions Concerning Your Communications with Any car
dealerships, Vehicle Brands and/or manufacturers.
 
Same
analysis as document request number 40.

to for services can confirm the terms of Your Customers’ VSCs, Including
Documents, Communications and ESI sufficient to show how that process has
changed over time, if at all.
 
Same
analysis as document request number 40.
 
DOCUMENT

FOR ADMISSION NO. 21: Admit that YOU have not corrected, remedied, and/or
prevented from occurring in the future the “system issue” where “in some corner
cases when a Claim needed to be modified in CMS, CMS would apply additional

Form
Interrogatory Number 17.1
 
The
motion is granted.  Form interrogatory
number 17.1 is a standard discovery request approved by the Judicial
Council.  Plaintiff is entitled to
propound it.  Defendant’s supplemental
responses to this request do not comply in that they fail to state the
addresses and telephone numbers of the people who possess knowledge of the
facts and/or have custody of the subject documents.  (See, e.g., Defendant’s Separate Statement,
pp. 67-68.)  Defendant should either
provide further responses or make a showing of undue burden.
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
requests a $41,575.00 monetary sanction against Defendant.  (See Motion, pp. 11-12.)
 
The
request is denied.  Plaintiff delayed and
did not fully respond to Defendant’s meet-and-confer inquiries; Plaintiff
propounded multiple merits-based requests and requests that need to be modified;
and Defendant provided numerous compliant supplemental responses.  Under the circumstances, sanctions are not
warranted.
