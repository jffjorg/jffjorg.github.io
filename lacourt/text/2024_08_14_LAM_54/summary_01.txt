Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Cross-Defendants ADLI Law Group, P.C. and Dariush G. Adli. The motion is granted in its entirety as to Cross-Defendant ADLI Law Group, P.C., and granted in part as to Cross-Defendant Dariush G. Adli, with partial leave to amend.

The Judge has also addressed the various causes of action alleged by Cross-Complainants. The motion is granted as to the first and second causes of action for misrepresentation, and the third cause of action for unjust enrichment. The motion is denied as to the fourth and eighth causes of action for conversion and receipt of stolen property, respectively. The motion is granted as to the fifth cause of action for unfair business practices, but only if Cross-Complainants can allege facts that tie Cross-Defendants' alleged overbilling to any violation of law.

The motion is denied as to the sixth and seventh causes of action for breach of contract. The Judge has also denied Cross-Defendants' contention that Dariush G. Adli is not liable because ALG, not Adli, was the only one who signed the parties' agreement.
