BACKGROUND
 
This is a dispute over legal
fees. Plaintiffs Dariush G. Adli (Adli) and ADLI Law Group P.C. (ALG) sued
defendants Skypanels, Inc., Ali Salomi, and Chadwick Tyner on November 12,
2020, alleging a single cause of action for breach of contract (retainer
agreement) and claiming $33,343.25 in damages.
 
Defendants Ali Salomi and
Chadwick Tyner cross-complained against Plaintiffs on May 27, 2021 for
intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment,
conversion, unfair business practices, breach of contract (in two iterations),
and civil theft (Penal Code § 496). Salomi and Tyner (Cross-Complainants)
allege Adli and ALG overbilled them at least $40,000.00 for the services in
question.
 
On July 3, 2024, Plaintiffs
moved for judgment on the pleading as to all causes of action in the
cross-complaint. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A. Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Cross-Defendants
request judicial notice of (1-3) each Cross-Complainant’s creditor claim filed
in ALG’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, (4) the Bankruptcy Court’s “Order
Confirming Debtor [ALG]’s Fourth Amended Plan of Reorganization”, and (5) the
retainer agreement that allegedly underlies the parties’ dispute.
 
            The
request is granted as to the first four documents and denied as to the fifth.
 
B.  ALG’s
Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
 
            Cross-Defendants
contend ALG cannot be held liable because the Bankruptcy Court’s February 21,
2023 Order discharged ALG of liabilities incurred prior to approval of its
Plan. The Court has taken judicial notice of the order, which confirms ALG’s
Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan. (See RJN, Ex. 4, 4:7-8 [“The Plan ... is hereby
confirmed.”].) 
 
“[A]fter confirmation of a [bankruptcy]
plan, the property dealt with by the plan is free and clear of all claims and
interests of creditors, equity security holders, and of general partners in the
debtor.” (11 U.S.C. § 1141(c).) Absent certain exceptions, “the confirmation of
a plan ... discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of
such confirmation ... .” (Id., subd. (d)(1)(A).)
 
            Cross-Complainants
argue section 1141 does not apply because “the moving party has never produced
any written orders from the bankruptcy court pertaining to the
Cross-Complaint.” (Opp., 3:21-22.) But noticed materials show ALG was relieved
of debts accrued prior to February 2023, by operation of law. The bankruptcy
court does not need to make any special order directed to this proceeding.
 
            The
motion is granted in its entirety as to ALG, without leave to amend.
            
D. First and Second Causes of Action for Misrepresentation
 
            Cross-Complainants
do not state a claim for either intentional or negligent misrepresentation.
 
“The
elements of fraud [i.e., intentional misrepresentation], ... are (a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Golden Eagle
Land Investment, L.P. v. Rancho Santa Fe Assn. (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 399,
428.) 
 
            Negligent
misrepresentation requires assertion of an untrue fact that is believed by the defendant
to be true, lack of reasonable ground for the belief, defendant’s intent to
induce plaintiff’s reliance upon the representation, plaintiff’s justifiable
reliance upon the representation, and resulting damage. (Moncada v. West
Coast Quartz Corp. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 768, 781; Charnay v. Cobert
(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) 
 
            Intentional and negligent
misrepresentation must both be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz
Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) “The particularity demands
that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)
 
Cross-Complainants allege that
Cross-Defendants overcharged them. This is arguably a misrepresentation. But
Cross-Complainants do not allege facts showing Cross-Defendants intentionally
overcharged them with knowledge of the charges’ falsity and an intent to induce
Cross-Complainants’ reliance. Without more facts, Cross-Complainants have not
satisfied the heightened pleading standard for fraud.
 
Motion for judgment on the
pleadings is granted as to these causes of action, with leave to file an
amended cross-complaint.
 
C. Third Cause of Action for Unjust Enrichment
 
Unjust enrichment is not a cause of
action; it is a result of a defendant’s failure to make restitution. (Dinosaur
Development, Inc. v. White (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1310, 1315; Melchior
v. New Line Productions, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793.)  
 
But this is a distinction without a
difference; restitution and unjust enrichment are synonymous under California
law.  (Melchior v. New Line Productions, Inc., supra, 106
Cal.App.4th at 793.) For this reason, courts regularly discuss, without
contradiction, “the elements of a claim for unjust enrichment [,]” which are
“receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of
another.”  (Lyles v. Sangadeo-Patel (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th
759, 769, quoting Prakashpalan v. Engstrom, Lipscomb & Lack (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1132.) 
 
Cross-Complainants pled facts showing they paid
Cross-Defendants’ overstated bill. If true, Cross-Defendants received
Cross-Complainants’ money and continue to benefit from it unjustly at
Cross-Complainants’ expense. This states a claim for unjust enrichment. 
 
But Cross-Defendants are correct
that Cross-Complainants cannot recover on a restitution theory if they seek only
to recover on the parties’ contract. (See Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza
Del Rey (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 221, 231.)
 
The limitation is not
absolute. “[A] party to an express contract can assert a claim for restitution
based on unjust enrichment by ‘alleg[ing in that cause of action] that the
express contract is void or was rescinded.’” (Ibid.) And “[a] claim for
restitution is permitted even if the party inconsistently pleads a breach of
contract claim that alleges the existence of an enforceable agreement.” (Ibid.,
quoting Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1389.) But the
party must allege its contract is void or voidable, or that there are some
other equitable ground for recovery. Cross-Complainants have not done so here.
 
The motion is granted as to the third cause of action, with
leave to file an amended cross-complaint.
 
D. Fourth and Eighth Causes of Action for Conversion
and Receipt of Stolen Property
 
“ ‘Conversion is generally
described as the wrongful exercise of dominion over the personal property of
another. [Citation.] The basic elements of the tort are (1) the plaintiff's
ownership or right to possession of personal property; (2) the defendant's
disposition of the property in a manner that is inconsistent with the
plaintiff's property rights; and (3) resulting
damages. [Citation.]’ (Fremont Indemnity Co. v.
Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119 (Fremont).)
 
No cause of action lies for
conversion where the property in dispute is voluntarily transferred, even if
the transferee does not have a legal claim to possess it. (See Berry v.
Frazier (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1258, 1271 [“ ‘there can be no conversion
where an owner either expressly or impliedly assents to or ratifies the taking,
use or disposition of his property.’ ”].)
 
Cross-Complainants allege
they voluntarily paid Cross-Defendants, either based on the parties’ written
retainer agreement or “for work performed on a trademark matter”. Because they
concede they paid voluntarily, they have not stated a claim. 
 
Cross-Complainants’ claim
under Penal Code § 496 fails for similar reasons. The Court is persuaded
by the reasoning in Alvarez v. Adtalem Education Group, Inc. (Dec. 16,
2019, N.D.Cal. 19-cv-04079-JSW) [nonpub. opn.] 2019 WL 13065378, p. *5, cited
in Siry Investment, L.P. v.
Farkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th 333, 370 (Groban, J., conc.
opn.), where the federal district court, applying section 496, held “[a] cause
of action for civil theft cannot lie where a plaintiff received legitimate
services based on mutual agreement to pay for those services.”[1] (Ibid., citing AdTrader,
Inc. v. Google LLC (July 13, 2018, N.D.Cal. 17-cv-07082-BLF) [nonpub. opn.]
2018 WL 3428525, pp. *9-*10.)
 
            These
defects cannot be cured by amendment. Cross-Defendants’ motion is granted as to
the fourth and eighth causes of action without leave to amend.
            
E. Fifth Cause of Action for Unfair Business Practices
 
The UCL “bars ‘unfair competition’ and defines the term as
a ‘business act or practice’ that is (1) ‘fraudulent,’ (2) ‘unlawful,’ or (3)
‘unfair.’ … Each is its own independent ground for liability under the [UCL],
but their underlying purpose ‘is to protect both consumers and competitors by
promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services’ … .” (Shaeffer
v. Califia Farms, LLC (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 1125, 1135, citations omitted.)
“[T]he UCL is a chameleon. … Depending on which prong is involved, a UCL claim
may most closely resemble, in terms of the right asserted, an action for
misrepresentation …, misappropriation …, price fixing …, interference with
prospective economic advantage …, or any of countless other common law and
statutory claims. ” (Aryeh v. Canon Business Solutions, Inc. (2013) 55
Cal.4th 1185, 1196.) 
 
            A
claim for “unfair” practices arises from injury to consumers in general. (See Camacho
v. Automobile Club of Southern California (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1403.)
Cross-Complainants have not alleged such injury. And as discussed above,
Cross-Complainants have not pled any fraudulent practice. They have also not pled
facts that tie Cross-Defendants’ alleged overbilling to any violation of law. They
have not stated a claim under any prong of the UCL.
 
            The
motion is granted as to the fifth cause of action, with leave to file an
amended cross-complaint.
 
F. Sixth and Seventh Causes of Action for Breach
of Contract
 
The elements of breach of
contract are (1) the contract, (2) performance or excuse, (3) breach, and
(4) injury. (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.) “A cause of
action for breach of implied contract has the same elements as does a cause of
action for breach of contract, except that the promise is not expressed in
words but is implied from the promisor's conduct.” (Yari v. Producers Guild
of America, Inc. (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 172, 182.)
 
Cross-Complainants allege they had a retainer agreement and
they paid Cross-Defendants according to that agreement, but Cross-Defendants
did not perform the work Cross-Complainants paid them for. Cross-Complainants
have pled a claim for breach of express contract based on the retainer
agreement. Cross-Complainants may plead a breach of implied contract in the
alternative. (See Berlanga v. University of San Francisco (2024) 100
Cal.App.5th 75, 82 [claims for express and implied contract]; Aton Center,
Inc. v. United Healthcare Ins. Co. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 1214, 1232 [concurrent
claims based on express oral and implied-in-fact contracts that “shared a
common factual predicate”].)
 
            Cross-Defendants
contend Adli is not liable because ALG, not Adli, was the only one who signed
the parties’ agreement. But this contention is based on the party’s private
contract, which is outside the four corners of the cross-complaint and not
judicially noticeable. Cross-Complainants allege in their pleading they
contracted with both Adli and ALG. That is sufficient to state a claim against Adli.
 
            The motion is denied as to the sixth
and seventh causes of action.
