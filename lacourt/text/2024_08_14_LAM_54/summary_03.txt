Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to stay the action and for a protective order filed by the defendant, Ashton Simmonds. The defendant seeks to stay the litigation and the deposition of himself, citing the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The court finds that the defendant has not shown a basis for a protective order or to stay the deposition or litigation. The court considers the competing interests in the case, including the need to proceed expeditiously with the litigation, the burden on the defendant, the convenience of the court, and the interests of persons not parties to the civil litigation. The court determines that denying the stay motion promotes the convenience of the court in the management of its cases and that the public has an interest in this litigation. The court concludes that the defendant's invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege does not warrant a stay of the deposition or the litigation.
