Summary in English:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The plaintiff alleges that he was sexually abused as a child by a public entity, and the defendant is arguing that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred. The court finds that the plaintiff's claims are exempt from the Government Tort Claims Act and that the revival of time-barred claims does not constitute a "gift" of public funds. The court also finds that the revival of time-barred claims serves the public purpose of deterring sexual assault and protecting minors.
