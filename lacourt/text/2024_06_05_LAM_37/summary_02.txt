And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

"Pursuant to CCP ยง 439, the meet and confer requirement has been met. Senate Bill No. 640 waived the requirement to present a claim within 6 months after the accrual of the cause of action. The Government Tort Claims Act replaced the old Tort Claims Act, as explained in City of Stockton v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, 742, fn. 7. The Government Claims Act is an apt short version of the comprehensive title bestowed by the 1963 Legislature. The meet and confer requirement has been met, and the Senate Bill No. 640 waived the requirement to present a claim within 6 months after accrual of cause of action."
