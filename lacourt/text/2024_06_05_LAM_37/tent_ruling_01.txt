Background
 
On July 21, 2022,
James Oree Milton (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Does 1 and Does 2 to
25. 
 
The action arises
out of childhood sexual abuse under CCP § 340.1. The Complaint alleges four
causes of action for: 
1)    
Negligence against School; 
2)    
Negligence against Does 2
to 25;
3)    
Negligent Hiring,
Retention, and Supervision against School; and 
4)    
Negligent Hiring,
Retention, and Supervision against Does 2 to 25. 
 
On March 25, 2024,
Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”) filed a Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings (MJOP). Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is
now before the court. 
motion for
judgment on the pleadings[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings
performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only
defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed.” (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
1057, 1064.) “In deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all
properly pleaded material facts are deemed to be true, as well as all facts
that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins.
Exchange v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When
considering demurrers and judgment on the pleadings, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v. Transit Authority of City
of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.) A motion for judgment on
the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause of action. (Id.)
“In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
leave to amend should be granted if there is any reasonable possibility that
the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami v. Mullikin Medical
Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory motion for judgment
on the pleadings may be made any time before or during trial. (Stoops v.
Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may take judicial notice of records of any court of
record of the United States. (Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may
only judicially notice the existence of the record, not that its contents are
the truth. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
 
Defendant LAUSD requests judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
Order Re: Demurrer, E.L. v. Pasadena Unified
School District, Case No. 22STCV23288, Superior Court of California, County
of Los Angeles.
 
2)    
Order After Hearing, Jane Doe v. Sergio
Marquez, et al., Case No. 22CV003767, in the Superior Court of California,
County of Monterey.
 
3)    
Order,
Jane Doe, et al. v. Alcanes Union High School District, et al., Case No.
C22-02613, Superior Court of California, County of Contra Costa.
 
The court denies Defendant LAUSD’s request for judicial
notice. Judicial notice is an evidentiary procedure that allows the court to
establish certain indisputable facts. The unpublished rulings offered by LAUSD
have no precedential value and are not being submitted as evidence but are
being cited as precedent. Such citation is beyond the
scope of judicial notice and is legally improper. (Budrow v. Dave &
Buster’s of California, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 875, 884-885.)
 
Plaintiff requests judicial notice of the following:

III.      Discussion
 
Plaintiff brings this action
against LAUSD due to sexual abuse that occurred around 1975  to 1976. (Compl., ¶¶ 3, 32.) Defendant LAUSD
has now filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (“MJOP”) on two grounds:
1) Plaintiff failed to comply with the Government Tort Claims Act; and 2) Assembly Bill 218 (“AB 218”), which further amended CCP § 340.1,
is unconstitutional because it retroactively strips governmental immunity from
public entities in violation of Cal. Const. art. XVI, § 6, which prohibits
gifts of public funds.  
 
A.        Plaintiffs’ Claims are Exempt From the
Government Tort Claims Act
 
Under the Government Tort Claims Act, no person may sue a
public entity or public employee for money or damages unless a timely written
claim has been presented to, and acted on or deemed rejected by the public
entity. (Gov. Code, §§ 905, 912.4, 945.4.)
 
The Complaint alleges
that it is exempt from the Government Tort Claims Act under Gov. Code § 905(m).
(Compl., ¶ 62.) Section 905(m) exempts “[c]laims made pursuant
to Section 340.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the recovery of damages suffered as a
result of childhood sexual abuse.” (Gov. Code, § 904(m); see also A.M.
v. Ventura Unified School Dist. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1252, 1254–1255
(A.M.).)  
 
CCP
§ 340.1(q) currently states in relevant part: 
 
(p) This section applies to any
claim in which the childhood sexual assault occurred on and after January 1,
2024. Notwithstanding any other law, a claim for damages based on conduct
described in paragraphs (1) through (3), inclusive, of subdivision (a), in
which the childhood sexual assault occurred on or before December 31, 2023 may
only be commenced pursuant to the applicable statute of limitations set forth
in existing law as it read on December 31, 2023.
 
(CCP (Jan. 1, 2024), § 340.1(q).)
 
Prior to January 1,
2024, CCP § 340.1 stated in relevant part: 
 
(q)
Notwithstanding any other law, a claim for damages
[for childhood sexual assault] that  has
not been litigated to finality and that would otherwise be barred as of January
1, 2020, because the applicable statute of limitations, claim presentation deadline,
or any other time limit had expired, is revived, and these claims may be
commenced within three years of January 1, 2020. A plaintiff shall have the
later of the three-year time period under this subdivision or the time period
under subdivision (a) as amended by the act that added this subdivision.
 
(r)
The changes made to the time period . . . 
by the act that amended this subdivision in 2019 apply to and revive any
action commenced on or after the date of enactment of that act, and to any
action filed before the date of enactment, and still pending on that date,
including any action or causes of action that would have been barred by the
laws in effect before the date of enactment.
 
(CCP (Dec. 31, 2023), § 340.1(q)(r).)
 
Because Plaintiff filed this action on
July 21, 2022 -- within three years of January 1, 2020 -- Plaintiff’s Complaint
is exempt from the claims presentation requirement under Gov. Code § 905(m).
Furthermore, Section 905(p) explicitly states: 
 
The changes made to this section by the act that added this
subdivision are retroactive and apply to any action commenced on or after the
date of enactment of that act, and to any action filed before the date of
enactment and still pending on that date, including any action or causes of
action that would have been barred by the laws in effect before the date of
enactment.
 
AB 218, as codified in CCP
§ 340.1, abolished the statute of limitation for childhood sexual assault
claims.  Section 905(m) and (p) expressly
exclude such claims from the claim presentation requirement and retroactively
revives such claims. Therefore, Defendant LAUSD’s argument that Plaintiff is
required to comply with the claims presentation requirement of the Government
Tort Claims Act is without merit. 
 
B.        AB 218 is Not Unconstitutional
 
Defendant
LAUSD alleges that AB 2018’s retroactive provision violates Const. art. XVI, §
6, which prohibits gifts of public funds.  
 
Cal.
Const., art. XVI, § 6 states in the relevant part:  
 
The Legislature shall
have no power to give or to lend, or to authorize the giving or lending, of the
credit of the State, or of any county, city and county, city, township or other
political corporation or subdivision of the State now existing, or that may be
hereafter established, in aid of or to any person, association, or corporation,
whether municipal or otherwise, or to pledge the credit thereof, in any manner
whatever, for the payment of the liabilities of any individual, association,
municipal or other corporation whatever; nor shall it have power to make any
gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any public money or thing of value
to any individual, municipal or other corporation whatever[.] 
 
(Cal.
Const., art. XVI, § 6.) LAUSD argues that AB 218 is unconstitutional because it
applies retroactively rather than prospectively and revives lapsed claims by
providing relief from the Government Tort Claims Act presentation requirement
under section 905(m). Therefore, LAUSD argues that AB 218 violates the
prohibition against gift of public funds to a plaintiff. (Motion, at p. 9, fn.
5.) 
 
The term “gift” for purposes of
Cal. Cost. Art. XVI, § 6, “‘includes all appropriations of public money for
which there is no authority or enforceable claim,’ even if there is a moral or
equitable obligation.” (Jordan v. California Dept. of Motor Vehicles
(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 431, 450 [citation omitted].) “It
is well settled that the primary question to be considered in determining
whether an appropriation of public funds is to be considered a gift is whether
the funds are to be used for a public or private purpose. If they are to be
used for a public purpose, they are not a gift within the meaning of this
constitutional prohibition.”  (Page v. MiraCosta Community College Dist. (2009) 180
Cal.App.4th 471, 495 [internal citations and quotations omitted].) “The
determination of what constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for
the Legislature to determine, and its discretion will not be disturbed by the
courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis.” (County of Alameda v. Carleson (1971) 5 Cal.3d 730,
746.) 
 
Prior to the enactment of AB 218, the
California Supreme Court in Shirk v. Vista Unified School Dist. (2007)
42 Cal.4th 201 (“Shirk”), held that despite the 2009 amendments reviving
certain claims for childhood sexual abuse that had lapsed due to the expiration
of the statutes of limitations, the plaintiff’s claims in Shirk were
nevertheless barred due to her failure to present a timely claim under the
Government Claims Act. (Id. at p. 212-214.) The Legislature responded by
enacting Senate Bill No. 640[2] and
expressly exempting claims based on childhood sexual abuse from the claim
presentation requirement and the tort claims requirements and the six-month
notice. (Coats v. New Haven Unified School District (2020) 46
Cal.App.5th 415, 422 (“Coats”) [“Subdivision
(m) was added to section 905 in 2008, in direct response to Shirk.”].)
 
AB 218 amended Gov. Code § 905(m) by
deleting the limitation that the waiver from the claim presentation requirement
applied to conduct “occurring on or after January 1, 2009” and adding
subsection (p) to the Gov. Code § 905, expressly stating that “changes made to
this section by the act that added this subdivision are retroactive and apply
to any action commenced on or after the date of enactment of that act, and to
any action filed before the date of enactment and still pending on that date,
including any action or causes of action that would have been barred by the
laws in effect before the date of enactment.” (Gov. Code, § 905(p).) 
 
Plaintiff’s opposition cites the
legislative history of AB 218 which makes clear that its public purpose was to
ensure that victims of childhood sexual abuse can recover for their injuries
and deter the coverup of sexual assault in institutions. (Plaintiff’s RJN, Ex.
12.) In A.M.
v. Ventura Unified School Dist. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1252, the Court of Appeal noted: 
 
Finally, the legislative history of Government Code section
905, subdivision (m) confirms that the purpose of that section was ‘to ensure
that victims severely damaged by childhood sexual abuse are able to seek
compensation from those responsible, whether those responsible are private or
public entities....’ [Citation.] The author of the legislation explained this
would be accomplished ‘by specifically exempting Section 340.1 civil actions
for childhood sexual abuse from government tort claim requirements, thereby
treating Section 340.1 actions against public entities the same as those
against private entities.’ [Citation.] Our decision is consistent with this intent. 
 
(Id. at p. 1264 [internal quotations omitted].) Accordingly, the court finds that by
permitting victims of sexual childhood sexual abuse to bring claims, AB 218
serves the public by deterring sexual assault and protecting minors. 
More importantly,
Defendant LAUSD fails to show that that revival of a lapsed claims constitutes a “gift” under Cal. Const.,
art. XVI, § 6 as the plaintiff is still required to prove wrongdoing and
damages to recover. Nothing in section CCP § 340.1(q), or Gov. Code § 905(m)
and (p)—the statutory sections modified by AB 218—obligate any defendant,
individually or collectively with the other statutory sections, to pay monies
related to a meritless claim.
 
The cases that LAUSD
relies on—Bourn v. Hart (1892) 93 Cal. 321, Conlin v. Board of
Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal. 17, Powell v. Phelan (1903) 138 Cal. 271,
and Heron v. Riley (1930) 209 Cal. 507—were all decided before the
Government Tort Claims Act was enacted in 1963[3]. 
 
Enacted
in 1963, the Government Claims Act (GCA or Act) is a comprehensive statutory
scheme governing the liabilities and immunities of public entities and public
employees for torts. [Citation.] For many decades before the Act, tort
liability for public entity defendants was barred by a common law rule of
governmental immunity. Over time, however, the common law rule became ‘riddled
with exceptions,’ both legislative and judge made, and in 1961 this court
abolished the rule altogether [in Muskopf v. Corning Hospital Dist.
(1961) 55 Cal.2d 211].
 
(Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Protection
Dist.
(2019) 7 Cal.5th 798, 803.) In Williams v. Horvath
(1976) 16 Cal.3d 834, the California Supreme Court explained that “following
our decision in Muskopf v. Corning Hospital Dist. (1961) 55 Cal.2d 211”
“the Tort Claims Act” was enacted. (Id. at p. 838.) “Government Code
section 815 restores sovereign immunity in California except as provided in the
Tort Claims Act or other statute. Thus, the intent of the act is not to expand
the rights of plaintiffs in suits against governmental entities, but to confine
potential governmental liability rigidly delineated circumstances: immunity is
waived only if the various requirements of the act are satisfied.” (Id.)
 
Furthermore, the cases relied on by LAUSD
are factually distinguishable because the decisions involved circumstance where the legislature appropriated funds
to pay specific individuals (Bourn v. Hart (1892) 93 Cal. 321, 326-328; Conlin
v. Board of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal.17, 21-23) passed legislation that a
specific class of persons would be paid a specified amount out of a county’s or
other public entity’s general funds (Powell v. Phelan (1903) 138 Cal.
271, 273-274, Heron v. Riley, 1930) 209 Cal. 507.) AB 218 does not appropriate funds to
specific individuals or class of persons but instead revives previously time-barred claims
that accrued when the sexual assault occurred while still requiring that the
claims be proven in a court of competent jurisdiction in the manner provided by
law, consistent with due process requirements
 
“‘A defendant challenging the
constitutionality of a statute carries a heavy burden: ‘The courts will presume
a statute is constitutional unless its unconstitutionality clearly, positively,
and unmistakably appears; all presumptions and intendments favor its validity.’
[Citations.]” (In re D.L. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th
144, 156.) Defendant LAUSD has failed to show that AB 218 is unconstitutional
and violates the Gift Clause of the California Constitution. Moreover, the law
is clear that the Legislature has the power to revive time-barred claims. (See Liebig v. Superior Court
(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 828, 830-831; Coats v. New Haven Unified School Dist.
(2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 427-428.)
 
Accordingly, LAUSD’s Motion is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant LAUSD’s Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings is denied. Defendant to give notice.
