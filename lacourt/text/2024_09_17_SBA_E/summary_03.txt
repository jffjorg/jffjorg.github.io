And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees. The plaintiff, Kenneth E. Follmar III, had sought attorney's fees in the amount of $4,770.00, claiming that he was the prevailing party in an action against the defendants, Selene Finance LP, US Bancorp, and MTC Financial Inc. The plaintiff had obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) on an ex parte basis, which was subsequently dissolved after the defendants had an opportunity to present their opposition. The plaintiff also had an application for a preliminary injunction denied on the merits. The judge found that the plaintiff did not meet the burden of proof to show a likelihood of prevailing on his claims at trial, and therefore, the court denied the motion for attorney's fees.
