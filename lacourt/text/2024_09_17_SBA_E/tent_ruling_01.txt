Having considered defendants’ motion and
the associated exhibits, the court rules as follows: The motion for terminating
sanctions against Plaintiff Nastassja Greene is granted in part.  
 
I.               
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On
October 1, 2019, Plaintiffs Nastassja Greene (“Greene”) and Ami Miller
(“Miller”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Defendants
Wyndham Worldwide Corporation, Wyndham Destinations, Inc., Ramada by Wyndham
Hawthorne/LAX, Jimmy Kim (“Kim”), Clara Gaeta (“Gaeta”) (collectively
“Defendants”), and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, alleging the following causes
of action: (1) battery; (2) negligence; (3) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; (4) fraudulent concealment; (5) private nuisance; and (6) public
nuisance. 
 
On
June 15, 2021, Defendant Travel & Leisure Co. (“TLC”), erroneously sued as
Wyndham Destinations, Inc., formerly known as Wyndham Worldwide Corporation,
filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On
January 12, 2022, Defendants Kim and Gaeta filed a joint demurrer as well as a
motion to strike. Also, on such date, Defendant 401 South Hoover Property, Inc.
(“SHP”) dba Ramada by Wyndham Hawthorne/LAX (erroneously sued and served as
Ramada by Wyndham Hawthorne/LAX) also filed a demurrer and motion to strike. 
On
February 3, 2022, Department 1 of this Court reassigned this action on the
grounds that this case is not a personal injury action. (02/03/22 Minute
Order.) Department 1 reassigned this action to the Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka in
Department B at the Torrance Courthouse for all further proceedings. (02/03/22
Minute Order.) 
 
On
February 8, 2022, the hearings on the respective demurrers were taken
off-calendar in Department 32 at the Spring Street Courthouse due to the case
being deemed non-PI and transferred to Torrance Courthouse, Department B.
(02/08/22 Minute Order.) 
 
On
June 17, 2022, Defendants Kim and Gaeta filed a joint demurrer and motion to
strike. Also, on such date, Defendant SHP filed a demurrer to the Complaint as
well as a motion to strike. 
 
On
December 21, 2022, after hearing oral argument, the Court sustained the
demurrers to the Complaint with leave to amend and granted, in part, the
motions to strike with leave to amend. (12/21/22 Minute Order.) 
 
On
February 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). 
 
On
April 14, 2023, Defendants TLC and SHP filed a joint demurrer and motion to
strike as to the FAC. Also, on such date, Defendants Kim and Gaeta filed a
joint demurrer and motion to strike as to the FAC. 
 
On
May 16, 2023, Defendant SHP filed numerous discovery motions pertaining to
Plaintiffs. 
 
On
June 29, 2023, after hearing oral argument, the Court sustained the respective
demurrers filed by the parties to the FAC with leave to amend. (06/29/23 Minute
Order.) The Court also granted in part the respective motions to strike filed
by Defendants with leave to amend. (06/29/23 Minute Order.) 
 
On
July 31, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
against Defendants alleging causes of action for: (1) battery; (2) negligence;
(3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (4) fraudulent concealment;
(5) private nuisance; and (6) public nuisance. 
 
On
September 28, 2023, after hearing oral argument, the Court granted in part
Defendant SHP’s discovery motions. (09/28/23 Minute Order.) The Court found
that Plaintiffs failed to serve any responses to set one of Defendant SHP’s
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for Production of
Documents, and Requests for Admissions. (09/28/23 Minute Order at p. 3.) The
Court ordered Plaintiffs to serve verified responses to set one of Defendant
SHP’s Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for
Production of Documents within 10 days of the Court’s order and deemed that set
one of Defendant SHP’s Requests for Admissions were deemed admitted. (09/28/23
Minute Order at p. 3.) The Court, however, denied Defendant SHP’s request for
monetary sanctions. (09/28/23 Minute Order at p. 3.) 
 
On
October 6, 2023, Defendants filed and served Notice of Ruling as to the Court’s
September 28, 2023 order. 
 
On
November 9, 2023, after hearing oral argument, the Court sustained the demurrer
of Defendants to the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action in
the SAC without leave to amend. (11/09/23 Minute Order.) The Court granted
Defendants’ motion to strike, in part, without leave to amend and deemed the
motion to strike as moot, in part. (11/09/23 Minute Order.) 
 
On
January 25, 2024, this case was reassigned from the Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka to
the Honorable David K. Reinert in Department P at Torrance Courthouse effective
January 29, 2024. 
 
On
March 14, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion for an order for
terminating sanctions against Plaintiff Greene or, alternatively, evidence
sanctions and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Greene and her counsel. The
motion is made on the grounds that Plaintiff Greene has failed to provide
responses to discovery in accordance with the Court’s September 28, 2023 order.
The motion for terminating sanctions was served on Plaintiff Greene’s counsel
on March 8, 2024. 
 
On
April 29, 2024, Defendants filed and served a notice of non-opposition as to
the motion for terminating sanctions. 
 
On
May 6, 2024, after hearing, the Honorable David K. Reinert, sitting in
Department P at the Torrance Courthouse, continued the hearing on the instant motion
for terminating sanctions to June 27, 2024. (05/06/24 Minute Order.)
Plaintiffs’ counsel, Ilan N. Rosen, indicated that he was not able to locate
Plaintiff Greene. (05/06/24 Minute Order.) Pursuant to the request of
Plaintiffs’ counsel, the Court reserved a hearing on a motion to be relieved as
counsel for June 27, 2024. (05/06/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On
June 27, 2024, the Honorable David K. Reinert, sitting in Department P at the
Torrance Courthouse, continued the hearing on the motion for terminating
sanctions to July 23, 2024. (06/27/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On
July 17, 2024, this action was reassigned from the Honorable David K. Reinert
to the Honorable Alen B. Honeycutt sitting in Department E at Torrance
Courthouse effective August 5, 2024. 
 
Also,
on July 17, 2024, according to eCourt, which is the Court’s electronic case
management system, Defendants rescheduled the hearing on the motion for
terminating sanctions to August 22, 2024. 
 
On
August 15, 2024, according to eCourt, the Court rescheduled the hearing on the
motion for terminating sanctions from August 22, 2024 to September 17, 2024. 
 
On
September 9, 2024, pursuant to a request for dismissal filed by Plaintiff,
Defendants Wyndham Destinations, Inc. and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation were
dismissed from this action without prejudice. 
 
As
of September 12, 2024, Defendants’ motion for terminating sanctions is
unopposed. Any opposition to the motion was required to have been filed and
served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP § 1005(b).)  
 
II.            
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
 
Plaintiffs allege that they checked into a
hotel room on or about October 3, 2017. (SAC, ¶ 16.) Plaintiffs allege that on
or about October 4, 2017, they woke up to find their arms were covered with
itchy and swollen bites, of which were accompanied with an increasingly
intensifying sharp pain. (SAC, ¶ 17.) Plaintiffs voiced their concerns over the
bed bug incident to hotel management, to which the management stated that they
would inspect the rooms; however, the management denied any findings. (SAC, ¶
18.) 
 
 
III.          
LEGAL STANDARD
 A
misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)  A misuse of the discovery process also
includes disobeying a court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (g).) A court may impose issue sanctions, evidence sanctions,
or monetary sanctions against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery
process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030.) Where an issue sanction is imposed,
“designated facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance
with the claim of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery
process.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (b).) An issue sanction may also
involve “any party engaging in misuse of the discovery process from supporting
or opposing designated claims or defenses.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(b).) An evidence sanction involves “an order prohibiting any party engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated matters in
evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (c).) 
A terminating sanction may be imposed by the
court by one of the following orders: (1) an order striking out the pleadings
or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process; (2) an order staying further proceedings by that party until an order
for discovery is obeyed; (3) an order dismissing the action, or any part of the
action, of that party; or (4) an order rending judgment by default against that
party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(1)-(4).) 
“The discovery statutes evince an incremental
approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending
with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)  “Discovery
sanctions should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that
which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.” (Ibid.) “[C]ontinuing misuses of the discovery process
warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will
curb the abuse.”  (Ibid.) Where
discovery violations are “willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the
evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.” (Ibid.)  A trial court
has broad discretion to impose discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally
a prerequisite to the imposition of nonmonetary sanctions. (Biles v. Exxon
Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) Where discovery sanctions
are requested against a party, there must be a failure to comply with a court
order and the failure must be willful. (Ibid.)  
“A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.”
(Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702.) A trial
court’s order to impose terminating sanctions will be reversed only if it “was
arbitrary, capricious, or whimsical.” (Ibid.) Trial courts have properly
imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more
discovery orders. (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) Terminating sanctions are warranted when a party’s lack
of compliance with the discovery process has caused the opposing party
prejudice. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 989.)
California Code of Civil Procedure,
Section 2023.030 provides that “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction
ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” A court has
discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791.)
IV.          
DISCUSSION
 
Moving Party’s Arguments
 
Defendants assert that terminating
sanctions are warranted against Plaintiff Greene for her failure to abide by
the Court’s September 28, 2023 order and continued non-compliance with the
discovery process. 
 
Responding Party’s Opposition 
 
None filed as of September 12, 2024. 
 
Moving Party’s Reply 
 
None filed as of September 12, 2024. 
 
Motion’s Merits 
 
Procedural Defects as to Defendants’
Request for Evidence Sanctions
 
The Court will initially address Defendants’
request for evidence sanctions. 
 
A motion for issue or evidentiary
sanctions requires a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345,
subd. (a)(7).) A separate statement is not required when: (1) no response has
been provided to the request for discovery; or (2) a court has allowed the
moving party to submit—in place of a separate statement—a concise outline of
the discovery request and each response in dispute. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1345, subd. (b)(1)-(2).) Also, “[a] request for sanction shall, in the notice
of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction
is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought.” (Sole Energy Co. v.
Hodges (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 199, 207.) “The notice of motion shall be
supported by a memorandum of points and authorities, and accompanied by a
declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction
sought.” (Id. at p. 208.) 
 
Here, the Court finds that Defendants’
request for evidence sanctions is procedurally deficient. While it is
undisputed that Plaintiff Greene has failed to provide any responses to
discovery, and thus a separate statement is not required, Defendants do not
articulate what specific evidence sanctions they seek against Plaintiff Greene.
Defendants merely argue that they “[a]lternatively . . . request the Court
grant an order precluding Plaintiff from introducing evidence at trial that
should have been disclosed during discovery.” (Memorandum of Points and
Authorities at p. 14:16-17.) However, Defendants have failed to articulate in
their notice of motion or elsewhere the matters they seek to prohibit Plaintiff
Greene from introducing into evidence. (CCP § 2023.030(c).) As such, the Court
has no basis to ascertain what specific evidentiary sanctions are sought.
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendants’
request for evidentiary sanctions. The Court will, however, assess Defendants’
request for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions. 
 
Evidence in Support of the Motion
 
In support of the motion, Defendants’
counsel, Allison K. Howard (“Howard”), provides a declaration. Ms. Howard
declares that she propounded, on behalf of Defendant SHP, a first set of Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for Production of Documents,
and Request for Admissions on Plaintiff Greene on December 21, 2022. (Howard
Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant SHP’s first set of
initial discovery was originally due no later than January 24, 2023. (Howard
Decl., ¶ 6.) After granting Plaintiff Greene multiple extensions to respond to
such discovery, Defendant SHP filed a motion to compel. (Howard Decl., ¶¶ 7-19;
Exhs. B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I.) 
 
On September 28, 2023, the Court issued an
order granting Defendant SHP’s motions to compel and the Court granted
Defendant SHP’s motion for an order deeming admitted its first set of Requests
for Admissions. (Howard Decl., ¶ 23; Exh. M.) On October 6, 2023, counsel’s
office sent Plaintiff’s counsel notice of the Court’s September 28, 2023 order.
(Howard Decl., ¶ 24; Exh. N.) Pursuant to the Court’s September, 28, 2023
order, counsel declares that Plaintiff Greene’s responses to Defendant SHP’s
first set of written discovery were due October 18, 2023. (Howard Decl., ¶ 25.)
Plaintiff Greene has still not provided responses to Defendant SHP’s first set
of written discovery as ordered by the Court. (Howard Decl., ¶¶ 27-30; Exhs. P,
Q, and R.) Counsel states that Plaintiff Greene’s refusal to comply with
discovery obligations constitutes a misuse of the discovery process and her
lack of response has caused Defendants to incur and will continue to cause
Defendants to incur reasonable and necessary fees and costs to bring the
instant motion. (Howard Decl., ¶ 31.) 
 
As to monetary sanctions, counsel states
that Defendants have and will incur attorneys’ fees and costs totaling
$5,500.00 consisting of the following: time and expense of attempting to meet
and confer with Plaintiff Greene’s counsel, researching, drafting, and filing
the instant motion, preparing a reply brief to Plaintiff’s opposition, and
attending the hearing on the instant motion. (Howard Decl., ¶ 32.) 
 
Appropriateness of Terminating Sanctions
 
Given that the instant motion is
unopposed, it is undisputed that Plaintiff Greene has failed to comply with the
Court’s September 28, 2023 order. Given that the motion is unopposed, the Court
finds that Plaintiff Greene’s non-compliance is willful. 
 
The Court, however, finds that terminating
sanctions against Plaintiff Greene are not appropriate at this time. Although
Plaintiff Greene has failed to comply with the Court’s September 28, 2023
order, the Court must take an incremental approach to discovery sanctions
pursuant to Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992. Plaintiff Greene has only failed to comply with one
discovery order of this Court. While evidence sanctions might have been
appropriate, the Court cannot grant such sanctions given the defects as to
Defendants’ request for evidence sanctions. 
 
As such, the Court DENIES Defendants’
request for terminating sanctions as to Plaintiff Greene. 
 
The Court, however, ORDERS that Plaintiff
Greene comply with the Court’s September 28, 2023 order forthwith and in any
event no later than 10 days from the date of notice of this order. 
 
Imposition of Monetary Sanctions
 
Defendants request monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff Greene and her counsel of record in the sum of $5,500.00. 
 
The Court has yet to impose monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff Greene. In its September 28, 2023 order, the Court
denied Defendant SHP’s request for monetary sanctions. (See 09/28/23 Minute
Order at p. 3.) Counsel’s declaration in support of the instant motion does not
set forth counsel’s hourly rate or the time spent on the instant motion;
however, counsel does attest that Defendants will and have incurred attorney’s
fees and costs totaling $5,500.00 as to the instant motion. The Court also
notes that the notice of motion does not specifically identify Plaintiff’s
counsel by name although requesting monetary sanctions against Plaintiff’s
counsel. (See Notice of Motion.) As such, the Court will not impose monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel because Defendants have failed to
“identify . . . [the] attorney against whom the sanction is sought.” (CCP §
2023.240.) 
 
Exercising its discretion, the court
GRANTS IN PART Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions. Given that the
motion is unopposed and the straightforward nature of the motion, the Court
exercises its discretion and AWARDS Defendant SHP monetary sanctions in the
reasonable amount of $750.00. The Court will only award monetary sanctions to
Defendant SHP—and not the other named defendants—because Plaintiff Greene
failed to comply with a discovery order of this Court pertaining to only
Defendant SHP. Monetary sanctions in the amount of $750.00 are to be paid by
Plaintiff Greene within 30 days of the date of notice of this order to
Defendant SHP. 
 
    
V. CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the Motion for
Terminating Sanctions Against Plaintiff Nastassja Greene is GRANTED IN PART.
The Court DENIES Defendants’ request for terminating and evidence sanctions
against Plaintiff Nastassja Greene. 
 The Court ORDERS Plaintiff Nastassja Greene to
comply with the Court’s September 28, 2023 order forthwith and in any event no
later than 20 days from the date of notice of this order.
 
The Court GRANTS IN PART Defendants’ request
for monetary sanctions. Monetary sanctions in the amount of $750.00 are to be
paid to Defendant SHP by Plaintiff Nastassja Greene within 20 days of the date
of notice of this order.    
 
Moving Party to
give notice.

South Hoover Property, Inc. dba Ramada by Wyndham Hawthorne/LAX, Travel &
Leisure Co., Jimmy Kim, and Clara Gaeta’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions filed
