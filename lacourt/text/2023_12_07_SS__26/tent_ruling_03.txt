ANALYSIS:
 
Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain (“Judgment Creditor”), in pro
per, filed the instant action for fraud against Alina Grygoryshyna (“Judgment
Debtor”), also in pro per, on July 6, 2020. Following Judgment Debtor’s failure
to appear, the Court entered default judgment in Judgment Creditor’s favor on
January 4, 2021. 
 
Judgment Creditor served a Subpoena Duces Tecum for Personal
Appearance and Production of Documents, setting the examination on December 21,
2022. (Subpoena Duces Tecum, filed 10/21/22.) The subpoena sought Judgment
Debtor’s appearance and production of the following documents: 
 
1.     
Driver’s license
2.     
Marriage certificate
3.     
Prenuptial agreement
4.     
Titles for all vehicles owned
5.     
Real estate deeds for all property owned
6.     
All credit and debit cards issued on name
7.     
GIA certificates for all diamond jewelry owned
8.     
All bank account statements for the previous two years
9.     
Federal and state tax returns for the previous two
years
10.  Articles
of incorporation and articles of organization for all businesses owned
 
(Subpoena Duces Tecum, filed 10/21/22, p. 4.) The Court
continued the examination to February 28, 2023, to allow Judgment Debtor to
bring the documents and held the subpoena duces tecum was “to remain in full
force and effect.” (Minute Order, 12/21/22.) On February 28, 2023, the Court
continued the examination to March 28, 2023 and ordered Judgment Debtor to:
 
[B]ring the missing documents, any
documents that show a ceremonial marriage occurred or copy of name change
order, and credit card/bank statements for Bank of America or Wells Fargo, even
if closed; if accounts were closed, judgment debtor shall provide the last four
months of statements for the closed accounts and the closing account
statements. In addition to the judgment creditor bringing all the discussed
documents to the continuance date, the judgment debtor shall send copies of
said documents, via email, to the judgment creditor in advance of the
continuance date.
 
(Minute Order, 02/28/23.) Again, the Court ruled the
subpoena duces tecum was “to remain in full force and effect.” (Ibid.)
On March 28, 2023, the Court found that Judgment Debtor failed to bring the
documents or to serve them on Judgment Creditor, as ordered. (Minute Order,
03/28/23.) The Court set an Order to Show Cause re: Contempt for May 31, 2023.
(Ibid.) 
 
On May 31, 2023, Judgment Debtor represented that she was in
possession of the documents and the Court continued the OSC to June 15, 2023 to
allow Judgment Debtor to serve them on Judgment Creditor. (Minute Order,
05/31/23.) On June 15, 2023, the Court ordered that Judgment Debtor be
represented by a public defender and continued the OSC to July 17, 2023 to
allow time for compliance as guided by the public defender. (Minute Order,
06/15/23.) 
 
On July 17, 2023, the Court granted Judgment Debtor’s
request for a continuance of the contempt hearing to January 18, 2024. (Minute
Order, 07/17/23.) The Court reiterated that Judgment Debtor was to provide
Judgment Creditor with the subpoenaed documents. (Ibid.) 
 
Judgment Creditor filed the instant Motion to Produce
Documents on July 24, 2023. Judgment Creditor also filed eight Subpoena Duces
Tecum for Personal Appearance and Production of Documents at Hearing on third
parties, setting the hearings for various dates in September 2023. On August
11, 2023, Judgment Debtor filed a Motion to Quash Request for Production of
Documents or Modify Protective Order; Request to Reschedule Hearing. Following
transfer of this action from Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse to
Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse, the hearing was re-scheduled to
September 7, 2023. (Notice of Continuance, 08/17/23.) Judgment Creditor filed
the Motion again on August 22, 2023. 
 
The instant Motion to Produce Documents came for hearing on
September 7, 2023. Judgment Debtor did not appear but sought to send a
representative, Sammy Hakim (“Hakim”). (Minute Order, 09/07/23.) The Court
informed Hakim that he could not represent Judgment Debtor as a non-attorney
and continued the hearing to November 7, 2023. (Ibid.) On September 12
and 25, 2023, Judgment Creditor re-filed the instant Motion with a supporting
supplemental declaration also filed on September 12, 2023. 
 
The Motion then came for hearing on
November 7, 2023 but was continued due to the Court’s unavailability to
November 29, 2023. (Minute Order, 11/07/23.) The clerk gave notice of the
order. (Certificate of Mailing, 11/07/23.) On November 29, 2023, the Court
indicated that further time was required to effectuate a tentative ruling and
continued the matter to December 7, 2023. (Minute Order, 11/29/23.) 

 
 
 
Discussion
 
Judgment Creditor
moves to compel Judgment Debtor’s production of the subpoenaed documents
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 708.110 and 1985.8. Code of Civil
Procedure section 708.110, however, pertains only to the order for judgment
debtor examination and does not address production of documents. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 708.110.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.8, subdivision (a)(1)
is also unhelpful with respect to Judgment Creditor’s request for relief as it
only provides that “[a] subpoena in a civil proceeding may require that
electronically stored information . . . be produced . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1985.8, subd. (a)(1).) 
 
Judgment Creditor
also moves for modification of the Court’s orders dated February 28, 2023 and
July 17, 2023. Specifically, that the February 28, 2023 order limiting the time
period of production of bank account statements to four months be changed to two
years as provided for in the subpoena, and that the July 17, 2023 order be
modified to provide a deadline for production. Judgment Creditor contends that
the four-month production period be extended to two years because the financial
statements Judgment Debtor has produced show “multiple and repeated
funds transfers to and from close family members and friends and associated
business entities” and indicate an attempt to dispose of and conceal the funds
to avoid collection by Judgment Creditor. (Motion, ¶21.) However, the Motion
offers no evidence to support this theory. (Ibid.) The request to modify
the production period set forth in the February 28, 2023 order is denied.
 
Judgment Creditor’s
request for clarification of the July 17, 2023 order, however, is appropriate
as the Court did not set another hearing date for the judgment debtor
examination nor a date by which the documents should be produced. (See Minute
Order, 07/17/23.) To the extent Judgment Debtor’s Motion to Quash is an
opposition to the instant Motion to Produce Documents, no proper basis is
provided to quash the subpoena served on December 21, 2022. In fact, Judgment
Debtor contends that she has produced all financial records as ordered, with
the exception of three months of credit statements from Capital One, which are
not available. (Motion to Quash, pp. 2:27-3:4.) The Motion to Quash does not
address the production of subpoenaed non-financial documents, including
Judgment Debtor’s vehicle title, marriage certificate, and certificate of
non-filing from tax agencies. Accordingly, Judgment Debtor is to produce the
documents as set forth in the February 28, 2023 order by December 21, 2023. 
 
Conclusion
 
Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain’s Motion to Produce Documents is granted in part and denied in part. THE
REQUEST TO MODIFY THE JULY 17, 2023 ORDER IS GRANTED AS FOLLOWS: BY DECEMBER 21,
2023, JUDGMENT DEBTOR IS TO PRODUCE THE DOCUMENTS AS SET FORTH IN THE COURT’S
FEBRUARY 28, 2023 ORDER. THE REQUEST TO MODIFY THE FEBRUARY 28, 2023 ORDER IS
DENIED.
