And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's motion to vacate the dismissal, enforce the settlement agreement, and enter judgment. The settlement agreement was entered into by State Farm and Armando Sosa Bustamante, the defendant, on April 23, 2020. The agreement provided for Defendant to pay State Farm $24,180.80, with $7,830.80 coming from insurance and the remainder to be paid in monthly installments starting on February 15, 2020. Despite Defendant only paying $10,830.00 towards the settlement, State Farm is seeking judgment in the amount of $13,422.80 (settlement amount less monies paid) plus costs of $72.00. The judge found that the settlement agreement was enforceable and that the request for retention of jurisdiction was proper, and therefore granted the motion.
