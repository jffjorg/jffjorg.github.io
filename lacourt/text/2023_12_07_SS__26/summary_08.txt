And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Motion of Attorney Morse Mehrban for an order allowing him to collect only the attorney's fees awarded as part of the judgment. The Motion is based on the contention that the attorney's fees belong to the attorney, but the Judge finds that the Motion does not analyze the circumstances of the cited cases and lacks supporting evidence. The Judge notes that the Court has the power to compel obedience to its judgments and orders, but the Motion does not demonstrate how this power applies in this case. The Judge concludes that the Motion is denied.
