ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action
for automobile subrogation against Defendant Armando Sosa Bustamante (“Defendant”)
on June 6, 2018. Defendant filed an answer to the Complaint on February 21,
2019. On November 22, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Conditional Notice of Settlement.
A second lawsuit between the parties was filed on November 30, 2018 in LASC
Case No. 18STLC14502 but the parties’ stipulation to consolidate the cases was
denied on February 11, 2020. (Stipulation to Consolidate, filed 02/11/20.) 
 
On April 23,
2020, Plaintiff filed a copy of its
settlement agreement with Defendant with a request for dismissal and retention
of jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.4. The Court granted
the request for dismissal with retention of jurisdiction on the same date.
(Stip for Entry of Judgment and Order, 04/23/20.) 
 
Plaintiff filed a Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce
Settlement, and Enter Judgment (“the Motion”) on May 18, 2023. The Motion came
for hearing on August 10, 2023 and was denied. (Minute Order, 08/10/23.) On
August 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal,
Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment (“the Renewed Motion”). The Renewed
Motion initially came for hearing on November 7, 2023, at which time Plaintiff
requested and was granted a 30-day continuance. (Minute Order, 11/07/23.) On
November 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed a supplemental declaration in support of the
Renewed Motion. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
When a party
seeks the same relief that was previously denied, it must bring a renewed
motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (b). (California
Correctional Peace Officers Ass’n v. Virga (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 30, 43,
fn. 11; see also Tate v. Wilburn (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 150, 156-157.)
When a motion has been denied in whole or in part, the moving party may apply
again for the same relief at a later time only upon “new or different facts,
circumstances or law.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (b); see Graham v.
Hansen (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 965, 969-970.) 
 
The Renewed Motion is supported by the supplemental
declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, which sets forth new facts regarding the
judgment sought to be entered in this action. Specifically, that instead of now
seeking a settlement with respect to this action and LASC Case No. 18STLC14502,
Plaintiff only seeks a settlement of this action. The Renewed Motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure,
section 664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) The settlement agreement here complies with the statutory
requirements set forth above because it was signed by both parties and
Plaintiff’s attorney. (Motion, Benson Decl., Exh. 1, p. 4.)
 
Furthermore, the request for
retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the parties, before the
action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of jurisdiction to conform to the
statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If,
after a suit has been dismissed, a party brings a section 664.6 motion for a
judgment on a settlement agreement but cannot present to the court a request
for retention of jurisdiction that meets all of these requirements, then
enforcement of the agreement must be left to a separate lawsuit.”].) The
parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction complies with these requirements
because it was made in writing to the Court before the action was dismissed.
(Motion, Benson Decl., Exh. 1, ¶11.) Therefore, the Court finds that the
parties’ settlement agreement is enforceable, and the request for the Court’s
retention of jurisdiction is proper, under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
 
The settlement agreement provides
that Defendant would pay Plaintiff $24,180.80 by way of $7,830.80 from
insurance, followed by monthly payments starting on February 15, 2020. (Id.
at Exh. 1, ¶2.) The settlement agreement also provides that if Defendant defaults,
judgment in the amount of $37,196.36 (the combined demands of the complaints in
this action and LASC Case No. 18STLC14502), less monies paid, plus costs and
prejudgment interest, may be entered in Plaintiff’s favor. (Id. at Exh.
A, ¶¶1, 3.) Defendant only paid $10,830.00 towards the settlement. (Motion,
Supp. Cicione Decl., ¶8.) However, Plaintiff now only seeks judgment in the
settlement amount less monies paid in the amount of $13,422.80 ($24,180.80 -
$10,830.00) plus costs of $72.00. (Ibid.)  
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce
Settlement Agreement and Enter Judgment is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,422.80
PRINCIPAL AND $72.00 COSTS.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
