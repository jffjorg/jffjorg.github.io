And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's third motion to vacate dismissal, enforce settlement, and enter judgment. The motion is denied because Plaintiff failed to comply with procedural requirements, including providing a declaration showing new or different facts, circumstances, or law, and failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for its lack of diligence in presenting new or different facts to the Court. The Court finds that Plaintiff's failure to comply with procedural requirements is a jurisdictional prerequisite to granting the motion, and that Plaintiff's lack of diligence in presenting new or different facts is a strict requirement of diligence that is intended to incentivize parties to efficiently marshal their evidence.
