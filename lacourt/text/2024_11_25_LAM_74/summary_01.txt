And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the defendant's motion to seal portions of the plaintiff's opposition to the defendant LPCH's Motion for Summary Judgement. The court finds that the defendant has identified three categories of confidential information: sensitive financial information and proprietary business information related to the plaintiff's services agreement with the defendant, sensitive financial information related to the Anthem CME Agreement with LPCH, and personally identifiable health information of non-party minors. The court agrees that the defendant's privacy interest in confidential and proprietary business information and the minor patients' interest in personal health information overrides the public right of access. The court grants the motion to seal and orders that the proposed sealing order be signed without modification.
