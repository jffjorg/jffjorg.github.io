The Court has

The motion is GRANTED.

Background
            This
is an action arising from alleged injuries that Plaintiff Victoria Franklin
(“Plaintiff”) sustained while providing teaching services at the ICEF Viewpark
Preparatory High School campus, which is located at 5701 South Crenshaw Blvd.,
Los Angeles, CA 90043 (the “Premises”). The Complaint arises from an incident
which allegedly occurred on or about October 14, 2022. 
            On
October 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants The Nia
Foundation Incorporated, Inner City Education Foundation, ICEF Viewpark
Preparatory High School, Los Angeles Unified School District, and DOES 1-50,
inclusive (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging causes of action for: (1)
failure to carry workers’ compensation insurance/negligence per se; (2)
negligence; (3) negligent hiring, supervision, training, and retention; (4)
premises liability; and (5) concealment of lack (sic) workers’ compensation
insurance. 
            Also,
on October 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Civil Case Cover Sheet Addendum and
Statement of Location, which is dated October 10, 2024. Plaintiff’s counsel
attests therein that this action was properly filed in the West District and
indicates that the address of 5701 South Crenshaw Blvd. is the basis for the
filing location. 
            On
October 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Order Nunc Pro Tunc
and Application for Relief from Electronic Filing System Error. Plaintiff seeks
“an [o]rder to date the [c]omplaint, summons, and related pleadings for October
10, 2024, when they were originally filed.” (Not. of Mot. at p. 2:4-6.) The
motion was not filed with a proof of service. 
            As
of November 18, 2024, no proof of service has been filed showing service of the
summons and complaint on any defendant. The Court informs Plaintiff that “[t]he
summons and complaint shall be served upon a defendant within three years after
the action is commenced against the defendant . . . [and] an action is
commenced at the time the complaint is filed.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.210,
subd. (a).) As to the filing of a proof of service concerning the summons and
complaint “[p]roof of service of summons shall be filed within 60 days after
the time the summons and complaint must be served upon a defendant.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 583.210, subd. (b).) 
Legal
Standard
            Where
the filing of a summons and complaint has an insubstantial defect, “the clerk
should file the complaint and notify the attorney or party that the perceived
defect should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.” (Rojas v. Cutsforth
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 774, 777 (Rojas).) “The functions of the clerk
are purely ministerial.” (Ibid.) “The clerk has no discretion to reject
a complaint that substantially conforms to the local rules.” (Ibid.)
“[A] paper is deemed filed when it is deposited with the clerk with directions
to file the paper.” (Id. at p. 778.) There is a preference for
dispositions of actions on the merits. (Carlson v. State of California
Department of Fish & Game (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1281 (Carlson).)
“[E]rrors in compliance with local rules [should] not prejudice the client.” (Ibid.)
A clerk no express or implied “power to enforce local rules by rejecting
otherwise conforming papers.” (Ibid.) A paper is “filed when presented
to the clerk for filing.” (Ibid.) “For purposes of the statute of
limitations, filing means delivery to the clerk during business hours.” (Id.
at p. 1273.) “[S]o long as a complaint complies with state requirements, the
clerk has a ministerial duty to file.” (Id. at p. 1270.) 
            California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.220(c) provides that “[i]f a party is required to
provide a cover sheet under this rule or a similar local rule fails to do so or
provides a defective or incomplete cover sheet at the time the party’s first
paper is submitted for filing, the clerk of the court must file the paper.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.220(c).) 
Los
Angeles Superior Court Local Rules, Rule 2.3(a)(1)(E) provides that
“[i]n addition to the Civil Case Cover Sheet required by the California Rules
of Court, a civil action or proceeding presented for filing in any district,
other than electronically filed family law cases initiated by the district
attorney, must be accompanied by the Civil Case Cover Sheet Addendum and
Statement of Location (form LACIV 109), signed by counsel for plaintiff or the
self-represented plaintiff. A copy of the completed form must be served with
the summons and complaint or petition.” (Superior Court of California, County
of Los Angeles, Court Rules, Rule 2.3(a)(1)(E).) 
Every
unlimited civil tort action for bodily injury, wrongful death, or damage to
personal property must be filed in the judicial district where the incident
arose. (Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Court Rules, Rule
2.3(a)(1)(A).) The filing court location on the Los Angeles Superior Court
website should be used to ascertain the appropriate filing location. (Ibid.)

Discussion  
            Evidence in Support of the Motion 
            Plaintiff’s counsel, Justin R. Rogal
(“Rogal”), provides a declaration in support of the motion. Mr. Rogal states
the following: On Thursday, October 10, 2024, he personally prepared and
e-filed the Complaint, Summons, and Civil Case Cover Sheet (with the Los
Angeles Superior Court Addendum) (collectively, the “Complaint Packet”) with
One Legal, which is an authorized e-filing service provider. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 4;
Exs. 1, 2.) One Legal’s case initiation menu only presented filing options for
the Santa Monica Courthouse and Stanley Mosk Courthouse when counsel input the
ZIP Code 90043. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 5; Ex. 3.) No other locations were provided for
such ZIP Code. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 5; Ex. 3.) Counsel used the Court’s “Locate Your
Filing Courthouse” function on the Court’s website. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 6.) Such
function indicated that either the Santa Monica Courthouse or Beverly Hills
Courthouse was the correct location to file the Complaint. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 6.)
Counsel therefore selected the Santa Monica Courthouse believing it was the
more correct filing location given that: (1) the incident occurred closer to
Santa Monica; and (2) Stanley Mosk was not an option for “View Park” as
appearing on the Los Angeles Superior Court website. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 6.) The
Complaint Packet was timely submitted on October 10, 2024, within the hours for
submission by e-filing. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 7; Ex. 1.) 
On October 15, 2024, counsel’s office was notified that the Complaint
Packet was rejected. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 8; Ex. 4.) When the rejection notice was
obtained, it said that the Complaint Packet had been rejected due to “Incorrect
Court District/Court Location” and advised Plaintiff to file the documents at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 9; Ex. 5.) Counsel states that the
rejection was irregular. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 10.) On October 16, 2024, the very next
day, Plaintiff’s counsel re-filed the Complaint Packet and corrected the
address of the Court on the Summons and Civil Case Cover Sheet to Stanley Mosk
per the Court clerk’s instruction on the rejection notice. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 11;
Ex. 7.) The complaint filed on October 10, 2024 and the re-filed complaint filed
on October 16, 2024 are identical. (Rogal Decl. ¶ 12.) 
Matthew Mann (“Mann”) also declares that when he called the civil clerk
in Santa Monica Courthouse and explained the problem concerning the rejection,
he was told that the filing date could not be changed without a court order,
and that the Complaint Packet should have been filed with Stanley Mosk
Courthouse. (Mann Decl. ¶ 6.) Mr. Mann states that on October 16, 2024, he
promptly filed the matter in Stanley Mosk and it was accepted on October 16,
2024. (Mann Decl. ¶ 7.) 
The Complaint
Should be Deemed Filed on October 10, 2024
The Court finds that the Complaint should be deemed filed on October
10, 2024. Based on the declarations of counsel, there was an error concerning
the proper court location for the filing courthouse. Such error, however, did
not warrant a rejection of the complaint on October 10, 2024. The clerk should
have filed the complaint pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.220(c). The
complaint was presented to the clerk for filing on October 10, 2024, and
therefore it should be deemed filed as of such date. (Rojas, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th 774, 778.)  Plaintiff should not be prejudiced for such
an insubstantial defect under Carlson, supra,
68 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1281. 
Pursuant to Rojas, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th 774, 778, the Court issues an
order nunc pro tunc and deems the complaint filed on October 10, 2024,
which is the date it was presented to the clerk for filing. 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Nunc Pro Tunc and Application for Relief
from Electronic Filing System Error is GRANTED. 
It is so
ordered.
