Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion by the plaintiff, Victoria Franklin, to deem the complaint filed on October 10, 2024, despite an error in the court location. The plaintiff filed the complaint electronically on October 10, 2024, but it was rejected due to an incorrect court district/court location. The plaintiff re-filed the complaint and corrected the address on October 16, 2024.

The judge finds that the error in court location was insubstantial and did not warrant rejection of the complaint. The clerk should have filed the complaint on October 10, 2024, despite the error, and the plaintiff should not be prejudiced for the error.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for an order nunc pro tunc and deems the complaint filed on October 10, 2024. The judge also orders that the plaintiff's motion for relief from the electronic filing system error is granted.
