And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Kapa Investment's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The plaintiff claims that the defendants, Collision Craft, Inc. and Richard Jay Rogers, failed to pay rent as required under a lease agreement and failed to vacate the premises. The plaintiff served a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit, but the defendants failed to pay the full amount due. The judge found that the notice was defective because it included non-rent charges, such as property taxes, and that the lease itself is unclear about whether payment of taxes constitutes rent. The judge requires additional evidence to determine whether the parties contemplated payment of taxes or personal property taxes to constitute rent. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is denied.
