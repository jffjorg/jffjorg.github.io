Summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants (Doc McGhee, McGhee Entertainment, Inc., Gene Simmons, and Paul Stanley) to the complaint filed by the plaintiffs (The Estate of Francis S. Stueber III, by and through its Successors-In-Interest, Catherine Stueber and Patrick Von Stueber, etc.). The defendants argue that workers' compensation is the exclusive remedy for the plaintiffs and that they released their claims via a Workers Compensation Appeals Board Order Approving Compromise and Release in Dependency Claim. The Judge has ruled that the demurrer is overruled, and the defendants must file and serve an answer to the complaint within ten days of the entry of this order. The Judge notes that the complaint does not allege an employment relationship between the defendants and the decedent, and that the defendants are welcome to make further arguments in support of their demurrer in the context of a motion allowing the consideration of evidence.
