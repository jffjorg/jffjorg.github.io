And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, LAUSD, has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the claims are barred as a matter of law. The court agrees with the defendant's arguments and sustains the demurrer with leave to amend. Specifically, the court finds that the plaintiff's breach of contract claim is barred because public employees cannot assert contract claims against public entities. The court also finds that the plaintiff's claim for negligent violation of the FEHA is not properly pleaded and grants leave to amend to state a direct claim for violation of the FEHA. Finally, the court sustains the demurrer to the plaintiff's claim for violation of the Public Records Act, but grants leave to amend to clarify that the plaintiff seeks only to enforce her request for records and for attorney fees related to such enforcement action. The court gives the plaintiff 30 days to amend its complaint.
