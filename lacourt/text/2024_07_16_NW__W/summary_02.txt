```

And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has denied the motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint supporting the claim for punitive damages. The defendants argued that the allegations were not based on ultimate facts, were conclusory, and failed to plead specific facts sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. However, the Judge found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged malice or oppression by the defendants, as they intentionally chose not to properly abate severe infestations and failed to provide a safe and habitable dwelling. The Judge also found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged ratification or authorization by an officer, director, or managing agent. Therefore, the motion to strike is denied, and the defendants have 30 days to answer.
