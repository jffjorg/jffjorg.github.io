And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike portions of the complaint by the plaintiffs, Eddy Haemker and Debra Haemker. The defendant, Loretta Westlund, has moved to strike 18 portions of the complaint, including punitive damages for breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. The Judge has granted the motion in part, striking only the portion of the complaint related to punitive damages for breach of implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. The Judge has ruled that the plaintiffs do not have sufficient facts to recover punitive damages for this cause of action, as they have not been evicted and their remedy is to sue for breach of contract damages.

However, the Judge has denied the motion to strike the remaining 17 portions of the complaint, finding that the plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to recover punitive damages for retaliatory actions. The Judge has ruled that the plaintiffs' allegations of retaliatory actions, including intentional eviction and increased rent, can reasonably be characterized as conduct intended to harm the plaintiffs or despicable conduct carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of the plaintiffs' rights. The Judge has given the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaint.
