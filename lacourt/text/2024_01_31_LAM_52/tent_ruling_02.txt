 Case Number:  21STCV28570    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  52 Judgment
Creditors Thomas Nash and Bo Kyung O’Connor’s Motion for Attorney Fees
            Judgment creditors Thomas Nash and
Bo Kyung O’Connor move for an additional $48,157.50 in attorney fees incurred
in enforcing the judgment against judgment debtor Ninon Aprea.
            “Attorney’s
fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under”
the Enforcement of Judgments Law “if the underlying judgment includes an award
of attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of
paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.”  (CCP § 685.040.)  The Enforcement of Judgments Law “ ‘addresses
in detail several means of enforcing a judgment, including liens on real and
personal property (§§ 697.010-697.920), writs of execution (§§
699.010-701.830), garnishment of wages (§§ 706.010-706.154) and writs of
possession or sale (§§ 712.010-716.030)....’ 
[Citation.]  Each of these means
of enforcing a judgment results, at least to some degree, in the satisfaction
of the judgment.”  (Highland Springs
Conference & Training Center v. City of Banning (2019) 42
Cal.App.5th 416, 426.)
Creditors claim $39,157.50 in attorney fees incurred
for 14.9 hours at $675 hourly plus 38.8 hours at $750 hourly.  They also seek an anticipated $9,750 of fees for 10 hours at $675
hourly plus 4 hours at $750 hourly spent reviewing the opposition, drafting the
reply, and preparing for and attending the hearing on this motion.  (Linzer Decl., ¶¶ 23-24.)  
Hourly Rates
            For
hourly rates, “the trial court is in the best position to value the services
rendered by the attorneys.”  (569 East
County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 426, 436.)  Courts may rely
on their “own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees, the
difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied, and
affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and
rate determinations in other cases.” (Id. at p. 437, citations omitted.)
            The
court finds creditors’ attorneys’ rates of $675 and $750 hourly reflect the
reasonable market value of their services.
Number of Hours
            The
court finds creditors did not reasonably incur all hours of fees they
claim.  In calculating the
lodestar, the court must determine whether the tasks performed by an attorney
were necessary and whether the amount of time billed for each task was
reasonable.  (Baxter v. Bock (2016)
247 Cal.App.4th 775, 793.)  The moving
party has the burden of proof on these issues. 
(Ibid.)  
            Creditors did not reasonably incur
all hours claimed for drafting this motion. 
Across various entries dated October 22, 2023, to November 9, 2023,
creditors billed 4.8 hours at $675 hourly and 5.3 hours at $750 hourly related
to drafting this motion.  (Linzer Decl.,
Ex. O.)  This motion did not reasonably
require 10.1 hours of work.  Not only is
this motion relatively simple, but also creditors already successfully recovered
postjudgment attorney fees in motions filed May 20, 2022, and September 13,
2022.  They did not need to reinvent the
wheel.  The court will reduce these fees by
2.4 hours at $675 hourly and by 2.8 hours at $750 hourly, totaling $3,720.  
            The court will also reduce the fees
creditors claimed for their anticipated work in reviewing the opposition,
drafting the reply, and attending the hearing. 
They claim a total of 10 hours at $675 hourly and 4 hours at $750
hourly.  (Linzer Decl., ¶¶ 23-24.)  Debtor’s opposition is just over three pages
long.  These tasks did not reasonably
require the fees creditors claim.  The
court will reduce them by 7 hours at $675 hourly and by 3 hours at $750 hourly,
totaling $6,975.
            Debtor’s opposition argues creditors’
bills include time spent on tasks not related to enforcing the judgment.  After reviewing the invoice from Linzer Law
Group, P.C. (Linzer Decl., Ex. O), the court finds all entries were related to
enforcing the judgment.  
            After reducing the lodestar by
$10,695 as discussed above, creditors will recover $38,212.50 in attorney fees.
Disposition
The motion is granted
in part.  The court hereby awards $38,212.50 in attorney fees to
judgment creditors Thomas Nash and Bo
Kyung O’Connor.  
The court will
modify the proposed second amended judgment to reflect the reduced amount of
attorney fees.
