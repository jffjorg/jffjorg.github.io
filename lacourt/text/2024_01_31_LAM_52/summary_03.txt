And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay action without prejudice. The defendants, Gori Company, LLC, Sky Kim, and Hyun Joong Kim, have moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff, Patrick Yi's, action. The plaintiff argues that the arbitration agreement is procedurally and substantively unconscionable.

The judge found that the plaintiff shows at most minimal procedural unconscionability, as the agreement was presented to him as a non-negotiable condition of his employment as a co-founder and CTO of Gori Company, LLC. However, the judge notes that the agreement is not an employment agreement, but rather a "Stock Restriction Agreement" that was presented to the plaintiff after he had already worked for the company for several months.

The judge also found that the plaintiff shows at most a single substantively unconscionable provision in the agreement, which requires arbitration to be conducted in Santa Clara County, even though the plaintiff lives in Orange County. However, the judge notes that this provision would be severable and that the defendants have agreed to waive it.

The judge also addressed the plaintiff's argument that the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA) prohibits enforcement of the arbitration agreement. The judge found that the EFAA applies to this case, as it relates to sexual harassment allegations, and that the defendants' argument that the EFAA only applies to arbitrations under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) is misplaced.

Finally, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the defendants may refile their motion to compel arbitration if they defeat the plaintiff's sexual harassment claim or claims before trial.
