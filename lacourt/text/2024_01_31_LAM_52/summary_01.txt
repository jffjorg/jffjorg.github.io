And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for determination of good faith settlement brought by Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, and Southern California Permanente Medical Group. The motion was based on a settlement with the plaintiffs, Catherine Pham, D.D.S. and Tuan H. Tran, in exchange for waiving a lien of $1,034,160. The judge found that Kaiser's evidence presented was insufficient to support the settlement, particularly in regards to the plaintiffs' approximate total recovery and Kaiser's proportionate liability. The judge noted that Kaiser's counsel's declarations were not substantial evidence and did not provide a reasonable basis for the settlement. The judge also denied the motion to admit James A. Frederick to appear as counsel pro hac vice for LivaNova Holding USA, Inc. and LivaNova Deutschland, GmbH.
