And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion for additional attorney fees filed by judgment creditors Thomas Nash and Bo Kyung O'Connor. The creditors are seeking an additional $48,157.50 in attorney fees incurred in enforcing the judgment against judgment debtor Ninon Aprea. The court found that the creditors' attorneys' rates of $675 and $750 hourly reflect the reasonable market value of their services. However, the court reduced the fees claimed by the creditors because it found that they did not reasonably incur all of the hours claimed for drafting the motion and reviewing the opposition. The court awarded the creditors $38,212.50 in attorney fees. The motion is granted in part, and the court will modify the proposed second amended judgment to reflect the reduced amount of attorney fees.
