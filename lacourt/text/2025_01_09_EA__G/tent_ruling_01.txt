  Case Number:  24PSCV02656    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  G Plaintiff Covenant Care California, LLC’s Application  for Default Judgment Respondent: NO OPPOSITION TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff Covenant Care California, LLC’s Application for Default Judgment is GRANTED. BACKGROUND This  is a breach of contract action arising from a healthcare services agreement. In  November 2018, Plaintiff Covenant Care California, LLC, doing business as Royal  Care Skilled Nursing Center (Royal Care), entered into an agreement with  Defendant Comprehensive Care Hospice Inc. (Comprehensive Care) in which Royal  Care agreed to provide services for a hospice patient in exchange for receiving  reimbursement from Comprehensive Care. While Royal Care allegedly provided  room, board, and skilled nursing care for the patient from January 2021 to May  2022, Comprehensive Care allegedly failed to make the required reimbursements  and now owes as outstanding amount of $52,296.44. On August  15, 2024, Royal Care filed a complaint against Comprehensive Care and Does 1-20,  alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of written contract, (2)  open book account, (3) money had and received, and (4) reasonable value of  goods and services sold and delivered. On September 17, 2024, Royal Care’s  process server served Comprehensive Care with substitute service in West Covina. On October  29, 2024, the court entered default against Comprehensive Care after they  failed to file a timely answer. On November 12, 2024, Royal Care submitted the  present application for default judgment. A case  management conference is set for January 9, 2025. LEGAL STANDARD Code  of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a  party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on  the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a  brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in  support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)  a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a  dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application  for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for  each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees  if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of  Court 3.1800.) ANALYSIS Royal  Care seeks default judgment against Comprehensive Care in the total amount of $65,111.78,  including $52,296.44 in damages, $12,223.49 in interest, and $591.85 in costs. Because  the court finds Royal Care has submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS  their application for default judgment. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Royal  Care’s application for default judgment is GRANTED.
