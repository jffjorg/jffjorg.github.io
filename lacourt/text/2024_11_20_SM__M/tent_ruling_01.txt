for Reconsideration
HEARING DATE:   11/20/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 
A non-prevailing party may make a
motion to reconsider and enter a different order under the following
conditions: (1) brought before the same judge that made the order sought to be
reconsidered; (2) made within 10 days after service upon the party of the
notice of entry of the order (extended under CCP § 1013 for type of service);
(3) based on new or different facts, circumstances or law than those before the
court at the time of the original ruling; (4) supported by a declaration
stating the previous order, by which judge it was made, and the new or
different facts, circumstances or law claimed to exist; and (5) the motion must
be made and decided before entry of judgment. (CCP, § 1008.)  
 
The legislature
intended to restrict motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a party
offers the court some fact or circumstance not previously considered and some
valid reason for not offering it earlier. (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995)
32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)¿¿Thus, “[t]o be
entitled to reconsideration, a party should show that (1) evidence of new or
different facts exist, and (2) the party has a satisfactory explanation for
failing to produce such evidence at an earlier time.” (Mink v. Superior
Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.) The moving party must demonstrate
that such newly discovered evidence could not,
with reasonable diligence, have previously discovered and produced. (Wilcox
v. Ford (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1170.) 
 
The court may also reconsider its
prior interim orders on its own motion to correct its own errors. (Le
Francoise v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1107-09.)¿ 
 
“No application
to reconsider any order or for the renewal of a previous motion may be
considered by any judge or court unless made according to this section.” (CCP §
1008(e)); see Powell v. County of Orange (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1573,
1577 [“The name of a motion is not controlling, and, regardless of the name, a
motion asking the trial court to decide the same matter previously ruled on is
a motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008.”].)
Therefore, the moving party must comply with the requirements of section 1008,
regardless of the title of the noticed motion.
 
A motion for reconsideration must be made to the same
judge. (CCP § 1008(a).) “A trial court’s discretion to reconsider
another judge’s prior ruling is necessarily narrow and usually only appropriate
when the prior judge is unavailable.” (Marriage of Oliverez (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1247.) “[O]ne trial court judge may not reconsider and overrule a
ruling by another trial court judge, unless the first judge is
unavailable.”  (Davcon, Inc. v. Roberts & Morgan (2003) 110
Cal.App.4th 1355, 1361.) 
 
Reconsideration cannot be granted
based on claims the court misinterpreted the law in its initial ruling because
this is not a “new” or “different” matter.¿ (Gilberd v. AC Transit
(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)
Analysis
 
Plaintiff Natalie Serrano moves for
reconsideration of the Court’s July 25, 2024, order granting Defendants’ motion
to compel arbitration. Plaintiff timely filed the instant motion within 10 days
of the prior order. 
 
Plaintiff argues that she did not
sign the arbitration agreement because the electronic signature is forged.
Plaintiff also wished to have a court reporter. Neither argument evidences “new”
or “different” matters which would require reversal of the prior order. First,
Plaintiff appeared at the hearing and presented the same arguments made in this
motion. Thus, it is not a new or different matter. Further, Plaintiff fails to
show that she exercised
reasonable diligence in bringing this evidence
to the Court’s attention. Plaintiff does not explain why
she failed to file a written opposition to the motion. Even if her arguments were
new matters, Plaintiff still provides no declaration stating that she did not
sign the agreement. Thus, there are no new or different circumstances presented
which justify reconsideration.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
