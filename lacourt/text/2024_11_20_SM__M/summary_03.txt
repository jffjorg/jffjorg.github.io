Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Maggi. The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the sexual assault, battery, and palimony causes of action, and sustained the demurrer as to the intentional misrepresentation cause of action with leave to amend. The judge has granted the motion to strike paragraphs 15, 16, and 17 of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) as irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. The judge has also granted the motion to strike attorneys' fees and punitive damages, but denied the motion to strike punitive damages as to the sexual assault and battery causes of action. The judge has corrected the filing date of the complaint to January 16, 2024, and has ordered that the punitive damages claim survive.
