Jaguar Land Rover North America LLC 
CASE NO.:                24SMCV00213
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   11/20/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
 If a
party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for
a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown
in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on
the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response
of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Where there has been no timely
response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand, the demanding party must
seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. Thus,
unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he
or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline
for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving
party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the
motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no
showing of "good cause" is required. 
 
Pursuant to CCP section
2033.280(b), a party may move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). “Failure to timely respond to RFA does not result in
automatic admissions. Rather, the propounder of the RFA must ‘move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction’ under §
2023.010 et seq.” (CCP, § 2033.280(b).) The court “shall” grant the motion to
deem RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP, § 2033.280(c).) 
  
ANALYSIS 
 
Plaintiff Victoria Benmoshe moves to compel
Defendant Jaguar Land Rover North America (“JLRNA”) to respond to the following
discovery: a) Request for Production of Documents, Set One; b) Form
Interrogatories, Set One; c) Special Interrogatories, Set One; and d) Requests
for Admission, Set One. Plaintiff also seeks sanctions in the amount of $7,489.20 against JLRNA and
counsel of record.
JLRNA served verified responses to Plaintiff’s discovery, including
the Requests for Admissions rendering the Motion moot. On March 19, 2024, JLRNA
served its initial responses to each of the subject discovery devices. (Cho
Decl., ¶ 3.) On October 10, 2024, JLRNA provided its verifications to its
responses to the responses. (Cho Decl., ¶4.)
While the motion is moot by the submission of substantive responses,
the issues of sanctions are not moot. In fact, the Court must
sanction any party that unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response, “unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (See, e.g., CCP, § 2030.290(c).) As the RFAs, sanctions must be imposed without
exception. (Id., §2033.280.) The record makes clear that JLRNA failed to
respond to the subject discovery until serving verifications a month after
these motions were filed. Thus, JLRNA’s discovery misconduct necessitated the
instant motion. Sanctions are therefore mandatory.
            The Court finds the requested
sanctions of $7,489.20 per motion to be unreasonable in light of the relative
simplicity of the motions and substantial overlap between the motions. As such,
the Court will impose a reasonable, total sanction of $4,306.80. 
Accordingly, the motions are MOOT. Sanctions are imposed in the
reduced total amount of $4,306.80, inclusive of costs, against JLRNA and its counsel
of record. Sanctions are to be paid within 30 days to
Plaintiff’s counsel.
