And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Benmoshe v. Jaguar Land Rover North America LLC (Case No. 24SMCV00213). The plaintiff, Victoria Benmoshe, moved to compel the defendant to respond to certain discovery requests and to impose sanctions for the defendant's failure to do so. The defendant had served verified responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, but the plaintiff argued that the defendant's failure to respond initially was sufficient to warrant sanctions.

The judge found that the defendant's failure to respond was sufficient to warrant sanctions, but reduced the amount of sanctions from the initial $7,489.20 to $4,306.80. The judge also noted that the defendant's discovery misconduct necessitated the motion and that sanctions were mandatory.

The judge ruled that the motions were moot due to the defendant's service of verified responses, but the issue of sanctions was not moot. The judge imposed sanctions on the defendant and its counsel of record in the amount of $4,306.80, payable within 30 days to the plaintiff's counsel.
