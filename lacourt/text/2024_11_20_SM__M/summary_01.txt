And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's July 25, 2024, order granting the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff argued that she did not sign the arbitration agreement because the electronic signature is forged and that she wanted a court reporter. However, the judge found that these arguments do not present "new" or "different" matters that would require reversal of the prior order. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to exercise reasonable diligence in bringing this evidence to the Court's attention and failed to provide a declaration stating that she did not sign the agreement. As a result, the motion is denied.
