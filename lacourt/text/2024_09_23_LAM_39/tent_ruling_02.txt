CASE NUMBER:


22STCV10372




MOTIONS:  


Motion to Compel Discovery Responses




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Florian Schmitz




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant Jason Muller



 
MOTION
            Plaintiff
Florian Schmitz (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel responses from Defendant Jason
Muller (“Defendant”) to a Post-Judgment Request for Production of Documents (“RPD”).  In its order of July 3, 2024, the Court
continued the motion to this date. 
However, it does not appear Defendant received notice, as such notice
was only sent to Plaintiff’s counsel and Defendant’s former counsel of record,
who was relieved as counsel and, therefore, no longer represents him.  Accordingly, the Court will continue the
motion for Plaintiff to give appropriate notice to Defendant.  
Nonetheless, if
Plaintiff demonstrates at the hearing Defendant did have notice of this hearing
date, or if Defendant waives notice, the following analysis applies.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff electronically
served the RPD on Defendant on October 23, 2023.  Defendant’s responses were thus due by November
27, 2023.  To date, Defendant has not
responded to the RPD.  Accordingly, the
motion to compel responses to the RPD is granted pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.300.  Defendant is
ordered to serve responses to Plaintiff’s RPD, without objections, within 30
days of service of this order.
Plaintiff requests
sanctions in connection with the motions. The Court finds that Defendant’s failure
to respond to the discovery is an abuse of the discovery process, and awards
sanctions.  The Court imposes sanctions against
Defendant in the amount of $2,145, which represents three hours of attorney
time to prepare the motion and attend the hearing at $695 per hour, plus the
filing fee for the motion.
