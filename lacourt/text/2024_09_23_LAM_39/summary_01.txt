And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend their pleading to add a new claim against Cross-Defendant Amit Tidhar. The motion was opposed by Tidhar, who argued that the amendment would prejudice him since he had not had the opportunity to defend against the new claims. The Judge found that the Plaintiffs had not provided sufficient evidence to support their request for leave to amend, and that the proposed amendment would prejudice Tidhar. Additionally, the Judge noted that the Plaintiffs' claims appear to be time-barred, as they did not assert their claims against Tidhar within the four-year statute of limitations. The Judge ordered the Plaintiffs to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
