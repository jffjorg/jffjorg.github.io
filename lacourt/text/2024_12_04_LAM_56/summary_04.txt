The judge has considered the motion for approval of the transfer of structured settlement payment rights from Respondent Domingo Munoz to Petitioner CBC Settlement Funding, LLC. Although no opposition papers were filed, the judge notes that the hearing was set for less than the statutorily mandated 20 days after the filing of the First Amended Petition. As a result, the judge continues the hearing to December 18, 2024, at 8:30 am, and orders Respondent to be present at the hearing. Petitioner is also ordered to give notice of this ruling.
