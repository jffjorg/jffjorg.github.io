BACKGROUND
Respondent/Transferor Domingo Munoz
(“Respondent”) entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release in 2002, which
included future periodic payments in the form of monthly payments. (First
Amended Petition, Exhibit F.)
 
On
October 11, 2024, Petitioner CBC Settlement Funding, LLC
(“Petitioner”) filed a Petition for Approval of the Transfer of Structured
Settlement Payment Rights by Respondent to Petitioner or its assignee.  
 
On
October 18, 2024, Petitioner moved for approval of the transfer of certain
structured settlement payment rights by Respondent to Petitioner or its
assignee. 
 
On November
21, 2024, Petitioner filed a First Amended Petition.  
 
All petitions for approval of structured
settlement payment rights must be filed by the transferee in the county where
the payee is residing at the time of the agreement, or if the payee is
domiciled outside of California, in the county of the settlement obligor or
annuity issuer.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (f)(1).)  All court costs and
filing fees must be paid by the transferee. 
(Id., § 10139.5, subd. (g).)  At
least 20 days before the hearing on the petition, the transferee must “file
with the court and serve on all interested parties a notice of the proposed
transfer and the petition for its authorization.”  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2).)  
 
The hearing on the instant Motion is set for December
4, 2024, which is less than the statutorily mandated 20 days after the filing
of the First Amended Petition. As such, the Court continues the hearing on the
First Amended Petition to December 18, 2024 at 8:30 am.  Respondent is ordered to be present, either
in person or virtually, at the hearing so that the Court may examine him as to
the merits of the First Amended Petition.
 


 
Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
 
        
Dated this 4th day of December 2024
