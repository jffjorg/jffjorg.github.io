BACKGROUND
             This action arises out of a dispute over money
that Defendants RVCC Intersect, LLC, Reserve Vault, LLC, Christopher L. Adams
and Nicolo James Rusconi (collectively, “Defendants”) allegedly owe to
Plaintiff Mal Bien Bar, LLC (“Plaintiff”) under a promissory note. The
currently operative first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleges: (1) breach of
promissory note; (2) breach of oral contract; and (3) conversion.
 
            On November 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Renewed Motion for Leave to Amend Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint. No opposition to the motion has been filed.
 
DISCUSSION
A
“motion for reconsideration” is provided for in section 1008, subdivision
(a).  A “renewed motion” is provided for in section 1008, subdivision (b).
(California Correctional Peace Officers Ass'n v. Virga (2010) 181
Cal.App.4th 30, 43, fn. 11; Tate v. Wilburn (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 150,
156-157.)   
 
A
motion for reconsideration seeks to modify or set aside the court’s previous
order. A renewed motion seeks the same relief that was previously denied. 
 
When
a motion has been denied in whole or in part, the moving party may apply again
for the same relief at a later time only on the following conditions: (1) the
motion must be based on “new or different facts, circumstances or law”; and (2)
the motion must be supported by declaration showing the previous order, by
which judge it was made, and what new or different facts, circumstances or law
are claimed to exist.  (CCP § 1008(b); Graham v. Hansen (1982) 128
CA3d 965, 969-970.) 
 
Unlike
a motion for reconsideration, there is no time limit under § 1008 for the
renewal of a previous motion.  (CCP § 1008(b),(e); Stephen v.
Enterprise Rent-A-Car of San Francisco (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 806,
816.) A renewal motion is proper even if the moving party concedes that
the court’s initial ruling was correct but claims that it is now erroneous in
light of changed circumstances. (Deauville Restaurant, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 843, 848.)¿ Statutory or jurisdictional
deadlines attached to the underlying motions, however, remain applicable. (See,
e.g., Kunysz v. Sandler (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1540, 1543 [motion to
renew an anti-SLAPP motion, brought nine months after the first amended
complaint was filed, was untimely because it was outside the 60-day statutory
period for filing an anti-SLAPP motion].) 
 
Plaintiff renews the motion to amend the complaint,
arguing that the Court previously denied the motion for leave to amend because it
was filed too close to the November 4, 2024 trial date. Plaintiff contends that,
since the trial date has been continued to April 21, 2025, there is now
sufficient time, and the motion for leave to amend should therefore be granted.
Plaintiff seeks to add 11 new causes of action, which constitutes a substantial
amendment. Such an amendment would require Defendants to conduct additional
discovery, necessitating more time before trial to complete discovery.  If this motion were granted and an amended
complaint were allowed to be filed, then a responsive pleading would not be due
until January 2025.  If demurrers were to
be filed, the case might not even be at issue until close to the discovery
cut-off.
 
The complaint in this matter was filed on December
19, 2019 and trial is currently set for April 21, 2025. Under CCP § 583.310, an
action must be brought to trial within five years of its filing, unless the
parties stipulate otherwise. Emergency Rule 10 extended the time to bring a
case to trial by six months, such that this matter must be brought to trial by
May 3, 2025.  As it is, the Court may not
be able to start trial as scheduled and will discuss at the time on the hearing
of this motion the need to move the trial date forward.  
 
The Court lacks discretion to continue trial beyond
the statutory deadline. Allowing these amendments would likely prejudice Defendants,
as the additional discovery required could not be accommodated within the
remaining time frame, given the Court’s inability to continue the trial date. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, the motion is DENIED. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
