POORIA NAVID, 
                        Plaintiff,
            vs.

  CASE NO.: 23STCV25545
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: PLAINTIFF’S MOTIONS
  TO COMPEL DISCOVERY RESPONSES
 
Date: June 27, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
            On October 19, 2023, Plaintiff Pooria Navid (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants
First Quality Builds LLC (“FQB”), Farshid Seyyed Hosseni (“Hosseni”)[1],
Elham Riahi Moghaddam (“Moghaddam”) and Eli Tour LLC (“Eli Tour”)
(collectively, “Defendants”).  The
complaint asserts claims for breach of contract, among others, arising from an
allegedly failed construction agreement.
 
            On April 4 and 5, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant Motions to Compel Discovery against FQB, Eli Tour, and
Moghaddam (“Present Defendants”). 
 
            On May 22, 2024, default was entered
against Present Defendants.  
DISCUSSION
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, “[t]he court may, upon motion of the
injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or
orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may,
on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void
judgment or order.”  (CCP § 473(d).)  Ministerial acts that were
performed inadvertently by a court clerk are clerical errors in nature and
within the Court’s power to correct at any time.  (People v. Mitchell
(2001) 26 Cal.4th 181, 185.)  The court has the inherent power to
reconsider its own interim orders at any time on its own motion.  (Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th
1094, 1107; Nieto v. Blue Shield of Calif. Life & Health Ins. Co. (2010)
181 Cal.App.4th 60, 73.)  
 
Here,
the Court finds that on May 22, 2024, default appears to have been entered against
Present Defendants, through inadvertence and/or clerical error.  The Court notes that Present Defendants had
previously appeared in this case by filing a Demurrer on March 21, 2024, and a
Motion to Strike on March 22, 2024.  In a
Minute Order dated May 7, 2024, the Court denied the Demurrer and overruled the
Motion to Strike.  In the order, the
Court inadvertently did not set a date for the filing of an answer.  Thus, default should not have been entered
against Present Defendants. 
 
Therefore,
the Court, on its own motion, strikes the default entered against Present Defendants.  Present Defendants shall have 30 days from
the date of this Order to answer the complaint.
 
The
hearing on the Motions to Compel Discovery filed by Plaintiff, currently set
for June 27, 2024, is hereby vacated and continued to August 26, 2024.  Present Defendants may file oppositions to
the Motions to Compel Discovery after they have filed their Answers to the
Complaint and according to Code.  A reply
may be filed by Plaintiff according to Code.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
 
Dated this 27th day of June 2024
