MOTION
 
This case arises from a dispute over the sale and ownership of real
property.  Defendant DH Distribution (“DH”) is a California Corporation, and owner
of the title to the subject property.  The
principal of DH, Defendant Sergey Menshikov (“Sergey”) currently resides in
Russia with his daughter, Defendant Lucy Menshikova (“Lucy”).  Sergey’s daughter, Defendant Larissa
Menshikova (“Larissa”) resides in Los Angeles and has acted as agent for Sergey
and/or DH in managing and controlling the property.  (DH, Sergey, Lucy, and Larissa together, “DH
Defendants.”)
 
Defendant Fred Behfarin (“Behfarin”) was a prospective purchaser of
the property.  Behfarin has sued DH,
Sergey, Lucy, Larisa, and Beverly Hills Escrow in related case 23STCV00692 to
enforce a contract for him to purchase the property for $1,400,000.  In connection with that action, Behfarin
recorded a lis pendens against the property and a Deed of Trust, securing a
Note in the amount of $665,000 in connection with the sale that fell
through.  Behfarin also recorded a
Memorandum of Agreement.  
 
Plaintiffs State of California (“State”) and City of West Hollywood (“City”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) assert an interest in ensuring that vacant
properties, such as the subject property, are maintained in accordance with
state and local laws preventing nuisances or threats the public’s health and
safety.
 
On October 6, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ request to appoint Receiver
Blake Alsbrook (“Receiver”) on the grounds that Defendants lack the ability to
preserve and manage the subject property, Plaintiffs had already exhausted all
lesser remedies without success, and the subject property continued to
deteriorate and pose an ongoing health and safety threat to the public during
the pendency of the related cases.  (See October
6, 2023 Minute Order.)  On November 16,
2023, the Court appointed the Receiver to take possession and control of the subject
property.
 
On February 9, 2024, the Court entered an order authorizing Receiver
to (1) first offer Behfarin Specific Performance to purchase the subject
property for $1,400,000; and (2) if Behfarin fails to timely perform, to hire a
broker to market and sell the subject property to the highest bidder on the
open market, with the sale subject to the final approval of the Court.  (See Order Authorizing Receiver to Sell
Receivership Real Property, February 9, 2024.)
 
In June 2024, finding that Behfarin failed to specifically perform the
agreement and purchase the subject property for the agreed-upon $1,400,000, the
Court entered an order authorizing Receiver to sell the property to a third
party for $2,090,000.  (See Order, June
21, 2024.)
 
Receiver now moves for an order:
 
(1)  
Approving and settling Receiver’s final report and
account
 
(2)  
Approving and Settling Final Compensation and
Reimbursement Costs for Receiver and Receiver’s professionals
 
(3)  
Exonerating Receiver’s Bond
 
(4)  
Terminating Receivership and Discharging Receiver from
any further duties or responsibilities
 
(5)  
Retaining Jurisdiction over any matters or claims
concerning the receivership
 
(6)  
Authorizing Receiver to discard all files and records
regarding the receivership without shredding them; and
 
(7)  
For such other orders as the Court deems proper
 
Behfarin and the DH Defendants separately respond to the Receiver’s
motion and Receiver replies.
 
ANALYSIS
 
            In support of the motion, Receiver
has provided the Declaration of Blake C. Alsbrook, informing the Court that the
nuisance structures on the property have been demolished and the property was
sold at an overbidding auction in June to a third party for $2,090,000.  (Alsbrook Decl. ¶¶ 18-19; 21-22.)  
 
            In July 2024, Behfarin filed a
Petition for Writ of Mandate challenging the Court’s Order expunging Behfarin’s
Lis Pendens, which was ultimately unsuccessful. 
(Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 20.) 
Escrow closed in or about September 2024, and the Receiver’s staff
removed the security fence on the property and provided the new owner’s contact
information to the City for future correspondence.  (Id. at ¶¶ 24-26.)
 
            The current balance of the
receivership bank account was $1,466,414.54 as of November 20, 2024.  (Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 32.)
 
            Receiver has also provided billing
statements for costs and fees incurred, indicating $9,021.02 is still due and
owing.  In addition, DH Distribution
submitted a claim for invoices for the payment of a professional security guard
on the property prior to the receivership period in the amount of $49,255
(Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 33 and Ex. 5) and the City seeks $30,030 for its attorneys’
fees incurred in this action (Id. at ¶ 34), neither of which the
Receiver opposes.  The City has also
submitted the Declaration of William Litvak substantiating the requested
$30,030.
 
            Receiver requests that the Court
permit the disbursement from the receivership funds the $9,021.02 to Receiver
for outstanding fees and costs; the $49,255 to DH for security of the subject
property; and the $30,030 to City for attorneys’ fees.  (Alsbrook Decl. ¶ 36.)  As for the remainder of the funds, the
Receiver requests instructions.
 
            Behfarin responds that he is
entitled to $1,010,237.92 from the sale, by virtue of his claims in the related
case, and therefore requests that this amount be disbursed to him.
 
            The DH Defendants also respond,
requesting that the balance of funds be deposited with the Court pending the
resolution of the related case on the merits. 

 
            No party objects to or opposes the
Receiver’s accounting or the disbursement of $9,021.02 to the Receiver, $49,255
for DH Distribution’s professional security guard, or the City’s $30,030 in
attorneys’ fees.  
 
            In Reply, the Receiver merely
reiterates Behfarin’s and the DH Defendants’ positions, and declines to opine
on the appropriate disbursement instructions for the remainder of the funds.
 
            Because the Receiver has supported
its request for the above disbursements of $9,021.02, $49,255, and $30,030, and
no party has opposed or objected to these disbursements, the Court approves
them.
 
            Regarding the remainder of the
funds, in light of the fact that Behfarin and the DH Defendants are involved in
the related litigation concerning the funds at issue, the Court agrees with the
DH Defendants that the appropriate course of action is to deposit the funds
with the Court pending the resolution of related action.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore the Court grants Receiver’s motion in its entirety.  In addition, the Court orders the Receiver to
deposit forthwith with the Clerk of the Court the remainder of the receivership
funds in the related action, 23STCV00692, pending resolution.  
 
Receiver shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
