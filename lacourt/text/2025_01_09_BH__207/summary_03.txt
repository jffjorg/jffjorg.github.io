And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for April 7, 2025. The motion was unopposed, but the judge found no good cause to grant another continuance of the trial. The plaintiff had requested a continuance because the defendants had not responded to their discovery requests, but the judge found that the plaintiff had not made diligent efforts to obtain the requested discovery. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's counsel had failed to timely and diligently conduct routine non-expert discovery and file the appropriate discovery motions. As a result, the judge concluded that the plaintiff's inability to obtain the requested discovery was not excused and that a continuance was not warranted. The judge's ruling is tentative, meaning that it is subject to change after further consideration.
