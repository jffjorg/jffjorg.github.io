BACKGROUND:
 
        On September 9, 2020, Plaintiff Maira
Benhumea filed her Complaint against Defendants Baronhr West, Inc., Spectrum
Packaging, Inc., and Cristobal Lorenzo on causes of action arising from Plaintiff’s
employment by Defendants. 
 
        On September 16, 2020, Plaintiff filed
her First Amended Complaint. 
 
        On October 8, 2020, by request of
Plaintiff, the Clerk’s Office dismissed without prejudice Defendant Spectrum
Packaging, Inc. from the First Amended Complaint. 
 
        On March 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed her
Second Amended Complaint. 
 
        On September 29, 2022, by request of
Plaintiff, the Clerk’s Office entered default without prejudice on Packtown,
Inc. and Cristobal Lorenzo. 
 
        On October 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed
Judicial Council Form CM-200, Notice of Settlement of Entire Case. 
 
        On October 4, 2022, the Court ordered
the Second Amended Complaint dismissed with prejudice. The Court retained
jurisdiction to make orders to enforce any and all terms of settlement,
including judgment, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
 
        On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed
her Motion to Enforce Settlement Pursuant to C.C.P. Section 664.6 (“Motion to
Enforce Settlement”). In support of her Motion to Enforce Settlement, Plaintiff
concurrently filed her Proposed Order. 
 
        No opposition or other response has been
filed to the Motion to Enforce Settlement.
        
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)
 
“Section 664.6 was enacted to provide a
summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without the
need for a new lawsuit.” (Weddington Prod., Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th
793, 809.) In deciding motions made under Section 664.6, judges “must determine
whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.” (Kohn v.
Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
 
II.       Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to enter
judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant Baronhr West, Inc. for damages
of $10,923.87, attorney’s fees of $2,475.00 (4.5 hours at $550.00 per hour),
and costs of $60.00. (Motion to Enforce Settlement, p. 5:9–11.) Plaintiff
provides the Court with a copy of the agreement. (Id. at Exh. A.)
 
Defendant has not opposed the
Motion. 
 
The Court determines that the
Parties entered into a valid and binding settlement. The Court shall enter
judgment that will conform with the written settlement agreement. 
 
        The hourly rate
and costs requested are reasonable, but the number of hours spent claimed is
too high; since there was no opposition filed, Plaintiff’s counsel did not
spend the anticipated 1.5 hours to review the opposition. The Court will award three
hours of work at the hourly rate requested, plus costs for a total of $1,710.00
in attorney's fees and costs.  
 
III.     Conclusion 
 
The Motion is GRANTED. Monetary
sanctions are AWARDED in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount
of $ 12,633.87. 
 
Moving party is to prepare judgment.
