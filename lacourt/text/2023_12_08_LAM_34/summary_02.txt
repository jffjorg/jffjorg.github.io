And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the petition for approval of compromise of claim or action and the motion for determination of good faith settlement. The judge has granted the petition with the change that no attorney's fees or costs are to be subtracted from the $5,000.00 awarded to each of the minor plaintiffs. The judge has also denied the motion for determination of good faith settlement, finding that it is not necessary since there is only one defendant and the settlement agreement precludes further actions against the current owner of the building.
