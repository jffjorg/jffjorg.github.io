And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a continuation of the Final Status Conference (FSC) and the trial, which were previously set for December 7, 2023. The parties have failed to comply with the court's orders regarding the filing of revised joint trial documents, including the joint exhibit list and witness list. As a result, the parties are ordered to appear in court on December 11, 2023, and show cause why they should not be ordered to pay monetary sanctions of at least $500 for failure to comply with the court's orders. The parties are also ordered to file declarations setting forth their efforts to prepare revised joint trial documents and explaining why those efforts have not resulted in the filing of all required joint trial documents. The trial is continued to December 11, 2023, at 9:30 am, and all parties must appear in person in Department 26.
