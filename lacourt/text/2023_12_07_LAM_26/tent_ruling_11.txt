If proof of service has not been filed at that time, then no later than five days before the OSC hearing, Plaintiff’s Counsel is also to file a declaration explaining the failure to file proofs of service of the summons and complaint as to all unserved defendants and explaining any and all efforts undertaken to attempt service of the summons and complaint on all named defendants.
