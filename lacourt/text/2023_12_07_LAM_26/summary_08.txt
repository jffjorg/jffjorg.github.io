And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has continued the Final Status Conference (FSC) to December 11, 2023, and ordered all parties to appear in person to show cause why sanctions, including monetary sanctions, dismissal of the complaint, striking of the answer, or exclusion of unidentified non-impeachment exhibits or witnesses should not be imposed for failure to comply with the court's orders. The parties have failed to comply with the court's previous orders, including the failure to file revised joint exhibit lists, joint witness lists, and trial briefs. The judge has reissued a new order requiring the parties to complete their exchange of non-impeachment exhibits and file a revised joint exhibit list, revised joint witness list, and trial brief by December 8, 2023. The parties are also ordered to file declarations explaining their efforts to prepare the required documents and why those efforts failed. The judge has warned that failure to comply with the court's orders may result in exclusion at trial of non-impeachment exhibits and witnesses.
