And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing date from December 7, 2023 to February 2, 2024 at 8:30 am. The Plaintiff has failed to comply with the Court's October 17, 2023 order to seek and obtain default from defendants who have not responded. The Plaintiff has filed proof of service of the Summons and Complaint, but has not filed a declaration explaining their failure to do so. The Court orders Plaintiff's Counsel to appear on February 2, 2024 and explain why sanctions, including monetary sanctions of at least $500 and/or dismissal, should not be imposed for failure to cause entry of default. If defaults have not all been entered by the hearing date, the Plaintiff's Counsel must file a declaration explaining their failure to obtain entry of defaults and any efforts undertaken to seek them. Failure to appear at the next hearing will be deemed consent to dismiss the entire case.
