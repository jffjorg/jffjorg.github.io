And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling continues the OSC re proof of service set for December 7, 2023 to February 2, 2024 at 8:30 am. The Plaintiff has failed to comply with the Court's October 23, 2023 minute order to file proof of service of the Summons and Complaint on defendant Maria Marmolejo, and has also failed to file a declaration explaining its failure to do so. The Judge orders Plaintiff's Counsel to appear on February 2, 2024 at 8:30 am to explain why sanctions, including monetary sanctions of at least $500 and/or dismissal, should not be imposed for failure to file proof of service. The Judge also requires Plaintiff's Counsel to file a declaration explaining the failure to file proofs of service on all unserved defendants and any efforts undertaken to attempt service. If the Plaintiff fails to appear at the next hearing, it will be deemed to have consented to dismiss the entire case.
