And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the status conference previously set for December 7, 2023, to February 26, 2024. The court strongly encourages the parties to engage in mediation if they are willing. The judge has also continued the Order to Show Cause (OSC) for the dismissal of all unnamed defendants and cross-defendants, including the unnamed Does and Roes, to February 26, 2024. Any party opposing the dismissal of these unnamed defendants and cross-defendants must file a written opposition at least 10 days before the OSC and appear at the hearing to show cause why they should not be dismissed. Failure to appear at the OSC will result in the dismissal of these unnamed defendants and cross-defendants. The Further Settlement Conference (FSC) remains set for February 26, 2024, and the trial remains firmly set for March 11, 2024. The court's judicial assistant will notify all parties electronically.
