The Judge has ordered Plaintiff's Counsel to appear on February 6, 2024, to explain why sanctions, including monetary sanctions of at least $500 and/or dismissal, should not be imposed for this failure. Additionally, Plaintiff's Counsel must file a declaration explaining the failure to file proofs of service and any efforts undertaken to attempt service on all named defendants.

The Judge has also ordered Plaintiff's Counsel to explain why sanctions should not be imposed for failure to cause entry of default as to all served defendants who have not responded, including The Madera Group LLC and Tosh Berman. If defaults have not been entered, Plaintiff's Counsel must file a declaration explaining the failure and any efforts undertaken to seek their defaults.
