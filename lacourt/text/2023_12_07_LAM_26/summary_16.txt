And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to continue the Final Status Conference set for December 7, 2023 to December 11, 2023 at 8:30 am. This decision comes after the Defendant filed a Notice of Stay of Proceedings, attaching a Notice of Bankruptcy Case Filing involving Judgment Debtor David Eun Kang on December 6, 2023. The Court has determined that the automatic stay of proceedings triggered by the bankruptcy filing must be lifted by seeking leave from the bankruptcy court. As a result, the Judge has set an OSC re stay of the action for December 11, 2023 at 8:30 am, requiring any party opposing the automatic stay to file and serve briefing explaining why the stay should not be imposed, and to appear in court to show cause why the stay should not be imposed.
