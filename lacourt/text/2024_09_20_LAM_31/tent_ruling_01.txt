MOTION
TO SET ASIDE ORDER



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Ehab Atallah
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Emil
Hakim
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On April 4, 2022, Plaintiff, Emil Hakim, filed a Complaint
against Defendant, Ehab Atallah, arising from the parties’ written agreements for
Defendant to purchase Plaintiff’s properties. 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant engaged in an elaborate scheme to
defraud Plaintiff of $6,800,000.  Pursuant to the forum selection clause in the
agreements, Plaintiff’s claims proceeded in arbitration in Egypt.  
 
            On April
27, 2022, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss for Forum Non Conveniens (“Motion
to Dismiss”).  The court continued the Motion
to Dismiss on several occasions to allow for the arbitration proceedings in
Egypt to be completed.  By mid-2023, the
arbitration proceedings had concluded in Defendant’s favor.  Plaintiff appealed the arbitral awards, which
the Court of Appeal in Egypt rejected.
 
            On September
27, 2023, this court granted Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.  The action was dismissed on October 6, 2023.
 
Other Actions   
 
            On February
13, 2024, Defendant filed a Petition to Confirm the Foreign Arbitration Awards
Pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207 in Case No. 24STCP0447.  The motion was heard on May 3, 2024 and taken
under submission.  On May 6, 2024, the
court (Fruin, J.) in Case No. 24STCP0447 issued its final order granting the
Petition and entered judgment in Defendant’s favor.  The court served notice of the ruling on May
16, 2024.  Plaintiff filed a motion for
reconsideration of Judge Fruin’s May 6, 2024, order.  The motion for reconsideration was scheduled
for August 12, 2024.
 
            Motion
to Set Aside the September 27, 2023 Order
 
            On March 27,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion
to Set Aside this court’s September 27, 2023, order under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b).  
 
The Motion to Set Aside was heard on August 6, 2024.  The court issued an order in advance of the
hearing stating an inclination to deny the Motion to Set Aside.  However, because Plaintiff filed a motion for
reconsideration in Case No. 24STCP0447 which had not been heard prior to the
August 6, 2024, hearing, the court continued this matter to allow resolution of
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration.
 
            On August
16, 2024, Defendant filed a notice indicating Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration was denied on August 12, 2024.
 
            The court
now adopts its previously issued tentative ruling as the final order of the
court.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b) provides that a court may “relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.”  In addition, a court
must vacate a default or dismissal when a motion for relief under Section 473,
subdivision (b) is filed timely and accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect “unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact
caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)   
 
The party or the legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than six months had elapsed from the
entry of default, and hence relief under section 473 was unavailable”]; People
v. The North River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 712, 721 [motion for
relief under section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months”].)   
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
A.   
Judicial Notice
 
Defendant requests judicial notice of eleven documents.  The unopposed request is GRANTED.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d)(1).)
 
B.    
Application 
 
Plaintiff seeks mandatory relief to vacate the court’s
September 27, 2023 order on the following grounds: (1) Plaintiff’s counsel did
not provide evidence in advance of the September 27, 2023 hearing for
Defendant’s motion to dismiss showing that the arbitral proceedings had not
been completed, (2) the failure to provide evidence of ongoing arbitration in
Egypt supported the court’s September 27, 2023 order granting Defendant’s
motion to dismiss, (3) the failure was due to Plaintiff’s counsel’s mistake or excusable
neglect, and (4) this motion was timely filed within 6 months of the order.  (See Declaration of Thomas M. Bundy.)  For these reasons, Plaintiff argues the court
must set aside the September 27, 2023 order.
 
In opposition, Defendant argues the motion should be denied
because Plaintiff has not offered evidence of Plaintiff’s counsel’s mistake.  Further, the court considered Plaintiff’s
argument that the arbitration proceedings were ongoing at oral argument and
still dismissed the action.
 
Plaintiff is not entitled to an order setting aside this
court’s September 27, 2023, order  for three
reasons.   First, the court considered Plaintiff’s
argument at the September 27, 2023 hearing, that the arbitration was
ongoing.  (See Declaration of Daniel L.
Germaine, Ex. L, pp. 11-12.)  The court
adopted its tentative ruling which found, based on Defendant’s supplemental
declarations, that the arbitration proceedings were completed.  In essence, Plaintiff seeks reconsideration
of the court’s September 27, 2023. 
However, the time for filing a motion for reconsideration has long
passed.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd.
(a).)  
 
Second, Plaintiff’s counsel does not show the court’s
September 27, 2023 order was entered because of counsel’s excusable neglect or
mistake. Plaintiff’s counsel states in his declaration: “I failed to file
evidence that the arbitration proceedings in Egypt were not completed. That
failure was excusable because by the time of the September 27, 2023, hearing,
the next hearing date in Egypt had not yet been set.”  (Bundy Decl., ¶ 5.)  Far from describing a failure to present
evidence due to mistake or neglect, Plaintiff’s counsel makes clear there was
no evidence the arbitration proceedings were ongoing which could have been
presented to the court at the time of the September 27, 2023 hearing.   
 
Third, Defendant has already obtained an order from Judge
Fruin in a separately filed action (Case No. 24STCP0447) confirming the arbitral
awards.  (See Minute Order, 5/16/24, Case
No. 24STCP0447.)  Plaintiff moved for
reconsideration of the May 16, 2024, order, which Judge Fruin denied on August
12, 2024.  Therefore, the instant Motion
to Set Aside is moot.   
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Motion to Set Aside Order is DENIED.  
  
Defendant to give notice.
 
 
Dated:   September 20,
2024
