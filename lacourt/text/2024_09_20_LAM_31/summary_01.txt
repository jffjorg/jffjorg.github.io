And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Kerry Bensinger has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the September 27, 2023 order granting the Defendant's motion to dismiss. The Plaintiff argues that the court's order was entered due to the Plaintiff's counsel's mistake or excusable neglect in failing to provide evidence that the arbitration proceedings in Egypt were ongoing at the time of the hearing. However, the judge finds that the Plaintiff's counsel does not show that the court's order was entered because of counsel's mistake or neglect, but rather because the court considered the Plaintiff's argument at the September 27, 2023 hearing that the arbitration was ongoing. Additionally, the judge finds that the motion to set aside is moot due to the denial of the Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration in a separately filed action.
