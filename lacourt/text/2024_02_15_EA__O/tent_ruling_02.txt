[1] As the SAC’s only change was naming Daniel Munoz as a
plaintiff, the court informed the parties they need not file new motions/papers
as to the SAC. 
 


[2] Should Plaintiff seek to maintain the willful
misconduct COA, leave to amend is DENIED as Plaintiff has not cured the defect
despite previous leave to amend and plaintiff failed to meet and confer prior
to the filing of this demurrer.
