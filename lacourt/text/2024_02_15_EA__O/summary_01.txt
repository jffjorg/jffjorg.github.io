```
Case Number: 23PSCV00365
Hearing Date: February 15, 2024
Dept: O

Judge's Ruling:
  - DEFENDANT HUSSEIN ABIDALI's demurrer to the third amended complaint is SUSTAINED with leave to amend, changing the cause of action from willful misconduct to battery.
  - DEFENDANT HUSSEIN ABIDALI's motion to strike portions of the third amended complaint is GRANTED without leave to amend.

Background:
  - Plaintiff EVANGELINE MUNOZ (decedent) and her successor-in-interest, Jenny Macias, brought suit against defendants Casa Colina Hospital, Casa Colina Hospital & Centers for Healthcare, Casa Colina, Inc., Jalal Badday, M.D., and Hussein Abidali, D.O.

Facts:
  - Ms. Munoz was a resident at Casa Colina from March 27, 2022, to April 22, 2022, where she underwent a G-tube placement surgery.
  - The surgery was performed by Dr. Abidali, who failed to receive informed consent from Ms. Munoz or her representative.
  - Ms. Munoz suffered from a urinary tract infection, depression, and a lack of appetite, and was prescribed medication that severely reduced her appetite.
  - Dr. Abidali performed the G-tube placement, which was later determined to be improperly placed, leading to an infection and at least one additional stroke.

Legal Standard:
  - A demurrer may be asserted on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

Discussion:
  - The court previously sustained a demurrer to the first amended complaint, finding that an unsuccessful surgery is a medical negligence cause of action, not one of willful misconduct.
  - The court now sustains the demurrer to the third amended complaint, finding that the allegations of willful misconduct are insufficient to state a cause of action.

Intention:
  - The intention of the court is to sustain the demurrer and grant the motion to strike, with leave to amend for the sole purpose of modifying the cause of action from willful misconduct to battery.

Money:
  - The court does not award any money damages in this ruling.
