  Case No.:  23STCV12304
  Hearing Date:  January 6, 2025
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff Ava
Welsing-Kitcher filed this action against Defendants Karplus Warehouse, Inc.
and The Western Surety Company, asserting claims arising from Plaintiff’s
purchase of a Hyundai vehicle. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint on July 31, 2023. 
            On January 4, 2024, the Court
ordered the matter to arbitration pursuant to the parties’ stipulation. On May
31, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to withdraw from arbitration.
            On November 18, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to compel Defendant Karplus to respond to form
interrogatories. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
DISCUSSION 
            Plaintiff served the subject form
interrogatories on July 22, 2024. (Ratliff Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant did not serve
responses by the deadline of August 23, 2024. (Id., ¶ 3.) Defendant did
not respond to two follow-up emails from Plaintiff in September 2024. (Id.,
¶¶ 4-7.) Defendant has not provided any responses to the FROGs to date. (Id.,
¶ 8.) 
            These facts demonstrate that
Defendant has failed to respond to duly served discovery. Thus, an order
compelling compliance is warranted. Sanctions are also warranted as Defendant
has provided no substantial justification for its failure to respond. Plaintiff
reasonably claims $305 per hour for 2.5 hours, plus a $60 filing fee. (See
Ratliff Decl. ¶ 9.) Thus, the Court awards sanctions of $822.50.
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel
responses is GRANTED. Defendant Karplus Warehouse, Inc. shall serve responses
to the subject form interrogatories within 15 days of this order. The Court
sanctions Defendant in the amount of $822.50, to be paid within 30 days of this
order.
