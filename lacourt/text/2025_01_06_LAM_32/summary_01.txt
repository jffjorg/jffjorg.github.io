And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to add Donald Bolin and Southcoast Financial, LLC as judgment debtors. The plaintiff seeks to amend the judgment to add these individuals as judgment debtors because they were virtually represented in and controlled the underlying litigation. The evidence shows that Donald Bolin commingled his assets with 10979 Chalon, LLC and used its funds for personal use. 10979 Chalon, LLC's account had only $150,000 in it, and Southcoast Financial, LLC profited from selling a property for $26,000,000. The judge finds that adding Mr. Bolin and Southcoast Financial, LLC as judgment debtors is justified because they were virtually represented in and controlled the litigation, and an inequitable result would follow if they were not treated as judgment debtors. The judge also rejects the defendant's contention that the procedure for adding judgment debtors under Code of Civil Procedure section 187 requires amending the complaint and serving summons on the new parties.
