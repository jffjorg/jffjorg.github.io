And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Kevin Massengale against Tangular Gray, David Kilgore, and others. The lawsuit alleges eight causes of action, including deprivation of constitutional rights, unlawful contract, and fraud. David Kilgore, one of the defendants, filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that it is unclear and fails to state a cause of action. The judge agrees with Kilgore and sustains his demurrer without leave to amend. The judge finds that the complaint is incomprehensible and lacks facts supporting the allegations. Additionally, the complaint fails to comply with the government claims requirement, which requires a written claim to be filed with the public entity and denied before a lawsuit can be filed. The judge concludes that the complaint is subject to demurrer for uncertainty and failure to state a cause of action.
