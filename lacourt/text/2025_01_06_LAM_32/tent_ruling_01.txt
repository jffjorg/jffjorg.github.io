     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiffs’ motion to amend judgment 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 28, 2021, Plaintiffs Ignite
International, Ltd. and Ignite International Brands, Ltd. filed this action for
breach of contract against Defendant 10979 Chalon, LLC. Plaintiffs sued to
recover amounts due under a settlement agreement between the parties. 
            After a bench trial from March 5 to
7, 2024, the Court found for Plaintiffs. On April 11, 2024, the Court granted
judgment for Plaintiffs in the amount of $2.5 million. After awarding
attorney’s fees and costs, the Court issued an amended judgment on August 7,
2024 in the amount of $2,741,208.74.  
            On October 31, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed the instant ex parte application to amend the judgment to add Donald
Bolin and Southcoast Financial LLC as judgment debtors. Defendant filed its
opposition on December 23, 2024. Plaintiffs filed their reply on December 23,
2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“When jurisdiction is, by the Constitution
or this Code, or by any other statute, conferred on a Court or judicial
officer, all the means necessary to carry it into effect are also given; and in
the exercise of this jurisdiction, if the course of proceeding be not
specifically pointed out by this Code or the statute, any suitable process or
mode of proceeding may be adopted which may appear most conformable to the
spirit of this Code.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 187.) 
“Pursuant to section 187, a trial court
has jurisdiction to modify a judgment to add additional judgment debtors.” (McClellan
v. Northridge Park Townhome Owners Ass'n (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 746, 752.) “Judgments
are often amended to add additional judgment debtors on the grounds that a
person or entity is the alter ego of the original judgment debtor.” (NEC
Electronics Inc. v. Hurt (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 772, 778.) “This is an
equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending the
judgment to add a new defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the
real defendant.” (Ibid.) 
“In order to prevail in a motion to add
judgment debtors, [the moving party] must show that (1) the parties to be added
as judgment debtors had control of the underlying litigation and were virtually
represented in that proceeding; (2) there is such a unity of interest and
ownership that the separate personalities of the entity and the owners no
longer exist; and (3) an inequitable result will follow if the acts are treated
as those of the entity alone.” (Relentless Air Racing, LLC v. Airborne
Turbine Ltd. Partnership (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 811, 815-16.) “In addition,
even if all the formal elements necessary to establish alter ego liability are
not present, an unnamed party may be included as a judgment debtor if ‘the
equities overwhelmingly favor’ the amendment and it is necessary to prevent an
injustice.” (Carolina Casualty Ins. Co. v. L.M. Ross Law Group, LLP (2012)
212 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1188-1189.)  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
seeks to establish Mr. Bolin as the alter ego of Defendant because Mr. Bolin
commingled his assets with Defendant and used Defendant’s funds for personal
use. Mr. Bolin acknowledged transferring $2.1 million from the account for
10979 Chalon in February 2024, one month before trial, though he testified that
he could not remember why he did so. (Plntf.’s Ex. 4 (Transcript of 10/16/24
Debtor Exam) at 63:8-17; Ex. 6 (Wells Fargo Stmt. for February 2024) at p. 3.)
In particular, there was a $1.9 million transfer on February 9, 2024 directly
to an account for Donald Bolin. (Ex. 6 at p. 2.) Mr. Bolin has charged the
10979 Chalon account for meals, trips, tuition, and health insurance. (Ex. 4 at
pp. 55, 71-73, 81-86.) Mr. Bolin was Defendant’s representative at deposition
and at trial.  
            On April 3, 2024, the subject
property was transferred from Defendant 10979 Chalon to Southcoast Financial
LLC. (Plntf.’s Ex. 8 (Property Report as of 10/11/24) at p. 12.) Mr. Bolin is
the sole manager of Southcoast Financial. (Ex. 9 (Articles of Organization);
Ex. 10 (Stmt. of Information).) In June 2024, Southcoast Financial deposited
$140,000 to 10979 Chalon, and Mr. Bolin testified that he “borrow[s] money from
that entity so [he] can keep this operation running.” (Ex. 4 at 74:22-75:4.) On
July 31, 2024, Southcoast Financial sold the subject property to EDUD Investments
for $26,000,000, with Mr. Bolin signing the grant deed. (Plntf.’s Ex. 8 at p.
1; Ex. 11.)  
            These facts show that there is no
separateness between 10979 Chalon, Mr. Bolin, and Southcoast Financial. They
additionally show that Mr. Bolin and Southcoast Financial were virtually
represented in and controlled the litigation. Similar facts supported adding
individuals and their companies as judgment debtors in Relentless Air.
(See Relentless Air, supra, 222 Cal.App.4th at pp. 813-15.) Plaintiff
cannot collect the full judgment from 10979 Chalon because the bank account for
10979 Chalon only has $150,000 in it. (Plntf.’s Ex. 7.) Southcoast Financial,
Mr. Bolin’s company, is the one that profited from selling the property for
$26,000,000. Therefore, an inequitable result would follow if 10979 Chalon were
treated as the sole judgment debtor. Under these circumstances, equity warrants
adding Mr. Bolin and Southcoast Financial as judgment debtors.
            In opposing the motion, Defendant
does not dispute any of the facts established by the above record. Instead,
Defendant contends that the motion is procedurally defective because Mr. Bolin
and Southcoast Financial are not parties to the action and have not been served
with summons. Defendant cites no authority suggesting that the procedure of
adding judgment debtors under Code of Civil Procedure section 187 requires
amending the complaint to add new parties and serving summons to the new
parties. To the contrary, this process is premised on the principle that the
court is “not amending the judgment to add a new defendant but is merely
inserting the correct name of the real defendant.” (NEC Electronics, supra,
208 Cal.App.3d at p. 778.) Doing so is justified not because the new judgment
debtors are added to the complaint and served with summons, but because “it can
be demonstrated that in their capacity as alter ego of the [judgment debtor]
they in fact had control of the previous litigation, and thus were virtually
represented in the lawsuit.” (Ibid.) Again, Defendant does not dispute
that Plaintiff’s evidence satisfies this requirement.    
            At the original hearing date of
November 18, 2024, the Court continued the motion because proper service had
not been demonstrated on both Mr. Bolin and Southcoast Financial. The Court
ordered personal service to be effectuated by November 20, 2024 and imposed new
deadlines for an opposition and reply.[1]
Defendant now acknowledges that “Donald Bolin and Southcoast Financial LLC have
been notified of this motion.” (Opp. 2:22-23.) Yet, Defendant chose not to
oppose the substance of the motion. The due process concerns have been
addressed through proper service of the motion and through undisputed evidence
establishing Mr. Bolin and Southcoast Financial as alter egos. Defendant cites
no authority for its proposition that the Section 187 procedure additionally
requires amending the complaint and serving summons.
            Based on the undisputed facts in the
record, the Court finds that Mr. Bolin and Southcoast Financial should be added
as judgment debtors.
 
 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to add Donald
Bolin and Southcoast Financial, LLC as judgment debtors is GRANTED.
