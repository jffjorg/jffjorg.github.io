     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant david kilgore’s demurrer to second
  amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 10, 2024, Plaintiff Kevin
Massengale filed this action against Defendants Tangular Gray, David Kilgore,
Lorraine Jimenez, and Analu Fernandini. Plaintiff filed the operative Second
Amended Complaint on October 24, 2024, adding Xavier Becerra as a defendant.
The SAC alleges eight “counts,” or causes of action: (1) deprivation of
constitutional rights; (2) unlawful contract; (3) fraud and deceptive business
practices; (4) breach of contract; (5) false or misleading misrepresentations;
(6) involuntary servitude; (7) violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1503(a); and (8)
defamation.   
            On November 27, 2024, Defendant
Kilgore filed the instant demurrer to the SAC. Plaintiff filed his opposition
on December 10, 2024. Defendant filed his reply on December 13, 2024. Plaintiff
filed an unauthorized sur-reply on December 23, 2024, which will not be
considered.    
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer
requirement. (See Jedrzejek Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Uncertainty
            A complaint is subject to demurrer “if
the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.”
(A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th
677, 695.) 
            In the SAC, Plaintiff appears to
take issue with a paternity finding and child support obligation imposed by the
“Title IV-D Agency.” However, the complaint is incomprehensible and contains no
facts supporting any of the eight causes of action. In particular, no facts are
alleged pertaining to moving defendant Kilgore, the director of the Department
of Child Support Services.      
            Therefore, the SAC is subject to
demurrer for uncertainty and for failing to state facts constituting a cause of
action. Plaintiff’s opposition makes no attempt to demonstrate how this
deficiency can be cured by amendment.   
II.
Government Claim
Under the Tort Claims Act, “no person may
sue a public entity or public employee for ‘money or damages’ unless a timely
written claim has been presented to and denied by the public entity.” (County
of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1267; Gov.
Code, § 945.4.) A plaintiff must file a lawsuit within six months after notice
of the board’s action on their claim. (Gov. Code, § 945.6.) “[F]ailure to
allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim presentation
requirement subjects a claim against a public entity to a demurrer for failure
to state a cause of action.” (Lowry v. Port San Luis Harbor Dist. (2020)
56 Cal.App.5th 211, 218.) 
The SAC contains no allegations
demonstrating compliance with the government claims requirement, and Plaintiff
makes no attempt to address this defect in his opposition. Therefore, the SAC
is subject to demurrer for this independent reason.   
CONCLUSION
            Defendant David Kilgore’s demurrer
is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
