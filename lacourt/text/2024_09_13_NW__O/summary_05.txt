And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding the plaintiff's third cause of action for negligent entrustment. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants, Helen Galper and Mark Galper, were negligent in their operation of a vehicle and that Mark Galper's negligent entrustment of the vehicle to Helen Galper was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's damages. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's complaint fails to adequately plead the elements of negligent entrustment, specifically that Mark Galper knew or should have known that Helen Galper was unfit or incompetent for driving. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's third cause of action is defective and should be dismissed.
