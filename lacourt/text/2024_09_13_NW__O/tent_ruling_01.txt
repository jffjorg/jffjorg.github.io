ORDER
  GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES 



 


 
I.              
BACKGROUND 
This case
arises out of a contract between Plaintiff Pacific Building Contractors Inc.,

Louisa Mclean (collectively, “Defendants”) for failure to pay Plaintiff in full
for Plaintiff’s construction and repair work on Defendants residence. (See First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”), ¶¶ 6-10.)
This Court
held a bench trial on March 13, 2024, and later entered judgment in favor of
Plaintiff, awarding Plaintiff $54,324.16, plus Plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and
costs according to proof. 
Plaintiff now
seeks attorney’s fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a) [1].

III.        
LEGAL STANDARD
“A party
is entitled to an award of¿attorney¿fees¿if there
is a specific authorization therefor by statute or private agreement.” (Beverly Hills Properties v.
Marcolino (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 7, 10.)  
 “With respect to attorney fees
incurred to litigate a contract claim, the recovery of such fees are governed
by¿Section 1717.”
(Intelligent Investments Corp. v. Gonzales (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1,
4.) Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a)
provides in, pertinent part, “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract
specifically provides that¿attorney's¿fees¿and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the¿prevailing¿party, then the party who is determined
to be the¿party¿prevailing¿on the contract, whether he or she is
the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable¿attorney's¿fees¿in addition to other costs.”
“California
courts liberally construe the term ‘on a contract’
as used within¿section
1717. As long as the action involves a contract it is ‘on
the contract’
within the meaning of¿Section
1717.”
(Dell Merk Inc. v. Franzia (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 443, 455, (internal
citations omitted).) 
“The court…shall determine who is the
party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section, whether or not
the suit proceeds to final judgment…the party prevailing on the contract shall
be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract. The
court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for
purposes of this section.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1717(b).)
Code of Civil Procedure § 1032(b)
provides that, “[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled … to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”
Attorneys’ fees awarded pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1717 are
allowable as costs under Code of Civil Procedure § 1032 as they are attorneys’
fees authorized by contract. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B); Code
Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(10)(A).) Attorneys’ fees are therefore recoverable as an
element of costs.
IV.         
ANALYSIS
A.            
Plaintiff is Entitled to an Award of Reasonable Attorney’s
Fees and Costs Under Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a).
Plaintiff is entitled to
an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure
§ 1717(a) as the prevailing party in this action.   
Plaintiff requests a
total of $19,250.00 for fees and costs incurred in connection with this action and the instant Motion.
Defendants did not
oppose. 
B.      Plaintiff’s Fees Are Granted in Part.
1.        Plaintiff’s Counsels’ Rates are Reasonable.
The Court finds Plaintiff’s primary counsel’s (“Mr.
Fox”) hourly rate of $500.00 reasonable given the prevailing rates in the
Greater Los Angeles Area for an attorney with Mr. Fox’s 26 years of business
litigation experience and considering the level of complexity of the action and
the skill demanded by it. The Court also finds Plaintiff’s secondary counsel’s
(“Mr. Kian”) hourly rate of $375.00 reasonable, and both counsels’ blended
hourly rate of $350.00 reasonable. 
2.       Not
All Plaintiff’s Counsels’ Hours Are Reasonable.
Mr. Fox and Mr. Kian’s requested fees account for 55
hours of collective legal time. The Court finds almost all of Mr. Fox and Mr.
Kian’s hours reasonable. However, the Court finds the 6.0 hours to “prepare
trial exhibit binders and copies” unreasonable, as this accounts for clerical,
not legal work, and thus finds it appropriate to reduce these hours to 0.0. 
With this finding in mind, the Court has adjusted Mr.
Fox and Mr. Kian’s task fees as follows:
///
///



Date


Task


Requested Time


Adjusted Time




3/12/24


Prepare
  trial exhibit binders and copies 


6.0


0.0



Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court concludes
Mr. Fox and Mr. Kian’s reasonable hours total 49 hours, amounting to $17,150.00
in fees. 
3.       Plaintiff
is also Entitled to Costs.
Plaintiff seeks reimbursement of $585.00 in costs
and filed a Memorandum as required by Rules of Court, rule 3.1700. Defendants
have not opposed. The Court finds Plaintiff’s requested costs reasonable and
will therefore include this amount in its fee award.
V.       CONCLUSION
          Based on
the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees in the
amount of $17,735.00. Accordingly, the Court orders Plaintiff to prepare and
submit an Amended Judgment that reflects these additional fees and costs. 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
DATED:      September 13, 2024

Judge,
