The judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in part.

The Plaintiff has requested a total of $19,250.00 for fees and costs, and the judge has awarded $17,735.00. The judge has also reduced the number of hours worked by the Plaintiff's counsel, Mr. Fox and Mr. Kian, from 55 hours to 49 hours, and has adjusted the fees accordingly. The judge has found that the Plaintiff's requested costs of $585.00 are reasonable and will include this amount in the fee award. The Plaintiff is ordered to prepare and submit an amended judgment that reflects the additional fees and costs.
