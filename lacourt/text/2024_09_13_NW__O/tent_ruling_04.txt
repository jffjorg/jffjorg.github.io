[2] The Court’s ‘general’
classification of the indemnity provision and finding the provision is not void
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2782(a) should not be interpreted as a finding
regarding Riehl’s entitlement to indemnification. Such a finding is improper at
the pleading stage as it typically requires a factual inquiry into the
circumstances of a given case and an analysis of whether conduct constitutes
active or passive negligence, “unless the circumstances of the case and
language of the contract evince a different intent by the parties.” (Gonzales,
20 Cal.3d at 810; see also McCrary, 133 Cal.App.4th at 1538–1539.)
