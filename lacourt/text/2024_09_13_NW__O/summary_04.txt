And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling emphasizes that the court's classification of the indemnity provision in the contract does not imply a finding on Riehl's entitlement to indemnification. Such a finding is typically made at a later stage of the case, requiring a factual inquiry into the circumstances and an analysis of whether the conduct constitutes active or passive negligence. The court notes that the language of the contract and the circumstances of the case may indicate a different intent by the parties, and a determination of entitlement to indemnification should be made based on these factors, rather than solely on the court's classification of the indemnity provision.
