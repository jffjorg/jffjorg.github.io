I.        INTRODUCTION
This case
arises out of the alleged construction defects of a residence located at 17100
Rancho Street, Encino, California (“Property”). (See First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”), ¶ 1.)
Plaintiff Evan Jehle, Trustee of the 17100 Rancho Trust, alleges he purchased the
Property from Defendant developer Rancho Villa, LLC (“Rancho Villa”), on October
25, 2019, but that the Property was “replete with latent defects.” (See FAC,
¶¶ 2, 24.) Plaintiff filed his FAC
against Rancho Villa and those involved in the construction of the Property:
Defendant David Zemach (“Zemach”)(managing member and owner of Rancho Villa), Defendant
CW General Construction, Inc. (“CW”)(general contractor responsible for allegedly
defective decking), Defendant Yoram David Najum dba JR Pool and Spa Services (“JR
Pool”)(pool and spa contractor responsible for defective pool construction), Defendants
Hudson Insurance Company (“Hudson Insurance”) and Hartford Insurance Group
(“Hartford Insurance”)(CW and JR Pool’s insurers, later dismissed), and Defendant
J.T. Eden dba The Eden Group (“J.T. Eden”)(architectural/engineering firm involved
in the construction of the Property)(collectively, “Defendants”). (See
FAC.)
A number of
cross-complaints have been filed in this action. Rancho Villa and Zemach filed
a Cross-Complaint against CW, Cross-Defendant Gordon S. Gibson, Inc. (“Gibson”),
Cross-Defendant Jabs Pools and Spas, LLC (“Jabs Pools”) and Riehl Construction
Consulting, LLC (“Riehl”). 
For good
measure, Riehl filed a Cross-Complaint of its own against Plaintiff and
Cross-Defendant NJJ Entertainment, LLC (“NJJ”). NJJ now demurrers to all three
causes of action contained in Riehl’s Cross-Complaint.

III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge
the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the
demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian,
116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” (Mitchell v.
California Dept. of Pub. Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007, citation
omitted.) “[T]he facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981)
123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are
stated to support the cause of action asserted. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10(e).)  
“A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (See
Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court
to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the
pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a),
emphasis added.) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the
results of the meet and confer process. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)
          NJJ filed a declaration attesting to the parties’ telephonic meet
and confer efforts, consisting of a series of letters and emails. (See Declaration
of Fred Fenster filed June 12, 2024, ¶¶
3-11, Exs. 1-6.) NJJ has not complied with Code of Civil Procedure
§ 430.41(a)(3) in person, telephonic, or video conference requirements. Although
the Court will address the merits of the instant demurrer despite NJJ’s
non-compliance, all counsel involved are warned not to take for granted this
Court will overlook similar non-compliance with meet and confer requirements in
the future.
V.       ANALYSIS  
A.            
Breach of Written Contract – Express Indemnity
Cause
The
Court first addresses Riehl’s third cause of action for breach of written contract—express
indemnity clause. 
The
elements of a cause of action for express indemnity are (1) a contract defining
the obligation for one party to make good as to a loss another party incurred
and (2) the occurrence of loss the other party incurred or of some other legal consequence
of conduct of another party. (See Rossmoor
Sanitation, Inc. v. Pylon, Inc. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 622, 628 9 (“Rossmoor”).)
“Indemnity is a contract by which one engages to save another from a legal
consequence of the conduct of one of the parties, or of some other person.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2772.) “A defendant may properly bring a declaratory
cross-complaint for indemnity in the original tort action even though for
statute of limitations purposes, the defendant’s indemnity action does not
accrue until he has suffered actual loss through payment.” (Allen v. Southland Plumbing (1988) 201
Cal.App.3d 60, 65, cleaned up.)
Rancho
Villa filed its Cross-Complaint for equitable indemnity, contribution, and
declaratory relief on September 29, 2023, and amended its Cross-Complaint to
include Riehl on November 7, 2023. (See Rancho Villa Cross-Complaint.) Riehl,
in turn, filed its own Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff and NJJ (owned by
Plaintiff) on January 6, 2024, alleging (1) Equitable Indemnity, Apportionment, and
Contribution; (2) Declaratory Relief; and (3) Breach of Written
Contract-Express Indemnity. (See Riehl Cross-Complaint.) All of Riehl’s
causes of action are based on an indemnity provision in a contract between it
and Plaintiff/NJJ that Riehl attached to its Cross-Complaint. (See Riehl
Cross-Complaint, Exhibit 1.) The contract is dated March 3, 2020, and is for “certain
construction activities at the Property.” (See Riehl Cross-Complaint,
Exhibit 1, pg. 1, C.) The indemnity provision states the following:
“Client
agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold Riehl harmless from and against
any and all actions, adjudications, awards, causes of action, claims, costs,
damages, demands, expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and
costs and court costs), fees, fines, forfeitures, injuries, judgments,
liabilities, liens, losses, obligations, orders, penalties, proceedings, stop
notices and suits in any way arising out of or resulting from or in connection
with or related to the Property or the Services.”
(Riehl
Cross-Complaint, Exhibit 1, pg. 2, IV.)
 NJJ argues the indemnity
provision is unenforceable, and thus all three causes of action fail, because it
violates Code of Civil Procedure § 2782(a). (See Demurrer, pg. 5.) Code
of Civil Procedure § 2782(a) states, in relevant part, 
“[e]xcept
as provided in Sections 2782.1, 2782.2, 2782.5, and 2782.6, provisions,
clauses, covenants, or agreements contained in, collateral to, or affecting any
construction contract and that purport to indemnify the promisee against
liability for damages for death or bodily injury to persons, injury to
property, or any other loss, damage or expense arising from the sole
negligence or willful misconduct of the promisee or the promisee’s
agents, servants, or independent contractors who are directly responsible to
the promisee, or for defects in design furnished by those persons, are against
public policy and are void and unenforceable.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc. § 2782(a), emphasis added.) 
NJJ argues
the contract is a construction contract as defined in Code of Civil Procedure §
2783, and so falls under the purview of Code of Civil Procedure § 2782(a). (See
Demurrer, pp. 8, 10-11.) NJJ further argues the indemnity provision is “overbroad,
unspecific and is designed to cover all events—whether relating to Riehl’s sole
negligence or willful misconduct, as well as ‘suits in any way arising out of
or resulting from or in connection with or related to the Property or Services.’”
(Demurrer, pg. 10.) In support of its arguments, NJJ cites Southern Pacific
Transportation Co. v. Sandyland Protective Assn. (1990), 224 Cal.App.3d
1494, and Smoketree-Lake Murray, v. Mills Concrete Construction Co.
(1991), 234 Cal.App.3d 1724 (“Smoketree”), where the Court of Appeals
discussed Code of Civil Procedure § 2782(a)’s purpose of ensuring “that an
indemnitee would not, by contractual language however specific,
require indemnity for damages sustained as a result of its sole negligence
or willful misconduct.” (Smoketree, 234 Cal.App.3d at 1738, internal
citations omitted.)
In
opposition, Riehl argues (1) the duty to defend is separate from the duty to
indemnify, citing Crawford v. Weather Shield Mfg., Inc., 44 Cal.4th 541;
(2) Code of Civil Procedure § 2782 does not apply to Riehl as the contract was
for professional services, not construction services; and (3) there is no
evidence Riehl was solely negligent or that willful misconduct occurred. (See
Opposition, pp. 5-11.) Riehl also argues NJJ’s attempt to invalidate the indemnity
provision is premature and inappropriate for a demurrer and references other
contracts between Riehl and NJJ with indemnity provisions. (See Opposition,
pp. 1-2, 7-8, 10.) 
In
reply, NJJ argues Riehl’s Opposition fails to refute its argument that the
contract is a construction contract that is unenforceable because it violates
Code of Civil Procedure § 2782(a). (See Reply, pg. 3.)
As a preliminary
matter, the Court notes a demurrer is only appropriate to challenge defects on
the face of pleading or those judicially noticeable. Defects on the face of the
pleading include matters shown in exhibits, such as the allegedly illegal terms
of an attached contract. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318; see also Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; Beck
v. American Health Group Int'l, Inc. (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1555, 1563,
superseded by statute on other grounds.) Thus, a demurrer is the appropriate vehicle
to challenge the alleged defects of the indemnity provision contained in the
contract between Riehl and NJJ, but extrinsic evidence like an additional
contract not mentioned in Riehl’s Cross-Complaint is not allowed. 
          Turning
to the indemnity provision at issue, the Court finds it does not violate Code
of Civil Procedure § 2782(a). “In interpreting an express indemnity agreement,
the courts look first to the words of the contract to determine the intended
scope of the indemnity agreement. A key factor in determining the scope of the
agreement, is the specificity of the language.” (Smoketree, 234
Cal.App.3d at 1737.) “Some California cases have interpreted express indemnity
provisions by reference to a classification system described in MacDonald
& Kruse, Inc. v. San Jose Steel Co. (1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 413…According
to MacDonald & Kruse, the first type of indemnity provision (“type
I”) “provides ‘expressly and unequivocally’ that the indemnitor is to
indemnify the indemnitee for, among other things, the negligence of the
indemnitee,” and the indemnitee is indemnified whether its liability arises
from its sole or concurrent negligence.” (McCrary Construction Co. v. Metal
Deck Specialists, Inc. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1528, 1536, emphasis added.) If
a type 1 indemnity provision includes indemnity arising from the “sole
negligence” of the indemnitee, the provision may be unenforceable as contemplated
by Code of Civil Procedure § 2782(a). (See National Union Fire Ins. Co. v.
Nationwide Ins. Co. (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 709, 716–717.)
By
contrast, courts have classified indemnity provisions that do not
address the issue of an indemnitee’s negligence as ‘general’. (See Gonzales
v. R. J. Novick Constr. Co., Inc. (1978) 20 Cal.3d 798, 809 (citations
omitted).) Examples of provisions that have been deemed ‘general’ include “[p]rovisions
purporting to hold an owner harmless ‘in any suit at law’, ‘from all claims for
damages to persons’, and ‘from any cause whatsoever’, without expressly
mentioning an indemnitee's negligence.” (Rossmoor, 13 Cal.3d at 628–629 (internal
citations omitted).) “While such clauses may be construed to provide indemnity
for a loss resulting in part from an indemnitee's passive negligence,
they will not be interpreted to provide indemnity if an indemnitee has
been actively negligent. Whether conduct constitutes
active or passive negligence depends upon the circumstances of a given case and
is ordinarily a question for the trier of fact; active negligence may be
determined as a matter of law, however, when the evidence is so clear and
undisputed that reasonable persons could not disagree.” (Gonzales, 20
Cal.3d at 810, cleaned up.)
General
indemnity provisions will not, however, be nullified merely because they
do not expressly disclaim the right to indemnification for the indemnitee’s
sole negligence. (See Gonzales, 20 Cal.3d at 809, fn. 8.) “If it had
been the intention of the Legislature, in passing section 2782, to nullify
all general indemnity clauses not containing an express disclaimer of any right
to indemnification for the promisee’s sole negligence, we have no doubt that
that intention would have been clearly stated…[w]e think it manifest that the
purpose of the Legislature in passing section 2782…was to insure that an
indemnitee would not, by contractual language however specific,
require indemnity for damages sustained as a result of its sole negligence
or willful misconduct.” (Id.) 
          Here,
the Court finds the indemnity provision fits
squarely within the ‘general’ classification. As NJJ acknowledges, the
indemnity provision is broad. It makes no mention of Riehl’s, NJJ’s, or any third
party’s negligence; rather, it refers generally to NJJ’s promise to “indemnify,
defend, protect and hold Riehl harmless from” a litany of actions,
adjudications, awards, etc. “arising
out of or resulting from or in connection with or related to the Property or
the Services.” (Riehl Cross-Complaint, Exhibit 1, pg. 2, IV.) 
This ‘general’ provision cannot be classified as a
type I provision and does not contain the express ‘sole negligence’ language
and risk-transferring Code of Civil Procedure § 2782(a) seeks to
prohibit. The Court thus declines to find the provision unenforceable pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure §
2782(a) and finds Riehl’s third cause of action for breach of written contract—express
indemnity clause sufficient to state a cause of action.[2]
Accordingly,
the Court OVERRULES NJJ’s Demurrer as to Riehl’s third cause of action for
breach of written contract—express indemnity.
B.            
Equitable Indemnity, Apportionment,
Contribution, and Declaratory Relief
The
Court will next address Riehl’s first and second causes of action for equitable
indemnity, apportionment, contribution, and declaratory relief. 
To state
a cause of action for equitable indemnity, a plaintiff must allege the same
harm for which claimant may be held liable is properly attributable wholly or
partly to a defendant or cross-defendant. (See Platt v. Coldwell Banker
Residential Real Estate Services (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1439, 1445, fn. 7.) 
To state
a cause of action for apportionment, a plaintiff must allege the relative
responsibility of various parties for an injury to a claimant (e.g.,
negligence, strict liability, or other theories) and equitable apportionment or
allocation of loss, by requiring parties to pay a share of the claimant’s
judgment in proportion to their comparative responsibilities. (See Knight v. Jewett (1992) 3 Cal.4th 296,
314; see also Li v. Yellow Cab Co.
(1975) 13 Cal.3d 804, 827.)
A cause
of action for contribution is proper “[w]here a money judgment has been
rendered jointly against two or more defendants in a tort action.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 875(a).)
Finally,
a cause of action for declaratory relief requires the following elements: (1)
person interested under a written instrument or a contract; or (2) a
declaration of his or her rights or duties (a) with respect to another or (b)
in respect to, in, over or upon property; and (3) an actual controversy. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 1060.)    
Here,
NJJ’s Notice of Demurrer states it demurrers to Riehl’s Cross-Complaint “pursuant
to Section 430.10, subdivision (e) of the California Code of Civil Procedure,
on the ground that…all causes of action being asserted against NJJ…fail as a
matter of law because the Service Agreement that it signed with Riehl is a
construction contract as that term is defined in California Civil Code Section
2783, and as a consequence thereof, the indemnity provision contained in
Section IV of Exhibit 1…is unenforceable as a matter of law because it is
contrary to the public policy as set forth more particularly in California
Civil Code Section 2782(a).” (See NJJ’s Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2.) 
In
short, NJJ argues Riehl’s first and second causes of action fail because they
are based on the indemnity provision and the indemnity provision is
unenforceable pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2782(a). NJJ advances no
other arguments in either its Notice, Demurrer, or Reply.
Because this Court previously found the
indemnity provision is not unenforceable pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 2782(a), and in
accordance with Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, requiring a memorandum of points
and authorities containing evidence and argument in support of a party’s
demurrer, the Court OVERRULES NJJ’s Demurrer as to Riehl’s first and second
causes of action for equitable indemnity, apportionment, and
contribution, and declaratory relief. 
VI.    
CONCLUSION
