And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Daniel E. Hendrix vs. Emate Health Medical Center DBA: Emate Health Queen of the Valley Hospital. The defendant has demurred to the complaint, alleging that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for elder abuse. The court has agreed with the defendant and sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the second cause of action. The court found that the plaintiff has not alleged facts constituting authorization or ratification on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the defendant corporation. The plaintiff must plead with particularity the facts constituting the neglect and establishing the causal link between the neglect and the injury. The court also found that the allegations of understaffing and inadequate supervision are not pled with specificity, and therefore the complaint fails to state a cause of action for elder abuse.
