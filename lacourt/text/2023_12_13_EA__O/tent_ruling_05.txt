 Case Number:  23PSCV02266    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s
Counsel’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel Re: Christopher Floyd is GRANTED,
effective upon [see below].[1]
 
Background
 
This is a habitability case. 
 
On July 26, 2023, Plaintiffs ERIN LOPEZ; CAMERON FLOYD, and
CHRISTOPHER FLOYD, filed suit against Defendants HARRIS BROS and COVINA
ROLLINGWOOD APARTMENTS for: 1.    
Violation Of California Civil Code § 1942.4 2.    
Tortious Breach Of The Warranty Of Habitability 3.    
Private Nuisance 4.    
Business And Professions Code § 17200, Et Seq. 5.    
Negligence 6.    
Breach Of Covenant Of Quiet Enjoyment 7.    
Intentional Infliction Of Emotional Distress
 
On November 9, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel, Jacob O.
Partiyeli, filed the instant motion. 
 
An OSC Re: POS and a CMC are both set for 1/04/2024. 
 
Discussion
 
According to counsel’s declaration, there has been a
breakdown in client communications, which makes it impossible for counsel to
act in Plaintiff’s best interest. Counsel has attempted to contact the client
on several occasions but has never received a response. The lack of ongoing
communication prevents us from effectively representing him in this matter. 
 
As (i) Counsel has complied with all California Rules of
Court Rule 3.1362 (filed MC-051, 052, and 053 forms), (ii) Counsel appropriately
served Plaintiff and Defendants, (iii) no substantive motion is calendar that
would warrant immediate representation (suggesting no prejudice) and (iv) the
action is relatively recent, the court grants the motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, effective upon serving this court’s order relieving Counsel sent to
Plaintiff, Defendant, and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
