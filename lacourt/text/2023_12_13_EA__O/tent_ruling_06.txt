Though the court will seek
clarification as to whether Counsel seeks to be relieved as to all Plaintiffs
or solely as to Christopher Floyd. The proposed order (053 form) and
notice of motion and motion (051 form) both mention Christopher, but the
declaration (052 form) references all Plaintiffs. (See section 1 of 052
compared to Section 1 of 053 form.) That said, as Counselâ€™s declaration
specifically references Christopher Floyd, the court reasonably presumes the
motion is only as to one of the three plaintiffs.
