And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motion to reopen discovery and permit the deposition of Jamiee Castillo. The court has granted the motion in part, allowing the deposition of Castillo, but has left the issue of expert discovery pending. The court has determined that the defendant's belief that the pre-trial dates, including the discovery cutoff, were continued commensurate with the new trial date, was reasonable, and that the defendant's failure to conduct discovery earlier was not dilatory. The court has also determined that the deposition of Castillo is necessary to prevent prejudice to the defendant, and that reopening discovery will facilitate settlement discussions rather than hinder them. The court has also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the defendant's motion to reopen discovery is an attempt to delay the trial.
