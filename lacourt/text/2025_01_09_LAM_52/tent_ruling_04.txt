 Case Number:  23STLC01829    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  52 Defendant
City of Hawthorne’s Motion to Continue Trial
Defendant
City of Hawthorne moves to continue the trial and pretrial deadlines.  The non-jury trial is set for April 9, 2025.  California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1332(a) provides: “To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for a trial are firm.  All parties and their counsel must regard the
date set for trial as certain.” 
(Italics added.)  
Defendant
does not show good cause to continue the trial or pretrial deadlines.  Defendant argues the court should continue
the trial due to the pending appeal of the court’s order on defendant’s
anti-SLAPP motion.  Plaintiff filed this
action on March 20, 2023.  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.714(b)(1) provides that the trial court should manage
its unlimited cases so that 85 percent are disposed within 18 months and 100
percent are disposed within 24 months. 
The current trial date is over 24 months after plaintiff filed the
action.  The case is set for a one-day
bench trial.  The court finds that
continuing the trial will not serve the interest of judicial economy.
Defendant’s
motion to continue trial is denied.
