And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Hawthorne has moved to continue the trial and pretrial deadlines in a civil case. However, the judge has denied this motion because the City of Hawthorne has not shown good cause to do so. The trial is currently set for April 9, 2025, and the case was filed on March 20, 2023. The judge notes that the trial court has a duty to manage unlimited cases and ensure that 85% of cases are disposed within 18 months and 100% within 24 months. In this case, the current trial date is over 24 months after the case was filed. Therefore, continuing the trial will not serve the interest of judicial economy.
