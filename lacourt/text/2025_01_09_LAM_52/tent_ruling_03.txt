 Case Number:  22STCV36102    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  52 Plaintiff
Arthur Little’s Motion to Reopen Discovery and Compel Compliance
Plaintiff
Arthur Little moves to reopen discovery and compel defendant Regents of the
University of California to produce the entire investigation file regarding the
internal complaint plaintiff made in 2019. 
The court does not reach the issue of whether to reopen discovery under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 because, even if the court reopened
discovery, plaintiff could not obtain the discovery he seeks.  
Plaintiff
labels this motion one to compel compliance with requests for production under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320. 
It is not. Subdivision (a) of that
section provides, “If a party
filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling …
thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in
accordance with that party’s statement of compliance, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling compliance.” 
This provision permits moving to compel production only after the
responding party gives a statement of compliance under section 2031.220.  In contrast, section 2031.310, subdivision
(a) provides that the requesting party may move to compel a further written
response to the demand if “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.  (2) A representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  (3) An objection in the response is without
merit or too general.”  
The distinction between the two motions matters here
because, unlike a motion to compel compliance under section 2031.320, a motion
to compel further responses under section 2031.310 must be made “within 45 days
of the service of the verified response.” 
(§ 2031.310, subd. (c).)  This 45-day
deadline “renders the court without authority to rule on [late] motions to
compel other than to deny them.”  (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  Enacting this deadline “indicates an
intention by the Legislature not to vest any authority in the court” to rule on
untimely motions to compel further responses. 
(Id. at p. 1409; accord New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1427–1428.)  “Although an actual refusal to produce the
items promised may lead to a motion to compel compliance …, this cannot
be substituted for the motion to compel a further response,” which must
be made “within 45 days” of the response. 
(Standon Co. v. Superior Ct. (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 898, 903.)    
History of Requests and Responses
The
record shows plaintiff requested the subject documents four times.  First, in requests for production, set one,
to which defendant responded on April 28, 2023, only with objections and no
statement of compliance.  (Adame Decl., ¶
2, Ex. A, RFP Nos. 15-17.)  Second, plaintiff
made the same requests in a notice of deposition of defendant’s person(s) most
qualified served on October 6, 2023. 
(Gil Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 1, RFP Nos. 9-11.) 
On November 6, 2023, defendant responded by objecting and did not agree
to produce any documents for request Nos. 9-11. 
(Id., ¶ 4, Ex. 2.)  Third, plaintiff
repeated the requests in the notice of deposition of Maria DeHowitt (as
defendant’s person most qualified) served on January 17, 2024, to which
defendant objected on February 22. 
(Adame Decl., ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. C, RFP Nos. 9-11.)  Fourth, in the notice of deposition of
Chandra Bhatnagar (as defendant’s person most qualified) also served on January
17, to which defendant objected on March 28. 
(Id., ¶¶ 5, 7, Ex. D, RFP Nos. 9-11.)  
In
none of the responses to these requests did defendant agree to produce the
documents plaintiff now seeks.  This
motion, therefore, is not one to compel compliance “in accordance with [defendant’s]
statement of compliance.”  (§ 2031.320,
subd. (a).)  
Plaintiff
could not “reset the
clock” on the 45-day deadline “through the stratagem of asking the same
question again.”  (Professional Career
Colleges, Magna Institute, Inc. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d
490, 493; accord Sexton v. Superior Court, supra, 58 Cal.App.4th at p.
1409.)  But even if he could, plaintiff
made this motion on December 13, 2024, long past the 45-day deadline to compel
further responses (§ 2031.310, subd. (c)) for the latest of defendant’s
responses.  
In contending defendant agreed to produce the subject documents, plaintiff
relies on defendant’s meet and confer letter dated January 12, 2024, in
response to the October 6, 2023, notice of deposition of defendant’s person(s)
most qualified.  (Gil Decl., Ex. 4.)  Defendant wrote: “Request No. 9: Subject to
its objections and upon entry of a mutually agreeable protective order, The
Regents will produce documents related to Plaintiff’s complaints to the
Discrimination and Prevention Office since 2017.  Request No. 10: Subject to its objections and
upon entry of a mutually agreeable protective order, The Regents will produce
documents related to Plaintiff’s complaints to the Discrimination and
Prevention Office since 2017.  Request
No. 11: Subject to its objections and upon entry of a mutually agreeable
protective order, The Regents will produce documents related to Plaintiff’s
complaints to the Discrimination and Prevention Office since 2017.”  (Gil Decl., Ex. 4, p. 4.)  
That meet and confer letter was not a verified response to
requests for production subject to a motion to compel compliance under section
2031.320.  And even it were, defendant
did not agree to produce “all documents or things in the demanded category that
are in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no
objection is being made will be included in the production.”  (§ 2031.220.) 
Defendant stated it would produce some documents “[s]ubject to its
objections.”  (Gil Decl., Ex. 4, p. 4.)  Its objections included the one on which it
relies now, “the deliberative process privilege.”  (Id., Ex. 2, pp. 21-23.)  Plaintiff’s only remedy for these “objections
in the response” was to make a “motion within 45 days of its service.”  (Standon Co. v. Superior Court, supra,
225 Cal.App.3d at p. 903.)  He did not do
so.
Plaintiff’s
reply cites Carter v. Superior Court (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 994 (Carter)
for the proposition that a party may re-issue “substantially similar” document
requests in a notice of deposition.  (Reply,
p. 3, fn. 1.)  Carter concluded nothing
in the statutory scheme “suggests that seeking documents under one statutory
procedure,” demands for inspection, “bars a litigant from seeking the same
documents under the other,” a notice of deposition that included document
demands.  (Carter, at p. 997.)
Assuming
Carter applies, it does not help plaintiff.  When a notice of deposition includes document
demands, the requesting party may move to compel production when “a deponent
fails … to produce any document… that is specified in the deposition
notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480,
subd. (a).)  Such a motion must “be made
no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the
deposition.”  (Id., subd. (b).)  Like the 45-day deadline under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.310, this “60-day deadline [is] mandatory.”  (Weinstein v. Blumberg (2018) 25
Cal.App.5th 316, 321.)  “[A] deposition
is deemed to be final 30 days after the deponent has been notified by the
reporter that the deposition has been prepared for his or her inspection,
correction, and signature.”  (Collins
v. Superior Court (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1244, 1248.)  
The
record does not show plaintiff met that 60-day deadline.  Plaintiff deposed Maria DeHowitt (as
defendant’s person most qualified) on February 29, 2024, and deposed Chandra
Bhatnagar (also as defendant’s person most qualified) on April 3, 2024.  (Adame Decl., ¶ 11.)  Plaintiff filed this motion on December 13,
2024.  It was therefore untimely unless
“the completion of the record of the deposition” (§ 2025.480, subd. (a)) occurred
on October 24, 2024—over 200 days after the latest deposition on April 3.  Whether the applicable deadline was 45 days
(§ 2031.310, subd. (c)) or 60 days (§ 2025.480, subd. (b)), plaintiff missed
it.  He therefore waived his right to file
a motion seeking to overrule defendant’s objections and compel defendant to
produce the entire investigation file.
Disposition    
            Plaintiff Arthur Little’s motion to
reopen discovery and to compel compliance is denied.
