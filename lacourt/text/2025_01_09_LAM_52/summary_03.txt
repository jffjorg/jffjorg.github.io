* Plaintiff: Arthur Little
* Defendant: Regents of the University of California

**Significant Statements**

* "The court does not reach the issue of whether to reopen discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 because, even if the court reopened discovery, plaintiff could not obtain the discovery he seeks."
* "Plaintiff could not 'reset the clock' on the 45-day deadline 'through the stratagem of asking the same question again.'"
* "Plaintiff made this motion on December 13, 2024, long past the 45-day deadline to compel further responses (§ 2031.310, subd. (c)) for the latest of defendant's responses."
* "Plaintiff's only remedy for these 'objections in the response' was to make a 'motion within 45 days of its service.'"
* "Plaintiff filed this motion on December 13, 2024. It was therefore untimely unless 'the completion of the record of the deposition' (§ 2025.480, subd. (a)) occurred on October 24, 2024—over 200 days after the latest deposition on April 3."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies plaintiff Arthur Little's motion to reopen discovery and compel compliance. The motion is untimely and the plaintiff failed to comply with the applicable deadlines. The plaintiff made four requests for production, but the defendant did not agree to produce the requested documents. The plaintiff deposed witnesses, but did not file a motion to compel production within the 60-day deadline. The defendant objected to the requests for production, citing the deliberative process privilege. The judge finds that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the applicable statutes and that the plaintiff has waived his right to file a motion seeking to overrule the defendant's objections and compel the production of the entire investigation file.
