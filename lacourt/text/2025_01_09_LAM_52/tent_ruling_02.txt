 Case Number:  22STCV15743    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  52 Judgment Creditor Yolanda
Lopez Perez’s Motions to Compel Responses to Post-Judgment Special
Interrogatories and Requests for Production
Judgment
creditor Yolanda Lopez Perez moves to compel judgment debtor Color Story
Textile, Inc. to respond to special interrogatories and requests for production,
set one.  
A judgment creditor may propound interrogatories
(CCP § 708.020) and demand inspection of documents (§ 708.030) from a judgment
debtor pursuant to the Civil Discovery Act. 
When
a party fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories or demands for
inspection, the requesting party may move for an order compelling
responses.  (CCP §§ 2030.290(b)
[interrogatories]; 2031.300(b) [demands for inspection].) The responding party
also waives any objections.  (§§
2030.290(a); 2031.300(a).)  
Judgment debtor failed to serve timely responses to
these discovery requests.  Judgment
creditor served post-judgment special interrogatories, set one, and requests
for production, set one on judgment debtor by mail on May 13, 2024.  (Villareal Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.)  Judgment debtor had not served responses as
of November 5, 2024, when judgment creditor filed these motions.  (Id., ¶ 4.)  Judgment creditor is therefore
entitled to an order compelling judgment debtor to serve verified responses
without objections to these discovery requests.
Sanctions
In each motion, judgment creditor moves for $889.50
in sanctions against judgment debtor.  Failing
to respond to an authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery
process subject to monetary sanctions.  (CCP
§ 2023.010(d).)  Judgment debtor did not
respond to authorized discovery.  It did
not act with substantial justification. 
Sanctions are just under the circumstances.  Judgment creditor reasonably incurred all
expenses she claims.

Perez’s motion to compel responses to post-judgment special interrogatories is granted.  Judgment debtor Color Story Textile, Inc. is ordered to serve verified responses

within 30 days.
