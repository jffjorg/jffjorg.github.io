And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Tony Robert Tawil vs. Galpin Motors, Inc. The judge has overruled Galpin Motors' demurrer to the second amended complaint, which alleged fraud and deceit. The judge found that the plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded the first cause of action for fraud and deceit, and that the demurrer was improper.

The judge also denied Galpin Motors' motion to strike the request for punitive damages. The judge found that the plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded the fraud element to support the request for punitive damages, and that the motion was unpersuasive.

The judge has ordered Galpin Motors to serve an answer to the second amended complaint within 10 days.
