  - "Because Plaintiff did not allege that Defendant solely made a special promise to pay the debt of VNL, sans any consideration given by Plaintiff, the claim is outside the scope of the SOF suretyship provision."
  - "The Court finds the argument and the supportive legal authority persuasive over Plaintiff's legal authority."

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Aaron Rosen DBA RA Construction against Defendant David Malka. The Judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action (unjust enrichment) and overrules the demurrer as to the first, second, and third causes of action (breach of oral contract, common counts, and account stated). The Judge finds that the first, second, and third causes of action are not barred by the Statute of Frauds (SOF) and that the SOF argument presented by the Defendant is unpersuasive. The Judge also finds that the fifth cause of action (promissory fraud) is not defective and overrules the demurrer. The Defendant is ordered to file an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 20 days.
