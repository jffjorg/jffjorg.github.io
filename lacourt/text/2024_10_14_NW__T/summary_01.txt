And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion to bifurcate the Statute of Limitations issue in the case between Boris Tadevosyan and Lawrence A. Wolff, DDS, and Lawrence A. Wolff, DDS, Inc. The motion was filed by the defendants, who argued that the issue of the statute of limitations should be tried separately and before any other issues. The plaintiff, Boris Tadevosyan, opposed the motion, but the Judge found that the defendants had met their burden to show that bifurcation is mandatory. The Judge also rejected the plaintiff's arguments that bifurcation would not result in greater judicial economy and that the statute of limitations defense had already been previously ruled upon. Instead, the Judge found that the merits of the statute of limitations defense will be determined at trial by the trier of fact.
