  - "While the matter is discretionary, 'it is well settled that, in light of the public policy favoring trial by jury, a motion to be relieved of a jury waiver should be granted unless, and except, where granting such a motion would work serious hardship to the objecting party.'" (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, Â¶ 2:317)

And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Richard Martinez's motion for relief from jury trial waiver. The Plaintiff inadvertently failed to post jury fees prior to the initial case management conference or within one year of filing the action, but has since paid the fees. The Court finds that granting relief will not prejudice the other parties and exercises its discretion to grant the motion. The Court rules that the Plaintiff's motion is granted and orders the Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service within five days.
