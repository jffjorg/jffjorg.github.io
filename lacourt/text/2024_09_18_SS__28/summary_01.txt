The judge has considered the motion to compel the deposition of Hertz's person most qualified and for sanctions filed by Plaintiff D'Cameron Granger. The motion was opposed by Defendant Hertz Vehicles LLC, which argued that its objections to the deposition notice were timely and valid. The judge found that Plaintiff's counsel received Hertz's objections on July 26, 2024, which was within the three-day notice period required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410. The judge also found that Plaintiff had waived any objection to the defective service of the objections. The judge denied the motion, finding that Plaintiff had not made a sufficient showing that Hertz's person most qualified failed to appear for examination or produce documents as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450.
