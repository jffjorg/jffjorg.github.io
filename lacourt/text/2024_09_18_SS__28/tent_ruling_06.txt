On

The

PARTY’S REQUEST 
Defendant
asks the Court to impose terminating and monetary sanctions on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Monetary, issue, evidentiary, and terminating
sanctions 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part: 
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: 
“(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may
also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has
engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised
that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(b) The court may impose an issue sanction ordering
that designated facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance
with the claim of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery
process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting
any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or
opposing designated claims or defenses. 
“(c) The court may impose an evidence sanction by an
order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from introducing designated matters in evidence. 
“(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by
one of the following orders: 
“(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of
the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
“(2) An order staying further proceedings by that
party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
“(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of
the action, of that party. 
“(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against
that party. 
“(e) The court may impose a contempt sanction by an
order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a contempt of court. 
“(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), or any other
section of this title, absent exceptional circumstances, the court shall not
impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for failure to provide
electronically stored information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or
overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic
information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.)       
B.   Sanctions for failure to comply with Court order
compelling attendance at deposition 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (h), provides: 
“If [a] party or party-affiliated deponent . . . fails
to obey an order compelling attendance, testimony, and production [under Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a)], the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
that party deponent or against the party with whom the deponent is affiliated.
In lieu of, or in addition to, this sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against that
deponent or against the party with whom that party deponent is affiliated, and in
favor of any party who, in person or by attorney, attended in the expectation
that the deponent’s testimony would be taken pursuant to that order.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (h).)         
C.   Terminating sanctions for failure to comply with
discovery orders 
A
violation of a discovery order may support the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (See Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
A
terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with
caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280 (“Mileikowsky”).)  
DISCUSSION 
On
July 29, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel
Plaintiff to attend his deposition and ordered Plaintiff to attend his
deposition on August 5, 2024, at 1:00 p.m., or at another mutually agreeable
date and time within 30 days of the hearing on the motion.  The Court also
granted Defendant’s request for sanctions and ordered Plaintiff to pay
Defendant $661.75 within 30 days of the hearing on the motion. 
On
July 31, 2024, Defendant served notice of the July 29, 2024 order on Plaintiff. 
Defendant
now moves for terminating sanctions based on Plaintiff’s failure to comply with
the Court’s July 29, 2024 order.  
The
Court denies Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions.  Plaintiff has violated one discovery
order.  Defendant has not shown that less
severe sanctions would be ineffective in producing compliance with the
discovery rules. (See Mileikowsky, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp.
279-280.) 
Instead,
the Court orders Plaintiff to comply with the Court’s July 29, 2024 order by October
17, 2024.  Defendant’s counsel is to make
reasonable efforts to contact Plaintiff to schedule and conduct the deposition
by October 17, 2024. 
Defendant
requests $835.00 in monetary sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at
a rate of $175.00 per hour, one $60.00 filing fee, and $250.00 for a certificate
of non-appearance.  Counsel spent one
hour to prepare the motion and anticipated spending one hour to prepare a reply
and one hour to attend the hearing. 
The
Court grants Defendant $660.00 in sanctions based on two hours of attorney
time, one filing fee, and the certificate of non-appearance fee. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendant Jan Guy’s motion for
terminating sanctions as follows: 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Defendant Jan Guy’s request for terminating
sanctions. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Jan Guy’s request for monetary sanctions and orders
Plaintiff George Lewis to pay Defendant Jan Guy $660.00 by October 17, 2024. 
In
addition, the Court reinstates its July 29, 2024 order and ORDERS Plaintiff George
Lewis (1) to attend his deposition by October 17, 2024 and (2) to pay Defendant
Jan Guy $661.75 in sanctions by October 17, 2024.  Defendant’s counsel is ordered to make
reasonable efforts to contact Plaintiff to schedule and conduct the deposition
by October 17, 2024. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
