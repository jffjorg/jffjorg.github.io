 Case Number:  23STCV03962    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On February
22, 2023, Plaintiffs Pedro Javier Anguilarc Astro (sic) and KLNG, Inc. dba American Towing filed this action
against Defendants Dio Angelica Rivera (“Defendant”) and Does 1-25 for motor vehicle
tort and general negligence. 
On
December 11, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
August 21, 2024, Defendant filed (1) a motion to compel
Plaintiffs’ responses to demand for production of documents, set one, and for
sanctions, and (2) a motion to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to form
interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions. 
The motions were set for hearing on September 18, 2024.  Plaintiffs have not filed oppositions. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to demand for production of
documents, set one, and Plaintiffs’ responses to form interrogatories, set one.  Defendant also asks the Court to impose sanctions
on Plaintiffs and their counsel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Demand for inspection 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides in part: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subds. (a), (b), (c).)  
B.   Interrogatories 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides in part: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)  
DISCUSSION 
A.   Motions to compel 
On January
2, 2024, Defendant served a demand for production and inspection of documents
and tangible things, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, on Plaintiffs.  On March 19, 2024, Defendant served corrected
demands for production and inspection of documents and tangible things, set
one, and form interrogatories, set one (collectively, “discovery”), on
Plaintiffs. 
Plaintiffs
did not provide timely responses to the discovery and had not provided
responses by the time Defendant filed these motions. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to Defendant’s demand
for production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiffs to serve verified
code-compliant responses to the demand for production of documents, without
objections, and to produce the documents, electronically stored information,
and/or other things requested without objections by October 17, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to Defendant’s form
interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiffs to serve verified
code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without objections by
October 17, 2024. 
B.   Sanctions 
Defendant
asks the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiffs on each motion to compel.  Under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.290 and 2031.300, the Court shall impose a monetary sanction against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories or a demand for inspection unless the
Court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for
inspection].) 
Plaintiffs
did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or a
demand for inspection. Therefore, sanctions are not available under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award on Defendant’s motions.  In City of Los Angeles v.
Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (Aug. 23, 2024) __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042,
2024 DJDAR 8056, slip opn. pp. 1-42] (PwC), the Supreme Court held: “It
is already well-established that a court may not rely on [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by any other
applicable sanctions provision in the [Civil Discovery] Act.  A court may invoke
its independent authority to impose sanctions under sections 2023.010 and
2023.030 only when confronted with an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a
pattern of abuse, not already addressed by a relevant sanctions provision. And
where it invokes that authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules
generally governing the imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, __ Cal.5th __
[2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066, slip opn. at p. 40].) 
Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300,
subdivision (c), limit the Court’s authority to impose sanctions when (as here)
the non-moving party does not oppose a successful motion to compel responses to
interrogatories or inspection demands. 
Because these statutes address the issue, the Court may not invoke its
independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (See PwC,
supra, __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066,
slip opn. at p. 40].) 
The
Court denies Defendant’s sanctions requests.
