LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. * * * “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. 
“(2) On motion of any other party who, in person or by
attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the deposition notice in
the expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
in favor of that party and against the deponent or the party with whom the
deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g).)  
          Code of
Civil Procedure section 2025.410 provides in part: 
“(a)    Any party served with a deposition notice
that does not comply with Article 2 (commencing with Section 2025.210) waives
any error or irregularity unless that party promptly serves a written objection
specifying that error or irregularity at least three calendar days prior to the
date for which the deposition is scheduled, on the party seeking to take the
deposition and any other attorney or party on whom the deposition notice was
served. 
“(b)    If an objection is made three calendar days
before the deposition date, the objecting party shall make personal service of
that objection pursuant to Section 1011 on the party who gave notice of the
deposition. Any deposition taken after the service of a written objection shall
not be used against the objecting party under Section 2025.620 if the party did
not attend the deposition and if the court determines that the objection was a
valid one.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410,
subds. (a), (b).)        
DISCUSSION 
A.   The complaint 
The complaint
alleges that on January 12, 2020, at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard
and North Western Avenue in Los Angeles, Azor negligently, carelessly,
recklessly, wantonly, and unlawfully drove, operated, maintained, conducted,
controlled and entrusted his vehicle, causing the vehicle to drive into
Plaintiff at high speed, injuring Plaintiff. 
B.   Plaintiff’s motion to compel 
On October 9,
2023, Plaintiff served a deposition notice setting the deposition of Hertz’s person
most qualified (“PMQ”) for December 4, 2023.  On November 27, 2023, Hertz’s counsel
objected to the deposition notice and the request for production of documents
included in the deposition notice. 
On June 27, 2024,
Plaintiff served an amended deposition notice for Hertz’s PMQ for a deposition to take place on July 29,
2024.  According to Plaintiff, Hertz “never
objected” to the amended deposition notice. 
(Motion pp. 3, 10.)   Hertz did not appear at the July 29, 2024
deposition.  Plaintiff took a certificate
of non-appearance and contacted Hertz’s counsel to inquire about the non-appearance. 
Plaintiff
argues the Court should compel the deposition of Hertz’s PMQ because Hertz
failed to attend the July 29, 2024 deposition or produce responsive documents despite
failing to object to the amended deposition notice. 
Hertz opposes
the motion, asserting that, contrary to Plaintiff’s contention, Hertz served an
objection to the June 27, 2024 amended deposition notice.  Hertz has attached a copy of the objection,
which includes a proof of service dated July 26, 2024. 
Hertz’s July
26, 2024 objection stated that Hertz objected “on the grounds that Plaintiff’s
request are over broad and irrelevant to the claim at hand; and Defendant is at
a loss on who to produce on the categories. [¶] 
Additionally, objections are made to all of the document requests as no
deponent will be produced at said date and time.”  (Nelson dec., exh. A.) 
In his reply,
Plaintiff shifts gears and concedes that his counsel received Hertz’s July 26,
2024 objection.  Plaintiff argues that the
objection was untimely under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410,
subdivision (a), because “it was served only three days before the
scheduled deposition on July 29, 2024.” 
(Reply p. 2, original emphasis.)  But
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410, subdivision (a), allows a party to
serve an objection “at least three calendar days prior to the date for which
the deposition is scheduled . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) 
Plaintiff
does not mention Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410, subdivision (b),
which requires personal service of an objection made three calendar days before
the scheduled deposition. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (b).)  Hertz
electronically served the July 26, 2024 objection.  The Court finds that Plaintiff has waived any
objection to the defective service, particularly in light of the misleading
assertion in Plaintiff’s moving papers that Hertz “never objected” to Plaintiff’s
June 27, 2024 amended deposition notice.  (Motion pp. 3,
10.) 
  Plaintiff also argues the Court should grant
the motion because Hertz did not cooperate in scheduling the PMQ deposition.  But Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450
authorizes the Court to compel a PMQ deposition only when the PMQ, “without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  Plaintiff has not
made this showing. 
Finally,
Plaintiff argues in his reply that the objections which Hertz served on July
26, 2024 were not valid.  Plaintiff did
not raise this argument in his moving papers.  Instead, Plaintiff contended that Hertz "never objected" to Plaintiff's June 27, 2024 amended deposition notice.  (Motion pp. 3, 10.) 
Therefore, the Court does not consider the argument. 
The Court
denies the motion.     
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff D’Cameron Granger’s motion to compel the deposition of Defendant
Hertz Vehicles LLC’s person most qualified and for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
