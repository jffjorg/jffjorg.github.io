On
August 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages listing $9,037.98 in
property damages and $50,000 in uninsured motorist bodily injury payments, for
a total of $59,037.98. 
On
November 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted
service on Ayala of the summons, complaint, statement of damages and other
documents on October 26, 2022. 
On
December 5, 2022, Defendant My Car Enterprises Inc. dba Discount Car Rental

On

PARTY'S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Progressive Direct Insurance Company asks the Court to enter a default judgment
against Defendant Thomas Adrian Ayala and award Plaintiff $59,556.98,
consisting of $59,037.98 as the demand of the complaint and $519.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has submitted a complete default judgment
application with all required information. 
The Court grants the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Progressive Direct Insurance Company’s application for
default judgment against Defendant Thomas Adrian Ayala filed
on June 27, 2024.  The Court awards
Plaintiff Progressive Direct Insurance Company $59,556.98
against Defendant Thomas Adrian Ayala. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
