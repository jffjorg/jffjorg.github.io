And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, dismissing the first, second, and third causes of action (professional negligence, medical battery, and fraud) without leave to amend. The fourth cause of action (wrongful death) is also dismissed, but the court grants leave to amend to allow the plaintiff to cure the defects in the pleading. The court finds that the first, second, and third causes of action are barred by the doctrine of retraxit and the one-year statute of limitations, respectively.
