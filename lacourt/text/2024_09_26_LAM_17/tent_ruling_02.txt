  vs.
 
DOE #1, et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  22STCV35324 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: September 26, 2024



 
 
Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment, or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of Plaintiff’s SAC, is
DENIED.
 
On 11/4/2022,
Plaintiff Jane Doe C.J. filed suit against Doe #1 (a public entity) and Doe #2.
On 1/4/2024, Plaintiff filed a seconded amended complaint (SAC) alleging: (1)
childhood sexual abuse; (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (3)
negligent hiring, supervision, and retention; (4) failure to report suspected
child abuse; (5) negligent supervision of a minor; and (6) negligence. 
 
On 6/20/2024,
Defendant Doe #1 (hereinafter, Defendant or LAUSD) moved for summary judgment,
or, in the alternative, summary adjudication of Plaintiff’s SAC.[1]
 
Factual Background  
 
            Plaintiff
alleges in approximately 1987 or 1988, at the age of thirteen, she was sexually
harassed and abused by Doe #2, identified as teacher Chester Williams
(Williams) at 75th Street School.
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
argues that summary judgment is appropriate because there are no triable issues
as to any of the three claims asserted against it. The Court addresses each
claim in turn. 
 
I.                  
Negligent Hiring,
Supervising, and Retention
 
 
Defendant
argues that this claim fails as a matter of law because Williams passed a
background check and no employee of LAUSD reasonably suspected Williams would
abuse any student, including Plaintiff. 
 
To establish a cause of action for negligent
hiring, retention, or supervision, a plaintiff must show that the employer knew
or should have known that hiring the employee created a particular risk or
hazard and that particular harm occurs. (See Z.V. v. County of Riverside
(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 889, 902; Doe, supra, 50 Cal.App.4th at
1054.) 
 
“[A] school district is liable for negligence of
supervisory employees who “knew or should have known of [a school employee’s]
dangerous propensities, but nevertheless hiring, retained and failed to
properly supervise” the employee.” (Roe v. Hesperia Unified School District (2022)
85 Cal.App.5th 13, 25.) The standard for determining whether a school “knew” of
its employee’s dangerous propensities is constructive knowledge. (Id.) 
 
Here, to show that it had no constructive knowledge
of Williams’ dangerous propensities, Defendant submitted evidence that: 
 
-        
Williams received his teaching credential on or
about May 9, 1979, and the Commission on Teacher Credentialing was legally
required to conduct background checks before issuing a credential. (SS 9.)
Moreover, to comply with California Education Code section 44346, before
issuing a teaching credential, Commission on Teaching Credentialing
fingerprints all applicants, and the Department of Justice responds with
criminal records, if applicable. 
 
-        
Williams
completed and passed a background check and informed LAUSD that he had
successfully passed at the time he was hired. (SS 8 and 9.) 
 
Defendant
also argues that there is no evidence that any student, parent or employee
complained about Williams to any employee at LAUSD, and there were no reports
of any misbehavior or inappropriate conduct prior to Plaintiff’s alleged
incident in 1987 or 1988. Defendant submitted evidence that Plaintiff never
disclosed the alleged abuse to other teachers, or anyone except her mother. (SS
20.) Defendant argues that while Plaintiff alleges her mother reported
William’s conduct, she is not able to identify the person to whom her mother
allegedly reported the conduct to, nor does she has any additional information about
this disclosure: For example, in deposition, Plaintiff testified that her
mother went to the school to complain about Williams and talked to a “Hispanic
lady,” though she does not remember her title or any other information. (SS
26.) 
 
 Defendant submitted evidence that there is
nothing in William’s personnel file until the Complaints involving Martia
Williams in late 1987, which was after Plaintiff’s alleged abuse. (SS 10.)
Defendant submitted evidence that as soon as school administrators became aware
of the possible existence of inappropriate behavior in late March 1987, they
took action according to procedure, notifying police and removing Williams from
the school environment. (SS 10.) A police investigation was conduct and
Williams was arrested thereafter. (Id.) 

 
Taken
together, Defendant’s evidence supports a reasonable inference that it had no
constructive knowledge of Williams’ dangerous propensities. Accordingly, the
burden shifts to Plaintiff to disclose a triable issue of material fact. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff submitted evidence that:
 
-        
Williams’ application in 1980 was
initially rejected by the CTC only to be granted after the CTC’s investigation
due to past misconduct which the CTC did not condone. (AUMF No. 57.) There is
no evidence that Defendant took any steps to investigate what caused the
rejection, what the past misconduct was, and if any additional supervision was
needed or imposed. (AUMF No. 58.)
 
-        
Bertram Ashe, the principal at School,
conducted evaluations of Williams and Williams’ classroom in 1985, 1986, and
1987. (AUMF No. 60.) Williams was given a below standard evaluation on June 13,
1985, May 6, 1986, and May 8, 1987 following Ashe’s 8+ observations, including
an evaluation on March 31, 1987, of Williams in his classroom. (AUMF No. 61.)
Ashe’s evaluation included a review of the layout of Williams’ classroom and
Ashe repeatedly noted that Williams’ “furniture arrangement” was “not conducive
to good classroom environment” in Ashe’s evaluation reports. (AUMF No. 62.)
 
-        
Plaintiff reported Williams’ abuse and
molestation of her to Plaintiff’s mom after the very first instance of abuse by
Williams inside the self-enclosed room within Williams’ classroom. (AUMF No.
65.) Plaintiff’s mother informed Defendant’s School’s administration the very
next day and made a report regarding Williams’ abuse. (AUMF No. 66.) 
 
-        
Both Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s mother
recall Williams being arrested approximately one-week after his initial abuse
of Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s mother reporting Williams to the School. (AUMF No.
67.) However, Williams was allowed to return to the School only a few days
after being initially arrested. (AUMF No. 68.)
 
-        
Williams was allowed to remain as a
teacher at Defendant’s School, remained Plaintiff’s reading teacher, and
remained in the same classroom with the self-enclosed windowless room with a
couch. (AUMF No. 69.)
 
-        
Williams continued to abuse Plaintiff
and at least three other minor students thereafter in the same exact classroom
at Defendant’s School until his arrest on January 11, 1988, or April 1987 at
the earliest. (AUMF No. 72.)
 
-        
There is no evidence that Williams was
placed on leave of absence between January and March/April 1987 or thereafter
until his formal arrest on January 11, 1988. (AUMF No. 74.)
 
-        
There is no evidence that Williams was
placed on administrative leave, removed from teaching at 75th Street Elementary
School, or transferred to the Region C administrative building in April 1987 –
only that a complaint was received in April 1987 of Williams’ abuse of 3rd
grader Martia Williams. (AUMF No. 75.)
 
-        
In fact, Defendant’s School’s principal
completed an evaluation of Williams on May 8, 1987, which indicated an
observation date of March 31, 1987, of Williams in his classroom and was signed
by Williams on November 15, 1987. Ashe’s evaluation did not contain an
indication of Martia Williams’ complaint against Williams or that Williams had
been placed on leave or transferred as of April 1987. (AUMF No. 76.)
 
Moreover, on
9/17/2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel against both
Defendant and the California Commission on Teacher’s Credentialing (CTC). Given
these rulings, substantive discovery remains as to the hiring of Williams, the
identity/testimony from Williams’ other minor student victims, and the PMQ
Depositions of Defendant.
 
While as a
general matter there is no duty to act to protect others from the conduct of
third parties, a defendant may owe an affirmative duty to protect another from
the conduct of third parties if he or she has a “special relationship” with the
other person. (Jennifer C. v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 1320, 1328; Guerrero v. South Bay Union School Dist.
(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 264, 268.) It is well established that where a public
entity has a “special relationship” with a plaintiff, the duty of care owed
grows to include an affirmative duty to take all reasonable steps to protect
that plaintiff from foreseeable harm. (Jennifer C. v. Los Angeles Unified
School Dist. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1320, 1328; J.H. v. Los Angeles
Unified School Dist. (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 123, 141–142; M.W. v. Panama
Buena Vista Union School Dist. (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 508, 517; C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High Sch. Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 869- 70.).)
 
The Supreme
Court in C.A. explained: “a school district and its employees have a special
relationship with the district’s pupils.” (C.A., at p. 869-870.)
 
In Doe v.
Lawndale Elementary, supra., the Second District Court of Appeal
stated: 
 
Once a court
determines a defendant owes a duty to a plaintiff, “the remaining liability
questions—breach as well as factual and legal causation—are usually questions
for the jury.” (Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 228, 276
Cal.Rptr.3d 434, 483 P.3d 159 (conc. opn. of Cuéllar, J.); see (Vasilenko v.
Grace Family Church, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 1084, 224 Cal.Rptr.3d
846, 404 P.3d 1196 [“[b]reach, injury, and causation must be demonstrated on
the basis of facts adduced at trial, and a jury's determination of each must
take into account the particular context in which any act or injury
occurred”].) For example, a defendant's arguments “about specific measures it
has already taken”—such as whether the District's administrators did enough to
prevent Farr's sexual abuse—“concern[ ] whether defendant in fact took
reasonable care, a question of breach usually for the jury.” (Brown, at
pp. 230- 231, 276 Cal.Rptr.3d 434, 483 P.3d 159 (conc. opn. of Cuéllar, J.); see
Cabral v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2011) 51 Cal.4th 764, 772, 122 Cal.Rptr.3d
313, 248 P.3d 1170 (Cabral).) Similarly, “argument[s] about specific
foreseeability”—such as whether Farr's sexual abuse of Doe was foreseeable
under the circumstances— “would be relevant to whether plaintiff had
established proximate cause, also usually a question for the jury.” (Brown,
at p. 231, 276 Cal.Rptr.3d 434, 483 P.3d 159 (conc. opn. of Cuéllar, J.); see
T.H. v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. (2017) 4 Cal.5th 145, 198, 226
Cal.Rptr.3d 336, 407 P.3d 18.) “Most liability questions are case-specific and
so not amenable to analysis in terms of duty—they do not allow a categorical
determination whether defendant had to exercise reasonable care at all.” (Brown,
at p. 228, 276 Cal.Rptr.3d 434, 483 P.3d 159 (conc. opn. of Cuéllar, J.); see
Cabral, at p. 773, fn. 3, 122 Cal.Rptr.3d 313, 248 P.3d 1170 [“‘When no
such categorical considerations apply and reasonable minds could differ about
the competing risks and burdens or the foreseeability of the risks in a
specific case, ... courts should not use duty and no-duty determinations to
substitute their evaluation for that of the factfinder.’ ”].)
 
(Doe v.
Lawndale Elementary School Dist. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 113, 126–127.)
 
The Doe v.
Lawndale court continued: 
 
Nevertheless,
“‘[e]ven if an organization has a special relationship with the tortfeasor or
plaintiff, “[t]he court may depart from the general rule of duty ... if other
policy considerations clearly require an exception.” ’ ” (Archbishop, supra,
70 Cal.App.5th at p. 673, 285 Cal.Rptr.3d 613; see Regents, supra,
4 Cal.5th at p. 628, 230 Cal.Rptr.3d 415, 413 P.3d 656; Brown v. USA
Taekwondo (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 1077, 1095, 253 Cal.Rptr.3d 708, affd.
(2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 276 Cal.Rptr.3d 434, 483 P.3d 159.) As the Supreme Court
explained in Brown, “whether a defendant has a legal duty to take action
to protect the plaintiff from injuries caused by a third party” involves a two
step-inquiry: “First, the court must determine whether there exists a special
relationship between the parties or some other set of circumstances giving rise
to an affirmative duty to protect. Second, if so, the court must consult the
factors described in [Rowland v. Christian (1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 70
Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561 (Rowland)] to determine whether relevant policy
considerations counsel limiting that duty.” (Brown, supra, 11
Cal.5th at p. 209, 276.) 
 
(Id.
at p. 127.)
In Rowland v. Christian
(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, the court set forth the factual bases for finding a duty,
and noted that analysis requires a “balancing of a number of considerations;
the major ones are the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of
certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection
between the defendant's conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame
attached to the defendant's conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the
extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of
imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the
availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.” (Id.
at pp. 112–113.)
Here,
Plaintiff’s evidence supports at least a reasonable inference that Williams
conduct was foreseeable, that Plaintiff suffered certain injury, and that moral
blame attaches to Defendant as parents place trust in schools to supervise
their children. (Rowland, supra.) 
Whether or not LAUSD, in fact, should have foreseen William’s conduct
based on his initial rejection by CTC, the manner in which he organized his
classroom, or after Plaintiff’s mother allegedly reported his conduct, is
appropriately decided by a trier of fact. 
 
II.              
Failure to Report
 
Defendant argues
that Plaintiff’s claim for failure to report fails as a matter of law because
no mandatory reporter had a reasonable suspicion of child abuse. 
 
In support,
Defendant submitted evidence that as soon as the school became aware of the
complaint in late March 1987, the school action. (SS 10.) The police were
notified and Williams was removed from the classroom and school. (Id.) 
 
Moreover,
Defendant is immune for allegations in connection with such reporting, per
California Penal Code section 11172. “In order to promote the purpose of the
act of to protect abused children, section 11172 provides that mandated
reporters of child abuse are absolutely immune from liability. Robbins v.
Hamburger Home for Girls (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 671, 769.) As noted by
Defendant, this immunity is very broad:
 
This absolute
immunity extends not only to the making of the initial report, but also to
conduct giving rise to the obligation to report, such as the collection of data,
or the observation, examination, or treatment of the suspected victim performed
in a professional capacity and to subsequent communications between the
reporter and the public authorities responsible for investigating and
prosecuting child abuse.  
 
(Arce v.
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1455,
1484-1485.) 
 
Defendant’s
evidence supports a reasonable inference that no mandatory reporter had a
reasonable suspicion of child abuse, and thus there was no failure to report or
a breach of a mandatory duty to report. Accordingly, the burden shifts to
Plaintiff to disclose a triable issue of material fact. 
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff submitted evidence, already set forth above, that abuse
by Williams was first reported by another student on March 25, 1987, that
Williams was not removed after this report, that Plaintiff’s mother reported
William’s abuse directly to the School’s Principal, that Williams was allowed
to return to School a few days after being initially arrested, and that
Williams  continued to abuse Plaintiff
and at least three other minor students thereafter in the same exact classroom
at Defendant’s School until his arrest on January 11, 1988, or April 1987 at
the earliest.
 
Moreover,
there remains substantive discovery that has yet to take place, making summary
judgment inappropriate at this time.  
 
III.           
Negligent Supervision of
a Minor 
 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s claim for negligent supervision fails because Plaintiff
cannot establish any breach of duty which caused Plaintiff’s damages.
 
California
law has long imposed on school authorities a duty to supervise, at all times,
the conduct of children on school grounds and to enforce those rules and
regulations necessary to their protection. (Dailey v. Los Angeles Unified Sch.
Dist. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 741, 747.) The standard of care imposed on school authorities
in carrying out this duty to supervise is that degree of care which person of
ordinary prudence, charged with comparable duties, would exercise under the
same circumstances. (Id.) 
 
The Court of
Appeals recently held that because the special relationship between the
District and its employees, and the District’s pupils, “imposing obligations
beyond what each person generally owes others,’ the ‘duty of care owed by
school personnel includes the duty to use reasonable measures to protect
students from foreseeable injury at the hands of third parties acting
negligently or intentionally,’ including ‘injuries to a student resulting from
a teacher’s sexual assault.’” (Doe v. Lawndale Elementary School Dist. (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 113, 126.) 
 
Here,
Defendant submitted evidence that: 
 
-        
LAUSD, including 75th Street
School and the administration, has applicable policies and procedures to deal
with potential child abuse. (SS 50.)
 
-        
Williams had no record of parent or
student complaints, and no school employee had reason to believe there were
known or predictable risks against him. There was nothing in William’s
background that would have deemed him unfit or dangerous. (SS 47, 48.)
 
-        
Plaintiff never disclosed the abuse to
any employee at LAUSD. (SS 46, 52, 53.) 
 
Defendant’s
evidence supports a reasonable inference that it had no actual or constructive
notice of Williams’ propensity to inflict harm, and thus any harm was
unforeseeable. As such, Defendant’s evidence supports a reasonable inference
that it did not breach its duty of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm.
Accordingly, the burden shifts to Plaintiff to disclose a triable issue of
material fact.   
 
As set forth
above, Plaintiff has disclosed a triable issue as to foreseeability of harm.
Accordingly, there is a triable issue as to whether or not Defendant breached
its duty of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment, or, in the alternative,
summary adjudication of Plaintiff’s SAC, is denied. 
 
It is so ordered.
