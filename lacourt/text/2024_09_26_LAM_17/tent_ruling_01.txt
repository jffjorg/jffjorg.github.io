 Hearing
  Date: September 26, 2024



 
Defendant’s
motion to bifurcate is GRANTED.
 
On 3/11/2019,
Plaintiff Issa Al-Bayati (Plaintiff) filed suit against Defendants Los Angeles
Unified School Districts (LAUSD), Ana Velasco, and Nelson Velasco
(collectively, Defendants). On April 15, 2019, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint (FAC) alleging: (1) general negligence; (2) premises liability; (3)
negligent hiring and retention; and (4) negligent training and supervision. 
 
On 8/13/2024,
Defendant LAUSD (Defendant) moved to bifurcate. 
 
Discussion  
 
            Defendant
moves to bifurcate issues of liability from damages for purposes of the
trial.  
 
In support,
Defendant notes that Plaintiff’s sole remaining cause of action against it is
for negligence. If the issue of liability is found in favor of the District,
there need not be a trial on the issue of damages. 
 
            Defendant
argues that the issue of damages will be more time consuming and require
extensive expert witness testimony, which would otherwise not be necessary in
the liability phase of the trial. 
 
“The
court may, when the convenience of witnesses, the ends of justice, or the
economy and efficiency of handling the litigation would be promoted thereby [.
. .] make an order [. . .] that the trial of any issue or any part thereof
shall precede the trial of any other issue or any part thereof in the case [. .
.]¿ The court, on its own motion, may make
such an order at any time. [. . .]”¿
(CCP § 598, portions omitted.) 
 
            After
review, the Court agrees that bifurcation would serve the ends of judicial
economy, in that it could reduce the time of trial and limit the witnesses to
be called.
                                                                  
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to bifurcate is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.

TENTATIVE RULING
 



ISSA
  AL-BAYATI, a minor, by and through his Guardian ad litem, MAHA AL SADOON
                           
         vs.
 
LOS
  ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT; ANA VELASCO; NELSON VELASCO
 


 Case No.: 
  19STCV08232
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date: September 26, 2024



 
 
Defendant’s
motion to compel deposition is GRANTED. The Court declines to award sanctions
at this time.
 
On 3/11/2019,
Plaintiff Issa Al-Bayati (Plaintiff) filed suit against Defendants Los Angeles
Unified School Districts (LAUSD), Ana Velasco, and Nelson Velasco
(collectively, Defendants). On April 15, 2019, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint (FAC) alleging: (1) general negligence; (2) premises liability; (3)
negligent hiring and retention; and (4) negligent training and supervision. 
 
            On
9/18/2024, Defendant moved to compel Defendant’s expert witness’s deposition.
Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions in connection with this motion. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff has refused to produce experts for deposition, and seeks
an order compelling him to do so.
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s motion is not brought in good
faith and should be denied. 
 
            After
review, the Court grants Defendant’s motion. Correspondence between the parties
suggest that the delays in deposition have not been intentional. Defendant
electronically noticed the deposition of the respective experts on September 3,
2024, to Plaintiff. After the parties were found to be unavailable, Defense
counsel noticed the deposition of Enrique Vega for September 17, 2024; Jonathan
Eskenazi for September 19, 2024; and Janet Roughan for September 20, 2024. 
 
While the
Court understands Plaintiff’s position that these depositions were unilaterally
scheduled very close to the close of discovery, Plaintiff did not disclose his
expert witnesses until July 12, 2024. As such, the Court finds inadequate
evidence to include that Defendant failed to show diligence or engaged in
intentional gamesmanship, given that it has attempted to conduct depositions on
two different occasions prior to the close of discovery. 
 
At the same
time, the Court finds no basis for imposing sanctions on Plaintiff, as the
unavailability of his experts for unilaterally scheduled depositions is not
evidence of an abuse of discovery. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s motion to compel deposition is granted. The Court
declines to award sanctions at this time. 
 
It is so ordered.
