And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling made by Judge Hon. Jon R. Takasugi in a case involving ISSA AL-BAYATI, a minor, and the Los Angeles Unified School District, Ana Velasco, and Nelson Velasco. The case was filed on March 11, 2019, and the first amended complaint was filed on April 15, 2019. The defendant moved to bifurcate the trial on August 13, 2024, and the court granted the motion. The bifurcation will allow the court to focus on the issue of liability before considering damages.

The defendant also moved to compel the deposition of expert witnesses on September 18, 2024, and the court granted this motion as well. The court found that while the plaintiff did not disclose his expert witnesses until July 12, 2024, and the depositions were scheduled close to the close of discovery, the defendant had attempted to conduct depositions on two different occasions prior to the close of discovery. The court declined to award sanctions at this time.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing date. If all parties submit, the court will adopt this tentative as the final order.
