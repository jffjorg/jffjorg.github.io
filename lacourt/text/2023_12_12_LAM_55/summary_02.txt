And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration brought by Citistaff Solutions Inc. and the other defendants. The motion was made in response to the plaintiff's complaint alleging wrongful termination and sexual harassment. The judge found that the defendants failed to show by a preponderance of evidence that a valid arbitration agreement existed. The judge also sustained the plaintiff's evidentiary objections to the declaration of Charles Slater, which was presented as evidence of the arbitration agreement. The judge overruled the remaining evidentiary objections. The judge also found that the defendants failed to show that the plaintiff assented to the arbitration agreement, and therefore, did not have to reach the issue of unconscionability. The judge concluded that the motion to compel arbitration was denied.
