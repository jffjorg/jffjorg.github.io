  Case Number:  22STCV23653    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Petition of  Cross-Defendant Marcus & Millichap Real
Estate Investment Services, Inc. for Order Compelling Arbitration and Stay of
Proceedings On Cross-Complaint.
 
The unopposed petition is granted.
Cross-Defendant Marcus & Millichap Real Estate
Investment Services, Inc. and Defendants/Cross-Complainants TAYLOR EQUITIES 17,
LLC; RH CENTENNIAL APARTMENTS, LLC; RHET APARTMENTS, LLC, and RI III
APARTMENTS, LLC. shall arbitrate the controversies between them, including the
entire Cross-Complaint, in accordance with their agreement to arbitrate.  This entire case is stayed until such
arbitration has been completed or until other further order of the Court. 
On 1/9/23, plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint, alleging that plaintiffs are tenants at 625 S. Burlington Ave.,
Los Angeles, which has uninhabitable conditions, including cockroach
infestations, widespread mold contamination, open exposure to raw sewage,
plumbing issues, faulty and insufficient utilities, structural defects, and
deficient security.  
On 5/17/23,  Defendants/Cross-Complainants
TAYLOR EQUITIES 17, LLC (property buyer); RH CENTENNIAL APARTMENTS, LLC; RHET
APARTMENTS, LLC, and RI III APARTMENTS, LLC. filed a Cross-Complaint, alleging
that cross-defendants’ conduct, including of MARCUS & MILLICHAP REAL ESTATE
INVESTMENT SERVICES, INC. (broker and agents of buyer and seller), caused the tenants
to suffer injuries alleged in their First Amended Complaint (First Amended
Cross-Complaint, ¶ 14).
Now, Defendant/Cross-Defendant MARCUS & MILLICHAP
REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT SERVICES, INC. seeks an order compelling arbitration of
all causes of action against it in the cross-complaint (claims 2 and 10-14);
and staying all proceedings regarding the causes of action against Marcus &
Millichap, except for Marcus & Millichap’s anticipated motion for
attorneys’ fees. Grounds for the motion include that 1) TAYLOR EQUITIES 17,
LLC, Cross-Defendant LINDA V. ARMOR, and MARCUS entered into a Purchase
Agreement for the sale of 625 S. Burlington Avenue, Los Angeles;  2) The Purchase Agreement contains a broad
arbitration agreement requiring (i) arbitration of “[a]ll disputes arising
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of the Purchase
Agreement or the transaction contemplated herein;” and (ii) “[a]ny party who
fails or refuses to submit to arbitration following a demand by the other
party” to “bear all costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by
such other party in compelling arbitration.” 

No opposition has been filed to the motion.
Parties seeking to compel arbitration meet their
initial burden simply by reciting the terms of the governing provision, or by
attaching a copy of the provisions, unless there is a dispute over authenticity
that is beyond merely contesting the preliminary showing.  Sprunk v. Prisma LLC (2017) 14
Cal.App.5th 785, 793;  Ruiz v. Moss
Bros. Auto Group, Inc. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 846   (“In the face of … failure to recall signing
… had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the electronic
signature was authentic….”).  
Where a court has ordered arbitration, it shall stay
the pending action, until an arbitration is had in accordance with the order to
arbitrate, or another earlier time, and the stay may be with respect to an
issue that is severable.  CCP
§1281.4;  Cruz v. PacifiCare Health
Systems, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal. 4th 303, 320; 
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Sup. Ct. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th
188, 192;  Heritage Provider Network,
Inc. v. Sup. Ct.  (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1146, 1152, 1154 n. 12.  A civil action should be stayed where there
is a threat of inconsistent results or rendering arbitration ineffective.  Cruz, supra, at 320 (citing CCP
§1281.4);  Coast Plaza Doctors
Hospital v. Blue Cross of California (2000) 83 Cal. App.4th 677, 693
(citing  Federal Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct.
(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1370, 1375 (citing CCP §1281.4)).  Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.2(c)
“allows the trial court to stay arbitration proceedings while the concurrent
lawsuit proceeds or stay the lawsuit while arbitration proceeds to avoid
conflicting rulings on common issues of fact and law amongst interrelated
parties.”  Cronus Investments, Inc.
v.  Concierge Services (2005) 35
Cal.4th 376, 383, 393.
A court may award attorneys' fees, and costs, incurred
in relation to statutorily authorized judicial proceedings regarding
arbitration, and the arbitrator makes the determination in connection with the
arbitration proceedings. Corona v. Amherst (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 701, 707;  DiMarco v. 
Chaney (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1809, 1816-17;  Carole Ring & Assocs. v. Nicastro
(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 253, 260-62; 
Ajida Technologies, Inc. v. Roos Instruments, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.
App 4th 534, 552 n. 11. A party prevailing on a petition to compel
arbitration is entitled to attorney fees pursuant to an applicable attorney-fee
provision, “[w]here an action is brought solely to compel arbitration of
contractual disputes between the parties.” 
Otay River Constructors v. San Diego Expressway (2008) 158 Cal.
App. 4th 796, 799, 807.  Attorney fees
incurred in connection with petitions to compel arbitration are awardable
before the merits of the dispute have been determined, where a party prevailed
in a discrete proceeding on the contract.
