 Case Number:  BC675696    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  55 PETITION TO CONFIRM
ARBITRATION AWARD filed by Defendants Summary
 On 9/14/17, three plaintiffs
filed a Complaint, including allegations that a plaintiff was sexually harassed
by an assistant supervisor and coworkers, and experienced adverse employment
actions after complaining.
On 6/4/18, the Court
granted a Motion to Compel Arbitration, as to all three plaintiffs in this case.
On
9/2/21, the Court entered an order that case numbers BC675696 and 21STCV17412
are deemed related.
On
1/12/22, the Court confirmed an arbitration award, based on a petition
addressing Plaintiff/Respondent ERIKA VALADEZ, including based on the
arbitration award finding a bar of the Statute of Limitations.
On
1/12/22, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal as to the 1/12/22 order confirming
the award as to ERIKA VALADEZ.  According
to Court of Appeal records, that appeal was ordered on calendar for 12/13/23.
On
6/24/22, defendants filed a petition to confirm an arbitration award, as to
Plaintiff/Respondent MARIA ESTELA ROSAS. No opposition has been filed. 
 
MP
Positions
Moving parties request
the Court to confirm the arbitration award as to Respondent MARIA ESTELA ROSAS,
on bases including the following: 
·        
A JAMS arbitration award was made,
awarding nothing to either side, on August 2, 2021.
·        
The Arbitrator, after reviewing all
submissions, dismissed Claimant’s case, finding that her case was barred by
statutes of limitations, but that the issue was complicated and not frivolously
disputed.
 
Tentative
Ruling
The petition hearing is continued
to 1/31/24 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 55.
As the Court has ruled on
4/10/23 and 7/12/23, it appears that overlapping issues are involved as to the
instant petition, the similar petition of a co-plaintiff, and the appeal that
is still pending in in appellate Case Number B318125.  Thus, an appellate decision could impact the
outcome of the instant motion and case. Even if there is no automatic stay
pending appeal, judges can exercise discretion to continue or stay proceedings,
until an appeal is decided.  Reed v.
