And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling overrules the defendants' demurrer to the complaint filed by plaintiff Rena West. The plaintiff alleges that she was injured in a trip and fall due to inadequate lighting conditions on the defendants' property, Melrose Plaza, LLC, Vista Del Rosa Apartments, and Ali Habibi. The defendants argued that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a claim against them, but the judge finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges a claim for negligence and premises liability against the defendants. The judge also disagrees with the defendants' argument that the complaint is uncertain and notes that any ambiguity can be clarified through discovery. The defendants' demurrer is OVERRULED, and they are ordered to file an answer to the complaint within 10 days.
