And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Maria Sanchez, the plaintiff, and Target Corporation, the defendant. The defendant has moved to compel the plaintiff to provide further responses to its Requests for Admission (RFAs) regarding certain issues. The judge has reviewed the discovery responses and finds that they are incomplete and evasive. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's objections to the RFAs are without merit or too general. Therefore, the judge grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to its RFAs set one, as to Nos. 3, 4, and 5. The plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses to the requests within 15 days.

Additionally, the judge has awarded sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $1,850.00, which includes 10 hours of attorney time at a rate of $185 per hour, for the defendant's efforts in moving for and opposing the motion to compel further responses. The defendant is also seeking $5,065.61 in sanctions from the plaintiff, but the judge has only awarded $1,850.00.

The judge has also ordered the plaintiff and/or the plaintiff's counsel to pay the sanctions to the defendant within 20 days. The judge has encouraged the parties to meet and confer after reading the tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
