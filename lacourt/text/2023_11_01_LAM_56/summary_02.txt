English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court has considered the unopposed motion of Defendant Qiang Ma for an order deeming Defendant's Requests for Admissions, Set Three, admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Chao Yan and his counsel. The motion was filed on August 17, 2023, and no opposition was filed. The Court finds that Plaintiff's purported responses to the requests for admission, served on September 25, 2023, are unverified and therefore tantamount to no response at all. The Court grants the motion and awards Defendant reasonable monetary sanctions in the amount of $710.00, which represents 1.0 hour of work on the motion plus the $60.00 filing fee. The Court also orders Plaintiff and counsel to pay the sanctions within 30 days of the date of this order.
