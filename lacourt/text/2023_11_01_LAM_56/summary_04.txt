```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, and has denied the motion. The defendant argued that the retroactive exemption of childhood sexual abuse claims from the Government Claims Act, as provided by AB 218, is unconstitutional. The Court found that the exemption does not constitute a "gift of public money or thing of value" within the meaning of the California Constitution's Anti-Gift Provision. The Court held that the exemption does not create an obligation for the government to pay a claim, but rather requires the plaintiff to obtain a judgment in the case. The Court therefore denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings.
