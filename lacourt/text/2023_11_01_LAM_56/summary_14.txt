Summary:
The judge has considered the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, and has denied the motion.

The judge also noted that the plaintiff must first obtain a judgment in this case before recovering money from the defendant, which would not be a gift of public funds.
