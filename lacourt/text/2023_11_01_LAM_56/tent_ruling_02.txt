MOVING PARTY: Defendant
Qiang Ma (“Defendant”)  
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition papers were filed. Any opposition papers were required to
have been filed and served at least five court days before the hearing pursuant
to Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b).   
 
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff
filed a complaint against Defendants Qiang Ma and Does 1 to 50 arising from
alleged legal malpractice, alleging a single cause of action for professional
negligence/legal malpractice.    
 
            On
August 17, 2023, Defendant filed and served an unopposed motion for an order
deeming Defendant’s Requests for Admissions, Set Three, admitted, as well for
an order that the truth of each matter in the Requests for Admissions, Set
Three, served on Plaintiff be deemed admitted and conclusively established for
all purposes in this action (the “Motion”). Defendant also requests monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff and his counsel of record in the sum of $2,790.00
for the reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees incurred by Defendant in
bringing the Motion. Defendant contends that no responses were ever served to
Set Three of Defendant’s Requests for Admissions which were served on Plaintiff
on February 27, 2023. (Robinson Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) 
 
            On
October 25, 2023, Defendant filed and served a Notice of Non-Opposition.  The Notice of Non-Opposition states that on
September 25, 2023, Plaintiff served unverified responses to Set Three of
Defendant’s Requests for Admissions, which contained improper failures to
either admit or deny. (Robinson Supp. Decl., ¶ 2 and Exhibit E.) 
 
DISCUSSION
            “Any
party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to
the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of
specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to
fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.010.)  “Within 30 days after service
of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall
serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy
of the response on all other parties who have appeared.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.250(a).)
When a party fails to serve a timely response to
requests for admission “[t]he party to whom the request was directed waives any
objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product.” (Code Civ. Proc § 2033.280(a).) “The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this
order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a response in
substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.280(c).) Unverified or unsworn responses are tantamount to no responses at
all. (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 635-636.) 
 
“It is mandatory that the court
impose a monetary sanction . . . on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated [the]
motion.” (Id.) Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d) provides that a misuse of
the discovery process is “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery.”  Code Civ. Proc. §
2023.010(h) states that a misuse of the discovery process includes “[m]aking or
opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to
compel or limit discovery.”   “The court
may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct” under Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2023.030(a).  A court has discretion to
fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions.  (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v.
Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.)
 
            The
Court finds that Plaintiff’s purported September 25, 2023, responses to
Defendant’s Requests for Admissions, Set Three are not verified. (Robinson
Supp. Decl. at Exhibit E.) Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s responses are
tantamount to no response at all. Moreover, the Motion is unopposed which
thereby creates an inference that the Motion has merit. (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
 
            Counsel
declares that: (1) his hourly rate is $650.00 per hour and a $60.00 filing fee
was incurred in connection with the Motion (Robinson Decl., ¶ 6); (2) he spent
a total of 2.6 hours preparing the Motion (Id.); (3) he anticipates
spending a minimum of 1.5 hours in preparation of a reply and for oral argument
on this matter for a total of 4.2 hours (Id.); and (4) monetary
sanctions in the amount of $2,790.00 are requested in connection with the
Motion (Id.). 
 
            The
Court GRANTS the Motion. The Court exercises its discretion and awards
Defendant reasonable monetary sanctions in the amount of $710.00, which
represents 1.0 hours of work on the Motion plus the $60.00 filing fee. The
Court finds that such an amount is reasonable given the relative brevity of the
Motion and the lack of opposition to the Motion. Monetary sanctions are to be
paid by Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, to Defendant
within 30 days of the date of this order. 
 
             Moving Party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
