Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, and has denied the motion. The plaintiff, G.B., alleges that he was sexually abused by Norbert Stuart Volk, a counselor employed by the defendant, from approximately 1968 to 1969. The defendant argues that the retroactive elimination of the claim presentation requirement for childhood sexual abuse claims that arose before 2009 in AB 218 is unconstitutional under the Anti-Gift Provision of the California Constitution. The Court finds that the exemption does not constitute a "gift of public money or thing of value" within the meaning of the Anti-Gift Provision. The Court notes that the plaintiff must first obtain a judgment in this case before recovering money from the defendant.
