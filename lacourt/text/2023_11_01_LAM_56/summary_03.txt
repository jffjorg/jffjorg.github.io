The Court finds that the request is improperly made, as there is no evidence of an order of default judgment or dismissal against Plaintiff Simmons, and no motion to set aside default or dismissal was filed. The Judge also notes that the arguments regarding reasonability of the requested fees are moot, as the request is not properly made. The Court orders Defendant JPMorgan to give notice of this ruling.
