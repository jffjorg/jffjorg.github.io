And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the complaint does not state a valid claim against the defendant. The plaintiff alleges negligence, negligent hiring and retention, and negligent supervision by the defendant, related to the sexual abuse the plaintiff suffered at the hands of a teacher employed by the defendant in 1980. The defendant argues that the retroactive elimination of the claim presentation requirement for childhood sexual abuse claims, as provided by AB 218, is unconstitutional. The court finds that the exemption does not constitute a "gift of public money or thing of value" within the meaning of the Anti-Gift Provision of the California Constitution. Therefore, the court denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings.
