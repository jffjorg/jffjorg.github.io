Summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District. The plaintiff, O.B., alleges that the defendant's negligence and failure to supervise a teacher, Norbert Stuart Volk, who sexually abused the plaintiff between 1969 and 1970, caused harm. The defendant argues that the retroactive exemption of childhood sexual abuse claims from the Government Claims Act is unconstitutional. The judge finds that the exemption does not constitute a "gift of public money or thing of value" and therefore denies the motion.
