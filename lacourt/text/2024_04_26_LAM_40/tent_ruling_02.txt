 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Miguel
  Sanchez’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
  Production of Documents, Set One.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Miguel
Sanchez sued Defendants Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC and Does 1 through 10 pursuant
to a July 3, 2023 Complaint violations of the Song Beverly Act.
The claims arise from
the following allegations. On July 20, 2019, Plaintiff purchased a 2019
Mercedes-Benz GLA250W (Vehicle) manufactured and/or distributed by
Mercedez-Benz. In connection with this purchase, Plaintiff received an express
written warranty from Mercedez-Benz, which undertook to preserve or maintain
the utility or performance of the Vehicle or to provide compensation if there was
a failure in utility or performance within the warranty period. After Plaintiff
took possession of the Vehicle and during the warranty period, the Vehicle
contained or developed defects, which include but are not limited to, defective
body, powertrain, safety, electrical, braking, and noise systems. Plaintiff
then presented the Vehicle to Mercedez-Benz for repair, but Mercedez-Benz was
unable to conform the Vehicle to warranty after a reasonable number of
attempts. Neither did Mercedez-Benz repurchase or replace the Vehicle.
B. Motion Before the
Court
On October 5, 2023,
Plaintiff served Request for Production of Documents (RPDs), Set One, on
Mercedes-Benz.
On November 30, 2023,
following an extension, Mercedes-Benz served responses to RPDs, Set One.
On January 15, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel unsuccessfully attempted to meet and confer with
Mercedes-Benz’s counsel regarding a continuance of the motion to compel further
deadline. Mercedes-Benz characterizes its nonresponse to this communication as
based on timing and the last-minute nature of the request.
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a motion to compel further responses from Mercedes-Benz to RDPs, Set One,
Nos. 16-21 and 49-51. The motion does not seek monetary sanctions.
On April 15, 2024,
Mercedes-Benz filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion.
On April 22, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a reply to Mercedes-Benz’s opposition.
Plaintiff’s motion is
now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Compel Further
Production
A.
Legal Standard
A
motion to compel a further response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory
answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories, demands to produce,
or requests for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
To
request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the
production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra,
at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the
responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, complete, or
evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s
objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
B.

After review, the Court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s motion, in part and as modified, with the following documents to be

reported failures, (d) the failure rates of the Electrical System Defect, and

(2) All documents relating to
notices, letters, campaigns, warranty extensions, technical service bulletins,

(3) All documents evidencing
policies and procedures used to evaluate customer requests for repurchase
pursuant to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, from the date of purchase
to the present. Mercedes-Benz is not required to conduct a search of emails.

(4) All training manuals and/or
other documents published by Mercedes-Benz and provided to its employees,
agents, and representatives in connection with handling consumer lemon law
