And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the motions to compel initial production of documents and requests for sanctions are MOOT as to compelling initial production responses in relation to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, from Plaintiff Gili Cohen and Plaintiff Powerhouse Enterprise Ltd. The judge has also denied JLR Los Angeles LLC's requests for monetary sanctions of $2,356.65 and $2,271.65, respectively. The judge found that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust, citing the plaintiffs' counsel's declaration that the failure to respond to RPDs, Set One was a result of inadvertence, or a technical issue, and that the plaintiffs complied with their discovery obligations by serving responses to RPDs, Set One, on January 31, 2024, nine days after JLR filed the motions before the Court, later supplementing those responses on March 19, 2024.
