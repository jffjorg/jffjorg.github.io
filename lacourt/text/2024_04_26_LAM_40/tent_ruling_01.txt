I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Jinwoo Park sues
Defendants Keith K. Kim, John P. Yasuda, Herb Fox, Joseph Walsh, all his former
criminal defense attorneys, and the State Bar of California pursuant to a
November 1, 2023, Third Amended Complaint (TAC) alleging an undefined cause of
action that is alleged not to be “legal malpractice” but is alleged to involve
the willful destruction and losing of the People’s exhibits in a criminal
prosecution defense and subsequent appeal, in breach of the professional
ethical duty encompassed in the California Rules of Professional Conduct at
rule 1.16(e)(1) and addressed in formal opinions by the California Bar
Association and Los Angeles County Bar Association. The TAC alleges liability
against the State Bar of California based on failure to act upon complaints
filed with the State Bar by Plaintiff against Defendants Keith K. Kim, John P.
Yasuda, Herb Fox, and Joseph Walsh (the individual Defendants).
B. April 18, 2024,
Order
On November 27, 2023, Defendant Fox
filed a demurrer challenging the sufficiency of the TAC’s allegations as
directed against Defendant Fox.
That same day, Defendant Fox filed
a motion to strike challenging the TAC.
On December 1, 2023, Defendant
Yasuda filed a joinder to Defendant Fox’s demurrer.
On December 5, 2023, Defendant
Walsh filed a joinder to Defendant Fox’s demurrer and motion to strike.
On January 17, 2024, Plaintiff Park
filed an opposition to all demurrers and motions to strike filed against the
TAC.
On March 22, 2024, Defendant Fox
filed separate replies to Plaintiff Park’s opposition.
On April 4, 2024, Defendant
Fox’s demurrer and motion to strike and Defendants Yasuda’s and Walsh’s
joinders came before the Court. However, based on the need for a Korean
language interpreter, the Court continued the hearing to April 18, 2024.
On April 18, 2024, the
Court sustained Defendant Fox’s demurrer and Defendants Yasuda’s and Walsh’s
joinders to the TAC’s sole alleged claim against them, without leave to amend,
which mooted a determination on Defendant Walsh’s motion to strike and
Defendant Yasuda’s joinder thereto.
C. Demurrer and
Motion to Strike, Defendant Walsh
Prior to April 18,
2024, on November 30, 2022, Defendant Walsh filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s
TAC.
That same day,
Defendant Walsh filed a motion to strike Plaintiff’s TAC.
On January 17, 2024, Plaintiff Park
filed an opposition to all demurrers and motions to strike filed against the
TAC.
No reply appears in the record.
Defendant Walsh’s demurrer and
motion to strike are now before the Court.
D. Demurrer, the
State Bar of California
On December 5, 2023, the
State Bar of California filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s TAC.

On April 19, 2024, the
State Bar of California filed a reply to Plaintiff’s opposition.
the State Bar of
California’s demurrer is now before the Court.

2024, order discussed above, Defendant Joseph Walsh’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s
TAC is MOOT.
 
III. Motion to Strike, Defendant Joseph Walsh:
MOOT.
Based on the Court’s April 18,
2024, order discussed above, Defendant Joseph Walsh’s motion to strike
Plaintiff’s TAC is MOOT.
 
IV. Demurrer, the State Bar of California: SUSTAINED, without leave to
amend.
A.
Legal Standard
1. Jurisdiction
A
demurrer may be made to a complaint or cross-complaint on the basis that the
court does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the cause of action
in the pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (a); Buss v. J.O. Martin
Co. (1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 123, 133; Davis v. Southern Cal. Edison Co.
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 619, 636.)
2. Sufficiency
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e).)
To
sufficiently allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate
facts—that is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of
action pleaded. (Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods
Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick
v. Downey Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) “[E]ach
evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need
not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012)
53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)
In
challenging the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the
truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-67.) Courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v.
Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) A
demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of
fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) 
B.
Analysis
1. Nature of Cause of Action
Against the State Bar of California
“[T]he nature and character of a
pleading is to be determined from its allegations, regardless of what it may be
called, and [] the subject matter of an action and issues involved are
determined from the facts alleged rather than from the title of the pleadings
or the character of the damage recovery suggested in connection with the prayer
for relief.” (McDonald v. Filice (1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 613, 622; accord Ananda
Church of Self-Realization v. Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co. (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 1273, 1281; Lovejoy v. AT&T Corp. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th
85, 98.) To determine the nature of a cause of action, California courts look
at the facts alleged, not its label. (See, e.g., Saunders v. Cariss
(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 905, 908.)
The entire TAC is pled in a string
of paragraphs spanning 20 pages that are not broken into different sections by
headers, e.g., an introduction summarizing the parties, an explanation of
jurisdiction and/or venue, Doe and/or joint liability allegations, common
allegations to all counts, specifically defined counts, and a prayer.
A review of the TAC shows that its
allegations against the State Bar of California are contained in page 19, from
lines 9 to 27, with the TAC’s preceding and subsequent allegations confined to
the individual Defendants. The allegations against the State Bar of California premise
liability on allegations that the State Bar: (a) failed to respond to
Plaintiff’s complaints against the individual Defendants; (b) failed to compel
the individual Defendants to release the exhibits from Plaintiff’s criminal
prosecution and appeal; and (c) failed to investigate or discipline the
individual Defendants. The TAC alleges that these omissions constitute
violations of Business and Professions Code section 6077. The TAC also alleges
that through the above conduct, the State Bar of California protected the individual
Defendants, in effect granting the individual Defendants legal immunity,
therefore failing to protect the public and further violating Business and
Professions Code section 6001.1.
Thus, the Court determines that the
TAC alleges two counts against the State Bar of California: (1) Violation of
Bus. & Prof Code., § 6077 based on the three omissions discussed above; and
(2) Violation of Bus. & Prof Code., § 6001.1 based on failure to protect
the public while instead protecting the individual Defendants through the above
three omissions, i.e., a derivative claim premising section 6001.1 liability on
section 6077 liability. (TAC, 19:9-18 [violation of § 6077 based on three
omissions]; see TAC, 19:18-27 [violation of § 6001.1 based on failure to
protect the public through three above omissions].)
2. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds in favor of the
State Bar of California.
The two Court-crafted counts
alleged in the TAC arise from three grounds: (a) failure to respond to
Plaintiff’s complaints against the individual Defendants (ground (a)); (b)
failure to compel the individual Defendants to release the exhibits from
Plaintiff’s criminal prosecution and appeal (ground (b)); and (c) failure to
investigate or discipline the individual Defendants (ground (c)). (TAC,
19:9-27.)
None of these grounds can support a
claim against the State Bar of California.
“A failure, if any, of the State
Bar officials to perform their duty in the initiation and conduct of a
disciplinary proceeding [does] not create a cause of action for damages in
plaintiff’s favor. The law does not provide in that manner for the enforcement
of the performance of duty by public officers. It does accord to the individual
the right to invoke disciplinary action against an attorney in the Supreme
Court, upon a proper showing that ‘the State Bar has arbitrarily failed or
refused to grant a hearing on such specific charges or has arbitrarily failed
or refused, after a hearing, to take appropriate action.’ In re Walker,
32 Cal.2d 488, 491, 196 P.2d 882, 883.” (Bollotin v. California State Pers.
Bd. (1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 197, 200; accord Sheller v. Superior Court
(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1697, 1710 [“Thus, in California, the inherent judicial
power of the superior court does not extend to attorney disciplinary actions.
That power is exclusively held by the Supreme Court and the State Bar, acting
as its administrative arm. (Jacobs v. State Bar, supra, 20 Cal.3d at p.
198, 141 Cal.Rptr. 812, 570 P.2d 1230.)”].) Because this is a Superior Court,
not the California Supreme Court, grounds (1) and (3) for liability are before
the wrong court, and this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this subject matter.
There are other alternative grounds
for this conclusion; in particular, the Court lacks jurisdiction because Plaintiff
failed to plead timely compliance with the Government Claims Act.
Nothing in the parties’ papers
permits a conclusion that these defects are curable by amendment, especially as
this relates to a Third Amended Complaint.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS the State
Bar of California’s demurrer, without leave to amend.
