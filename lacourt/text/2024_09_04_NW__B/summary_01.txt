And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. The defendant, HB Parkco Construction, Inc., argued that the Privette doctrine bars the plaintiff's claims, but the plaintiff contends that the Hooker exception applies. The judge found that the plaintiff has created a triable issue of material fact as to whether the defendant retained control over the manner and means of the work at the construction site where the plaintiff was injured. Specifically, the judge noted that the defendant's employee, Joseph Gonzales, had extensive job duties at the site, including scheduling, ensuring employee safety, and conducting regular inspections. The judge found that this level of control raises a triable issue of fact and that summary judgment is inappropriate.
