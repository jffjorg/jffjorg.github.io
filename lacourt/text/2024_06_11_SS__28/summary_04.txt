And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has tentatively ruled that the Plaintiff's application for a default judgment against the Defendant be denied. The Plaintiff is seeking $254,021.15 in damages, including $200,000.00 in general damages, $53,512.54 in special damages, and $508.61 in costs. However, the Court found that the Plaintiff's evidence only supports $8,127.85 in special damages, and not the $53,512.54 requested. Additionally, the Plaintiff did not provide evidence to support their request for future medical expenses. Therefore, the Court is denying the request for default judgment. The Court has set an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Resubmit Default Judgment Packet for August 12, 2024.
