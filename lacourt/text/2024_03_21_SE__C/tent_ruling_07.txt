Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
This
lemon law action was filed by Plaintiff ISAIAS FRAUSTO (“Plaintiff”) on April
6, 2023. 
 
On
August 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the subject Motion, which seeks to compel
Defendant’s further responses to Request for Production of Documents (set one)
Nos. 1, 3, 7, 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41,
42, 43, 50, 51, 52, 53, 58, 59, 68, 76, 78, 79, 86, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97,
98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 103, 104, and 105.

 
The
Joint Statement filed on March 11, 2024 states that the parties have  informally resolved the Motion with respect to
RFP Nos. 1, 3, and 7. Therefore, the Motion is GRANTED as to RFP Nos. 1, 3, and
7 per stipulation of the parties. Defendant is ORDERED to produce further
responses and documents by no later than 30 days of the date of the Court’s
issuance of this Order. This date may be extended by agreement of the parties. 
 
RFP
Nos. 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 50, 51, 52, 53, 58, 59,
68, 76, 78, 79, 86, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 103,
104, and 105
 
CCP § 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion
compelling further answers to document requests if it finds that the response
is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  The motion
shall be accompanied with a meet and confer declaration.  (CCP § 2031.310(b).)  
The
parties remain at an impasse regarding RFP Nos. 17, 23,
24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 50, 51, 52,
53, 58, 59, 68, 76, 78, 79, 86, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95,
96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 103, 104, and 105.
 
RFP
Nos. 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, and 42 seek internal investigation
documents concerning transmission defects in GM vehicles equipped with the same
transmission as the Subject Vehicle.  
 
RFP
Nos. 43, 50, 51, 52, 53 seek documents concerning summaries, memoranda, and
Power Points concerning transmission defects in GM vehicles equipped with the
same transmission as the Subject Vehicle. 

 
RFP
Nos. 58, 59, 68 seek documents concerning Song Beverly Act and Buyback Policies
and Procedures not limited to the Subject Vehicle, vehicles of the same make,
model, and year as the Subject Vehicle; or GM vehicle equipped with the same
transmission as the Subject Vehicle that were sold in California. 
 
RFP Nos. 76, 78, 79
seek documents and information showing any communications with any governmental
agencies and third-party suppliers regarding the alleged defects in GM vehicles
equipped with the same transmission as the Subject Vehicle. 
RFP No. 86 seeks
documents concerning Dealer Agreements and GM’s Financial Documents. 
RFP Nos. 91, 92, 93,
94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 103, 104, and 105 seek documents related
to the Subject Vehicle’s Defects, including internal investigations, emails,
and other ESI. 
The Motion is DENIED
without prejudice as to RFP No. 86. This information is protected under Civil
Code §3295(c). 
The remainder of the
Motion is otherwise GRANTED. The requests are overbroad because they seek
documents related to all GM vehicles equipped with the same transmission as the
Subject Vehicle, worldwide. These requests will be limited to documents
concerning 2019 Chevrolet Silverado’s sold in California.  
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories or demand for production of documents unless the party subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or the sanction would
otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310,
subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
The Court finds that Defendant acted with
substantial justification.
