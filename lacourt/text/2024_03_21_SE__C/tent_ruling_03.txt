CASE NO.:  22NWCV01106
HEARING: 03/21/24
 
#2
 
Defendant MARIO LUNDES’s unopposed Motion to Set Aside
Default is GRANTED.  
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of March 18, 2024. 
 
Defendant’s Proposed Answer attached as Exhibit A to the
Subject Motion is not deemed filed. Defendant MARIO LUNDES is ORDERED to
file the Proposed Answer within five court days of the Court’s issuance of this
Order. 
 
Default was entered against Defendant Mario Lundes on August
1, 2023. 
 
On September 21, 2023, Defendant Lundes moved to set aside
the default under CCP §473(b). 
 
CCP § 473(b), states that “[t]he court may…relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” 
 
The policy of hearing cases on
their merits is well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971)
17 Cal.App.3d 900.) Given the liberality associated with Motions to Set
Aside Defaults, the Court finds the Declaration of
Thomas A. Goodwin sufficient to warrant to relief. The law favors trials
on the merits. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.) 
 
The unopposed Motion is GRANTED.
