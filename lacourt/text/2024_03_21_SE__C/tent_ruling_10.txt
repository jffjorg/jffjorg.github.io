 Case Number:  23NWCV03087    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  C MVP Bell Gardens Suva, LLC, vs Now or Never Express
Corp.
This is an unlawful detainer action.  
 
Defendant Now or Never Express Corp.’s ex parte application
for a Motion to Seal Defendant’s Record and Temporarily Stay the Lock-out is
DENIED.  Defendant’s argues that unless the record is sealed, it will be
difficult to find corporate office space in the current market.  However,
this argument applies to all corporate entities that have been evicted. 
Defendant has not demonstrated an overriding interest that overcomes the right
of public access to the record. (Cal. Rule of Cout, rule 2.550, subdiv. (d).)
 Nor has Defendant asserted grounds for relief from default pursuant to
CCP § 473.  
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Ex Parte application is
DENIED.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
