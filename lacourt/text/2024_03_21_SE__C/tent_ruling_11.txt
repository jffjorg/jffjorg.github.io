SANCHEZ 
CASE NO.:  23NWCV03597

Defendant MELISSA GAMEZ’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint
is OVERRULED. Defendant Gamez is to Answer in 5 court days. 
 
Opposing Party to give Notice. 
 
This unlawful detainer action was filed by Plaintiff HAGOP
BILEMJIAN, Trustee of the Bilemjian Family Revocable Living Trust (“Plaintiff”)
on November 7, 2023. 
 
Defendant MELISSA GAMEZ (“Defendant”) (in pro per) generally
demurs to the entire Complaint. 
 
The demurrer is procedurally defective. A demurrer must
distinctly specify the grounds upon which any of the objections to the
complaint are taken. If it fails to do so, it may be disregarded. (CCP
§430.60.) Moreover, each ground in a demurrer must be in a separate paragraph
and must state whether it applies to the entire complaint or to a specified
cause of action. (CRC Rule 3.120(a).) 
 
Here, Defendant filed a Memorandum of Points and Authorities
which states: “THE PARTY AGAINST WHOM A COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED MAY OBJECT ON
THE GROUND THA THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE
CAUSE OF ACTION CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 430.10(e).” (Dem. 2:1-6.) Defendant
states that she and her family are experiencing financial hardship, but she
makes no legal arguments.  Therefore,
there is no legal basis to sustain the demurrer.  
 
The Demurrer is OVERRULED.
