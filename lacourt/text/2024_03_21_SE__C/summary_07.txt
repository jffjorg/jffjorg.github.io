And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (set one). The motion is granted in part and denied in part. The parties have informally resolved the motion with respect to certain requests, and the defendant is ordered to produce further responses and documents within 30 days. The court finds that the defendant acted with substantial justification in opposing the motion. The court also denies the motion without prejudice as to one request, which is protected under Civil Code §3295(c). The court will impose a monetary sanction against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses, unless the party acted with substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust.
