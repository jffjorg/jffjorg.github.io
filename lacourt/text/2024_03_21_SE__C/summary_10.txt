The Judge has denied the defendant's ex parte application for a Motion to Seal Defendant's Record and Temporarily Stay the Lock-out. The defendant, Now or Never Express Corp., argued that unless the record is sealed, it will be difficult to find corporate office space in the current market. However, the Judge concluded that this argument applies to all corporate entities that have been evicted and that the defendant has not demonstrated an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record. Additionally, the defendant failed to assert grounds for relief from default pursuant to CCP § 473. As a result, the defendant's ex parte application is denied.
