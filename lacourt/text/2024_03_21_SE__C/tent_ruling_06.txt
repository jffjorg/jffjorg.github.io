Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Requests for Production of Documents (set one) is GRANTED in part.  

 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
This
lemon law action was filed by Plaintiffs MARTIN GARIBAY and MARIA TERESA
GARIBAY (“Plaintiffs”) on February 22, 2023. 
 
On
August 25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the subject Motion, which seeks to compel
Defendant’s further responses to Request for Production of Documents (set one)
Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 17, 19, 23, 25, 31, 36, 39, 42, 43, 49, 56, 58, 59,
68, 77, 78, and 79.
 
The
parties’ Joint Statement filed on March 12, 2024 states that the parties have
informally resolved the Motion with respect to RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 56,
58, 59, and 68. Therefore, the Motion is GRANTED as to RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8,
9, 56, 58, 59, and 68 per stipulation of the parties. Defendant is ORDERED to
produce further responses and documents by no later than 30 days of the date of
the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be extended by agreement of
the parties. 
 
RFP
Nos. 12, 17, 19, 23, 25, 31, 36, 39, 42, 43, 49, 76, 77, 78, and 79 
 
CCP § 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion
compelling further answers to document requests if it finds that the response
is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  The motion
shall be accompanied with a meet and confer declaration.  (CCP § 2031.310(b).)  
The
parties remain at an impasse regarding RFP Nos. 12, 17, 19, 23, 25, 31, 36, 39,
42, 43, 49, 76, 77, 78, and 79, which seek GM’s internal analysis,
investigations, communications, reports, repair documents, government
submissions, and design-related documents (including other consumer complaints
and matters) about the alleged ‘Transmission Defects’ in vehicles other than
Plaintiffs’ own Yukon.” (Motion 6:17-22.) 
 
 
RFP
Nos. 12, 17, 19, 23, 25, 31, 36, 39, 42 seek documents and information
concerning the defects in GM vehicles equipped with the same transmission as
the Subject Vehicle.  
 
RFP
Nos. 43 and 49 seek Power Point presentations, summaries, evaluations, reports,
memoranda, meeting minutes, etc. concerning the alleged defects in GMC vehicles
equipped with the same transmission as the Subject Vehicle, as well as
deposition testimony regarding these documents. 
          
RFP Nos. 76, 77, 78,
and 79 seek documents and information showing any communications with any
governmental agencies and third-party suppliers regarding the alleged defects
in GM vehicles equipped with the same transmission as the Subject Vehicle. 
The requests are
overbroad because they seek documents related to all GM vehicles equipped with
the same transmission as the Subject Vehicle, worldwide. These requests will be
limited to documents concerning 2016 Yukon XL’s sold in California.  
The Motion is GRANTED
in part. 
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories or demand for production of documents unless the party subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or the sanction would
otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310,
subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
The Court finds that Defendant acted with
substantial justification.
