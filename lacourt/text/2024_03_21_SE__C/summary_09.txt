And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants defendant Jose Sanchez-Alvarez's motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against him. The motion was filed within the 180-day time limit specified in California Civil Procedure Code (CCP) §473.5. The defendant declares that he did not receive actual notice of the action in time to appear and defend himself, and that he has a meritorious defense. The judge finds the defendant's declarations sufficient to warrant relief and grants the motion. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's order and to file, serve, and reserve a hearing date for his proposed demurrer within 5 court days of the order.
