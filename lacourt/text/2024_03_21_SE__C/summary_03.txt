The default was entered after Defendant failed to respond to the lawsuit. Defendant filed the Motion to Set Aside Default on September 21, 2023, and the Court has reviewed the Declaration of Thomas A. Goodwin, which provides sufficient evidence to warrant relief. The Court notes that the law favors trials on the merits, and the liberality associated with Motions to Set Aside Defaults is well-established. The Defendant is ordered to file his proposed answer within five court days of the Court's issuance of this order.
