Defendant JOSE SANCHEZ-ALVAREZ’s Motion to Set Aside Default
and Default Judgment is GRANTED.  
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED as to the
existence of the document. (Cal. Ev. Code §452.) 
 
Defendant’s Proposed Demurrer attached as Exhibit G to the
Reply is not deemed served and filed as of the hearing date. Moving Party is ORDERED to FILE, SERVE, and RESERVE A HEARING DATE
for the Proposed Demurrer within 5 court days of the Court’s issuance of this
Order. 
 
This breach of contract action was filed by Plaintiff
CHRISTINA LOZA (“Plaintiff”) on January 3, 2023. 
 
Default was entered against Defendant JOSE SANCHEZ-ALVAREZ
(“Defendant”) on September 5, 2023. Default Judgment was entered against
Defendant on January 23, 2024. 
 
Defendant now moves to set aside the default under CCP §473.5.

CCP §473.5 sets the time limit as requiring the motion to be
filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i)
two years after entry of a default judgment; or (ii) 180 days after service on
the party of a written notice that a default or default judgment had been
entered. (CCP §473.5(a).) “Notice of motion to set aside
the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action shall
designate as the time for making the motion a date prescribed by subdivision
(b) of Section 1005, and it shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the party’s lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was
not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party
shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other
pleading proposed to be filed in the action.” 
(CCP § 473.5(b).)
 
Here, the default was entered on
September 5, 2023. This motion was filed on January 19, 2024, which is within 180
days of September 5, 2023.  The motion is
timely.  
 
Defendant Sanchez-Alvarez declares, under penalty of
perjury, that he was no longer employed and/or associated with EXP on July 7,
2023 when the Summons was allegedly subserved onto him by leaving a copy within
someone at EXP. (Sanchez-Alvarez Decl., ¶11.) 
 
Under CCP §473.5, the Court may set aside a default or
default judgment if “(1) [defendant] received through no inexcusable fault of
his own, no actual notice of the action in time to appear and defendant, and
had not made a general appearance; (2) a default or default judgment has been
entered against him by the court; (3) he acted with reasonable diligence in
serving and filing the notice of motion to set aside the default or default
judgment; and (4) he has a meritorious defense.” (CCP §473.5.) 
 
The policy of hearing cases on
their merits is well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971)
17 Cal.App.3d 900.) Given the liberality associated with Motions to Set
Aside Defaults, the Court finds the declarations of
Defendant Sanchez-Alvarez sufficient to warrant to relief. The law
favors trials on the merits. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th
975, 980.) The Court finds adequate grounds to allow Defendant
the opportunity to defend themselves on the merits of this action.
