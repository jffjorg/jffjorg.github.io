Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA, has moved to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in this case. The defendant has submitted evidence of a valid arbitration agreement in the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC), which was signed by the plaintiff. However, the court finds that the arbitration agreement does not cover the controversy in this case. The plaintiff's claims arise from the defendant's statutory obligation to reimburse consumers or replace their vehicles when unable to repair them, and not from the sales contract. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.
