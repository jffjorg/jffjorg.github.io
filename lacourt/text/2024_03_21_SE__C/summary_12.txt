And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining Defendant Gloria Martinez's demurrer to Plaintiff's complaint for unlawful detainer. The complaint was filed by Plaintiffs Mary Lou Soto and Jose Sota against multiple defendants, including Gloria Martinez, on December 20, 2023. The demurrer was filed on behalf of Gloria Martinez, and the judge has determined that the complaint is uncertain and fails to sufficiently allege or address certain facts. Specifically, the complaint lacks clarity regarding the terms of the tenancy agreement between the parties, how the defendants allegedly breached the agreement, and the notice to vacate the premises. The judge has given the Plaintiffs 10 days to amend the complaint to address these deficiencies.
