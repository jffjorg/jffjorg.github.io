      CASE NO.: 22STCV29648
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 
Dept.
  27
1:30
  p.m.
December
  7, 2023



 
Plaintiff’s attorney of record, Daniel
Azizi, seeks to be relieved because there has been an irreparable breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship that prevents effective representation. 
For a Motion to Withdraw, California
Rule of Court 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion to be directed
to the client; (2) a declaration stating in general terms the basis for the
withdrawal, without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship; (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on
all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel. Counsel’s Motion complies with Rule 3.1362.  
Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Here, trial is currently set for March 11, 2024, with a final status
conference on February 26, 2024. 
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to
counsel’s motion. 
The Court finds that no prejudice will
result to Plaintiff in granting the Motion because the dates for trial and
final status conference can be changed if necessary to ensure Plaintiff is not
prejudiced by counsel’s withdrawal.
Thus, the Court GRANTS Counsel’s Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel upon the filing of a proof of service by Counsel
demonstrating that defendant was given notice of this ruling. Such proof of
service and filing of it must be completed within 7 calendar days of this ruling.
