The court has granted Defendant City of Gardena's motions to compel responses to discovery requests. The motions were filed due to Plaintiff Eileen Vargas's failure to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents, and Requests for Admission. The court finds that Plaintiff has waived all objections, including privilege and work product, by failing to provide timely responses. The court does not award monetary sanctions. The court orders Plaintiff to provide responses to the discovery requests without objection within 30 days of the date of this order.
