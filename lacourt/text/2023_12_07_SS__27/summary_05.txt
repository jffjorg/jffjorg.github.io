And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel brought by Daniel Azizi, the attorney of record for Plaintiff Donyea Richardson. Azizi seeks to withdraw due to an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, which prevents effective representation. The judge finds that Azizi's motion complies with California Rule of Court 3.1362, and absent a showing of resulting prejudice, the request for withdrawal should be granted. Since the trial is currently set for March 11, 2024, and the final status conference is on February 26, 2024, the judge finds that no prejudice will result to the plaintiff if the motion is granted. Therefore, the judge grants the motion, but requires Azizi to file proof of service demonstrating that the defendant was given notice of this ruling within 7 calendar days.
