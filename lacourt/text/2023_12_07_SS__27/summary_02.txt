And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by defendant's attorney, Stephen C. Pasarow. The motion was filed because the defendants, Mike Yura Hovannisyan and Tehmine Mailyan, have failed to cooperate with defense counsel and have not consented to sign a substitution of attorney. The Court has previously ordered that State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, the defendants' insurer, will no longer provide a defense due to the defendants' lack of cooperation.

The Court has granted counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel for the defendants, but has given the defendants time to obtain new counsel or prepare to represent themselves before the trial on April 8, 2024. The Court has also ordered that the defendants must file proof of service demonstrating that they were given notice of this ruling within 7 calendar days.
