ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On April 1, 2022, Via Champ (“Plaintiff”),
filed a Complaint against United Parcel Service (“Defendant”) for personal
injuries arising from an April 3, 2020 motor vehicle and pedestrian incident.
The Defendant's employee, Summit Prasertsit, was maneuvering his vehicle away
from a parking spot when his truck hit a metal bench. The Plaintiff alleges she
was seated on the bench at the time of the incident.
 
On May 18, 2022, Defendant filed
and served their answer. Defendant also served Form Interrogatories, Set One;
Special Interrogatories, Set One; and Request for Production of Documents, Set
One. Responses were initially due on June 21, 2022. 
 
On June 17, 2022, Plaintiff’s
Counsel requested a thirty-day extension to July 21, 2022, to provide discovery
responses. 
 
On August 11, 2022, Plaintiff
granted another extension to provide discovery responses. 
 
On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff’s
counsel informed Defense counsel, Themba Nelson, that they lost contact with
Plaintiff and could not provide discovery responses or a medical update.
Plaintiff’s lead counsel, Mr. Rickie Ivie, was engaged in a trial but would
file a motion requesting to be relieved as counsel. 
 
On October 21, 2022, Plaintiff’s
counsel continued to indicate that they intended to withdraw as counsel. 
 
On December 20, 2022, Plaintiff’s
counsel indicated that they still did not contact Plaintiff but believed that
she was incapacitated and/or hospitalized. 
 
As of February 24, 2023, Defense
counsel called Plaintiff’s counsel to confirm that they had not found Plaintiff.

 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel hired an investigator to locate Plaintiff, and told Defense counsel
that if they were not successful, they would make a motion to be relieved as
counsel. 
 
On June 21, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel told Defense counsel that they received information from their
investigator which could lead to the location of Plaintiff and requested
another extension. Furthermore, on July 7, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel indicated
that they spoke with Plaintiff’s sister, Georgia, to help aid in the search for
Plaintiff. However, all attempts to locate Plaintiff failed. 
 
On July 18, 2023, the parties
signed and filed a joint stipulation to continue the trial date. Subsequently,
the court granted the request and agreed to continue the trial from September
29, 2023, to February 27, 2024. 
 
On August 4, 2023, Defense counsel
spoke with Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr. Ivie, who informed him that they still had
not been in contact with Plaintiff. Plaintiff’s family has also not been able
to reach Plaintiff to inform her that her father recently passed away. Counsel
requested additional time to locate Plaintiff, and if unsuccessful, they would
not object to a motion to dismiss this case and would sign a declaration to
that effect if necessary. 
 
On August 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel indicated that they would have no opposition to any motion to dismiss
due to their inability to locate Plaintiff and their inability to continue to
assist her in the prosecution of this matter.
 
            On September
19, 2023, Defendant United Parcel Service filed the instant Motion to Dismiss
(“Motion”).  No opposition has been
filed.
 
II.                
Legal Standard & Discussion
 
The Moving Party moves to dismiss
the Complaint for failure to prosecute pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure § 583.410 because Plaintiff failed to respond to any discovery
responses due on June 21, 2022 and her counsel has lost all contact with her. Moreover,
Plaintiff’s counsel did not oppose the motion. 
 
Under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
583.410, the court may, in its discretion, dismiss an action for delay in
prosecution if it deems such action appropriate under the circumstances. In
considering a motion for discretionary dismissal, the court is guided by the
factors outlined in California Rule of Court 3.1342, as established in Corrinet
v. Bardy, 35 Cal.App.5th 69, 71 (Cal. Ct. App. 2019.) Rule 3.1342 states
that a proper determination of a motion to dismiss for delay in prosecution
must consider: (1) The court's case file, declarations, and supporting data
from the parties, as well as the availability of essential parties for service
of process; (2) Diligence in seeking to effect service of process; (3)
Engagement in settlement negotiations or discussions; (4) Diligence in pursuing
discovery or other pretrial proceedings, including extraordinary relief; (5)
The nature and complexity of the case; (6) Applicable laws and related
litigation; (7) Extensions of time or delays attributable to either party; (8)
Court calendar conditions and earlier trial date availability; (9) Whether
justice is best served by dismissal or trial; or (10) Any other relevant fact
or circumstance.
 
Here, Rule 3.1342’s factors 4,7,
and 10 are at issue. Defendant served Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One to
Plaintiff on May 18, 2022 which were initially due on June 21, 2022. (Themba
Nelson’s Declaration, ¶2.) Defendant gave Plaintiff about five separate
extensions of time to respond; the last extension provided Plaintiff until July
19, 2023 to respond. (Id. at ¶3; Exhibit B.) To this date,
the Plaintiff failed to provide responses to the discovery requests, nor has
she been accessible to her legal representation or shown any initiative in
advancing the prosecution of this case. (Id. at ¶11; Exhibit B.) Importantly,
Plaintiff’s counsel indicated that they would not oppose the motion due to
their inability to locate the Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶9,10; Exhibit B.)
Thus, Plaintiff’s failure in diligently pursuing discovery even with multiple
extensions shows that the Court may dismiss the action. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that
Defendant has presented sufficient evidence or arguments demonstrating that the
Court must dismiss the action because of Plaintiff’s failure to respond to
discovery responses for over a year and her lack of contact with her counsel.  Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III.             
Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, the Motion to Dismiss,
filed by Defendant United Parcel Service, is GRANTED without prejudice.
 
Moving party is to give notice.
