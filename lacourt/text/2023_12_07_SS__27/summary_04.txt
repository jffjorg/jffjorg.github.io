```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the defendant's motion to dismiss the case is granted without prejudice. The plaintiff failed to respond to discovery requests and her counsel lost contact with her, making it impossible to continue the prosecution of the case. The defendant served discovery requests in May 2022, but the plaintiff failed to respond, and despite multiple extensions, the plaintiff failed to provide responses. The plaintiff's counsel indicated that they would not oppose the motion due to their inability to locate the plaintiff. The judge finds that the defendant has presented sufficient evidence to support the dismissal of the case and grants the motion.
