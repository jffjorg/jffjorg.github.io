      CASE NO.: 21STCV11800
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 
Dept.
  27
1:30
  p.m.
December
  7, 2023



 
Defendant Tehmine Mailyan and Defendant
Mike Yura Hovannisyan’s attorney of record, Stephen C. Pasarow, seeks to be
relieved because Defendants have failed to cooperate with defense counsel and failed
to consent to sign a substitution of attorney.  Counsel has filed two motions, one to be
relieved as to each Defendant.
Defendants’ insurer State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company ("State Farm”) initially provided their
defense. However, on August 24, 2023, the Court issued an order finding there
is no coverage under State Farm's policy no. 648-9109-F13- 75 "because
Defendant Tehmine Mailyan and Defendant Mike Hovhannisyan materially failed to
cooperate with the claim investigation regarding the February 18, 2020,
accident described in the Complaint." The Court further found that no
defendant is entitled to coverage under the policy. Therefore, State Farm will
no longer provide a defense for Defendants. 
For a Motion to Withdraw, California
Rule of Court 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion to be directed
to the client; (2) a declaration stating in general terms the basis for the
withdrawal, without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship; (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on
all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel. Counsel’s Motions comply with California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362.  
Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)  Here, trial is currently set
for April 8, 2024, with a final status conference on March 25, 2024. 
Each Defendant has not filed an
opposition to Counsel’s motion. 
Defendants have time before trial to
obtain counsel or to prepare to represent themselves.  Further, Defendants were aware of Counsel's
intention to be relieved as counsel of record prior to the motion.  And, in any event, the dates for trial and
final status conference can be changed if necessary to ensure Defendants are
not prejudiced by counsel’s withdrawal.
Thus, the Court GRANTS Counsel’s Motions
to Be Relieved as Counsel for Defendants upon the filing proofs of service by
Counsel demonstrating that each Defendant was given notice of this ruling. Such
proofs of service and filing of them must be completed within 7 calendar days
of this ruling.
