MOTION
TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF FRANKESKA WILSON’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES,
SET ONE AND SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE 


 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Juan Guerrero, Jr. 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Frankeska
Wilson 
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On August 24, 2022, Reuben Creech (“Creech”) and Frankeska
Wilson (“Wilson”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Claribel
Reyes (“Reyes”), Juan Guerrero Jr. (“Guerrero”), and Does 1 to 10
(collectively, “Defendants”) for injuries arising from a motor vehicle collision.
 
On February 1, 2023, Defendant Guerrero served Plaintiff Wilson
with Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories and responses were due on
March 6, 2023.
 
On April 20, 2023, Plaintiff Wilson submitted her discovery
responses.
 
On May 1, 2023, Defendant Guerrero’s counsel sent Plaintiff
Wilson’s counsel a Meet and Confer Letter requesting verified responses by May
8, 2023; however, no responses were provided. 
 
On September 8, 2023, the parties participated in an
Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) with the Court regarding the motion to
compel but the discovery issues were not resolved.
            
            On November
13, 2023, Defendant Guerrero filed this motion to compel further responses. 
 
Plaintiff did not file an opposition.  
 
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR COMPELLING FURTHER
RESPONSES  
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300 and 2033.290, parties may move for a
further response to interrogatories or requests for admission where an answer
to the requests are evasive or incomplete or where an objection is without
merit or too general.   
 
California
Code of Civil Procedure §2030.230(a) requires each answer in response to
interrogatories to “be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to responding party permits.” ¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.300, subd. (a).)
            Notice of
the motion must be given within 45 days of service of the verified response,
otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c); 2033.290, subd. (c).)¿ The
motion must also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b); 2033.290, subd. (b).)¿¿¿¿ 
Finally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving further discovery
contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a
statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3).)  
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Moving Party: Defendant argues that Plaintiff
Wilson’s untimely responses to Form Interrogatories numbers: 2.6; 2.7; 4.1(d);
10.1; 10.2; 10.3; 11.1; 11.2; 17.1. and to Special Interrogatory numbers 7, 8,
and 9 were incomplete and evasive. 
 
            Responding Party: Plaintiff did not provide an
opposition. 
 
A.   
Timeliness
 
Notice
of the motion must be given within 45 days of service of the verified response,
otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)  
 
Here,
Plaintiff not only untimely provided responses on April 20, 2023, because they
were due on March 6, 2023, but also failed to verify the responses. (Victoire
Marqué’s Declaration, ¶¶2,3.) Defendant’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter
to Plaintiff’s counsel on May 1, 2023, requesting verified responses to said
discovery by May 1, 2023. (Id. at ¶5.) After not receiving
verified responses, Defendant Guerrero filed his motion to compel further responses
on November 13, 2023. (Notice of Motion and Motion to Compel, p.1; Victoire
Marqué’s Declaration, ¶7.) Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant
Guerrero timely made his motion to compel because Plaintiff never filed
verified responses, and, therefore, the 45-daytime limit does not apply.  
 
B.     Meet and Confer 
 
A
motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b); 2033.290, subd.
(b).)¿ 
 
Defendant Guerrero submits declarations detailing his
counsel’s meet and confer efforts; at the Informal Discovery Conference, the
Court recommended that Defendant Guerrero proceed with filing his Motion to
Compel. (Victoire Marqué’s Declaration, ¶8.) Thus, the Court finds that Defendant
Guerrero has satisfied the meet and confer requirement. 
 
C.     Analysis
 
Defendant seeks an order compelling Form
Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One. Under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.300 and 2033.290, parties may move for a further
response to interrogatories or requests for admission where an answer to the is
incomplete or evasive. 
Plaintiff responded to Nos. 2.6 ,2.7, 4.1(d), 10.1, 10.3, 11.1 and 11.2
as follows: “discovery and investigation continuing. Plaintiff reserves the
right to supplement and/or amend this response” which requested her education, employment,
injuries, insurance, and workers’ compensation information. (Plaintiff
Frankeska Wilson’s Responses p.5-6, 9, 15-17.) Further, Plaintiff responded
“[n]ot applicable” to No. 10.2, which requested her physical, mental, and
emotional disabilities immediately before the incident. (Id. at 15.) Form Interrogatory No. 17.1, requested a specific
response to each Request for Admissions she denied, however, Plaintiff provided
general responses to these requests. (Id. at 23.)
Plaintiff also responded to Special
Interrogatory Nos. 7, 8, and 9 which requested pharmacy information, Medicare
benefits, and Medicare Health Insurance Claim number with “discovery and
investigation continuing. Plaintiff reserves the right to supplement and/or
amend this response.” (Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories p.5.)
Therefore, Plaintiff Wilson’s responses were not only untimely and unverified
but also evasive and incomplete because they were standard questions for a personal
injury case, all of which could have been addressed at the time requested.
 
Accordingly, the unopposed motion is GRANTED as to Form
Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
            
The motion to compel further discovery responses is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Wilson is ordered to provide
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories,
Set One within twenty days of the date of this Order. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
