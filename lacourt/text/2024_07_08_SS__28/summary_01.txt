And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery and conduct two depositions. The plaintiff had claimed that her counsel made a mistake by requesting expert depositions after the expert discovery cutoff, and asked the court to grant relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. However, the judge found that the motion did not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, and that the plaintiff had not shown diligence in scheduling the depositions. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions. Instead, the judge granted Youthfill's request for sanctions and ordered the plaintiff and her counsel to pay Youthfill $750.00.
