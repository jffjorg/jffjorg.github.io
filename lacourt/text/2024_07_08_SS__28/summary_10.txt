Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The case was filed on June 26, 2023, by Plaintiff Jose Quinteros Amaya against Defendants Isaac Medina Gonzalez and Does 1-10 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The Defendant filed an answer on September 12, 2023, and later filed a motion to reclassify the case as a limited civil case on May 10, 2024. The court has denied the motion. The Defendant argued that the case was improperly classified as an unlimited civil case because a verdict will necessarily be less than $35,000.00. However, the court found that the Defendant did not show that recovery of more than $35,000.00 in combined general and special damages is "virtually unattainable". The court notes that general damages, such as pain and suffering, are not subject to precise measurement and their translation into money damages is peculiarly the function of the trier of the facts. Therefore, the court denies the motion to reclassify the case as a limited civil case.
