LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
C.      Requests for admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Sanchez’s discovery 
On May
3, 2024, Sanchez served request for production, set one, special
interrogatories, set one, form interrogatories, set one, and requests for
admission, set one, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Sanchez
filed these motions on June 10, 2024. 
B.   Plaintiff’s late responses 
Plaintiff
asserts that on June 18, 2024, she served verified, objection-free responses to
Sanchez’s request for production, special interrogatories, form interrogatories,
and requests for admission, making Sanchez’s motions moot.  Plaintiff asks the Court to impose sanctions
on Sanchez because Sanchez refused to take the motions off calendar. 
C.   Sanchez’s motions and sanctions requests 
1.    Request for production 
Sanchez
argues that Plaintiff’s responses to the request for production are not code-compliant
because the statement of inability to comply with requests 4-7 is inadequate.  But when the party demanding responses deems
that “[a] representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive,” the demanding party may move for an order compelling further responses
to the demand (if the demanding party can comply with the motion’s statutory requirements).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2).)  The Court therefore denies Sanchez’s motion to
compel responses to the request for production as moot. 
Sanchez
also asks the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiff based on the late
responses.  Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.300, with certain exceptions, “the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response
to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff did not unsuccessfully make or
oppose a motion to compel.  Therefore,
sanctions are not available under this statute. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award here.  Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions
may not be imposed based solely on [the statute].  Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if
authorized by some other provision of the Discovery Act.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery
process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or other provision of this title”].) 
2.    Special and form interrogatories 
Sanchez
argues that Plaintiff’s responses to the special and form interrogatories are
not code-compliant because they are incomplete and evasive (the special
interrogatories) and improper, disingenuous, and in bad faith (the form
interrogatories).  But if the propounding
party deems responses to interrogatories are “evasive or incomplete,” the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response (if the
propounding party can comply with the motion’s statutory requirements).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1).)  The Court therefore denies Sanchez’s motions
to compel responses to the special and form interrogatories as moot. 
Sanchez
also asks the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiff based on the late
responses.  Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, with certain exceptions, “the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to interrogatories . . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff did not unsuccessfully make or
oppose a motion to compel.  Therefore,
sanctions are not available under this statute. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award here.  Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 is “ ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions
may not be imposed based solely on [the statute].  Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if
authorized by some other provision of the Discovery Act.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery
process “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or other provision of this title”].) 
3.    Requests for admission 
Sanchez
argues that Plaintiff’s responses to the requests for admission are not “code-compliant.”  But if responses are “in substantial
compliance” with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220, the Court may not deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Here, Sanchez identifies only Plaintiff’s
response to one request for admission as deficient: “Admit that YOU have been
provided with no less than 17 camera views from the subject bus’s camera
system.”   Plaintiff responded:
“Plaintiff cannot admit or deny, therefore deny.”  The Court finds that the response is in substantial
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220 for purposes of Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c). 
“It
is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated [a
motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Sanchez requests $1,200.00 in sanctions based
on 2.4 hours of attorney time at an hourly rate of $500.00.  Counsel spent 1.4 hours preparing the moving
papers and anticipated spending 0.5 hours to review any opposition and prepare
a reply and 0.5 hours to appear at the hearing. 
The Court awards $600.00 in sanctions based on 2.4 hours of attorney
time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour. 
D.   Plaintiff’s sanctions requests 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to impose sanctions on Sanchez under Code of Civil Procedure
section 128.5 because he did not take his motions off calendar after Plaintiff
served her discovery responses. 
Sanchez
was not required to take his motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests
for admission off calendar because he was entitled to pursue sanctions under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c). 
Even
if Sanchez should have taken his motions to compel responses to the requests
for production, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories off calendar
after Plaintiff served her late responses, Plaintiff has not cited a statutory basis
for sanctions.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
128.5, subd. (e) [“This section shall not apply to disclosures and discovery
requests, responses, objections, and motions”].)  The Court denies Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions.

The
Court DENIES Defendant Francisco Sanchez’s motion to compel Plaintiff Maria Rivas's responses to
request for production, set one, and request for sanctions.
