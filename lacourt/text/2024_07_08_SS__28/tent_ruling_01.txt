to conduct two depositions and (2) to impose sanctions on Defendants. 
Youthfill
asks the Court to deny the motion and impose sanctions on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Motion to reopen discovery 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 provides: 
“(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action. 
“(b) Except as provided in Section 2024.050, a
continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen
discovery proceedings.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020.) Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.030 provides: 
 "Any
party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings
pertaining to a witness identified under Chapter 18 (commencing with Section
2034.010) on or before the 15th day, and to have motions concerning that
discovery heard on or before the 10th day, before the date initially set for
the trial of the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.030.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 provides: 
“(a) On motion of any party, the court may grant leave
to complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery
heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new
trial date has been set. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(b) In exercising its discretion to grant or deny
this motion, the court shall take into consideration any matter relevant to the
leave requested, including, but not limited to, the following: 
“(1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery. 
“(2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the party
seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons
that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard
earlier. 
“(3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or
hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the
date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in
prejudice to any other party. 
“(4) The length of time that has elapsed between any
date previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen
discovery, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.050.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2016.040 provides: “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
B.   Discretionary relief under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 473 provides in part: 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve
a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b).) 

DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
asserts that her counsel “inadvertently and mistakenly requested expert
depositions after the expert discovery cutoff . . . .”  (Motion p. 2.)  Plaintiff asks the Court to grant relief from
this error under the discretionary provisions of Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b), and reopen discovery or expert discovery to allow Plaintiff to
conduct these depositions. 
Plaintiff’s
motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.050, which governs requests to reopen discovery, because it does not
include a meet and confer declaration.  And
Plaintiff cites no authority allowing a Court to reopen discovery based on
attorney mistake or inadvertence under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(b), when the moving party has not satisfied the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 2024.050. 
In
addition, the Court has considered the matters relevant to Plaintiff’s request to
reopen discovery.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (b).)  Plaintiff has not shown diligence in
scheduling the depositions at issue.  The
Court exercises its discretion to deny Plaintiff’s motion. 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, subdivision (c), “[t]he court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to extend or to reopen discovery, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b).) 
Youthfill
requests $14,615.00 in sanctions based on 29 hours of attorney time.  Counsel spent 5 hours at an hourly rate of
$700.00 and 24 hours at an hourly rate of $450 to prepare Youthfill’s opposition
to Plaintiff’s motion.  The Court grants
sanctions of $750.00 based on three hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate
of $250.00 per hour. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Anna Larmie’s motion to reopen discovery and request for
sanctions. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Youthfill MD XIX,
LLC’s request for sanctions and orders Plaintiff Anna Larmie and her counsel to
pay Defendant Youthfill MD XIX, LLC
$750.00 by August 7, 2024. 
Moving
