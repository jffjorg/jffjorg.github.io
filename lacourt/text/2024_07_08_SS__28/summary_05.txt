And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Anthony Sykes, is seeking to vacate the dismissal of Elmer Aguilar, one of the defendants, without prejudice. The plaintiff argues that the dismissal resulted from his counsel's mistake and inadvertence in failing to inform the court that the lawsuit had been served on Aguilar. However, the judge finds that the dismissal was due to the plaintiff's failure to obtain Aguilar's default and delay in prosecuting the case, despite the court's repeated instructions to file proof of service of a statement of damages. The judge denies the motion to vacate the dismissal and orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
