And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers in this case and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Nicholas Johnson, has requested leave to add a punitive damage claim to his complaint, which was previously dismissed with prejudice. The defendants, Dawn Renaye Murray-Santos, Mike Santos, and Maggie Frederick, oppose the addition of the punitive damage claim and request to continue the trial and related dates.

The Court grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a punitive damage claim. The plaintiff shall file and serve a first amended complaint within 30 days of the hearing on this motion.

The Court denies the motion to continue the trial and related dates filed by the defendants for lack of proper notice. The defendants did not serve their motion with the required statutory notice, and they did not respond to the plaintiff's argument on this point.

The Court's ruling is based on the laws and rules governing motions to amend pleadings and motions to continue trials, including Code of Civil Procedure sections 473, 576, 2024.020, and 2024.050, and California Rules of Court, rules 3.1324 and 3.1332.
