 Case Number:  23STCV14832    Hearing Date:   July 8, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On
June 26, 2023, Plaintiff Jose Quinteros Amaya (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Isaac Medina Gonzalez (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for motor
vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
September 12 ,2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
May 10, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to reclassify the case as a limited civil case.  The motion was set for hearing on July 8, 2024.  Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for December 23, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Defendant
asks the Court to reclassify the case as a limited civil case. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 403.040 provides in part: 
“(a) The plaintiff, cross-complainant, or petitioner
may file a motion for reclassification within the time allowed for that party
to amend the initial pleading. The defendant or cross-defendant may file a
motion for reclassification within the time allowed for that party to respond
to the initial pleading. The court, on its own motion, may reclassify a case at
any time. A motion for reclassification does not extend the moving party’s time
to amend or answer or otherwise respond. The court shall grant the motion and
enter an order for reclassification, regardless of any fault or lack of fault,
if the case has been classified in an incorrect jurisdictional classification. 
“(b) If a party files a motion for reclassification
after the time for that party to amend that party’s initial pleading or to
respond to a complaint, cross-complaint, or other initial pleading, the court
shall grant the motion and enter an order for reclassification only if both of
the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The case is incorrectly classified. 
“(2) The moving party shows good cause for not seeking
reclassification earlier.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040,
subds. (a), (b).) 
          Limited civil cases include cases in which “the demand,
exclusive of interest, or the value of the property in controversy amounts to thirty-five
thousand dollars ($35,000) or less.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 86, subd. (a)(1).)   
“[A]
matter may be reclassified as a limited civil action ‘when (i) the absence of
jurisdiction is apparent before trial from the complaint, petition, or related
documents, or (ii) during the course of pretrial litigation, it becomes clear
that the matter will “necessarily” result in a verdict below the superior
court's jurisdictional amount . . . .’ ”  (Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 266, 276-277 (Ytuarte), quoting Walker v. Superior Court
(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262 (Walker).)  “Even more appropriately, ‘... the test [is]
... whether “lack of jurisdiction is clear”...’ [or] virtually unattainable....”
’ ” (Id. at p. 277, quoting Walker, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p.
269.)  “This standard involves an
evaluation of the amount fairly in controversy, not an adjudication of the
merits of the claim, and according to Walker, requires a ‘high level of
certainty that [the] damage award will not exceed [the jurisdictional limit].’”
(Ibid., quoting Walker, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 269.) “The Supreme
Court explained: ‘ “The [trial] court may believe it highly unlikely that
plaintiff will recover the amount demanded, but this is not enough to defeat
jurisdiction, unless it appears to a legal certainty that plaintiff cannot
recover the amount [of the] demand[ ]”.’ “  (Ibid., quoting Walker, supra,
53 Cal.3d at p. 270; see Maldonado v. Superior Court (1996) 45
Cal.App.4th 397, 402 [“The unlikeliness of a judgment in excess of [the
jurisdictional amount] is not the test. The trial court reviews the record to
determine whether the result is obtainable. Simply stated, the trial court
looks to the possibility of a jurisdictionally appropriate verdict, not to its
probability”].) 
“Accordingly
under Walker the superior court must deny the motion to reclassify the
case as limited (and thus keep the matter in the unlimited civil court) unless
it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff's damages will necessarily
be less than [the jurisdictional amount]. This standard of ‘legal certainty’ is
not met when it appears a verdict within the unlimited court's jurisdiction is ‘possible.’
”  (Ytuarte, supra, 129
Cal.App.4th at p. 277.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   The complaint 
The
complaint alleges that on August 9, 2021, at Grand View Street at or near 7th
Street in Los Angeles, Defendants negligently
entrusted, managed, maintained, drove and operated their motor vehicle, causing
a collision with Plaintiff's vehicle and injuring Plaintiff.  Plaintiff seeks general and special damages. 
    B.   Defendant’s motion 
Defendant
asserts that the case was improperly classified as an unlimited civil case
because a verdict will necessarily be less than $35,000.00.  Defendant contends that "[g]ood cause exists for seeking the reclassification at
this juncture, because information regarding the Plaintiff’s limited medical
specials and property damage was not available to Defendant at the time of the
answer to the Complaint, and only became apparent following ongoing discovery.”  (Motion p. 4.) 
According to Defendant, on
January 4, 2024, Plaintiff served discovery
responses indicating that his medical specials are $5,290.00, property damage is
$7,500, damages for loss of use is $1,350.00, and damages for loss of a child
car seat is $150.00.  In addition, Plaintiff is not pursuing a loss of earnings
claim, he has not sought treatment in connection with this claim since December
2021, and he has no future medical appointments related to the accident.  Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s total damages claim is only $14,290.00 and is therefore below the $35,000.00 jurisdictional limit. 
C.   Analysis 
Defendant’s
motion does not address Plaintiff’s request for general damages.  As a result, Defendant has not shown that recovery
of more than $35,000.00 in combined general and special damages is “ ‘ “virtually
unattainable.” ’ ” (Ytuarte, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 277, quoting
Walker, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p. 269.) 
“ ‘
“Pain and suffering are not subject to precise measurement by any scale, and
their translation into money damages is peculiarly the function of the trier of
the facts.” ’ [Citation.]” (Singer v. Superior Court (1999) 70
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320, quoting Walker, supra, 53 Cal.3d at p.
269.)  “If any of several claims joined
in the complaint exceeds [the amount in controversy], no part of the case is
subject to the rules governing limited civil cases.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 3:104, p. 3-15.) 
The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Isaac Medina
Gonzalez’s motion to reclassify the case as a limited civil case. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
