Plaintiff Kapitus LLC (“Plaintiff”) seeks default judgment
against Defendants Pal Percent Inc. (“Pal Percent”) and James Chung (collectively,
“Defendants”).
 
Plaintiff requests:
 
(1) money judgment in the amount of $62,191.44, consisting
of:
 
(a) damages in the amount of $54,219.00;

 
(b) interest in the amount of $5,303.06;
 
(c) costs in the amount of $695.00;
 
(d) attorney’s fees in the amount
of $1,974.38;
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for default judgment.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff seeks to collect on that Defendants owe to it
pursuant to an agreement that the parties entered (the “Agreement”). 
 
Under the agreement, Plaintiff purchased the right to
receive 6.5% of the revenue of Defendant Pal Percent’s business until Plaintiff
received $55,970.00. Plaintiff paid defendant a gross amount of $38,600.00,
with a net purchase price of $17,5900.00 after accounting for the closing fee
and other payments provided for by the Agreement. Chung acted as a guarantor
for Pal Percent.
 
The Agreement provided that Defendant would pay the money
into an account and that Plaintiff would be authorized to debit $1,437.00 per
week from the account (the “Minimum Amount”). The minimum amount was to be
reconciled with Defendant’s actual revenue once every 30 days, if Defendant
requested reconciliation. The Agreement provided that Defendant would not be
entitled to reconciliation if Defendant defaulted.
 
Beginning on March 1, 2023, Defendant failed to make
payments into the account adequate to cover the weekly Minimum Amount.
Plaintiff gave notice of default to Pal Percent and Chung, but Defendants
failed to pay the amounts due.
 
The Agreement provides that unpaid amount owed by Defendant
would become due immediately upon Defendant’s default.
 
Plaintiff filed this action on July 21, 2023, raising claims
for (1) breach of contract; and (2) breach of contract (guaranty).
 
Default was entered against Defendants on March 6, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7));
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the complaint
or cross-complaint.  (Molen v.
Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
             
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
            Chung
was served on September 1, 2023 at 800 S Harvard Blvd, Apt 301, Los Angeles,
California 90005 by substitute service on his wife, Sophia Chung.
 
            Pal
Percent was served on December 18, 2023 at the office of the California
Secretary of State by substitute service on the Deputy Secretary of State, Pal
Percent’s authorized agent for service of process.
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants were dismissed from the action on March
13, 2024, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Michael H. Delbick avers to Defendant’s non-military status.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in the
Declaration of Vahan Gabrielyan. Plaintiff adequately pleads its causes of
action in the Complaint.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 580 prohibits the entry of
a default judgment in an amount in excess of that demanded in the complaint.”  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.) Moreover, “a statement of damages cannot be relied
upon to establish a plaintiff's monetary damages, except in cases of personal
injury or wrongful death.” (Ibid.) “In all other cases, when recovering
damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages
specified in the complaint.” (Ibid.)
 
            David
Zullo avers that Plaintiff owes an outstanding amount of $54,219.00 under the
agreement, which includes a default fee of $2,500.00 and “other authorized fees.”
(Zullo Decl. ¶ 11.)
 
 
Interest
 
The Complaint requests interest on the unpaid amount at the
rate of 10% per annum. 
 
Michael H. Delbick avers that $5,303.06 in interest has
accrued from March 1, 2023 to February 21, 2024.
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff includes a memorandum of costs in the submitted
Form CIV-100, averring that it expended $695.00 in costs.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiff
requests $1,974.38 in attorney’s fees.
 
This is an action on a contract. Because the judgment is
between $50,000.01 and $100,000, the maximum recovery of attorney’s fees is equal
to $1,890 plus 2% of the excess over $50,000.00. (Local Rule 3.214.) Thus, Plaintiff
may request $1,974.38 in attorney’s fees. Plaintiff’s request is therefore
proper.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
            Plaintiff
has submitted a proposed form of judgment consistent with the foregoing.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
            California
Rule of Court 3.1806 states that “unless otherwise ordered” judgment upon a
written obligation to pay money requires a clerk’s note across the face of the
writing that there has been a judgment. Here, Plaintiff has not submitted the
original documents. The Court does not discern any practical need for such a
clerk’s note on the written obligation in the current case and therefore orders
that it need not be included. If this causes any issues for any party or
non-party they are authorized to bring the matter to the Court’s
attention.  
 
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
