And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the request for default judgment by the Plaintiff, Bedford Law Group, APC, against the Defendant, Alberto Sanchez. The Plaintiff seeks a default judgment in the amount of $18,652.35, consisting of damages, interest, costs, and attorney's fees. The court finds that the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence of damages and interest, and therefore, the request for default judgment is denied. The court orders the Plaintiff to provide competent evidence of its damages and to amend and re-serve the complaint if it wishes to seek interest. The court also finds that the Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees is premature and must be revisited once the damages have been proven. Finally, the court notes that the Plaintiff did not submit the original written agreement, but does not require a clerk's note across the face of the writing as there is no practical need for it in this case.
