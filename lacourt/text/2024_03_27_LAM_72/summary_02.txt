And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants plaintiff Kapitus LLC's request for default judgment against defendants Pal Percent Inc. and James Chung. The defendants failed to answer or respond to the complaint, which was served on them on September 1, 2023, and December 18, 2023, respectively. The plaintiff is seeking a default judgment in the amount of $62,191.44, which includes damages, interest, costs, and attorney's fees.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has met the requirements for a default judgment, including serving the defendants with the complaint and summons, dismissing all other parties, and providing a brief summary of the case. The plaintiff has also provided admissible evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages and relief requested.

The judge notes that the defendants' default only admits facts well pleaded in the complaint, and that the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint, which is $54,219.00. The judge also finds that the plaintiff is entitled to attorney's fees in the amount of $1,974.38.

The judge orders that the clerk's note across the face of the written agreement, which is not submitted, need not be included in the judgment. The plaintiff's proposed form of judgment is approved, and the court grants the plaintiff's request for default judgment.
