And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's attempt to serve the Defendant through a managing agent in Canada is not effective. The Plaintiff tried to serve the Defendant's officer earlier this year, but the court has not received the return receipt for certified U.S. mail. The court declines to review federal cases from district courts and circuits other than the 9th Circuit, and finds that the Plaintiff's cited authorities do not support her position. The court is not aware of any authority where a managing agent outside of California successfully hailed a foreign corporation into California court. The court notes that the only method of service under California law that does not require transmission of documents abroad is service by publication, and that the Plaintiff has not addressed this option. The court also references HCCH authority indicating that Spain does not oppose the Hague Service Convention.
