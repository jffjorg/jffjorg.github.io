Plaintiff notes she tried to serve Moving Defendant’s officer earlier this year
at C & C North America’s office and the officer’s home in Florida. 
 


[2]
The court disregards Plaintiff’s authority that is not reported. [Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 8.1115.] The court declines to review those federal cases from
district courts and circuits other than the 9th Circuit. Additionally, Plaintiff
admits she has not yet received the return receipt. Accordingly, service in
this method is not yet effective. [CCP § 415.50.]
 


[3]
Of the new federal authority included with Plaintiff’s supplemental briefing
also do not support her position. (San
Antonio Winery, Inc. v. Jiaxing Micarose Trade Co. (9th Cir. 2022) 53 F.4th
1136 [concluding Hague Service Convention did not apply because the Lanham Act provided
for a domestic agent for service of process]; Khachatryan v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2008)
578 F.Supp.2d 1224 [concluding Hague Service Convention did not apply because
domestic distributor in Torrance, California was a managing agent for Japanese
corporation]; Daewoo Motor America, Inc.
v. Dongbu Fire Ins. Co., Ltd. (C.D. Cal 2001) 289 F.Supp.2d 1127
[concluding Hague Service Convention did not apply because California Insurance
Commissioner was designated agent for service of process pursuant to California
insurance law.])
 


[4]
Plaintiff also cites federal authority that is not binding on this court.
 


[5]
The court is not aware of any authority where a managing agent outside of
California successfully hailed a foreign corporation into California court. The
authorities Plaintiff has provided has not indicated such.
 


[6]
The Court in Lebel found that the
mother was not the defendant’s agent.
 


[7]
Plaintiff hinted to California’s long-arm statute, but did not develop this
argument. The court is not persuaded that it has the authority to hail a
Spanish corporation into California court via Canada.
 


[8]
The only method of service under California law which does not require the
transmission of documents abroad, and consequently does not implicate the Hague
Service Convention, is service of summons by publication where the party's
address remains unknown during the publication period despite the exercise of
reasonable diligence.”  (Kott supra, 45 Cal.App.4th, at p. 1136.)
This assumes there is not a domestic agent to accept service on behalf of the
foreign national. (See, e.g., Yamaha
Motor Co., Ltd. v. Superior Court (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 264 [discussing
domestic subsidiary as managing agent for foreign corporation.]) Additionally,
and as noted above, Plaintiff has indicated service via certified U.S. mail
with return receipt requested.

The court refers to HCCH authority indicating that Spain does not oppose
Articles 10(a) – (c). https://www.hcch.net/en/states/authorities/details3/?aid=273

Plaintiff has not addressed this case at all.
