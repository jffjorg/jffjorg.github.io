And here is a summary in English text:

The Tentative Ruling of Judge Upinder S. Kalra concerns the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Marissa Aguilera and others against Plaintiffs Samantha Rosales and Sergio Benitez. The court has reviewed the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) and has made the following decisions:

* Sustained the demurrer to the second and ninth causes of action (Breach of Warranty of Habitability and Violation of Business & Professions Code § 17200) without leave to amend.
* Overruled the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action (Violation of Los Angeles County Eviction Moratorium and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress).
* Granted the motion to strike in part, striking various references to punitive damages in the SAC.

The court also addressed several specific allegations in the SAC, including those related to private nuisance, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violation of the Los Angeles County Eviction Moratorium. In each case, the court found that the allegations were insufficient to support the claims.
