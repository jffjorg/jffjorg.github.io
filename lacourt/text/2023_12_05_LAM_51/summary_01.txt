And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons filed by Cosentino Group, S.A. (Moving Defendant). The Moving Defendant argued that the service of the summons and complaint did not comply with the Hague Service Convention, which regulates the service of process in international cases. The Moving Defendant contended that the service was not properly effected in Canada, where the process server attempted to serve Eduardo Cosentino, an officer of Cosentino Group, while he was on official business. The judge found that the service did not comply with the Hague Service Convention and therefore is invalid. The judge also rejected the plaintiff's arguments that the Hague Service Convention does not apply or that the service in Canada was proper.
