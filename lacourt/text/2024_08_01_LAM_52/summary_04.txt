And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of Eric Zimmerman's motion for a turnover order and assignment order. Zimmerman, the judgment creditor, seeks to assign Ryan Johnson's rights to payments from non-party Jamaica Mistaika Productions LLC. The court finds that Zimmerman has shown good cause for this order, as he obtained a judgment against Johnson in 2015 and they stipulated that Johnson owed $134,022.31, including accrued interest. Johnson assigned his right to payment of $55,000 to Zimmerman, but did not receive payment by the stipulated deadline. As a result, the judgment remains unsatisfied. The court will issue an order assigning Johnson's rights to payments from Jamaica to Zimmerman until the judgment is fully satisfied.
