And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to requests for production of documents and special interrogatories. The plaintiff, Fernando A. Silva Quintana, served the requests on February 1, 2024, and agreed to extend the defendant's deadline to respond to April 6, 2024. However, the defendant, Guardian Eagle Security, Inc., failed to serve timely responses, and the plaintiff filed motions to compel responses on May 17, 2024. The Judge finds that the defendant's failure to respond was unjustified and orders the defendant to serve verified responses to the requests without objections within 30 days. The Judge also orders the defendant to pay the plaintiff $2,100 in sanctions.
