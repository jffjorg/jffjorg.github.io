  Case Number:  22STCV21065    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Leo Angel Martinez’s Motion
to Continue Trial and Pretrial Deadlines 
Plaintiff Leo Angel Martinez moves to continue the
trial and all related pretrial deadlines. 
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases, the dates assigned for
a trial are firm.”  (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1332(a).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring” it.  (Rule 3.1332(c).)  
Plaintiff moves
to continue the trial to complete additional discovery, including defendant’s
deposition.  Plaintiff does not show he made
diligent efforts to conduct discovery and prepare for trial.  “A party’s excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts” indicates good cause.  (Rule
3.1332(c)(6).)  The failure of the parties
and their counsel to diligently prepare for trial is not good cause to continue
the trial.  (People v. Grant
(1988) 45 Cal.3d 829, 844; Kuhland v. Sedgwick (1860) 17 Cal. 123, 128.)   
Plaintiff filed
this action in June 2022.  Defendant
Global Aviation Management Group Corp. first appeared in the action on
September 30, 2022.  Plaintiff had ample
time to complete discovery and prepare for trial.  Despite plaintiff’s lack of diligence, the
court will continue the trial on its own motion.
Plaintiff Leo
Angel Martinez’s motion to continue trial and pretrial deadlines is denied.  
On its own motion,
the court hereby continues the final status conference from August 19, 2024, to February
3, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.  The court hereby continues the
non-jury trial from September 4, 2024, to February 19, 2025, at 10:00 a.m.  The court hereby continues all
pretrial deadlines that have not already passed to follow the new trial date.
