 Case Number:  23STCV14071    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  52 Specially Appearing Defendant GWG
Investment, LLC’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons
Defendant
GWG Investment, LLC (GWG) moves to quash service of summons.  “[O]nce a defendant files a motion to quash
the burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the
validity of the service and the court’s jurisdiction over the defendant.”  (Bolkiah v. Superior Court (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 984, 991.)  Here, the purported
service was substituted service, a prescribed form of constructive service that
must be strictly construed.  (Calvert
v. Al Binali (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 954, 962; Zirbes v. Stratton
(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1407, 1417.)
Plaintiffs do not
meet their burden of showing valid service of process on GWG.  Business entities must be served via their
designated agent for service of process, a director, officer, or other person
authorized to receive service.  (CCP §
416.10.)  GWG’s designated agent for
service of process is Vicky Cuiying Gong. 
(V. Gong Decl., ¶¶ 5, 8-9, Exs. B-C.)  GWG’s filings with the Secretary of State
identify the company’s principal address, mailing address, and the address for its
agent for service as 9906 Lower Azusa Rd., El Monte, CA 91731.  (Id., Exs. B-C.)  
Plaintiffs’ proof of service identifies the
person served on GWG’s behalf as “Ai Y. Gong (Vicky Gong), Agent for Service of
Process.”  (V. Gong Decl., Ex. A, §
3.b.)  The proof of service indicates
plaintiffs served GWG via substituted service at 556 Las Tunas Dr. #101,
Arcadia, CA 91007.  (Id., Ex. A, §
4.)  Service of summons addressed to “Ai
Y. Gong (Vicky Gong)” at that address was invalid.  Vicky Cuiying Gong’s declaration states, “I,
Vicky Gong, and Ai Y. Gong are absolutely not the same person.”  (Id., ¶ 2.)  Gong further states, “Ai Y. Gong is not an
officer, director, or agent of GWG Investment, LLC” (id., ¶ 6) and “is
not authorized to accept service of summons on behalf of GWG Investment, LLC” (id.,
¶ 7).
Plaintiffs do not present sufficient evidence
showing substituted service on GWG via “Ai Y. Gong (Vicky Gong)” at 556 Las
Tunas Dr. #101 in Arcadia was valid.  Plaintiffs’
counsel states he “believed” Vicky Cuiying Gong “used an alias of Ai Y.
Gong.”  (Zuetel Decl., ¶ 5.)  Plaintiffs assert that, in another lawsuit, the
plaintiff named a defendant “Gong Cuiying … aka Vicky Cuiying Gong aka Ai Ying
Gong.”  (Id., ¶ 6.)  Plaintiffs further state Ai Y. Gong uses or
used a mailing address that Vicky C. Gong previously owned.  (Id., ¶ 8.)  That evidence does not rebut Vicky Cuiying
Gong’s sworn declaration stating she is not Ai Y. Gong.  
Defendant
GWG Investment, LLC’s motion to quash service of summons is granted.  The court hereby quashes service of
summons on defendant GWG Investment, LLC.
