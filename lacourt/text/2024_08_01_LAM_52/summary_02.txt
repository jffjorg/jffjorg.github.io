And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, GWG Investment, LLC, has filed a motion to quash service of summons, alleging that the service was invalid. The plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of proving the validity of the service and the court's jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant is a business entity that must be served via its designated agent for service of process, which is Vicky Cuiying Gong. The proof of service identifies substituted service at 556 Las Tunas Dr. #101, Arcadia, but the defendant's designated agent, Vicky Cuiying Gong, has sworn that she is not Ai Y. Gong, who was served at that address. The plaintiffs have presented no evidence to rebut this sworn declaration, and therefore, their attempt to prove valid service has failed. The defendant's motion to quash service of summons is granted, and the court hereby quashes service of summons on the defendant.
