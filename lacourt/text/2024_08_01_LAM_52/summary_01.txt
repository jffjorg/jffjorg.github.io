And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Leo Angel Martinez's motion to continue the trial and pretrial deadlines. Despite the plaintiff's lack of diligence in completing discovery and preparing for trial, the court has decided to continue the trial on its own motion. The court has also continued the final status conference and non-jury trial dates. The plaintiff's motion is denied, and all pretrial deadlines that have not already passed will follow the new trial date.
