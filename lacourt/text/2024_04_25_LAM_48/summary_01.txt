And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel the depositions of the plaintiffs. The defendants had filed the motion on March 26, 2024, and the judge held an informal discovery conference on April 11, 2024. The parties agreed to take the plaintiffs' depositions on April 29, 2024 and May 1, 2024. Since the depositions are scheduled, the motion to compel depositions is denied as moot. The parties are required to give notice of their intention to submit on the tentative ruling.
