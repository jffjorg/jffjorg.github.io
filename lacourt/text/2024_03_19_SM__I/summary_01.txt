And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to sever the cross-action against the moving party, which means it will not be heard as part of the trial on April 2, 2024. The cross defendant was added to the case in 2022, but there is no evidence of diligence by the cross complainants to bring him into the case. The judge believes it would be unjust to force the cross defendant to trial without allowing him to conduct discovery, as discovery closed before he even answered. The judge will grant ex parte and continue the severed portion of the case, but will also set a discovery hold until May 15, 2024, to allow the other parties to focus on the trial. The judge will set a TSC hearing for May 15, 2024, to set a new trial date for the cross-action.
