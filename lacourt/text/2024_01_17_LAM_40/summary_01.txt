And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Jin Woo Park's motion to approve email serving of the summons and complaint on Defendant Keith K. Kim. The motion was filed on September 26, 2023, and was unopposed. Defendant Kim failed to appear in the action and did not oppose the motion. The Judge finds that electronic service of the summons and complaint is not permissible under California law, and that the statutory scheme only allows for personal service or substituted service. The Judge also notes that the Los Angeles Superior Court local rules do not provide for electronic service of summons and complaint. Therefore, the motion is denied.
