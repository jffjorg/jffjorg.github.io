 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Petitioner J.G.
  Wentworth Originations, LLC’s First Amended Verified Petition for Approval
  for Transfer of Payment Rights.



 
Background
Petitioner J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (J.G. Wentworth) has filed a
petition for approval of the transfer of certain structured settlement rights
belonging to Real Party-in-Interest Cary Chapman. Specifically, J.G. Wentworth
seeks the transfer of $731,988 in future annuity payment rights belonging to Cary
Chapman, which span payments to be paid between 2024 and 2070, the present
discounted value of which is $150,994.85, to be transferred in exchange for a $24,901.56
lump sum payment to Cary Chapman.
The Petition was filed on October
31, 2023.
On November 2, 2023, Petitioner J.G. Wentworth filed a notice of hearing for
January 17, 2024.
That same day, Petitioner filed a proof of service. The
filing shows serving of the notice of hearing, verified Petition, notice of
case assignment, and proof of service on Cary Cameron, the annuity issuer, the
annuity obligor, and various other individuals who are not specifically
identified.
On December 22, 2023, Petitioner
filed an Amended Petition.
That same day, Petitioner filed a supplemental
declaration from Cary Chapman.
The Amended Petition is now before
the Court.
 
Petition for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights
Legal Standard
A transfer of structured settlement payment
rights is void unless a court reviews and approves the transfer and finds that
(a) the transfer of the structured settlement payment rights is fair and
reasonable and in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the
welfare and support of his or her dependents, and (b) the transfer complies
with the requirements of Insurance Code Sections 10134 to 10139.5, will not
contravene other applicable law, and that the court has reviewed and approved
the transfer as provided in Section 10139.5. (See Ins. Code, § 10137, subds.
(a)-(b).)

Section 10136 Requirements
No
direct or indirect transfer of structured settlement payment rights by a payee
to which Section 10136 applies shall be effective, and no structured settlement
obligor or annuity issuer shall be required to make any payment directly or
indirectly to a transferee, unless all of the provisions of Section 10136 of
the Insurance Code are satisfied. (Ins.
Code, § 10136, subd. (a).)

First,
the transfer agreement satisfies the
disclosure form requirements set out in Insurance Code section 10136,
subdivision (b) because the transfer agreement is accompanied by a disclosure
addressed to Cary Chapman and the disclosure contains all the statutorily
required language of section 10136, subdivision (b). (See Ins. Code, § 10136,
subd. (b); see also 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Ex. B, California Disclosure
Statement.)
Second,
the transfer agreement satisfies the transfer-agreement requirements set out in
Insurance Code section 10136, subdivision (c) because the transfer agreement
contains all the necessary language required from this statutory subdivision.
(See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (c); see also 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Ex. A,
California Life Contingent Purchase Contract, §§ 2 [amount and due dates of
payments rights to be sold], 10 [remaining requirements].)
Third,
the transfer agreement does not violate Section 10138 as none of the contents
prohibited by this statutory section are contained in the transfer agreement.
(See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (d); see also 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Ex. A,
California Life Contingent Purchase Contract.)
Fourth,
Cary Chapman has not sought cancellation of the transfer agreement as of the
date of this hearing. (See Ins. Code, § 10136, subd. (e); see also 12/22/23 Supp.
Chapman Decl., ¶ 14.)
Accordingly,
the Court finds that J.G. Wentworth’s proposed transfer of Cary Chapman’s
settlement rights satisfies the requirements of Insurance Code section 10136,
subdivisions (a) through (e).
Section
10139.5 Requirements
A direct or indirect transfer of structured
settlement payment rights is not effective and a structured settlement obligor
or annuity issuer is not required to make any payment directly or indirectly to
any transferee of structured settlement payment rights unless the transfer has
been approved in advance in a final court order based on express written
findings by the court subject to Section 10139.5. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a).)
First,
the transfer agreement satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5,
subdivision (f)(1), because Petitioner J.G. Wentworth made the instant petition
and the petition was brought in the county in which the payee, Cary Chapman,
resides. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (f)(1); see 12/22/23 Amended Petition, p. 1 [showing Petitioner J.G.
Wentworth brings this Petition]; 12/22/23 Supp. Chapman Decl., ¶ 4 [… “I reside
in Los Angeles County, California”].)
Second, the petition DOES NOT SATISFY the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2).
Formal notice of this transfer and a copy of
the petition itself was filed by J.G. Wentworth with the Court and served on
all interested parties no later than 20 days before this hearing—notice and
original Petition served and filed on November 2, 2023, and an Amended Petition
served and filed on December 22, 2023, for a hearing on January 17, 2024, with
the filings to be made no later than December 28, 2023 (20 days prior to the
hearing). (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2) [notice of the proposed transfer
and the petition for its authorization must be filed with the court and served
on all interested parties not less than 20 days prior to hearing]; see also 11/2/23
Notice of Hearing; 11/2/23 Proof of Service; 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Proof of Service.) 
Further, the notice and Amended Petition
have attached all the necessary documents required from this subdivision. (See
Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(A)-(L).) The notice and petition: 
(A) Include a copy
of the instant petition and need not attach prior petitions made outside of
five years from the date of this petition. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(f)(2)(A) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(6), which in turn is
framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring information only
for petitions in last five years]; see also 12/22/23 Supp. Chapman Decl., ¶ 9 [seven transfer transactions
within last two years and identification of case numbers and amounts
transferred by and paid out to Cary Chapman].)
(B) Include a copy
of the proposed transfer agreement and disclosure form required by paragraph
(3) of subdivision (a). (See Ins. Code,
§ 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(B); see also 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Ex. B,
California Disclosure Statement & 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Ex. A,
California Life Contingent Purchase Contract.)
(C) Include
information regarding Cary Chapman’s dependents and their ages. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(C); see
also 12/22/23 Amended Petition, p. 4 [child named “J.F.” is 14 years old]; 12/22/23
Supp. Chapman Decl., ¶ 8 [married with one minor child].)
(D) Include a copy
of the disclosure required in subdivision (b) of Section 10136. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(D); see
also 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Ex. B, California Disclosure Statement.)
(E) Include copies
of the annuity contract, any qualified assignment agreement, and underlying
structured settlement agreement, if available, and if not available, a showing
of reasonable efforts to locate and secure a copy of the document, including
making inquiry with the payee. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(E)-(H); see also 12/22/23 Amended Petition,
Chapman Decl., ¶¶ 1-11 [background of annuity payments and efforts to locate].)
(F) Include copies
of the proofs of service made for notice of this petition. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(I); see
also 11/2/23 Proof of Service; 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Proof of
Service.)
(G) Include a
notification that any interested party is entitled to support, oppose, or
otherwise respond to the transferee’s petition, either in person or by counsel,
by submitting written comments to the court or by participating in the hearing.
(See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(f)(2)(J); see also 11/2/23 Notice of Hearing, pp. 1-2.)
(H) Include a
notification of the time and place of the hearing and notification of the
manner in which and the time by which written responses to the petition must be
filed, which may not be less than 15 days after service of the transferee’s
notice, in order to be considered by the court. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(K); see also 11/2/23 Notice of
Hearing, p. 1.)
(I) If the payee
entered into the structured settlement at issue within five years prior to the
date of the transfer agreement, then the transferee shall provide the specified
notice to the payee’s attorney of record at the time the structured settlement
was created, if the attorney is licensed to practice in California, at the
attorney’s address on file with the State Bar of California. Notice to the
former attorney described in this section is not required to be provided if the
payee in the transaction was not a party to the original structured settlement
at issue (for example, if the payee is an heir or beneficiary of the person who
was a party to the original structured settlement). Also, if the payee cannot
recall or identify his or her former attorney and if the identity of the former
attorney cannot be ascertained from the available structured settlement
documents, then the notice described in this subparagraph is not required to be
provided and the transfer may proceed without the notice. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (f)(2)(L); see
also 12/22/23 Supp. Chapman Decl., ¶ 4 [structured settlement entered into in
or around 1980, i.e., not within five years of this Amended Petition or this
hearing].)
Third, the petition DOES NOT SATISFY all the
payee information required from Section 10139.5, subdivision (c) as follows (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)):
(1) Included the
payee’s name and age (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (c)(1); see also 12/22/23 Supp. Chapman Decl., pp. 1 [name], 2
[at ¶ 8, 46 years of age].)
(2) Included the
payee’s marital status, and, if married or separated, the name of the payee’s
spouse. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (c)(2); see also 12/22/23 Supp. Chapman Decl., ¶ 8 [“married” to “Andra
Chapman”].)
(3) Did not include
the names, ages, and place or places of residence of the payee’s minor children
or other dependents, if any. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(3); see also 12/22/23 Amended Petition, p. 4 [child
named “J.F.” is 14 years old]; 12/22/23 Supp. Chapman Decl., ¶ 8 [one minor
child but no other information].)
(4) Included the
amounts and sources of the payee’s monthly income and financial resources and,
if presently married, the amounts and sources of the monthly income and
financial resources of the payee’s spouse. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(4); see also 12/22/23 Supp. Chapman
Decl., ¶ 8 [$1,500 monthly income for Cary Chapman, working 20-40 hours per
week; spouse unemployed].)
(5) Included
contradictory information permitting the determination of whether the payee is
currently obligated under any child support or spousal support order, and, if
so, the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any individual, entity, or
agency that is receiving child or spousal support from the payee under that
order or that has jurisdiction over the order or the payments in question. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(5); compare
12/22/23 Supp. Chapman Decl., ¶ 8 [“I do have [sic] court-ordered child support
obligations”], with 12/22/23 Amended Petition, ¶ 6 [“Payee has no court-ordered
child support or maintenance obligations”].)
(6) Included
information regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers, as described
in paragraph (11), (12), or (13) of subdivision (b). (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(6) [framed by Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subds. (b)(11)-(13), requiring information only for petitions in last
five years]; see also 12/22/23 Supp. Chapman Decl., ¶ 9 [seven
transfer transactions within last two years and identification of case numbers
and amounts transferred by and paid out to Cary Chapman].)
Fourth, the
petition satisfies the requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (g)
requiring that transferees bear the costs of transfer petitions of structured
settlement rights. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (g); see also 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Ex. A, California Life
Contingent Purchase Contract, § 10 [“We have charged [Cary Chapman] for
the following expenses: … for a total of $0.00 in expenses”]; 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Ex. B,
California Disclosure Statement [same].)
Fifth, the petition satisfies the
requirements of Section 10139.5, subdivision (h) because, when the petition was
filed, Petitioner advised Cary Chapman of Chapman’s right to seek independent
counsel and financial advice in connection with this transfer petition and
advised Chapman of his right to a reimbursement of $1,500 for incurring such
costs. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(h); see also 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Ex. A, California Life Contingent
Purchase Contract, § 10 [advised to get independent financial advice]; 12/22/23
Amended Petition, Ex. E [Statement of Professional Representation signed by Cary
Chapman indicating waiver of independent representation and full understanding
of transfer’s implications].)
Finally, the Court finds that the petition DOES
NOT SATISFY the entirety of the findings requirement set out in Insurance Code
section 10139.5, subdivisions (a)(1) to (a)(6). These findings, which the Court
expressly makes by the following language, are that:
(1) The Court cannot
determine whether the transfer is fair and reasonable in the best interest of
the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee’s
dependents. Cary Chapman is proposed to receive $24,901.56 for future payments
of $731,988, whose discounted present value is $150,994.85.
Cary Chapman is employed 20 to 40 hours per week, has a stated monthly
household income of $1,500, and states the transfer is needed to pay off $5,000
in credit card debt and to purchase a new vehicle to ensure more reliable
transportation to work. However, this transfer would be the eighth transfer
approved for Plaintiff since August 2021. In that time, Cary Chapman made seven
transfers to J.G. Wentworth, which transferred approximately $1,375,412 of
Chapman’s future payment rights in exchange for $206,962.90 altogether. Chapman
does not explain how the over $200,000 transferred to Chapman between August
2021 and August 2023 has been
insufficient to maintain Chapman’s family’s expenses, which is comprised of
three individuals, and where the supplemental Chapman declaration does not
detail expenses in the household, either now or in the last three years (when
Chapman began making the transfers at issue), as to justify a further transfer
beyond $200,000, particularly where the payout to Chapman, when compared to the
future and present value of the rights being sold, is, at first glance, low. Nor
does the Declaration address 1) the need for the withdrawal at a heavy discount
despite the fact that the purchase of a car would appear to be something that
could be accomplished in monthly installments; or 2) how much would be left over,
if anything, after this transaction. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(a)(1) [framed by Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (b)(1)-(15)]; see also 12/22/23 Supp. Chapman Decl., ¶¶ 4,
8-9, 11.)
(2) The payee has
been advised in writing by the transferee to seek independent professional
advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly
waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(2); see
also 12/22/23 Amended Petition, Ex. A, California Life Contingent Purchase
Contract, § 10 [advised to get independent financial advice]; 12/22/23 Amended
Petition, Ex. E [Statement of Professional Representation signed by Cary
Chapman indicating waiver of independent representation and full understanding
of transfer’s implications].)
(3) The transferee,
i.e., J.G. Wentworth, has complied with the notification requirements pursuant
to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), has provided the payee with a disclosure
form that complies with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement complies with
Sections 10136 and 10138. (See Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(3); see also Ins. Code, §§ 10136, subds. (b)-(e),
10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(A)-(L) discussions supra & 12/22/23 Amended
Petition, Ex. B, California Disclosure Statement & 12/22/23 Amended Petition,
Ex. A, California Life Contingent Purchase Contract.)
(4) The transfer
does not contravene any applicable statute or the order of any court or other
government authority. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (a)(4).)
(5) The payee
understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms set forth
in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136. (See Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(5); see also 12/22/23 Supp. Chapman
Decl., ¶ 13 [“I understand the terms of the transfer agreement, including the
terms set forth in the disclosure statement.”].)
(6) The Payee
understands and does not wish to exercise the payee’s right to cancel the
transfer agreement. (See Ins. Code, §
10139.5, subd. (a)(6); see also 12/22/23 Supp. Chapman Decl., ¶ 14 [“I understand
and do not wish to exercise my right to cancel the agreement”].)
Requirements
Conclusion
In
conclusion, the Petition fails to meet the requirements of:
(1) Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision
(a)(3) based on a failure to show that the transfer is in the best interest of
the payee and dependents;
(2) Insurance Code section 10139.5,
subdivision (c)(3) based on a failure to specify the place or places of
residences of Cary Chapman’s minor child where Chapman’s supplemental
declaration does not specify the minor’s name or initials or the child’s age or
any place of residence of the minor;
(3) Insurance Code section 10139.5,
subdivision (c)(5) based on a contradiction between Cary Chapman’s declaration
as to Chapman’s court-order child support or other maintenance obligations and
Petitioner’s representation that Chapman does not have any such obligations.

Conclusion
Petitioner J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC’s First Amended Verified
Petition for Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights is CONTINUED for further submissions
to address the issues raised above.
