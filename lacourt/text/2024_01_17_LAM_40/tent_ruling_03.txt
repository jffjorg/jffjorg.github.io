Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Karen Flores (Plaintiff)
sues Defendants Everbrands, Inc., a California Corporation (Everbrands CA),
Everbrands, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (Everbrands DE) (collectively,
Everbrands, Inc.), Michael Florman (Florman), Yon Lai (Lai), and Does 1-25
pursuant to a January 18, 2023 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Failure to Pay
a Minimum Wage, (2) Failure to Pay Overtime, (3) Failure to Provide rest
Breaks, (4) Failure to Provide Meal Breaks, (5) Inaccurate Wage Statements, (6)
Waiting Wage Penalties (Cal. Labor Code §§ 201-203), (7) Unfair Competition and
Unlawful Business Practices – (Cal. Bus. Code § 17200), and (8) Failure to
Provide Records. 
The claims arise from allegations
that when Plaintiff was employed by Defendants, she was paid less than the
applicable minimum wage, was not compensated for overtime, and was not
compensated for and/or provided meal and rest breaks.
Motion Before the Court
On July 24, 2023, Plaintiff Flores
served Special Interrogatories, Set One (SROGs, Set One), on Defendant
Evebrands CA. The interrogatories were served on Allyson K. Thompson, Esq., and
Laura P. Birnbaum, Esq., Plaintiff’s counsel.
On September 11, 2023, after an
extension was granted by Plaintiff, Everbrands CA served responses to SROGs,
Set One. The responses were verified.
On September 19, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel emailed a meet and confer letter regarding further responses to SROGs,
Set One.
By October 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel had not received supplemental responses to discovery or a response to
the September 19th meet and confer email and attached letter.
That same day, Plaintiff Flores
filed a motion to compel verified responses to SROGs, Set One, Nos. 15, 16, and
21. The motion also seeks monetary sanctions against Everbrands CA and Ms.
Thompson.
On January 3, 2024, Everbrands CA
opposed the motion. The opposition indicates that Everbrands CA served
supplemental responses to SROGS, Set One, Nos. 15, 16, and 21 on January 3,
2024.
Plaintiff Flores failed an untimely
reply to the opposition on January 16, 2024.
Plaintiff Flores’s motion is now
before the Court.
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Interrogatories
Legal
Standard
A
motion to compel a further response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory
answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories, demands to produce,
or requests for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a),
2031.310, subd. (a), 2033.290, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403
[interrogatories and demands to produce].)
To
compel a further response to interrogatories, the movant can show that: (1) the
responding party’s answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(1)); (2) the responding
party’s exercise of the option to produce documents in response to an
interrogatory was unwarranted or the required specification of those documents
was inadequate (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(2)); and (3) the
responding party’s objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a)(3); see, e.g., Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 550 [defendant’s argument that
plaintiff was required to establish good cause or prove merits of underlying
claim before propounding interrogatories without merit]).
Order
Compelling Further Interrogatory Responses: MOOT.
Plaintiff
Flores seeks an order compelling further responses from Everbrands CA to
Plaintiff’s SROGs, Set One, Nos. 15, 16, and 21. (Mot., pp. 5-7.)
In
opposition, Everbrands CA argues that this motion has been mooted through
supplemental responses served on Plaintiff Flores on January 3, 2024, i.e., the
same day on which the opposition was filed. The opposition attaches a copy of
those supplemental responses, which are verified by Michael Florman. (Opp’n,
pp. 2-3, citing Birnbaum Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.)
The
Court agrees with Everbrands CA.
A
review of the responses shows that they are substantively responsive to the
three SROGs.
Flores’
reply brief was filed the day before the hearing, some four days late, and thus
will not be considered. However, even if it were, a brief review of the reply
fails to indicate any specific objection to the substance of the response.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff Flores’s motion is MOOT.
Sanctions:
DENIED.
The court must impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)

Here,
based on the extensive sanction history between the parties, and what appears
to be good faith on Everbrands CA’s part serving supplemental discovery prior
to this hearing, the Court finds that sanctions would be unjust here. In terms
of the Reply brief, plaintiff provides no explanation why the Reply was filed
late, and thus the Court need not consider it; however, even if it did, the Court
would not impose sanctions for the reasons stated above.
Sanctions
are thus DENIED. 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Karen Flores’s Motion to Compel Responses Further
Responses [sic] to Special Interrogatories, Set 1 Sent to Everbrands, Inc. and
Request for Sanctions Pursuant to $3,620.51, Against Everbrands, Inc. and Their
Attorney of Record Allyson Thompson is:
(1) MOOT as to compelling further responses to SROGs, Set One, Nos. 15,
16, and 21; and
(2) DENIED as to sanctions.
