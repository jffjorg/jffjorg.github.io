And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Karen Flores's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and to impose sanctions against Everbrands, Inc. and its attorney, Allyson Thompson. The court finds that the motion is MOOT because Everbrands, Inc. has already served supplemental responses to the interrogatories, which are substantively responsive. The court also denies the request for sanctions, finding that sanctions would be unjust in this case. The court notes that the parties have a long history of disputes and that Everbrands, Inc. has acted in good faith by serving supplemental discovery prior to the hearing. The court declines to consider Plaintiff's late-filed reply brief and finds that sanctions would not be warranted even if it were considered.
