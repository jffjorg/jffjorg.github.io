EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
 
            Defendant
has made multiple objections to various portions of Plaintiff’s evidence.
However, given the Court's decision not to consider Plaintiff's evidence given
Plaintiff’s failure to file a separate statement, the Court denies Defendant's
evidentiary objections as moot. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c subd. (b)(3); Leyva
v. Garcia (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1095, 1105 fn. 3.)
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            The function of a
motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to
whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or
claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437 subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367,
381-382.)  
 
As to each cause of action, as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication
must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one
or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that
there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c(p)(2); see also Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of
the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence
in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39
Cal.4th 384, 389.)  
 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
            
DISCUSSION 
 
            Separate Statement
 
            Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c subdivision (b)(3) “The opposition papers shall include
a separate statement that responds to each of the material facts contended by
the moving party to be undisputed, indicating if the opposing party agrees or
disagrees that those facts are undisputed. The statement also shall set forth
plainly and concisely any other material facts the opposing party contends are
disputed. Each material fact contended by the opposing party to be disputed
shall be followed by reference to the supporting evidence. Failure to comply
with this requirement of a separate statement may constitute a sufficient
ground, in the court’s discretion, for granting the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c subd. (b)(1))
 
            While Plaintiff has
filed a response to Defendant’s separate statement, Plaintiff has failed to
file a separate statement of undisputed material facts to correspond with their
opposition. Defendant argues that it cannot be expected to properly respond to
the motion that does not lay out its evidence through a mandated separate
statement. Defendant also requests that the Court grant the motion as a failure
to file a separate statement in opposition is grounds for granting a motion for
summary judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c subd. (b)(3); Leyva v. Garcia
(2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1095, 1105 fn. 3.)
 
            The Court uses its
discretion to not grant the motion based on the failure to file a separate
statement. However, without a separate statement, the Court cannot find that
Defendant has established any dispute material facts, nor can the Court
consider Plaintiff’s evidence. 
 
On May 26, 2022, Plaintiff, a 50-year-old
regular jogger, was running on his usual route along the northern sidewalk of
Sepulveda Boulevard around 5:00 to 5:30 a.m. (UMF 4, 5.) While running in the
dark without any lighting equipment, Plaintiff tripped over a utility pole that
had fallen across the sidewalk. (UMF 8, 9, 10.) The pole, owned and maintained
exclusively by Frontier California Inc., was suspended above the ground and not
touching the sidewalk. (UMF 15.) Plaintiff stated that the pole, not any
condition of the sidewalk, caused him to fall, and he had never encountered or
heard of anyone else encountering hazards at that location in the five years he
regularly ran past it. (UMF 24, 25.) Photographs taken later by Plaintiff
showed no cracks or displacements on the sidewalk. (UMF 30.) 
 
On May 24, 2022, two days before the incident,
a resident reported downed utility wires to the Defendant’s Fire Department
(TFD). (UMF 35.) TFD found the fallen pole, determined it had no live
electricity, and placed yellow caution tape across the area, including the
sidewalk, to warn pedestrians. (UMF 38, 39, 40.) Defendant’s Public Safety
Dispatch attempted to identify the pole’s owner, contacting various entities,
including Southern California Edison and California Water Company, without
success. (UMF 46.) On June 1, 2022, a Defendant employee confirmed the pole
belonged to Frontier, and Defendant contacted Frontier on June 2, 2022. (UMF
48, 49.)
 
Plaintiff testified that he did not see any
caution tape near the pole before his fall but noticed it later when he
returned to take photographs. (UMF 53.) He described the caution tape as
haphazardly placed and not suspended above the ground. Defendant maintains
records of sidewalk repairs and complaints in its databases, which showed no
prior complaints or claims of dangerous conditions for the sidewalk near 4559
Sepulveda Blvd. The last recorded maintenance at that location occurred in
April 2009. (UMF 54, 55, 56.) Plaintiff’s claim, filed two months after the
incident, was the first recorded claim involving that sidewalk. (UMF 1.)
 
 
Cause of Action 1 and 2 – Government Code 835
and 840.2
 
Government
Code section 835 sets out the exclusive conditions under which a public entity
is liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition of public property.¿ (Metcalf
v. County of San Joaquin (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1121, 1129, citing Brown v.
Poway Unified Sch. Dist. (1993) 4 Cal.4th 820, 829; see also, Zelig v.
County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112.)¿ Per Government Code section
835, “a public entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of
its property if the plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous
condition at the time of the injury, that the injury was proximately caused by
the dangerous condition, that the dangerous condition created a reasonably
foreseeable risk of the kind of injury which was incurred, and that either: [¶]
(a) A negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity
within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition; or [c] (b)
The public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition
. . . a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken measures to protect
against the dangerous condition.”¿ (Gov. Code, § 835.)
 
Government
Code section 840.2 reads, “an employee of a public entity is liable for injury
caused by a dangerous condition of public property if the plaintiff establishes
that the property of the public entity was in a dangerous condition at the time
of the injury, that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous
condition, that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk
of the kind of injury which was incurred, and that either:
 
(a) The
dangerous condition was directly attributable wholly or in substantial part to
a negligent or wrongful act of the employee and the employee had the authority
and the funds and other means immediately available to take alternative action
which would not have created the dangerous condition; or
(b) The
employee had the authority and it was his responsibility to take adequate
measures to protect against the dangerous condition at the expense of the
public entity and the funds and other means for doing so were immediately
available to him, and he had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous
condition under Section 840.4 a sufficient time prior to the injury to have
taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.
(Gov.
Code, § 840.2.)
 
Government
code sections 835 and 840.2 require that the Plaintiff show that the property
was in a dangerous condition at the time of the incident. Defendant argues that
Plaintiff cannot establish a "dangerous condition of public property"
under California Government Code §§ 835 and 840.2 because the undisputed facts
show no hazardous condition of the sidewalk itself. (Holmes v. City of
Oakland, (1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 378, 386) To prove a dangerous condition,
Plaintiff must show a substantial risk of harm caused by the physical condition
of the public property or its relationship to foreseeable use. Here, the cause
of Plaintiff’s fall was Frontier's fallen pole, not any condition of the
sidewalk, which Plaintiff confirmed in his deposition. He stated that the
sidewalk was not hazardous, wet, or slippery, and testified he had never fallen
there before despite running past the location regularly for years. (UMF 21,
27, 28.)
 
Defendant
highlights that under Hacala v. Bird Rides, Inc., a public entity cannot
be held liable solely for third-party negligence unrelated to the physical
condition of the public property. (Hacala v. Bird Rides, Inc. (2023), 90
Cal. App. 5th 292, 307.) In Hacala, the court ruled that a scooter left
on a sidewalk by a third party did not render the sidewalk a dangerous
condition because there was no physical defect or hazardous characteristic of
the sidewalk itself. (Id.) Like in Hacala, Defendant’s sidewalk
was free of cracks, displacements, or defects, as evidenced by Plaintiff's
photographs and Defendant’s records, which show no prior complaints or
incidents involving the location. 
 
Defendant
emphasizes that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate how the sidewalk itself
increased the risk of harm or contributed to the incident. Plaintiff’s
testimony and the absence of prior complaints confirm that the pole alone
caused the fall, and Defendant had no role in its maintenance or condition.
Therefore, Plaintiff cannot meet the requirements under §§ 835 and 840.2, and
Defendant is not liable for the injuries caused solely by Frontier's fallen
pole.
 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s reliance on Hacala is
misplaced because the facts in Hacala are distinguishable from this
case. In Hacala, the dangerous condition arose solely from third-party
conduct, improperly parked scooters, over which the City had no control or
special relationship. (Hacala, supra, 90 Cal. App. 5th 292, 307.) The
court found that the City did not owe a duty because the sidewalk itself was
not defective, and the City’s role was limited to regulatory oversight.
Conversely, in Branzel v. Concord, the City was held liable for a
dangerous condition when PG&E’s wires near a public park increased the risk
of injury to those using the park for its intended purpose. (Branzel v.
Concord (1966) 247 Cal. App. 2d 68.)  
 
Plaintiff
further relies on Ducey v. Argo Sales Co., where the Supreme Court held
that public entities could be liable for failing to take protective measures
once they have actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition, even if
the condition was not created by the entity itself. (Ducey v. Argo Sales Co.
(1979) 25 Cal.3d 707, 716-717.)  Here,
Plaintiff contends that Defendant had notice of the downed power pole on its
sidewalk and failed to take timely, reasonable safety measures, such as
erecting effective warnings or barricades, to protect pedestrians. Unlike Hacala,
where the hazard arose solely from third-party actions, the dangerous condition
here was tied to Defendant’s failure to maintain and safeguard its property.
 
Plaintiff
concludes that Defendant had a duty to reasonably maintain the sidewalk in a
safe condition, and its failure to do so was a substantial factor in causing
Plaintiff’s injuries.  This creates
triable issues of fact regarding Defendant’s breach of duty and liability for
the dangerous condition of its property.
 
Furthermore,
Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s claim of no duty to protect pedestrians from
the downed utility pole because it was caused by Frontier’s negligence is
legally flawed. Prior third-party negligence does not excuse a public entity's
failure to address a known dangerous condition. (Chavez v. County of Merced 229
Cal. App. 2d 387.) Despite knowing about the fallen pole, the City failed to
timely implement effective safety measures, such as A-frame barricades or
proper warning signs, to protect pedestrians.
 
Plaintiff concludes
that Defendant’s employees had the authority and responsibility under
Government Code § 840.2 to address the hazard but failed to act timely. This
breach was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries, as proper
measures could have prevented the incident. Therefore, Defendant’s employees
are liable under § 840.2.
 
In reply, Defendant
emphasizes that Defendant placed yellow caution tape to warn pedestrians and
argues that Plaintiff’s own failure to use a light while running in the dark
was not exercising due care. Further, Plaintiff admitted the sidewalk itself
was not hazardous, and photographs confirm no physical defect existed.
Defendant contends that Hacala directly applies, as the hazard was
solely caused by third-party conduct, not the condition or design of the public
property. (Hacala, supra, 90 Cal. App. 5th 292, 307-308.) 
 
Ultimately,
Defendant maintains that Plaintiff cannot show the sidewalk itself was in a
dangerous condition or that Defendant’s actions increased the risk of harm.
 
In Hacala,
the Court found that the defendant’s failure to remove improperly parked
electric scooters, which led to the plaintiff's trip and fall incident, did not
create a dangerous condition on public property because the plaintiff did not
establish the existence of some physical characteristic of the property that
exposed the plaintiff to danger. (Hacala, supra, 90 Cal. App. 5th 292,
307-308.) The Court in Hacala did note that “A public entity may be
liable under Government Code section 835 for failing to take protective
measures to safeguard the public from a dangerous condition of the property
itself; however, when the danger at issue is third-party conduct,
liability attaches only if the alleged physical condition of the property
“increased or intensified” the risk of misconduct.” (Id.) However, “courts
have consistently refused to characterize harmful conduct on the part of a
third party as a dangerous condition in the absence of some concurrent
contributing defect in the property itself.” (Hacala, supra, 90
Cal. App. 5th 292, 307-308.
 
Defendant has shown
that the fallen pole was not owned or operated by Defendant. Furthermore,
Defendant has shown that there was no structural defect on the property that
could be constructed as an unsafe condition. 
 
While Plaintiff
argues that Defendant had a duty to reasonably maintain the property, The Court
in Hancala is clear in stating that liability only attaches if the physical
condition of the property increased or intensified the risk of harm. (Hacala,
supra, 90 Cal. App. 5th 292, 307-308.) Furthermore, the cases relied on by
Defendant are distinguishable. In Branzel, the Court found that the city
was liable because the city designated the public park as a location to fly
model airplanes despite the park being near high-voltage power lines, creating
an affirmative duty and increasing the risk of harm. (Branzel, supra, 257
Cal. App. 2d 68, 75.) Furthermore, the instant case is much more factually
similar to Hacala than it is to Chavez or Ducey. (Hacala,
supra, 90 Cal. App. 5th 292: Ducey, supra, 25 Cal.3d 707; Chavez,
supra, 229 Cal. App. 2d 387.) Both Hacala and the instant case have
to do with trip and fall incidents caused by the property of a third party. (Hacala,
supra, 90 Cal. App. 5th 292, 307.) While Chavez and Ducey
involve life-threatening dangers, such as drunk drivers and hidden, live high
voltage power lines. (Ducey, supra, 25 Cal.3d 707; Chavez, supra, 229
Cal. App. 2d 387.)  Last, Defendant
warned the public of the danger by placing yellow caution tape around the pole.
Thus, the Court finds that no dangerous condition existed because the downed
pole was not a physical characteristic of the property, and Defendant did not
“increase or intensify” the possible danger. (Hacala, supra, 90 Cal.
App. 5th 292, 308.)
 
Therefore,
Defendants have satisfied the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show there was no dangerous condition on the property. The
Court cannot consider Plaintiff’s evidence given the lack of a separate statement.
Consequently, Plaintiff has not shown any genuine disputes of material fact.
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the Motion for Summary Judgement.
