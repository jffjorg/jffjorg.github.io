## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case *Leon Barnett Hall v. Paulina Cruz et al.*  Plaintiff, Leon Hall, filed motions to compel discovery responses from Defendant, Paulina Cruz, after she failed to timely respond to requests for interrogatories, production of documents, and admissions. 

Although Plaintiff initially sought sanctions, the judge found that the Defendant ultimately provided discovery responses after experiencing delays due to needing to communicate with her in Spanish and reassignment of files among her attorney's associates. 

As a result, the judge ruled the motions to compel moot and granted Plaintiff a reduced amount of sanctions ($1,111.65 per motion) to cover the reasonable expenses incurred in filing the motions.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the plaintiff's motions to compel discovery responses from the defendant. The plaintiff had moved to compel the defendant to serve discovery responses, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, request for production of documents, and request for admissions, without objections. The plaintiff also sought monetary sanctions.

The judge has granted the motions to compel, but notes that they are moot since the defendant has already served discovery responses. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, but in a reduced amount of $1,111.65 per motion.

The case arises from an automobile accident that occurred on May 2, 2022, in which the plaintiff alleges they were injured as a result of the defendant's negligence. The plaintiff filed a complaint on November 8, 2022, and propounded discovery requests on May 1, 2023. The defendant failed to serve timely responses, and the plaintiff attempted to meet and confer with the defendant to resolve the issue. The defendant ultimately served responses on September 12, 2023.

In this tentative ruling, Judge W LEON BARNETT HALL addresses Plaintiff Leon Barnett Hall's motion to compel Defendant Paulina Cruz to serve discovery responses. The case arises from an automobile accident on May 2, 2022, in which Plaintiff alleges injury due to Defendant's negligence. Plaintiff filed a complaint on November 8, 2022, against Paulina Cruz, Access Services, and MV Transportation, Inc. Plaintiff propounded discovery requests on May 1, 2023, with responses due by June 16, 2023, a date agreed upon with defense counsel. However, Defendant failed to serve timely responses, leading to Plaintiff's motion for an order compelling responses and sanctions.

Defendant, in opposition, provided discovery responses on September 12, 2023, after several attempts by Plaintiff to meet and confer. Defendant's counsel explained that they tried to contact their client for several weeks, discovered Defendant had retained workers' compensation counsel, and faced delays due to file reassignment and Defendant's status as a Spanish-speaker.

The court finds Plaintiff's motions to compel discovery responses MOOT, as Defendant has served discovery responses. However, the court grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,111.65 per motion.
