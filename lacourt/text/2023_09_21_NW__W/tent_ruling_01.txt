Plaintiff Leon Hall’s Motion

Plaintiff Leon Hall’s Motion

DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Leon Hall moves to compel Defendant Paulina
Cruz to serve discovery responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One. Plaintiff also moves for an order deeming the
truth of all matters specified in Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set One
admitted. Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions per motion brought. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to
discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§
2030.290, 2031.300, 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails
to serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may also move for an order
that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (CCP §
2033.280(b).)
 
On May 1, 2023, Plaintiff propounded their discovery requests
including Plaintiff’s special interrogatories, set one, form interrogatories,
set one, request for production of documents, set one, and request for
admissions, set one. (Elechyan Decl. ¶5, Exh. 2.) Responses were due by June
16, 2023, a date mutually agreed upon with defense counsel. (Elechyan Decl.
¶5.) After no response, on June 28, 2023, Plaintiff attempted to meet and
confer with Defendant regarding the discovery requests. (Elechyan Decl. ¶6.) After
no response, Plaintiff’s counsel again attempted to meet and confer on July 5,
2023 and requested Defendant serve their responses by July 6, 2023. (Elechyan
Decl. ¶7.) No responses have been served. (Elechyan Decl. ¶8.) 
 
In opposition, Defendant has provided discovery responses. Counsel for
Defendant attests they tried to contact their client for several weeks upon
receiving the discovery requests. (Moore Decl. ¶3.) Eventually Defense counsel was
informed she had retained counsel to represent her as an applicant in a workers
compensation matter arising out of the subject incident. (Moore Decl. ¶3.) Defendant’s
workers compensation attorney put Counsel in contacts with Defendant. (Moore
Decl. ¶4.) Counsel discovered Defendant was a Spanish-speaker and thus required
one of the office paralegals to help with the discovery. (Moore Decl. ¶¶5-6.)
However, files were re-assigned amongst associates and this created a delay in
preparing Defendant’s responses. (Moore Decl. ¶7.) On September 12, 2023,
Defendant served discovery responses. (Moore Decl. ¶8.) 
 
Accordingly, the motions to compel are MOOT. 
 
Sanctions
 
The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or
both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone
as a result of that conduct. (CCP §2023.030.) 
 
Plaintiff requests $2,511.65 per motion, which includes 3 hours
drafting each motion, 1 hour reviewing any opposition, 1 hour preparing a
reply, and 1.5 hours attending the hearing on the matter. Plaintiff also paid
$61.65 filing fee per motion. Counsel’s hourly rate is $350.00. The court
grants Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,111.65 per
motion.
