Here's an English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling to grant the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Matthew C. Mickelson, the attorney representing W1 Inc., the plaintiff in this case. W1 Inc. had filed a complaint against Earthhunt Trading Co. LLC for breach of contract and other related claims, alleging that Earthhunt had failed to grant W1 Inc. a 1/3 ownership interest in their gold auction business as promised. Mickelson seeks to withdraw as counsel due to the requirements of State Bar Rules of Professional Conduct 1.16(b), which permit an attorney to withdraw under certain circumstances. The court has reviewed Mickelson's request and notes that all necessary steps have been taken to facilitate the withdrawal. However, the court reminds W1 Inc. that, as a corporation, they will be required to be represented by an attorney going forward. A case management conference is set for October 31, 2023. The trial has not yet been scheduled. The court grants Mickelson's request to be relieved as counsel, contingent upon further confirmation.
