And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession against defendants Jessica Skelton and Maxwell Murphy. The plaintiff, Ally Bank, alleges that the defendants entered into a contract with the plaintiff's assignor for a 2019 Jeep Cherokee motor vehicle but defaulted on the terms of the agreement. The plaintiff claims that it is entitled to possession of the vehicle and has provided evidence to support this claim, including a declaration from an authorized signatory of the plaintiff and a California Certificate of Title. The court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated its entitlement to possession and has met the requirements for a writ of possession under California Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010. The court also waives the requirement for the plaintiff to file an undertaking for the defendant's interest in the property, as the defendant does not have an interest in the property due to the amount owed on the contract.
