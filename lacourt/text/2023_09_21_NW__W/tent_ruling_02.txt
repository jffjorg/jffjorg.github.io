FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
On February
23, 2023, Plaintiff W1, Inc. Filed a complaint against Earthnut Trading Co. LLC
for breach of contract, open book account, account stated, and reasonable value
of services. Plaintiff alleges in 2020, Plaintiff and Defendants entered into an
oral agreement whereby Plaintiff agreed to perform services and expend funds,
time and effort to develop and set up an online gold auction platform with
Defendants, in reliance on Defendants’ promises that plaintiff shall receive a 1/3
ownership in the entity which was planned and was for conducting the gold
auction business ("Business"). However, after Plaintiff performed,
Plaintiff alleges Defendants failed to give Plaintiff the promised 1/3
ownership in the Business.
