And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court grants the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees and prejudgment interest. The plaintiff is awarded $6,000 in attorney fees, which is based on a flat fee agreement between the plaintiff and its counsel. The plaintiff also seeks prejudgment interest in the amount of $6,864.00, which is calculated based on a 10% per annum interest rate. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to these fees and interest as a result of the defendant's breach of contract and failure to pay rent. The court's ruling is based on California law, specifically Code Civ. Proc., § 1021, Civ. Code, § 1717, and Civ. Code, § 3289, subd. (b)."
