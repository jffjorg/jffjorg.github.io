And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendants' memorandum of costs. The plaintiff, Cristina Kim, obtained a net monetary recovery on her common counts claim, and the defendants, Adolfo and Ericka Echeagaray, are not the prevailing parties. The court finds that the defendants' arguments are without merit and that the motion is therefore granted.
