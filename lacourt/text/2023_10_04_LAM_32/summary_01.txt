And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' motions to stay the action and continue or vacate the trial date. The case was initiated by plaintiffs Jeffrey Lawrence Solomon and Lynn Soderquist-Solomon against defendants Oxgord Incorporated and Day to Day Imports Inc. on November 10, 2020. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action on grounds of forum non conveniens, arguing that the case should be tried in Idaho. The court denied the motion on April 28, 2023. The defendants then filed a petition for writ of mandate with the Court of Appeal and sought an order staying the action and continuing or vacating the trial date.

The judge notes that the court has inherent authority to control its own calendar and docket, and that a stay would not be in the interests of justice or judicial efficiency. The judge also finds that the defendants have not demonstrated undue prejudice if the case is not stayed, as they have already engaged in extensive substantive discovery and have exploited California discovery procedures for their own benefit.

The judge concludes that the defendants' motions to stay the action and continue or vacate the trial date are denied.
