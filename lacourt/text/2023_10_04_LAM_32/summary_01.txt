```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge is making a tentative ruling on the defendants' motions to stay the action and continue the trial. The defendants argue that the case should be stayed and continued because the Court of Appeal may reverse the court's ruling and order the case tried in Idaho. The judge has already denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the action on grounds of forum non conveniens, and is not inclined to further delay the case. The judge finds that the defendants have not demonstrated good cause to continue the trial and that a stay would not be in the interests of justice or judicial efficiency. The judge also notes that the defendants have already engaged in extensive discovery and have not demonstrated undue prejudice if the case is not stayed. The judge denies the defendants' motions to stay and continue the trial.
