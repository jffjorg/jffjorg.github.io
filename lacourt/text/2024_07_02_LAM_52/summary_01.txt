Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, California Clinic Management, LLC dba Acuity Eye Group, Acuity Holdings, LLC, Trilogy Eye Medical Group, Inc., Tom Chang, M.D., and Michael Samuel, M.D., have moved to stay the action pending their appeal of the court's order denying their motion to compel arbitration. The court has considered the four factors used by federal courts to determine whether to grant a stay, as well as other relevant factors. The court has found that the defendants have made a moderate showing of likelihood of success on appeal and that permitting the action to continue pending appeal could irreparably harm the defendants. The court has also found that staying the action is not likely to significantly injure the plaintiff. Finally, the court has found that the public interest moderately favors the plaintiff. Based on these findings, the court has granted the defendants' motion to stay the action pending appeal.
