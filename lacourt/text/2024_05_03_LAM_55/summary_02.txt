And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of ESTHER SCHNEIDER (Plaintiff) vs. ULTRAGENYX PHARMACEUTICAL INC. (Defendant) regarding a motion to compel arbitration and stay action pending arbitration. The Defendant has met its burden of showing the existence of an arbitration agreement signed by the Plaintiff in 2013. The Judge finds that the agreement is procedurally and substantively enforceable, despite the Plaintiff's contentions that the agreement is procedurally unconscionable due to lack of explanation of the terms and provision of a copy of the AAA rules governing arbitration. The Judge also finds that the agreement is not substantively unconscionable due to provisions regarding discovery, fee-shifting, and claims against each other. The Judge grants the motion and stays the action pending the outcome of the arbitration.
