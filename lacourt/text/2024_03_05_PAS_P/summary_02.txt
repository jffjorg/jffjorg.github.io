And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Margaret L. Oldendorf, has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment entered against her. The plaintiff, Rao Hsein Ray Wu, had alleged that the defendant, Karen Murphy, failed to pay rent for several months and had not vacated the premises after receiving a notice to pay rent or quit. The Judge found that the default judgment was entered in error, as the defendant had until January 19, 2024 to file her answer, which she did on the same day. The Judge therefore granted the motion to set aside the default judgment and scheduled a Trial Setting Conference for a future date.
