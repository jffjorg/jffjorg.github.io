Case No.: 23PDUD03806
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING MOTION BY  DEFENDANT TO
  SET ASIDE DEFAULT 
 
Date:   March
  5, 2024
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          
          I.        INTRODUCTION
           This case is an unlawful detainer action.
Plaintiff Rao Hsein Ray Wu (Wu) alleges that Defendant Karen Murphy (Murphy)
failed to pay her monthly rent of $4,000.00 for several months, and has not vacated
the premises after receiving a notice to pay rent or quit.
          On January 18, 2024, the Court entered
judgment for possession in favor of the plaintiff, on defendant’s default. 
          On February 15, 2024, Defendant Murphy
filed the instant motion to set aside the default entered against her. 
          Pursuant to the reasoning below, the
motion is granted.
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
CCP Section 657 provides that an order or judgment
of the Court may be vacated for a variety of reasons, including “Irregularity
in the proceedings of the court, jury or adverse party, or any order of the
court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a
fair trial.” (CCP § 657(1).) Additionally, “It is well settled that a judgment
or order which is void on its face, and which requires only an inspection of
the judgment roll or record to show its invalidity, may be set aside on motion,
at any time after its entry, by the court which rendered the judgment or made
the order.” (Hayashi v. Lorenz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 848, 851, internal
citations omitted.)
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          Here, Defendant Murphy filed a demurrer on December 6,
2023, which was heard and overruled on January 3, 2024. Murphy was given 10
days from receipt of the notice of ruling to file her answer. (1/3/24 Minute
Order.) The notice of ruling was served on Murphy on January 4, 2024, by regular
US mail, which extends the 10-day deadline by 5 calendar days. (CCP § 1013.)  Therefore, Murphy had until January 19, 2024
to file her answer. Murphy indeed filed her answer to the complaint on January
19, 2024. (1/19/24 Answer.)
          Her default was taken a day earlier, on January 18, 2024.
This action of the Court was in error, as Murphy had until the next day,
January 19, 2024 to file her answer and indeed did file her answer. 
          Accordingly, the motion to set aside the default is
GRANTED. 
          IV.     CONCLUSION
          The motion to set aside the default is granted. The dismissal
entered January 18, 2024, against Defendant Murphy is set aside.  The Court schedules a Trial Setting  Conference for __________, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  
The
Clerk is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
