[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS
 
Date:  March 5, 2024
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          
          I.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a case for personal injury and
other damages filed by Chris Szajner (Szajner) arising from an alleged bed bug
infestation in his hotel room. He sues Defendants Hilton Worldwide Holdings
Inc., Park Hotels and Resorts Inc., 
Hilton Garden Inn Arcadia/Pasadena area, and individual Pedro Figueroa
for these injuries, arising out of his stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Arcadia
in February-March of 2021. He alleges he awoke on February 12, 2021 with a rash
and bug bites. He alleges he changed rooms but the problem persisted. On March
10, 2021, he sought medical treatment and was diagnosed with bedbug bites. The
amended complaint filed February 10, 2023 indicates that he is suing on the
following causes of action: (1)Battery, (2) Negligence,  (3)Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress, (4) Fraudulent Concealment, (5) Private
Nuisance, (6) Public Nuisance, and (7) Breach of Contract. 
          This complaint was filed on February 9, 2023. On December
12, 2023, Plaintiff Szajner indicated that he was still attempting to serve the
defendants in this case. (No proofs of service have been filed as of today.) On
January 25, 2024, Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. (Park Hotels) filed its motion
to quash service of summons. Plaintiff filed a late opposition on February 28,
2024. Defendant filed a reply on the same day.
          Per the reasoning below, the Court grants Park Hotels’
Motion to Quash Service of Summons.
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code Civ. Proc. §418.10(a)(1) provides that a defendant, on
or before the last day to plead, may file a motion to quash service of the
summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. 
California’s “long-arm” statute
provides for jurisdiction “on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution
of this state or of the United States.” Code Civ. Proc. §410.10. 
The possible bases for
jurisdiction in this state are the following: 
- Physical presence in the
forum when served, aka “gotcha” jurisdiction; Burnham v. Superior Court
(1990) 495 U.S. 604, 612; 
- Domicile in the forum
state; Milliken v. Meyer (1940) 311 U.S. 457, 462; 
- General appearance in the
action; Code Civ. Proc. §410.50(a); 
- Contractual consent/forum
selection clause; National Equipment Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent (1964) 375
U.S. 311, 315-316; 
- Minimum contacts; International
Shoe Co. v. State of Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316; Burger King v.
Rudzewicz (1985) 471 U.S. 462, 475. 
See Weil & Brown, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023),
¶3:131. 
          CCP
Section 581 provides that an action may be dismissed without prejudice as to a defendant
if the motion is made pursuant to CCP Section 418.10. (CCP § 581.) 
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          a. General Jurisdiction
To
exercise general jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, there must be such
minimum contacts between the defendant and the forum state that the exercise of
personal jurisdiction is allowed. (International Shoe Co. v. State of
Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316; Burger King v. Rudzewicz (1985)
471 U.S. 462, 475.) Here, Park Hotels urges that this is not the case. In
support, Park Hotels provides the declaration of its executive vice president
and CFO, Sean Dell’Orto. (Dell’Orto Declaration.) He declares that Defendant
Park Hotels is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in
Virginia. It does not and did not own, operate, lease, manage the Arcadia
Hilton Garden Inn property. (Dell’Orto Declaration ¶ 4.) Additionally, Park
Hotels is not a franchisor of the Property, does not employ persons at the
subject property nor has responsibility for the property. (Id.) Lastly,
he declares that Park Hotels does not conduct any continuous or systematic
business activities in California. (Dell’Orto Declaration ¶ 4.)
          In opposition, Plaintiff does not
offer any evidence to demonstrate this Court has jurisdiction over Park Hotels.
Instead, Plaintiff urges that “Counsel for Defendant did not attempt to meet
and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the present matter.” (Opposition
p. 1: 23-24.) However, there is no meet and confer requirement before filing a
CCP Section 418.10 motion. 
As Plaintiff does not offer any evidence to support
the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction, and the Defendant has offered evidence to
the contrary, the Court finds that it cannot exercise general jurisdiction over
Defendant Park Hotels. (See Doe
v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cashel & Emly (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th
209, 217, referencing Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996)
14 Cal.4th 434, 449.)
b.
Specific Jurisdiction
To
exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant, there must be a
substantial connection with a business relationship defendant has purposefully
formed with California. (Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc.
(1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 448.) Here, Park Hotels urges that this is not the case.
Despite Plaintiff’s allegations that Park Hotels owns and operates the subject
property, Park Hotels urges that it does not do so. In support, Park Hotels
provides the declaration of its executive vice president and CFO, as described
above. Its attorney declares that Park Hotels does not own, lease, operate,
manage, occupy or control the Arcadia Hilton Garden Inn property. (Dell’Orto
Decl. ¶ 4.) He further declares that Park Hotels has no business relationship
with the property, its employees or the state of California. (Id.) 
In
opposition, Plaintiff does not offer any evidence to demonstrate this Court has
jurisdiction over Park Hotels. As Plaintiff does not offer any evidence to
support the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction, and the Defendant has offered
evidence that it is not subject to specific jurisdiction, the Court finds that
it cannot exercise specific jurisdiction over Defendant Park Hotels. 
In
sum, Park Hotels has provided evidence that it is not subject to general or
specific personal jurisdiction in California. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
           Specially appearing
entity Park Hotels’ motion to quash service of summons is GRANTED. Park Hotels is
ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
