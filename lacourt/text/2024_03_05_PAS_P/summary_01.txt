```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has tentatively ruled to grant Park Hotels' motion to quash service of summons. The Court finds that it cannot exercise general jurisdiction over Park Hotels because the defendant does not have sufficient minimum contacts with California. Additionally, the Court finds that it cannot exercise specific jurisdiction over Park Hotels because the defendant does not have a substantial connection with a business relationship in California. The Court orders Park Hotels to provide notice of this ruling.
