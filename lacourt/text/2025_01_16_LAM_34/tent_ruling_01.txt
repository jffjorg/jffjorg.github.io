Legal
Standard
 
            A prevailing party is entitled to
recover its attorney’s fees when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (See
CCP § 1033.5(a)(10); Civ. Code § 1717(a).) “A successful party means a
prevailing party, and [a party] may be considered prevailing parties for
attorney’s fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation
which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.” (Bowman
v. City of Berkeley (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)
 
Discussion
 
1.              
The Parties’ Arguments
 
            Defendant Friedman moves the court
to award him $47,450.00, which is comprised of $18,980.00 in attorney’s fees, and
$28,470.00 in a lodestar multiplier of 2.50. (Motion for Attorney’s Fees, at p.
10.) 
 
            In opposition, Plaintiffs concede
that Friedman is entitled to attorney’s fees for prevailing on his anti-SLAPP
Motion. (Opp., at pp. 5-6.) Nevertheless, Plaintiffs argue that Friedman’s anti-SLAPP Motion
was not factually or legally complex. (Ibid.) As such, Plaintiffs
contend that Friedman should not be able to recover more than Defendants Sill
and Ballin. (Id., at p. 3.)
 
2.              
Authority for Fees & Prevailing Party
 
a.               
Legal Standard 
 
“Except as provided in paragraph (2), in any action subject
to subdivision (b), a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall
be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs. If the court
finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to
cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s
fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion, pursuant to Section 128.5.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) 
 
“A defendant who prevails on a special motion to strike in an
action subject to paragraph (1) shall not be entitled to attorney’s fees and
costs if that cause of action is brought pursuant to Section 11130, 11130.3,
54960, or 54960.1 of the Government Code, or pursuant to Chapter 2 (commencing
with Section 7923.100) of Part 4 of Division 10 of Title 1 of the Government
Code. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a prevailing
defendant from recovering attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to Section
7923.115, 11130.5, or 54960.5 of the Government Code.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
425.16, subd. (c)(2).) 
 
b.              
Discussion 
 
            On September 24, 2024, the court
granted Friedman’s anti-SLAPP Motion and struck Friedman from the complaint.
(Minute Order dated September 24, 2024.) 
 
            Friedman
is a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike that is not brought
pursuant to one of the causes of action listed in Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16, subdivision (c)(2). Thus, Friedman is entitled to recover her
attorney’s fees and costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) 
 
3.              
Method of Calculation for Fees 
 
a.               
Legal Standard 
 
            “Section 425.16, subdivision (c),
provides that a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be
entitled to recover his or her attorney's fees and costs. It is well
established that the amount of an attorney fee award under the anti-SLAPP statute
is computed by the trial court in accordance with the familiar lodestar method.
Under that method, the court tabulates the attorney fee touchstone, or
lodestar, by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by the
reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar work.” (569
East Cnty. Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 426, 432, brackets, quotations, internal quotation marks
omitted.) 
 
b.              
Discussion 
             
Friedman argues that the lodestar
adjustment method should be used to calculate attorney’s fees. (Motion for
Attorney’s Fees, at p. 8.)  
 
Plaintiffs do not dispute this or propose
a different method. 
 
            The court uses the lodestar
adjustment method to calculate fees.
 
4.              
Reasonableness of the Fees Claimed
 
a.               
Reasonableness of the Hourly Rates
 
                                                        
i.                   
Legal Standard 
 
            “The courts repeatedly have stated
that the trial court is in the best position to value the services rendered by
the attorneys in his or her courtroom, and this includes the determination of
the hourly rate that will be used in the lodestar calculus. In making its
calculation, the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the
legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney
requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that
skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing
fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.” (569 East
County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 426, 437, citations omitted.) 
 
                                                      
ii.                   
Discussion 
 
            Counsel for Friedman, Bryan Pease (“Pease”),
has an hourly rate of $650.00 per hour. (Pease Decl., ¶ 9.) Pease graduated
from State University of New York and has practiced as an attorney for over 10
years. (Id., ¶ 8.)
 
            Plaintiffs
do not make an opposing argument about Pease’s hourly rates.
 
            After considering the information
provided, the court finds that the appropriate hourly rate for Counsel Pease is
$500.00 per hour. 
 
b.              
Reasonableness of the Number of Hours
 
                                                        
i.                   
Legal Standard 
 
            “Under the lodestar adjustment
methodology, the trial court must initially determine the actual time expended
and then ascertain whether under all the circumstances¿of the case the amount
of actual time expended and the monetary charge being made for the time
expended are reasonable. Factors to be considered include, but are not limited
to, the complexity of the case and procedural demands, the attorney skill
exhibited and the results achieved. The prevailing party and fee applicant
bears the burden of showing that the fees incurred were reasonably necessary
to¿the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount. It follows
that if the prevailing party fails to meet this burden, and the court finds the
time expended or amount charged is not reasonable under the circumstances, then
the court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser
amount.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of N. Am., LLC (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240,
247 [cleaned up].) 
 
                                                      
ii.                   
Discussion 
 
            Counsel Pease claims that 29.20
total hours were incurred in filing Friedman’s anti-SLAPP Motion and this fee
motion. (Pease Decl., ¶ 18.) The court finds this amount unreasonable. Friedman
filed his anti-SLAPP Motion two months after the court granted Ballin’s Motion
and after the parties had agreed that the Motions could be granted. The court finds
that a further reduction in the number of hours granted in Sill’s Motion for
Attorney’s fees is warranted given that Sill filed her anti-SLAPP motion prior
to the court’s determination of Ballin’s anti-SLAPP motion. Conversely,
Friedman filed his motion after the court granted both Ballin’s and Sill’s anti-SLAPP
motions and after the stipulation was entered.
 
            Accordingly, the court will grant Friedman’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees, in part, in the reduced amount of $2,500.00 (5.0
hours at $500.00 per hour).  
 
5.              
Reasonableness of Multiplier 
 
a.               
Legal Standard 
 
            Relevant
factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.
(Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
 
            The
contingent risks, preclusion of other work, skill, and difficulty counsel
assert are absorbed by counsel’s hourly rates. (Robertson v. Fleetwood
Travel Trailers of California Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 822.)
 
b.              
Discussion 
 
            Friedman argues that Counsel Pease
has no guarantee that counsel will be able to collect from Plaintiffs creating
a contingency risk which is even greater as Plaintiffs are also appealing.
(Motion for Attorney’s Fees, at p. 10.) Additionally, Friedman contends that in
order to encourage attorneys to defend free speech and when recovery is
uncertain, the court should award a multiplier. (Ibid.) As such, Friedman
requests that a multiplier of 2.50 be applied to the combined lodestar of $18,980.00
for a total award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $47,450.00. (Ibid.)
 
            In opposition, Plaintiffs do not
make any direct argument against Friedman’s request for a multiplier.   
 
            Nevertheless, the court denies Friedman’s
request for a 2.50 lodestar multiplier. Given the timing of the work done in
this case and the guaranteed results eventually obtained, a multiplier is not
appropriate. Any contingency risk factor is already accounted for in counsel’s
hourly rate of $500.00 per hour, which the court has found to be reasonable. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Friedman’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees is GRANTED, in part, in the reduced amount of $2,500.00.
