On June 24,
2024, Defendant Oceanic LA LP (“Oceanic”) filed an answer to Plaintiff’s
complaint. 
 
On September 17, 2024, the parties filed a
Notice of Conditional Settlement. 
 
On November
19, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Enforce Settlement. No opposition or
other responsive pleading has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).) 
 
“Section 664.6 was enacted to provide
a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without
the need for a new lawsuit.” (Weddington Prod., Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 809.) In deciding motions made under Section 664.6, judges
“must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding
settlement.” (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530,
1533.) 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
contends that on September 5, 2024, the parties agreed to settle and entered
into a settlement agreement providing that Plaintiff would be paid a sum of
$118,500.00 in exchange for signing the agreement and complying with its terms
to dismiss this action with prejudice providing a general release of all claims
to Oceanic. (Motion, at p. 3; Ben-Ari Decl., ¶ 3.) A payment of $45,000.00 was
to be paid to Plaintiff on October 15, 2024, and the remaining payment of $73,500.00
was to be paid on October 31, 2024. (Ben-Ari Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff received an
initial payment of $73,500.00. (Id., ¶ 10.) However, Plaintiff has not received
the remaining payment of $45,000.00 despite the parties’ communications. (Id.,
¶¶ 11-13, Exhs. 6-7.) Plaintiff provides a copy of the executed settlement
agreement. (Id., ¶ 9, Exh. 5.) Plaintiff also contends that the
settlement agreement allows for the recovery of attorney’s fees incurred in
bringing this motion in the amount of $4,447.50. (Motion, at p. 5.) 
 
            No
opposition has been filed. 
 
            The
court finds that the statutory requirements of section 664.6 have been met.
Further, Defendants did not oppose the motion. A failure to oppose a motion may
be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion. (CRC, Rule 8.54(c).)
Plaintiff’s motion is therefore granted to enforce the remaining $45,000.00
payment due.
 
            As to
Plaintiff's request for attorney’s fees, the settlement agreement provides in
section 20(d) that the agreement is “enforceable under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6, and therefore the prevailing party, as that term is
defined by CCP § 1032(a)(4), in any enforcement proceeding with respect to this
Agreement is entitled to its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred to
enforce this Agreement.” (Ben-Ari Decl., ¶ 9, Exh. 5, at p. 11.) As such,
Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees. Plaintiff’s counsel, Omri
A. Ben-Ari, declares to have an hourly rate of $675.00 per hour and spent 4.50
hours drafting this motion and exhibits with an anticipated 1.50 hours to
prepare a reply brief and 0.50 hours for attending the hearing on this motion
for a total of $4,447.50 in attorney’s fees. (Id., ¶¶ 14-15.) 
 
            The
court determines that a reasonable hourly rate for Plaintiff’s counsel is
$500.00 per hour due to his level of experience and complexity of the matter.
Additionally, as Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed, there is no need for an
additional 1.50 hours to be spent by counsel. As such, the court awards
Plaintiff $2,500.00 in attorney’s fees, comprised of 5.00 hours of counsel’s
time at the hourly rate of $500.00. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Lesbia Mazariegos
Maldonado’s Motion to Enforce Settlement and Request for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED.
 Judgment is entered against Defendant
Oceanic LA LP in the total amount of $45,000.00.  Attorney’s
fees are AWARDED in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants, jointly and
severally, in the reduced amount of $2,500.00.
