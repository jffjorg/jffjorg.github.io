And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Defendant Matt Friedman's Motion for Attorney's Fees, in part, in the reduced amount of $2,500.00. Friedman had requested $47,450.00 in attorney's fees and costs, but the court reduced the amount due to the relatively simple nature of Friedman's anti-SLAPP motion and the fact that the court had already granted similar fees to other defendants in the case. The court also denied Friedman's request for a lodestar multiplier of 2.50, finding that the contingency risk was already accounted for in counsel's hourly rate of $500.00 per hour.
