And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motions to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Teresa Zarate Gomez, and the non-party, Daniel Morga. The plaintiff had previously failed to appear for deposition on the initial noticed date, and the non-party had failed to answer questions and produce documents during deposition. The judge has ordered a second deposition session for both the plaintiff and the non-party, and has required them to produce all responsive documents.

The judge has also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,600, payable by the plaintiff and her counsel to the defendant and defense counsel. This amount represents the time and effort spent preparing the motions and appearing at the hearing.
