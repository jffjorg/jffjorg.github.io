And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The defendants, including Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., Woodbine Legacy/Playa Owner LLC, Davidson Hotel Company LLC, and Steve Wisner, argued that they had no duty to enact burdensome preventative security measures, such as posting a security guard, and that they acted sufficiently to prevent and discover criminal activity on the premises.

The judge found that the defendants had no actual knowledge of similar violent criminal activity occurring at the hotel prior to the subject incident, and that the hotel had several security measures in place, including a system of security cameras, a silent alarm, employee safety training, and an overnight security guard.

The judge also found that the hotel staff did not attempt to physically intervene to prevent or end the attack, and that law enforcement would not have arrived in time to stop the incident even if the hotel staff had called 911 earlier.

The judge denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication on the issue of whether a reasonable jury could find that failing to call 911 earlier was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's injuries, but granted the motion as to the defendants' claim that they had no duty to enact burdensome preventative security measures.

The judge also overruled the plaintiff's objections to certain declarations and exhibits, and sustained the defendants' objections to certain statements within the declarations of Robert Jakucs and Jay Hirokawa.
