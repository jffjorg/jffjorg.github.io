And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiff, Gabriel Fierro, to deem certain requests for admission (RFAs) admitted against the defendant, Veolia Transportation Services, Inc. and Transdev Services, Inc. The plaintiff had moved to deem the RFAs admitted or, in the alternative, to compel further responses to the RFAs. The defendant had objected to the motion and provided verifications on May 30, 2024. The judge denied the plaintiff's motion, finding that the defendant had provided verifications and that the plaintiff had failed to address the substance of the defendant's objections to the RFAs. The judge noted that the plaintiff's separate statement did not provide the RFAs or their responses, and that the plaintiff's argument did not demonstrate that the defendant's responses were evasive or incomplete.
