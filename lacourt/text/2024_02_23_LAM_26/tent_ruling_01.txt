  Case No.:  23STCV16364
 
  Hearing Date:  February 23, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motions to be relieved as counsel
 



 
On January 18, 2024, Bleau Fox, a
Professional Law Corporation (“Counsel”), filed the instant motions to be
relieved as counsel for Defendants Elena Nikolayevna Koroteeva and Ozopac Inc.
dba V-Red West Covina (jointly, “Clients”).
Counsel has filed a form MC051 and MC-052 as
to each Client and has lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed order on
form MC-053 pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362.  
The MC-052 form states that Counsel served
Clients via mail at Clients’ last known mailing address which Counsel states he
has confirmed as current within 30 days of the motion by conversing with
Clients through email. 
Counsel states “[t]here has been a
breakdown in attorney-client communication preventing [Counsel] from zealously
representing the client. [Clients] ha[ve] failed and continues failing to
cooperate with his counsel. Furthermore, [Clients] ha[ve] failed to fulfill [their]
financial obligations.”  
Counsel is ordered to appear at the
hearing and submit corrected MC-051 and MC-052 forms as well as a corrected
proposed order on form MC-053.  Provided
that such corrected forms are submitted, based on the declaration filed by
Counsel, the Court is inclined to grant the motions.  However, the motions and declarations on
forms MC-051 and MC-052 and the proposed order on form MC-053 for each Client
have not been properly completed.
The Court’s records show the following
upcoming hearings, which must all be listed in the revised proposed order
(MC-053) for each Client: 
 
-       In
item 7 (next scheduled hearing): “Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment or
Summary Adjudication set for April 26, 2024 at 8:30 am at 111 N. Hill Street,
Dept. 26, L.A., CA 90012.  Failure to file
timely written opposition papers or failure to appear at the April 26, 2024 hearing
may result in the Court granting Defendant’s motion for summary judgment or
adjudication.”;
 
 
-       In
Item 8 (additional hearings): “Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal of unnamed Doe
defendants and Roe cross-defendants set for May 24, 2024 at 8:30 am at 111 N. Hill Street, Dept. 26, L.A.,
CA 90012”
 
 
-      
In
Item 9, Counsel must also include the following language “Failure to appear at
trial will result in: (1) the Court deeming that Defendant waives Defendant’s
appearance for trial, (2) the trial proceeding in Defendant’s absence, and (3)
the entry of judgment against Defendant in any amount of damages proven at
trial.”
 
-       Additional
language for Item 13 for Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina only: “A corporation
must be represented by licensed counsel in proceedings before this Court. Ozopac
Inc. dba V-Red West Covina is ordered to file a substitution of counsel within 30
days of service of this signed order and to appear on April 3, 2024 at 8:30 am
in Department 26 with its new counsel.  Ozopac
Inc. dba V-Red West Covina’s failure to timely retain new counsel or failure to
appear on April 3, 2024 may result in the answer being stricken, the entry of
default and default judgment against Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina.  Moving Counsel is ordered to file proof of
service of this signed order on all parties within 3 days.”
 
Counsel is responsible for determining if
there are any other hearings scheduled or due dates for discovery for this
case, including any motions hearings, which must all be listed in the proposed
order.  For each hearing, Counsel must
state the date, time, and location of the hearing (“111 N. Hill Street, Dept.
26, Los Angeles, CA 90012”). For each due date for discovery, Counsel must
identify the nature of the discovery responses that are outstanding, the due
date, and the address where verified responses must be sent.
As to defendant Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West
Covina, the Court notes that while a corporation has the capacity to bring a
lawsuit because it has all the powers of a natural person in carrying out its
business, under a long-standing common law rule of procedure, a corporation,
unlike a natural person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in
propria persona, nor can it represent itself through a corporate officer,
director or other employee who is not an attorney.  (CLD
Const., Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.)  “[A Corporation] must be represented by
licensed counsel in proceedings before courts of record.  (Id.;
Gutierrez v. G & M Oil Co., Inc.
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 551, 564; Thomas
G. Ferruzzo, Inc. v. Superior Court (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 501, 503.)
However, “[a]n attorney may be allowed to withdraw without offending the rule
against corporate self-representation.” (Thomas
G. Ferruzzo, Inc., supra, 104 Cal.App.3d at 504.)
In light of these authorities, the Court
will require that Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina timely retain new counsel
and file a substitution of counsel within 30 days of service of the signed
order (MC-053) so that new counsel will be prepared for trial by the current
trial date.  The court hereby sets an OSC
regarding status of Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina’s representation for April
3, 2024 at 8:30 am in Department 26.  Ozopac
Inc. dba V-Red West Covina is ordered to appear on April 3, 2024 with its new counsel,
who should be prepared to address counsel’s readiness for trial by the current
trial date.  
If Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina fails
to file a substitution of counsel within 30 days of service of the signed
order, Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina is ordered to appear on April 3, 2024
at 8:30 am in Department 26 and show cause why Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West
Covina’s answer should not be stricken, and why default and default judgment
should not be entered against Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina on Plaintiff’s
Complaint.  Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West
Covina’s failure to appear on April 3, 2024 at 8:30 am in Department 26 shall
be deemed consent to: striking of Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina’s answer,
and entry of default and default judgment against Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West
Covina on Plaintiff’s Complaint.
The proposed orders (MC-053) are to be corrected
to add the April 3, 2024 OSC hearing to items 8 and 13, and to add the following
language to item 9: “Failure to appear at trial will result in: (1) the Court
deeming that Defendant waives Defendant’s appearance for trial, (2) the trial
proceeding in Defendant’s absence, and (3) the entry of judgment against
Defendant in any amount of damages proven at trial.”
The corrected Orders will be signed and
filed, and Counsel will be relieved as counsel of record for Defendants Elena
Nikolayevna Koroteeva and Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina, effective only
upon Counsel’s filing of the proofs of service of the signed Orders upon each client
Defendants Elena Nikolayevna Koroteeva and Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina at
each Client’s last known address.  Counsel
will remain the attorney of record until Counsel files proofs of service of the
signed orders as to both Defendants Elena Nikolayevna Koroteeva and Ozopac Inc.
dba V-Red West Covina. 
Counsel is ordered to serve copies of the
instant order and the signed form MC-053 order on all parties, including Defendants
Elena Nikolayevna Koroteeva and Ozopac Inc. dba V-Red West Covina, and file
proof of service of such within 3 days.
