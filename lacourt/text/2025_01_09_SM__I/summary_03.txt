And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by Rivian to compel arbitration in a Song Beverly Act case filed by the plaintiff. Rivian argues that the plaintiff is bound by an arbitration agreement in the Purchase Agreement, which was incorporated into the Warranty Agreement. However, the judge is not persuaded by Rivian's arguments. The judge finds that the arbitration clause in the Purchase Agreement does not apply to the plaintiff, as Rivian is not a signatory to the Purchase Agreement. Additionally, the judge finds that the Warranty Agreement is not binding on the plaintiff, as the plaintiff never signed the agreement. The judge also rejects Rivian's third-party beneficiary argument, finding that it is not clear from the contract that Rivian is a third-party beneficiary. The judge concludes that Rivian has not established an arbitration agreement between it and the plaintiff, and therefore denies the motion to compel arbitration.
