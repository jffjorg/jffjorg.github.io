And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is not pleased with the continuance request made by the witness and counsel, citing that the witness had a month to notify the court about the medical procedure and that counsel had time to prepare. The judge is also skeptical of the appeal filed by Pimi and Pilar, as they have yet to request a stay pending appeal and have had a year to do so. The judge will sanction Pilar and Pimi for the costs incurred preparing for the deposition and will condition the new deposition date on counsel's representation that she has authority to accept service of process. The judge is frustrated with the lack of urgency and cooperation from the parties and warns that further delays may result in further sanctions.
