And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding Defendant James Pakulis' motion to disqualify Plaintiff's counsel, Harrison Kordestani, Craig Chisvin, Kordestani Legal Partners, and CLC Law Group. The judge finds that Defendant has waived his right to move for disqualification due to an unreasonable delay in filing the motion. Additionally, the judge finds that Defendant has failed to demonstrate a conflict of interest between Plaintiff and MarJa, which is a necessary condition for disqualification. The judge notes that the case has already concluded and is currently pending on appeal, and questions whether the court has jurisdiction over the matter. Based on these findings, the judge denies Defendant's motion to disqualify.
