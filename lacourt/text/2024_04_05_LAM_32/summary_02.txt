And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on Defendant Mayelyn Swayze's motion for determination of good faith settlement. The case involves an auto accident on Interstate 5 in Los Angeles on August 13, 2020, in which Plaintiffs Manuel Perfecto Valdez and Jose Perfecto Valdez were involved. The accident occurred when a vehicle owned by Bekins A-1 Movers, Inc. and driven by Jorge Salcido collided with Plaintiffs' vehicle. The Bekins vehicle allegedly made an unsafe lane change after colliding with another vehicle driven by Moises Medina and owned by Mayelyn Swayze. Plaintiffs also claim damages from being rear-ended by a vehicle driven by Mario Ulloa and owned by Maria Ulloa.

After mediation, Plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement with Defendant Swayze and Medina, wherein Plaintiffs would each receive $72,000. The Court finds that the settlement was entered into in good faith, as the agreement resulted from arms-length negotiations overseen by a neutral mediator, and the settlement amount is within the ballpark of Defendants' potential liability. There is no indication of bad faith or collusion. Therefore, the Court grants Defendant Swayze's motion for determination of good faith settlement.
