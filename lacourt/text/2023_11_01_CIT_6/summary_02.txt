And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has tentatively ruled to grant the motion of Plaintiff's Counsel, Connor M. Trafton, to be relieved as counsel. Counsel has provided the required Judicial Council forms and proofs of service, and has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. The Court finds that the deterioration of the attorney-client relationship is sufficient grounds for withdrawal. However, the Court notes that the declaration does not specify the time or place for certain hearings, and that the proposed order is incomplete in certain respects. Therefore, Counsel must submit a corrected proposed order addressing these issues. Once the corrected order is signed by the Court, it will become effective upon Counsel filing proof of service of same upon Plaintiff.
