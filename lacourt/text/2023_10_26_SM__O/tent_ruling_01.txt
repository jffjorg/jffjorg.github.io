TENTATIVE
RULING
Defendant Jovo B.
Majstorovic’s Motion for Summary Judgement is DENIED. Defendant did not meet
their burden of establishing that the Plaintiff is not entitled to a
declaration in its favor. Furthermore, Plaintiffs met their burden of raising a
triable issue of material facts.            
  
“The summary judgment
procedures of C.C.P. 437c are applicable to declaratory relief actions.” ((c)
[§ 247] Actions for Declaratory Relief., 6 Witkin, Cal. Proc. 6th PWT § 247
(2023); see Walker v. Munro (1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 67, 70. [“it is
apparent that section 437c was intended to include declaratory relief actions
in a proper case.].) “If there is a jurisdictional defect not apparent on the
face of the complaint, or if the relief sought is dependent upon facts which
are shown by uncontradicted affidavits not to exist, or if it appears that in
the particular case the court desires to exercise the discretion invested in it
by section 1061, Code of Civil Procedure, there is no reason why the case
should be prolonged and a summary judgment not granted.” (Walker, supra,
178 Cal.App.2d at pp. 70–71.)
 
“Thus, in a declaratory
relief action, the defendant's burden is to establish the plaintiff is not
entitled to a declaration in its favor. It may do this by establishing (1) the
sought-after declaration is legally incorrect; (2) undisputed facts do not support
the premise for the sought-after declaration; or (3) the issue is otherwise not
one that is appropriate for declaratory relief.” (Gafcon, Inc. v. Ponsor
& Associates (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1402.)
 
“A party is entitled to
summary judgment only if it meets its initial burden of showing there are no
triable issues of fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter
of law. This is true even if the opposing party fails to file any opposition.
The court's assessment of whether the moving party has carried its burden—and
therefore caused a shift—occurs before the court's evaluation of the opposing
party's papers. Therefore, the burden on the motion does not initially shift as
a result of what is, or is not, contained in the opposing papers.” (Mosley
v. Pacific Specialty Insurance Company (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 417, 434–435 [landlord’s
failure to address issue of whether they were aware of their tenant’s marijuana
growing operation was not grounds to grant summary judgment where moving party
failed to satisfy its initial burden as to the issue]; (Thatcher v. Lucky
Stores, Inc. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1081, 1086-1087 [court cannot grant
summary judgment based merely on lack of opposition; court must first determine
if the moving party has satisfied its burden].)
 
In addition, the
evidence and affidavits of the moving party are construed strictly, while those
of the opponent are liberally read. (See Government Employees Ins. Co. v.
Sup. Ct. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 95, 100.) “All doubts as to the propriety of
granting the motion (whether there is any issue of material fact [Code of Civil
Procedure] § 437c) are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion
(i.e., a denial of summary judgment).” (Hamburg v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 497, 502.)
 
I.               
Triable Issues of Fact Remain as to the
Plaintiff’s Complaint for Declaratory Judgment
 
Defendant Jovo B.
Majstorovic ("JBM") argues he is entitled to summary judgment on
Plaintiff’s Declaratory Relief claim because (1) JBM purportedly gave renewal
notice by mail and the rebuttable presumption of CA Evidence Code section 641
apply (2) Plaintiff MSS Properties Special Purpose II, LLC’s (“MSS”) has no
standing to bring the action, and (3) MSS allegedly waived the right to assert
the Sublease terminated on 8-8-22 because MSS allegedly accepted rent for the
full month of August, 2022. 
 
            A.        There
is a triable issue regarding JBL’s exercise of its option to renew the lease.
 
“The renewal option in a
lease is an irrevocable offer by the landlord that binds the landlord in
advance to make a contract if the tenant exercises its option and accepts the
offer, but the tenant is free to accept or reject the offer. The act of
exercising the option is the act of accepting an offer and is subject to the
general rules applicable to an acceptance.” (§ 34:36. Option to extend or renew
lease term—Requirements for exercise of the option, 10 Cal. Real Est. § 34:36
(4th ed.), citations omitted.)
 
When an offer specifies
the manner in which an acceptance must be communicated, no other method is
sufficient (§ 1:41. When acceptance is effective, 1 Cal. Real Est. § 1:41 (4th
ed.); see Palo Alto Town & Country Village, Inc. v. BBTC Company
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 494, 500 [“in the absence of any specified means in the lease,
plaintiff's thesis against ordinary mail seems to us to be an astonishing one
in the light of the common practice of today's world of business.”].) “If a
proposal prescribes any conditions concerning the communication of its
acceptance, the proposer is not bound unless they are conformed to; but in
other cases any reasonable and usual mode may be adopted.” (Civ. Code, § 1582.)
 
JBM states he provided
Plaintiff with written notice of his intention to extend the Sublease term on
or around March 1, 2022 by mailing the notice, via regular stamped mail, with
return address, from a Post Office in Serbia to the correct Plaintiff’s address
at 6524 Fremont Circle, Huntington Beach, California 92648. (See JBM Decl., ¶¶
6, 7, Ex. 2–5.) 
 
Section 3 of the
sublease agreement provides for the sublease extension requirement of written
notice made at least ninety days before the sublease term end date. (Id. ¶
4, Ex. 1.) JBM allegedly mailed the notice on 3-1-22, which is more than ninety
days prior to the sublease end date of 8-8-22 or 8-9-22 (See SSUMF, ¶ 1 [Parties
dispute the correct sublease end date].) The sublease agreement expressly
provides for notices to be deemed valid only if sent by certified mail, return
receipt requested. (See JBM Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 15 [“All notices hereunder must be
in writing and, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be deemed validly given
if sent by certified mail, return receipt requested,” emphasis added.].)
JBM mailed the notice via regular stamped mail without a return receipt, and
thus JBM’s notice did not comply with the express terms of the sublease
agreement. 
 
Furthermore, if in fact
regular mail would have been accepted by MSS, MSS argues they never received
the noticed letter until the notice was personally dropped at their address on
8-8-22, well past the ninety-day notice deadline. (Summers Decl., ¶ 25, Ex. 5.)
MSS rejected this notice via US mail, postage prepaid, certified receipt, and
in an email to JBM. (Id. ¶ 26, Ex. 6.) 
 
JBM argues the “Mailbox Rule”
applies from Evidence Code § 641, and thus even if MSS did not receive the
3-1-22 mailed notice, the date of the notice shipment is the effective date of
notice. Evidence Code § 641 establishes a presumption of receipt stating “[a] letter
correctly addressed and properly mailed is presumed to have been received in
the ordinary course of mail." (Evid. Code § 641.) “The effect of a
presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence is to require the trier
of fact to assume the existence of the presumed fact unless and until evidence
is introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence, in which case
the trier of fact shall determine the existence or nonexistence of the presumed
fact from the evidence and without regard to the presumption.” (Evid. Code, §
604.) 
 
Here, JBM attached
evidence of the stamped envelope, letter, and receipt, but no evidence that the
letter was actually shipped, or placed in the mailbox. (JBM Decl., Ex. 2–5.)
Furthermore, there is no evidence of a tracking number, or return receipt
requested. (Id.). JBM also did not “properly” mail the notice letter, as
he did not utilize certified mail, return receipt requested, or any other
manner of tracking the letter. (Morasse Decl., ¶ 2B, 2C, 2E [“JBM admits that
return receipt was available but he did not use it.”].)
 
Thus, there is a triable
issue of material fact as to whether JBM’s method of the alleged renewal option
acceptance was properly noticed, or reasonable.  Thus, the Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Judgment is DENIED. 
 
            B.        JBM has
failed to show MSS does not have standing.
 
In reliance on the
allegations of the complaint, JBM argues (1) MSS’s complaint pleads no further assignments
or subleases and thus Ambulnz Health “has the right to the property through
2042”; (2) MSS first provided a notice of Abandonment on 2-4-19 one year after
MSS claims Ambulnz abandoned the property; (3) Section 17.03 of the
MSS/AmeriCare contract specifically provides that the lease continues in effect
as long as the landlord does not terminate the tenant’s right to possession;
(4) Section 17.03(c) further provides that no act by the landlord other than
its giving notice of termination terminates the Master Lease, and Plaintiff did
not do this. (MSJ, p. 7–9.) 
 
In response, Plaintiff provides
evidence showing (1) the Master Lease was modified by an assignment effective
6-1-17 changing the premises under the Master Lease to cover the entire second
floor and uncovered parking lot, and remainder of the Property reverted back to
MSS at that time (Summers Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 2); (2) the Master lease terminated on
3-31-18 through the statutory notice of belief of abandonment process under Civ
code §§ 1951.3(b) and 1951.35(b) after giving notice on 2-3-18 (Summer Decl., ¶¶
9–11, Ex. 3 [See Summers Decl., Fn 1, p. 3 - Summers states there is a date
typo on when the notice was sent stating the year 2017, but the correct year is
2018].); and (3) the Master lease expired on its own on 9-30-22 as per the
terms of the assignment (Summers Decl., ¶ 14, Ex. 2.)  Thus, JBM has failed to establish as a matter
of law that Plaintiff does not have standing to bring the complaint.
 
            C.        There
is a triable issue regarding JBL’s affirmative defense that Plaintiff waived
its right to renew the lease.
 
JBM argues Plaintiff
waived its right to claim JBM did not renew the lease because “Plaintiff
accepted defendant’s payment of rent for the full month of August 2022, and
therefore cannot contend that the Sublease ended on August 8, 2022.” (MSJ, pp.
9–10.) JBM cites to Gould v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc, “Acceptance of
benefits under a lease is conduct that supports a finding of waiver.” (Gould
v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc, (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1179.) Defendant
also states the Plaintiff tried to return part of the payment, but the
defendant refused, and Defendant has since tendered his monthly rental payments
each month after. (MSJ, p. 10.) Plaintiff provides a declaration and evidence
of the prorated check for the period of 8-9-22 to 8-31-22 by certified mail,
return receipt requested, which was returned to Plaintiff, and Plaintiff then
sent it to attorney Michael Smalley. (Summer Decl., ¶ 27, Ex. 6.)  Plaintiff further attests to not accepting
any rent from JBM for any period after 8-8-22 to the present. (Summer Decl., ¶
28.)  Thus, JBM has failed to establish
its defense of waiver as a matter of law.
