RULING
Defendant David R. Moradi’s Demurrer to the Plaintiff’s 2nd,
3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th,
and 8th Causes of Action in the FAC is OVERRULED. Defendant David R.
Moradi’s Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s FAC Prayer Paragraphs Seven and Nine is DENIED.
Plaintiff successfully alleges all the elements for the 2nd–8th
Causes of Action in the FAC.  
            
I.               
Defendant’s Demurrer to the FAC  
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The
only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to
show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.; Lewis v.
YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f there is any
reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it
is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada
Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
 
Plaintiff is only required to allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts. (See Committee on Children's Television, Inc. v. General
Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 212 [“the complaint should set forth the
ultimate facts constituting the cause of action, not the evidence by which
plaintiff proposes to prove those facts”); 1 Cal. Affirmative Def. § 10:2 (2d
ed.) [allegations of agency, course and scope of employment, etc. qualify as
ultimate facts].) Plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as true on demurrer.
(See Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924
[“For purposes of reviewing a demurrer, we accept the truth of material facts
properly pleaded in the operative complaint”].)
 
 
a.    
2nd Cause of action - Violation Of
Health And Safety Code under §§ 123100, Et Seq - OVERRULED
 
“[A]ny adult patient of a health care provider . . . and any
patient's personal representative shall be entitled to inspect patient records
upon presenting to the health care provider a request for those records and
upon payment of reasonable costs.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 123110(a).)
“A health care provider shall permit this inspection during
business hours within five working days after receipt of this request.” (Id.)
“Any patient or her representative shall be entitled to a paper or electronic
copy of all or any portion of her records that they have a right to inspect,
upon presenting to the healthcare provider a request specifying the records to
be copied.” (Health & Saf. Code § 123110(b)(1).) “A health care provider
shall ensure that copies are transmitted within 15 days after receiving the
request.” (Health & Saf. Code § 123110(b)(1).) 
 
“Any patient or representative aggrieved by a violation of
Section 123110 may, in addition to any other remedy provided by law, bring an
action against the health care provider to enforce the obligations prescribed
by Section 123110. Any judgment rendered in the action may, in the discretion
of the court, include an award of costs and reasonable attorney fees to the
prevailing party.” (Health & Saf. Code § 123120.)
 
Plaintiff alleges:
 
(1)    
Defendant Moradi is a health care provider within the
meaning of Health and Safety code § 123105. (FAC, ¶ 38.)  
 
(2)    
Plaintiff submitted formal record requests to Defendant
pursuant to Health and Safety Code § 123110 on November 9, 2021, and December
13, 2022, and Defendant knowingly and intentionally continues to withhold the requested
medical records to this date. (FAC, ¶ 39, 40, 41.)
 
(3)    
Plaintiff alleges that through Defendant not providing
her with the requested records she will be irreparably harmed by denying her
access to her own medical records for which Plaintiff has no plain, speedy or
adequate remedy at law. (FAC, ¶ 42.)
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a
cause of action for Violation of Health And Safety Code under §§ 123100, Et Seq.  Defendant’s Demurrer to the 2nd
Cause of Action is OVERRULED. 
 
b.  2nd Cause of Action—Negligent Hiring And
Supervision – OVERRULED 
 
For a Negligent hiring and
Supervision claim a Plaintiff must plead: 1) That Defendant hired employees
named in Complaint; 2) That the employee was unfit or incompetent to perform
the work for which they were hired; 3) That Defendant knew or should have known
that employee was unfit or incompetent and that this unfitness or incompetence
created a particular risk to others; 4) That employee unfitness or incompetence
harmed Plaintiff; and 5) That Defendant’s negligence in hiring and supervising
said employee was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs’ harm. (See, CACI,
No. 426 - Negligent Hiring, Supervision, or Retention of Employee.)
 
Plaintiff’s FAC alleges that Defendant
Moradi works out of Defendant Agaki’s office, that Moradi hired and supervised
other named and unnamed defendants (employees), and that Defendants are alter
egos and/or joint enterprises. (FAC at ¶¶ 6-8, 46, 52). Plaintiff alleges: 
 
(1)  
Moradi hired employees (FAC, ¶ 46); 
 
(2)  
the employees were unfit and incompetent to perform the
dental or orthodontic work which they were hired (FAC, ¶ 47); 
 
(3)  
“Defendant[] knew or should have known that Employee
Defendants [DOES 1-50] were, or became, unfit and incompetent to perform the
orthodontic and dental work for which they were hired to perform and that this
unfitness and incompetence created a risk to others, including Plaintiff” (FAC,
¶ 48); 
 
(4)  
that employee unfitness or incompetence harmed
Plaintiff; (FAC at ¶¶ 49-50); and 
 
(5)  
that Defendants negligence in hiring and supervising
said employee was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s harm. (FAC at ¶¶
49-50.)
 
The Court finds Plaintiff has
successfully alleged all the elements of Negligent Hiring And Supervision. Defendant’s
Demurrer to the 3rd cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
a.    
4th cause of action —Fraudulent
Misrepresentation 
 
“The elements of fraud . . . are
(a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure);
(b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to
induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638.)
 
"A fraudulent
misrepresentation is one made with the knowledge that it is or may be untrue,
and with the intention that the person to whom it is made act in reliance
thereon. It must appear, however, not only that the plaintiff acted in reliance
on the misrepresentation but that he was justified in his reliance. He may not
justifiably rely upon mere statements of opinion, including legal conclusions
drawn from a true state of facts, unless the person expressing the opinion
purports to have expert knowledge concerning the matter or occupies a position
of confidence and trust. If, however, the opinion or legal conclusion
misrepresents the facts upon which it is based or implies the existence of
facts which are nonexistent, it constitutes an actionable
misrepresentation." (Wilke v. Coinway, Inc. (1967) 257 Cal.App.2d
126, 136, citations omitted, emphasis added)
 
Plaintiff alleges:
 
            (1) Moradi made numerous specific misrepresentations to
the Plaintiff on or about March                                                                    of
2021, April of 2021, and October 22, 2021 at 2:00 p.m. (FAC, ¶¶ 57–58); 
 
            (2) Moradi knew the misrepresentations were false (FAC, ¶
57); 
 
            (3) that Defendant intended to defraud Plaintiff or
induce reliance so that Plaintiff would                                                                be
obligated to pay Defendant additional money for Defendant’s services  (FAC, ¶¶ 58,     72.);

 
            (4) that Plaintiff was unaware of the truth and
justifiable relied on Defendant’s             misrepresentations
(FAC, ¶ 59); and 
 
(6)  
that Plaintiff sustained damages. (FAC, ¶¶ 60–61.)
 
Plaintiff further argues against
Defendant’s reliance on Wilke, and Plaintiff argues Wilke supports
the Plaintiff’s complaint. Under Wilke, Moradi is a person “expressing
an opinion purporting to have expert knowledge concerning the matter or
occupies a position of confidence and trust.” (Opposition, p. 15; Wilke,
supra, 257 Cal.App.2d at p. 136.) Defendant’s statements may have
been an opinion as argued by Defendant, but the opinion is still actionable
under Wilke because of Defendant’s purported professional skill and
knowledge in orthodontic work. 
 
Plaintiff has sufficiently
alleged the elements of Fraudulent Misrepresentation. Defendant’s Demurrer to
Plaintiff’s 4th Cause of Action is OVERRULED. 
 
b.    
5th Cause of Action—Negligent
Misrepresentation - OVERRULED
 
“Where the defendant makes
false statements, honestly believing that they are true, but without reasonable
ground for that belief, he or she may be liable for negligent
misrepresentation. If, however, defendant's belief is both honest and
reasonable, the misrepresentation is innocent and there is ordinarily no tort
liability.” (5 Witkin, Summary of California Law (2005) Torts, §818.)
 
To state a viable cause of
action for negligent misrepresentation, a party must plead the following:  “[1] misrepresentation of a past or existing
material fact, without reasonable ground for believing it to be true, and with
intent to induce another’s reliance on the fact misrepresented; [2] ignorance
of the truth and justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the party to
whom it was directed; and [3] resulting damage.” (Hydro-Mill Co., Inc. v.
Hayward, Tilton & Rolapp Ins. Associates, Inc., (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th
1145, 1154.)
 
Plaintiff successfully plead the
elements for Fraudulent Misrepresentation above, and the same set of
allegations and facts apply to Negligent Misrepresentation. More specifically,
Plaintiff pleads the following:
 
(1)  
Defendant Moradi made numerous misrepresentations to
Plaintiff (FAC, ¶¶ 53–56, 62); 
 
            (2) that Defendant’s ignorance of the truth and
justifiable reliance on the                                                                                                          misrepresentation by Plaintiff (FAC, ¶¶
64–66); and 
 
            (3) that Plaintiff was harmed or damaged (FAC, ¶¶ 67–68).
 
Plaintiff has successfully alleged
the elements of Negligent Misrepresentation. Defendant’s Demurrer to
Plaintiff’s 5th Cause of Action is OVERRULED. 
 
c.     
6th  Cause of Action—Fraudulent Concealment -
OVERRULED
 
“The required elements for
fraudulent concealment are: (1) concealment or suppression of a material fact;
(2) by a defendant with a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff; (3) the
defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff by intentionally concealing or
suppressing the fact; (4) the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not
have acted as he or she did if he or she had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact; and (5) plaintiff sustained damage as a result of the
concealment or suppression of the fact.”  (Graham v. Bank of America,
N.A. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 606.)
 
There are “four circumstances
in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when
the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the
defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff;
(3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff;
and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses
some material facts.”  (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th
326, 336.)
 
Plaintiff alleges:
 
(1)  
Defendant Moradi intentionally suppressed facts from
Plaintiff including but not limited to that Defendant’s standard of care was
not up to standards of the knowledge, skill, competence and/or care for licensed
skilled Orthodontic providers in the Los Angeles County. (FAC, ¶ 71);  
 
(2)  
Defendant had a duty to disclose these above-mentioned
suppressed facts since Defendant was Plaintiff’s physician (FAC, ¶ 73); 
            
            (2) that Defendant knew such misrepresentations were
false (FAC, ¶¶ 71–72); 
 
            (3) that Defendant intended to defraud Plaintiff or
induce reliance by concealing facts                                                              (FAC,
¶¶ 72, 75); 
 
            (4) that Plaintiff was unaware of the truth and
justifiable relied on Defendant’s             misrepresentations
(FAC, ¶ 74); and 
 
            (5) that Plaintiff sustained damages. (FAC, ¶¶ 77–78.)
 
Thus, Plaintiff has
successfully alleged all the elements of Fraudulent Concealment.  Defendant’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s 6th
Cause of Action is OVERRULED. 
 
 
d.    
7th Cause of Action—Intentional
Infliction Of Emotional Distress – OVERRULED 
The elements of a cause of
action for intentional infliction of emotional distress are (1) outrageous
conduct by the defendant, (2) intention to cause or reckless disregard of the
probability of causing emotional distress, (3) severe emotional suffering, and
(4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress. “Conduct is
extreme and outrageous when it exceeds all bounds of decency usually tolerated
by a decent society, and is of a nature which is especially calculated to
cause, and does cause, mental distress. Liability does not extend to mere
insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other
trivialities.” (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214
Cal.App.3d 590, 618.)
 
The California Supreme Court
has held that a defendant’s actions could be characterized as
"outrageous" for purposes of tort liability for intentional
infliction of emotional distress, if he “(1) abuses a relation or position
which gives him power to damage the plaintiff's interest; (2) knows the
plaintiff is susceptible to injuries through mental distress; or (3) acts
intentionally or unreasonably with the recognition that the acts are likely to
result in illness through mental distress.” (Agarwal v. Johnson (1979)
25 Cal.3d 932, 946 [overruled on other grounds].)
 
Whether a defendant's conduct
can reasonably be found to be outrageous is a question of law that must
initially be determined by the court. (See Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 534 [affirming order sustaining demurrer to IIED cause of
action without leave to amend based on failure to allege outrageous conduct].)
If reasonable persons may differ, it is for the jury to determine whether the
conduct was actually outrageous. (Id.)
 
Here, Plaintiff incorporates,
repeats, and realleges all allegations throughout the complaint. (FAC, ¶ 79.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendant’s behavior, alleged within the FAC, was outrageous
(FAC, 80.) The FAC includes alleged facts pleading fraudulent
misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment and dental malpractice that could
reasonably reach outrageous behavior, and thus is a question of fact for the
jury. The Plaintiff alleges Defendant intended to cause emotional distress or
acted with reckless disregard of the probability that Plaintiff would suffer emotional
distress by realleging other allegations in the complaint, namely Defendant’s fraudulent
concealment of facts intending to prolong treatment obligating Plaintiff to pay
additional money for Defendant’s services. (FAC, ¶¶ 81, 72.) Plaintiff alleges that
as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s conduct, Plaintiff suffered,
and continues to suffer, and will suffer in the future, severe emotional
distress. (FAC, ¶ 82–83.) 
 
Thus, Plaintiff has
successfully alleged all the elements of IIED. Defendant’s Demurrer to
Plaintiff’s 7th Cause of Action is OVERRULED. 
 
 
e.     
8th Cause of Action—Declaratory
Relief Re: Health And Safety Code §§ 123100, Et Seq.
 
“To allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for
declaratory relief, the plaintiff must allege two essential elements: (1) a
proper subject of declaratory relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving
justiciable questions relating to the rights or obligations of a party.” Childhelp,
Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 224, 235, as modified
(May 5, 2023), [internal citations omitted].)
 
Here, Plaintiff’s claim for Declaratory Relief under Health
and Safety Code §§ 123100, et seq is a proper subject of declaratory relief
because Plaintiff successfully alleges Defendant violated § 123100 by not
providing requested medical records within the statutory fifteen day period and
has yet to supply the records. Under Health and Safety Code § 123120, “[a]ny
patient or representative aggrieved by a violation of Section 123110 may, in
addition to any other remedy provided by law, bring an action against the
health care provider to enforce the obligations prescribed by Section 123110.”
(Health & Saf. Code § 123120, emphasis added.) Declaratory relief, along
with injunctive relief mentioned in the prayer for relief, are other remedies
provided by law and thus are in line with the statute. 
 
Plaintiff also alleges this statutory violation creates an
actual controversy because “(i) that Health and Safety Code § 123100, et seq.
requires that Defendant[] provide true and correct copy of Plaintiff's medical
records; (ii) Defendant did not, and continue[s] to not, comply with Health and
Safety Code § 123100, et seq.; and (iii) that such breach warrants the issuance
of the herein requested injunctive relief to enjoin the violation,” further a “[a]
judicial determination is necessary and appropriate at this time, so that the
parties may ascertain their respective rights and duties under Health and
Safety Code § 123100, et seq.” (FAC, ¶¶ 85, 86.)
 
Thus, Plaintiff has
successfully alleged all the elements for Declaratory Relief under Health and
Safety Code §§ 123100, et seq.  Defendant’s
Demurrer to Plaintiff’s 8th Cause of Action is OVERRULED. 
 
II.            
Motion to Strike - DENIED
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) The
court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for
moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial
notice. (Id. § 437.)
 
“Any judgment rendered in the action may, in the discretion
of the court, include an award of costs and reasonable attorney fees to the
prevailing party.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 123120.)
 
“A preliminary injunction is an interim remedy designed to
maintain the status quo pending a decision on the merits. It is not, in itself,
a cause of action. Thus, a cause of action must exist before injunctive
relief may be granted.” (MaJor v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618, 623.)
 
Defendant first moves to strike Plaintiff’s Prayer for attorney’s
fees and costs under the Violation of Health and Safety Code §§ 123100, et seq.
(MTS, p. 5; see FAC, Prayer ¶ 7, p 16.) However, Health and Safety Code §123120
provides for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party in a
cause of action brought under a violation of Health and Safety Code § 123100.
Plaintiff has successfully brought a cause of action under Health and Safety
Code § 123100, and thus if Plaintiff is successful in their claim they are
entitled to attorney’s fees and costs. Defendant’s Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s
Prayer ¶ 7 is DENIED.
 
Defendant next moves to Strike Plaintiff’s FAC Prayer ¶ 9, “[t]hat
an injunction shall be issued against Defendants, and each of them, which shall
require Defendants to provide true and correct copies of Plaintiff's patient
records and shall enjoin Defendants from violating Health and Safety Code §
123100, et seq.” (FAC Prayer ¶ 9, p. 16.) However, Plaintiff correctly points
out in the opposition, that they are permitted to plead and pray for injunctive
relief in the FAC, since they may at some point move for injunctive relief in
relation to whether they win declaratory relief. (See Raju v. Superior Court
(2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 1222, 1251, as modified on denial of reh'g (July 6,
2023).) Thus, Defendant’s Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Prayer ¶ 9 is
DENIED.
