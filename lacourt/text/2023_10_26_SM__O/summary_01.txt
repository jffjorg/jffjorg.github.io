And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Jovo B. Majstorovic, has moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff's complaint for declaratory relief. The plaintiff, MSS Properties Special Purpose II, LLC, argues that the defendant's notice of intent to extend the sublease was not properly given, and that the plaintiff has standing to bring the complaint. The court finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding the defendant's notice and that the plaintiff has provided evidence showing its standing to bring the complaint. Therefore, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.

The court also finds that the defendant has failed to establish as a matter of law that the plaintiff waived its right to renew the lease. The defendant argues that the plaintiff accepted rent for the full month of August 2022, but the court finds that the plaintiff provided evidence of a prorated check for the period of 8-9-22 to 8-31-22, and that the plaintiff has not accepted any rent from the defendant for any period after 8-8-22 to the present.
