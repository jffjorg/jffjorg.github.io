ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“The guardian or
conservator of the estate or guardian ad litem so appearing for any minor,
person who lacks legal capacity to make decisions, or person for whom a
conservator has been appointed shall have power, with the approval of the court
in which the action or proceeding is pending, to compromise the same, to agree
to the order or judgment to be entered therein for or against the ward or
conservatee, and to satisfy any judgment or order in favor of the ward or
conservatee or release or discharge any claim of the ward or conservatee
pursuant to that compromise. . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a)(3).)
 
“A petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue
under Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with rules 7.950 or 7.950.5,
7.951, and 7.952.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384(a).)
 
“A petition for court approval of a compromise of, or a
covenant not to sue or enforce judgment on, a minor's disputed claim; a
compromise or settlement of a pending action or proceeding to which a minor or
person with a disability is a party; or the disposition of the proceeds of a
judgment for a minor or person with a disability under Probate Code sections
3500 and 3600-3613 or Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must be verified by
the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all information that has
any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or
disposition. Except as provided in rule 7.950.5, the petition must be submitted
on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of
Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With a Disability (form
MC-350).” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)
 
“In all cases under Code of Civil Procedure section 372 or
Probate Code sections 3600-3601, unless the court has approved the fee
agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when
approving and allowing the amount of attorney's fees payable from money or
property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a
disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(a)(1).)
 
“The court must give consideration to the terms of any
representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative of
the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based on
the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made, except
where the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability contemplated that the attorney's fee would be affected by later
events.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).)
 
“A petition requesting court approval and allowance of an
attorney's fee under (a) must include a declaration from the attorney that
addresses the factors listed in (b) that are applicable to the matter before the
court.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(c).)
 
II.       Discussion
 
A.      Approval
of the Petitions
 
Allen White II petitions the Court for
approval of a compromise that includes: (1) Allen White III, who is a
four-year-old minor; and (2) Alivia White, who is a two-year-old minor. 
 
        Among other things, the
Gross Settlement Amount is $240,000.00, which consists of a $115,000.00 payment
to Allen White II, a $115,000.00 payment to Lynda Terry, a $5,000.00 payment to
Allen White III, and a $5,000.00 payment to Alivia White. (Petitions,
Attachment 11.) According to the Petitions, the differences in the amounts per
plaintiff is because the adults are also being compensated for other claims and
losses not suffered by the minors. (Petitions, Attachment 13a, ¶ 3.)
 
        According to paragraph 4 of
Attachment 13a, the percentage of attorney’s fees to be assessed from each of
the minor plaintiffs is 25% of their respective awards. According to Item 16 of
the Petitions, this the total amount of fees requested is $1,230.01, as well as
$79.97 in costs (for each of the minor plaintiffs). (Petitions, Item 16.)
 
        Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 372 and California Rules of Court, rules 7.950 and 7.955, the Court
finds that the Compromise is generally reasonable and that the applicable
procedures have been followed. 
 
        The Court will grant the petitions with
the following change: the attorneys are not to assess any attorney’s fees or
costs against the funds allotted to the minors. In other words, each of the
minors is to receive the full $5,000.00 awarded to each of them. 
 
        With the above change, the Court GRANTS
the Petitions. 
 
B.      Order
to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account
 
1.      Legal
Standard
 
“In any case in which the court orders that funds to be received by a
minor or a person with a disability must be deposited in a financial
institution and not disbursed without further order of the court, the order
must include a provision that a certified or filed endorsed copy of the order
must be delivered to a manager at the financial institution where the funds are
to be deposited, and that a receipt from the financial institution must be
promptly filed with the court, acknowledging receipt of both the funds
deposited and the order for deposit of funds.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.953, subd. (a).)
 
“If, in the order approving the compromise of a minor's claim, there is a
finding that the minor will attain the age of majority on a definite date, the
order for deposit may require that the depository permit the withdrawal of
funds by the former minor after that date, without further order of the court.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.953, subd. (a).)
 
2.      Discussion
 
For each of the minor children, Plaintiff/Guardian ad Litem filed
Judicial Council Form MC-355, Order to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account. Each
of the forms submitted lists the minor’s birthday, requests that no withdrawal
of interest or principal be allowed without court order prior to the minor’s
18th birthday, and requests that such withdrawals can be made by the minor
without court order once they reach 18 years of age.
 
The Court PERMITS the funds to be placed in blocked
accounts that will not allow withdrawals of principal or interest without prior
court order until the date at which each minor becomes eighteen years old, at
which point that minor may withdraw the principal and interest without a court
order. 
 
        The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff/Guardian ad Litem to deliver to the manager at the
financial institution where the funds are to be deposited a certified or filed
copy of this Order. 
 
        The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff/Guardian ad Litem to promptly file with the Court a
receipt from the financial institution, acknowledging receipt of both the funds
deposited and the order for deposit of funds.
