In support of each of these discovery motions,  Plaintiff concurrently filed a Separate Statement and a Declaration of Louis F.  Teran.            On  February 23, 2024, Defendant filed an Opposition to each of the discovery  motions. Each of the oppositions includes a Request for Sanctions.            On  March 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Reply in support of all the discovery  motions.    ANALYSIS:   I.           Legal  Standard   A.           Legal  Standard for Further Responses to Interrogatories and/or Requests for Production  of Documents   On receipt of a  response to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and/or demand  requests, the propounding and/or demanding party “may move for an order  compelling further response” if: (1) the response is evasive or incomplete; (2)  the representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or  evasive; or (3) the objection is without merit or too general. (Code Civ.  Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a), 2031.310, subd. (a).)   The court shall  impose monetary sanctions against any party, person, or attorney who  unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further interrogatories  and/or a motion to compel further production of documents, unless the Court  finds that the one subject to sanction acted with substantial justification or  that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ.  Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h).)   B.           Legal  Standard for Further Responses to Requests for Admission   ¿“On  receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the party requesting  admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party  deems that either or both of the following apply: (1)¿An answer to a particular  request is evasive or incomplete[;] (2)¿An objection to a particular  request is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd.  (a).)   “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,  person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel  further response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).)   II.       Discussion   A.      The Parties’ Arguments   Plaintiff moves the Court to compel further responses to certain special  interrogatories (“SROGs”), requests for production of documents (“RPDs”), and  requests for admission (“RFAs”). (Further SROGs Motion, p. 8:27–28; Further  RPDs Motion, p. 8:6–8; Further RFAs Motion, p. 7:8–10.)           Defendant opposes the motions, arguing:  (1) that the motions should be denied because they are untimely; (2) that the  motions should be denied because Plaintiff did not meet and confer; (3) that  the motions should be denied because Defendant has already produced  supplemental responses, making these motions moot; and (4) that even if the  Court were to consider the merits of the motions, they should still be denied.  (Opposition to Further SROGs Motion, pp. 4:8, 6:1–2, 7:12–13, 9:18–19;  Opposition to Further RPDs Motion, pp. 4:1, 5:16–17, 7:5–6, 9:11–12; Opposition  to Further RFAs Motion, pp. 4:8, 6:1–2, 7:12–13, 9:18–19.)           In its Reply, Plaintiff argues: (1) that  the motions are proper and timely; (2) that supplemental responses have not  been served to the discovery at hand; (3) that Defendant’s discovery objections  are improper and evasive; and (4) that Plaintiff “only seeks and is entitled to  the truth.” (Reply, pp. 2:1, 3:6, 4:2–3, 6:2.)   B.      Timeliness of the Discovery Motions   1.      Legal Standard   Parties who propound discovery requests may move for an order compelling  further responses to SROGs, RPDs, and RFAs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  sections 2030.300, subdivision (a), 2031.310,  subdivision (a), and 2033.290, subdivision (a), respectively.            Unless notice of these motions are given  within 45 days of the service of the verified responses, or any supplemental  verified responses, or any specific later date to which the requesting party  and the responding party have agreed in writing, the requesting party waives  any right to compel further responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd.  (c); 2031.310, subd. (c); 2033.290, subd. (c).)   2.      Discussion           The following is the timeline of  relevant events:   (1)        On May  24, 2021, Plaintiff served Defendant with the SROGs, RPDs, and RFAs at issue  (Decls. Teran, ¶ 2);   (2)        On July  15, 2021, Defendant served initial responses to the SROGs, RPDs, and RFAs at  issue (Decls. Teran, ¶ 3);   (3)        On July  30, 2021, Plaintiff filed three motions to compel further responses to these  SROGs, RPDs, and RFAs;   (4)        On  August 31, 2021, Defendant filed its Motion for Summary Judgment;   (5)        On  September 2, 2021, Defendant served verified supplemental responses to the  SROGs, RPDs, and RFAs (Decl. Newman re: Opposition to Further SROGs Motion, ¶ 4  and Exh. A; Decl. Newman re: Opposition to Further RPDs Motion, ¶ 3 and Exh. A;  Decl. Newman re: Opposition to Further RFAs Motion, ¶ 4 and Exh. A);   (6)        On  September 7, 2021, the Court took off calendar five discovery motions (including  the three motions to compel further responses to these SROGs, RPDs, and RFAs)  and ordered the Parties to attend an informal discovery conference (Minute  Order dated September 7, 2021, p. 3);   (7)        On  October 22, 2021, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  (Minute Order dated October 22, 2021, p. 16);   (8)        On  December 21, 2023, the Court of Appeal reversed and remanded this matter; and   (9)        On  February 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the three current discovery motions.    The original three motions to compel further discovery responses were  based on Defendant’s July 15, 2021 responses. However, Defendant served  verified supplemental responses on September 2, 2021. From September 2, 2021  (the date of the latest supplemental production) to October 22, 2021 (the date  the Court granted summary judgment) was fifty days. That was longer than the  forty-five days allowed by the relevant sections of the Code of Civil  Procedure. Thus, these motions to compel further discovery are untimely because  Plaintiff waived its right to compel further responses.            The Court DENIES the Further SROGs  Motion.           The Court DENIES the Further RPDs  Motion.           The Court DENIES the Further RFAs  Motion.   C.      The Remaining Arguments   The Court need not and does not reach the remaining arguments made by the  Parties.    D.      Sanctions   Defendant requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,032.75 per  motion against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s Counsel. (Opposition to Further SROGs  Motion, p. 13:18–19; Opposition to Further RPDs Motion, p. 16:15–16; Opposition  to Further RFAs Motion, pp. 12:28–13:1.)   Plaintiff does not address the issue of monetary sanctions in its Reply.   Defense Counsel declares: (1) that they charge $335.00 per hour in this  matter; (2) that they worked twelve hours for each of these motions; and (3)  that they incurred $12.75 in filing costs for each opposition. (Decls. Newman,  ¶ 6.)           The hourly rate and costs claimed are  reasonable, but the number of hours claimed is not. The three oppositions are  nearly identical to each other, and even twelve hours for one of these motions  is unreasonable.  Too put it more  bluntly, the Court simply does not believe that defense counsel’s declarations under  penalty of perjury that he spent 36 hours and incurred $12,098.25 in attorney's  fees and costs on these three oppositions.      “If . .  . the Court were required to award a reasonable fee when an outrageously  unreasonable one has been asked for, claimants would be encouraged to make  unreasonable demands, knowing that the only unfavorable consequence of such  misconduct would be reduction of their fee to what they should have asked in  the first place. To discourage such greed, a severer reaction is needful.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d  621, 635 [cleaned up].) “A fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a  special circumstance  permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.” (Chavez  v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 990; Ketchum v. Moses (2001)  24 Cal.4th 1122, 1137; Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.)            The court declines to award  sanctions.       III.     Conclusion   Plaintiff’s Further SROGs Motion is DENIED.    Plaintiff’s Further RPDs Motion is DENIED.            Plaintiff’s Further RFAs Motion is  DENIED.            Defendant’s Request for Sanctions is DENIED.
