Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the petitions for approval of the compromise of claims or actions for the benefit of minors. The compromise includes payments to the minors and adults, and the court has approved the compromise with the condition that no attorney's fees or costs will be subtracted from the amounts awarded to the minors. The court has also ordered that the funds be placed in blocked accounts that will not allow withdrawals of principal or interest without prior court order until the minors reach the age of 18, at which point they may withdraw the principal and interest without court order. The court has also ordered the guardian ad litem to deliver a certified or filed copy of the order to the financial institution where the funds will be deposited and to file a receipt with the court acknowledging receipt of the funds and the order.
