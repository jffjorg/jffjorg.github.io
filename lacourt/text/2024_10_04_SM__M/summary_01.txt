And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the motion to relate case 21SMSC00753 with cases 21SMCV01059, 21STCV40908, and 21SMUD00002, and to deem the judgments in cases 21SMSC00753 and 21SMUD00002 satisfied. The judge found that the cases are not related, as they do not arise from the same or similar claims, and that the plaintiff failed to file a notice of related case in 21SMSC00753. The judge also noted that if the plaintiff believes that the judgment in 21SMSC00753 is satisfied, they may make a filing in the appropriate action.
