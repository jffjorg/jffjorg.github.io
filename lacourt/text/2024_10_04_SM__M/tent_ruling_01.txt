Legal
Standard
 
California Rules of Court (CRC), rule
3.300 sets forth the rules relevant to relating cases. It states that a “pending
civil case is related to another pending civil case, or to a civil case that
was dismissed with or without prejudice, or to a civil case that was disposed
of by judgment, if the cases: 
(1)  Involve the same parties
and are based on the same or similar claims; 
(2)  Arise from the same or
substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact; 
(3)  Involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property; or 
(4)  Are likely for other
reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by
different judges.”
 
When a case is relatable, the
parties are obliged to file a notice of related case containing the following
information: “(1)  List all civil cases that are related by court, case
name, case number, and filing date; (2) Identify the case that has the earliest
filing date and the court and department in which that case is pending; and (3)
 Describe the manner in which the cases are related.” (CRC Rule 3.300(c).)
The Notice must be filed in all pending cases listed in the notice and must be
served on all parties in those cases. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff Jessica Jacobs moves to
relate case 21SMSC00753 with cases 21SMCV01059, 21STCV40908, and 21SMUD00002,
and to deem the judgments in cases 21SMSC00753 and 21SMUD00002 satisfied. Plaintiff
does not explain why case 21SMSC00753 and the instant action are related. 21SMSC00753
is a small claims action between Plaintiff Jessica Jacobs against Defendant
Steven Ray Ritchie. Plaintiff claimed $10,000.00 in damages from damage to a
waterline, landscaping, building materials, trees, theft of building materials,
locks, chains, and gates. Jacobs was awarded a principal amount of $2,200.00
and costs of $75.00 for a total of $2,275.00 in small claims. Here, Plaintiff
claims ownership of real property and damages from nuisance and defamation
against Defendant. While the actions are between the same parties, they do not
arise from the “same or similar” claims, since the instant claims do not regard
the same damages or occurrences as the small claims case. Moreover, if
Plaintiff believes that this judgment is satisfied, then Plaintiff may make a
filing in the appropriate action.
 
The Court also notes that Plaintiff
neglected to file a notice of related case in 21SMSC00753.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
