And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial and related dates from November 4, 2024, to March 3, 2025. The defendant had argued that good cause existed for the continuance due to the parties' excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts. However, the judge found that this discovery issue could have been resolved prior to trial if the parties had exercised due diligence. The judge also noted that the outstanding discovery is of secondary importance and that the disputed RPDs seek recordings of an IME, which is not essential to the material issues in the action.

Additionally, the defendant had cited the unavailability of their preferred trial counsel due to prepaid vacations, but the judge found that counsel agreed to the trial dates and knew they were firm. The judge also denied the defendant's request to settle the action short of trial, noting that the parties had already attended mediation but were unable to settle the case.

Although the judge noted a few factors that weighed towards a continuance, including the modest four-month continuance and the parties' extensive discovery, the judge ultimately denied the motion because the defendant did not show good cause for the continuance.
