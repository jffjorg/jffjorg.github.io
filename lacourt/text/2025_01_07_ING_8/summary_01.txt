And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash subpoenas issued by the defendant, Centinela Valley Union High School District, to H. Claude Hudson Comprehensive Health Center. The subpoenas seek medical and billing records from 1980 to the present related to Jane Doe T.B.'s care and treatment. The Court has tentatively granted the motion in part, excluding the production of Mr. Is, X-Rays, and CT scans from the last four decades, but has denied the motion as to billing and treatment records. The Court has also noted that the parties have a confidentiality agreement in place to limit the dissemination of sensitive information.
