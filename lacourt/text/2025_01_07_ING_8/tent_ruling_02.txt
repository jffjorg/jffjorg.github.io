BACKGROUNDA. FactualOn March 6, 2024, Plaintiff, Olga Odell (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., and DOES 1 through 10. On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). On September 11, 2024, the Court sustained American Honda Motor, Co., Inc.’s (“AHM”) demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend.On October 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging causes of action (1) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code section 1793.2(a)(3); and (4) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Civil Code §§ 1791.1, 1794, 1795.5).Now, Defendant, AHM files a demurrer to the SAC.B. ProceduralOn November 13, 2024, AHM filed its demurrer and motion to strike portions of Plaintiff’s SAC. On December 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed opposition briefs. On December 30, 2024, AHM filed reply briefs.II. ANALYSISA. Demurreri. Legal StandardA demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿¿A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to respond to.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) However, “[a] demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)ii. DiscussionAHM again demurs to Plaintiff’s SAC on the grounds that it argues Plaintiff’s first, second, third, and fourth causes of action fail to state sufficient grounds to constitute a viable claim against AHM. AHM also demurs to the first, second, and third causes of action on the grounds it argues they are barred by the applicable statute of limitations.1. Meet and Confer RequirementThe declaration of Leanna L. H. Vault, Esq., (“Vault Decl.”) is offered in support of counsel’s compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. Vault declares that on November 6, 2024, she sent counsel for Plaintiff a substantive meet and confer letter outlining the grounds in which AHM intended to file a demurrer and requesting counsel for Plaintiff provide availability to telephonically meet and confer. (Vault Decl., ¶ 2.) On , November 7, 2024, Vault notes that she met and conferred telephonically with counsel for Plaintiff, Olivia Avelino, regarding the demurrer and motion to strike, but that the parties were unable to come to an agreement regarding the grounds in which AHM brought the demurrer and motion to strike. (Vault Decl., ¶ 3.) Thus, this Court finds that the meet and confer requirements have been met.2. Breach of Express Warranty – First, Second, and Third Causes of Action.Statute of LimitationsAs with AHM’s demurrer to the FAC, AHM argues that each of Plaintiff’s Express Warranty, Song-Beverly claims alleged in her SAC are time barred. In this Court’s September 11, 2024 ruling on AHM’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC, this Court found that Plaintiff failed to allege (as required by Fox and McKelvey), the specific facts to show the time and manner of discovery and the inability to have earlier discovered the elements of her cause of action. The FAC did not state the date or mileage on the odometer when Plaintiff alleges she first discovered that her CRV manifested a warranty-covered defect, but the inference from the FAC is that such discovery occurred in 2019 with over 60,000 miles on the odometer. This Court expressed that the warranty alleged in the FAC was alleged to be a limited, not full warranty, which means under the Magnuson-Moss Act the warrantor is entitled to limit the duration of coverage to less than the product’s lifetime. More specifically, the FAC alleged that Plaintiff’s original and first repair did not take place until 63,810 miles (over the 60,000 miles the warranty accounted for), and thus, the Court concluded the express warranty period may have already elapsed. The Court clarified that if this was the case, Plaintiff did not allege any facts that claim the repairs took place prior to the vehicle being driven 60,000 miles, or that tolling might have taken place prior to the July 16, 2019 date and prior to driving over 60,000 miles on the subject vehicle. Thus, the Court sustained the previous demurrer, allowing leave to amend, finding that the first, second, and third causes of action, as alleged in the FAC, were all time barred.In Plaintiff’s SAC, she now alleges that powertrain issues were presented to Defendant’s authorized repair facility on November 13, 2015 with approximately 10,859 miles on the odometer; on November 28, 2017 with approximately 34,206 miles on the odometer; on August 10, 2018 with approximately 47,870 miles on the odometer; on July 16, 2019 with approximately 63,810 miles on the odometer; and on January 29, 2021 with approximately 82,997 miles on the odometer. (SAC, ¶¶ 22-26.) Plaintiff alleges that she only discovered Defendant’s wrongful conduct on January 29, 2021, when Defendant’s authorized repair facility finally acknowledged and diagnosed the ongoing engine and transmission issues for which Plaintiff had presented the vehicle during the express warranty period. (SAC, ¶ 29.) The milage on the Subject Vehicle on January 29, 2021 was 82,997 miles. (SAC, ¶ 26.)Under the Siong-Beverly Act, the end of the warranty period, e.g., five years or 60,000 miles for the powertrain, is extended by operation of law if several parameters are met. (Civ.Code § 1795.6(b); CACI 3231.) First, a defect must exist within the warranty period. Second, the buyer or lessee must have returned the consumer good or vehicle for repairs. Third, the buyer or lessee must have notified the service and repair facility or manufacturer that the prior repair was not successful. If all these parameters are met, the warranty period continues indefinitely, until the defect is fixed. “There is no support in the law for instructing the jury that if a defect exists within the warranty period, the warranty continues in perpetuity until the defect has been diagnosed and fixed.” (Nunez v. FCA US LLC (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 385.) Moreover, the claimed existence of a latent defects that lead to a malfunction after the term of the warranty does not toll or extend the warranty period. (Daugherty v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 824, 832.) The FAC contains no allegations as to Section 1795.6’s tolling parameters, especially notification that the latest in-warranty repair was no successfulThe Court is not persuaded by Plaintiff’s additional facts on class action tolling for the same reasons addressed in AHM’s moving papers. As such, the Court is inclined to SUSTAIN demurrer without leave to amend, unless Plaintiff can truthfully add the requisite allegations as to the requirements for statutory tolling of an express warranty period.3. Breach of the Implied Warranty of MerchantabilityAs to the fourth cause of action, AHM again demurs on the grounds that the pleading is insufficient. As this Court noted at the previous hearing on the original demurrer, the duration of the implied warranty of merchantability and where present the implied warranty of fitness shall be coextensive in duration with an express warranty which accompanies the consumer goods, provided the duration of the express warranty is reasonable; but in no event shall an implied warranty have a duration of less than 60 days nor more than one year following the sale of new consumer goods to a retail buyer. Where no duration for an express warranty is stated with respect to consumer goods, or parts thereof, the duration of the implied warranty shall be the maximum period prescribed above.” (Civ. Code § 1791.1, subd. (c).) This Court held, on September 11, 2024, that Plaintiff would have been required to bring her implied warranty claim on or before November 9, 2015 (one year after purchase), or within two years after discovery of the breach. As previously mentioned, the Court did not believe that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that a breach occurred as the warranty period was over when Plaintiff first took the subject vehicle to be repaired.Here, the last date in Plaintiff’s repair doctrine now states January 29, 2021. (SAC, ¶¶ 29.) Thus, even if the Court based its decision on the two years after discovery of the breach prong, Plaintiff would still fall outside the statute of limitations. Plaintiff’s opposition brief does not provide any analysis as to this issue, but instead, only states the controlling authority. Based on the Court’s analysis, the Court SUSTAINS without leave to amend, the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action.III. CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, AHM’s demurrer is SUSTAINED. Because of this, the Motion to Strike is MOOTED. The Court’s tentative ruling is to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend. However, the Court will allow oral argument as to a possible further amendment consistent with the law cited in this tentative ruling.AHM is ordered to provide notice.
