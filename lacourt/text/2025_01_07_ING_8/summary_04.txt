And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the plaintiffs, who are the parents of five minor children, to approve compromises of their claims against Allstate Insurance Company Uninsured Motorist Benefits. The compromises were reached in a pending action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence, and the plaintiffs have requested court approval to settle the claims without a trial.

The judge notes that court approval is required for all settlements of a minor's claim, and that the plaintiffs have met the legal requirements for approval. The judge finds that the compromises are reasonable and in the best interests of the minor plaintiffs, and grants all three of the plaintiffs' petitions for minor's compromise.

The compromises provide for each of the minor plaintiffs to receive $6,000 from the defendant, with the total amount offered by all defendants being $24,000. The law firm representing the plaintiffs has also been paid $1,646.15 in fees and expenses. The judge orders that the balance of the proceeds of each minor plaintiff's settlement be deposited in an insured account at Wells Fargo.

The judge notes that the plaintiffs have incurred funeral and burial expenses, lost contributions to the family and gifts from the decedent, and lost the love, companionship, and other benefits of having the decedent in their lives. The judge finds that the compromises are fair and reasonable, and approves them.
