BACKGROUND
Plaintiff
Charlotte Woods and Defendant Shant Apet-Tashjir were involved in a vehicle
collision on January 5, 2019.
On June 30, 2021,
Plaintiff filed the Complaint alleging a single cause of action for negligence.
On January 25,
2023, Defendant filed the Answer.
On January 18,
2024, Defendant served Plaintiff notice for a deposition of Plaintiff to occur
on February 1, 2024. (Blunt Decl. ¶ 2.) 
On January 31,
2024, Defendant’s counsel contacted Plaintiff’s counsel to confirm the scheduled
deposition was moving forward. (Blunt Decl. ¶4.) Plaintiff's counsel informed
Defendant’s counsel that she had another deposition on calendar and requested
to reschedule Plaintiff’s deposition. (Blunt Decl. ¶ 2.) Defendant's counsel requested
Plaintiff's counsel reimburse Defendant for the cost of the court reporter and
attempted to schedule another deposition in the next 25 days. (Blunt Decl. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff failed to respond to the
request. (Blunt Decl. ¶ 4.) Plaintiff failed
to appear for the deposition on February 1, 2024. (Blunt Decl. ¶ 4.)
On February 27,
2024, Defendant filed a Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff.
On April 23, 2024,
Plaintiff’s Counsel agreed to a deposition of Plaintiff, which was scheduled
for June 7, 2024. (Blunt Decl. ¶ 8.)
On June 6, Plaintiff’s Counsel informed Defendant that Plaintiff would not
appear at the Deposition. (Blunt Decl. ¶ 10.)
On June 12, 2024, the
Court denied Defendant’s first Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff.
Between June 14
and July 10, 2024, Defendant’s counsel attempted to meet and confer with
Plaintiff’s counsel three times but received no response. (Blunt Decl., ¶13.)
On August 9, 2024,
Defendant filed concurrent motions to deem request for admissions admitted,
sanctions, and compel attendance at deposition.
On September 9,
2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted.
 
DISCUSSION 
 
RFA
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any
other party to the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the
truth of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of
law to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in
controversy between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.) “Within 30
days after service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests
are directed shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting
party, and a copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).)
If a party to whom request for admissions
are served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the request
was directed waives any objections, including those based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted and for monetary
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The court shall issue this
order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a response in
substantial compliance before the hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)
Defendant served the Requests for Admission,
Set one, on Plaintiff on June 14, 2024. (Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions Admitted “MTD” p. 3.)
Plaintiff failed to respond to Requests for Admission, Set One within thirty
days, and therefore, Defendant has moved to have the contents of Requests for
Admission, Set One “deemed admitted and conclusively established for all
purposes in this action.” (MTD p. 3.)
Plaintiff states that she responded to Requests
for Admission, Set One, on September 6, 2024. (Opposition p. 1.) Plaintiff
argues that her response was in substantial compliance with California Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.220, and therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is moot. (St.
Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 775-776.)
Defendant has filed no reply.
Here, Plaintiff served
her response to all of Defendant’s requests for admissions before the hearing
and in substantial compliance with the California Code of Civil Procedure §
2033.280, subdivision (c). (Panah
Decl. p. 1-2; Exhibit 1 p. 2-7.) Thus, Defendant’s motion is moot. (St.
Mary, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th 762
at pp. 7755-776.) 
          Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion
to Deem Request for Admissions Admitted.
 
Sanctions
 
Sanctions are mandatory against the party,
the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely response to the request
necessitated the motion to deem request for admissions as admitted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule. 3.1348(a)
[the court can award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party
seeking to compel discovery even though no opposition was filed, the opposition
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed].) 
Here, Defendant
requests $1,160 in sanctions for costs incurred following Plaintiff’s failure
to file a timely response to Defendant’s Request for Admissions. (Blunt Decl.
p. 1.) In calculating this number, Defendants’ counsel states that they spent 2
hours preparing the instant motion, 1 hour preparing the Reply, and 1.5 hours
attending the hearing. (Blunt Decl. p. 1.) However, as Defendant has yet to
file a Reply, the one hour spent preparing the Reply is struck from the
calculation. Thus, Defendant spent 3.5 hours at $210 an hour, plus a $60 filing
fee, totaling $795 in sanctions. (Blunt Decl. p. 1.) Plaintiff raised no
arguments against the imposition of sanctions.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel is granted in the
amount of $795. Sanctions are payable within 30 days of
service of this order.
 
Compel Deposition
 
“Any party may obtain discovery … by taking
in California the oral deposition of any person, including any party to the
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) The California Code of Civil Procedure sections
2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the requirements for (among other things)
what must be included in a deposition notice, when and where depositions may be
taken, and how and when the notice must be served.
“The service of a deposition notice … is
effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party to attend and to testify, as well
as to produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing for inspection and copying.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)
 
The California Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
The California Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
 
If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.
 
No “meet and confer” is required where the
deponent “fails to attend the deposition….” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (b)(2).) Only a “declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance” is needed. (Ibid.) The
moving party must show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the issue
relating to the nonappearance with this inquiry. (See Blago Leko v.
Cornerstone Home Inspection (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1124.)
Defendant argues that there is good cause to
compel the deposition of Plaintiff because Defendant would be prejudiced if
unable to depose Plaintiff. (Motion to Compel “MTC” p. 4.) Furthermore,
Defendant argues that the deposition is necessary to prepare for trial
effectively and that any more meet and confers would be a waste of time based
on previous failed attempts. (MTS p. 4.)
Plaintiff has filed no opposition to this
motion.
          Here, Defendant has
submitted evidence that Plaintiff was served with a Notice of Taking Deposition
and that Plaintiff attempted to reschedule the deposition twice without cause.
(Blunt Decl. ¶ 7-8, Exhibit A-B.) Since
the cancellation of the second attempted deposition Defendant has attempted to
meet and confer with Plaintiff three times, but Plaintiff has failed to
respond. (Blunt Decl. ¶13, Exhibit E.) Therefore, Defendant has shown good cause for an order to compel and
has met all the procedural requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450,
subdivision (b).
The Court GRANTS the motion to compel
deposition.
 
Sanctions
The California Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a), provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) In addition, a court shall impose monetary
sanctions if a motion to compel a deposition is granted unless “the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code. Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
          Here, Defendant is
requesting sanctions in the amount of $2,070.00 for costs and attorney’s fees
associated with bringing this motion. (MTC p. 5; Blunt Decl. ¶ 16.) In
calculating this number, Defendant’s counsel states that they spent 2 hours
preparing the instant motion, .5 hours reviewing the opposition, 1 hour
drafting the reply, and 1.5 hours attending the hearing, totaling 5 hours
billed at $210, plus the $60 filing fee and the $960 court reporter fees
resulting from the canceled depositions. However, as no opposition was filed,
the 1.5 hours spent reviewing the opposition can be struck, resulting in
sanctions of $1440. (3 hours X $210 + $60 filing fee + $960 court reporter
fee.)
          Plaintiff
has filed no opposition showing why Plaintiff acted with substantial
justification or why sanctions should not be imposed.
Therefore,
Defendant’s Motion for Sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $1440. Sanctions are payable within 30 days of service of this order.
