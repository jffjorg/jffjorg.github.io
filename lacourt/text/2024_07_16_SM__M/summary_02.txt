Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition, as well as the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,486.80 against the plaintiff and her counsel. The plaintiff failed to appear at her properly noticed deposition, despite being served with a deposition notice and request for production of documents. The plaintiff's counsel's objections to the deposition were untimely and lacked merit. The court finds no substantial justification for the plaintiff's failure to appear and therefore imposes the mandatory monetary sanctions.
