MOTION:                     Demurrer to the
Complaint  
HEARING DATE:   7/16/2024
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendants SM 10000 Property LLC demurs to the third cause of
action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. “[E]very lease includes a covenant of
quiet possession and enjoyment.” (Erlach v. Sierra Asset Servicing, LLC
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1281.) The
covenant of quiet enjoyment is inherent in the tenant's “exclusive right to
possession” granted by the rental agreement. (Nativi v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l
Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 291-292.) “Minor inconveniences and annoyances are
not actionable breaches of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.” (Andrews
v. Mobile Aire Estates (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 578, 589.) “To be actionable,
the [landlord’s] act or omission must substantially interfere with a [tenant’s]
right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the
tenancy.” (Id.) The
interference must be so serious as to render the premises unfit for the
purposes contemplated by the lease or which substantially affect the tenant's
enjoyment of a material part of the premises. (Andrews v. Mobile Aire
Estates (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 578, 589-590.) 
 
Plaintiff Ontiveros alleges she is a resident at an
apartment complex located at 10000 Santa Monica Boulevard, Management Office,
Los Angeles, CA 90067, owned/managed by Defendants. (Compl., ¶¶ 1-2, 8.) On
June 28, 2022, Plaintiff entered an elevator at the Subject Building with her
two dogs on a leash. (¶ 9.) The elevator door started to close while one of her
dogs was still outside the elevator. (¶ 10.) Plaintiff attempted to stop the
elevator door from closing, but the sensor malfunctioned, and the door closed.
(¶¶10-11.) As the elevator ascended, it harshly pulled on the leash, causing
injury to the middle finger of Plaintiff’s right hand. (¶ 12.) Plaintiff also
feared for the safety of her dog on the outside of the elevator. (Id.) Fortunately,
a bystander observed the incident and disconnected the dog from the leash
before any serious injury to the dog. (Id.) Plaintiff’s injured finger was
immobilized for several months and is left with a scar and limited mobility. (¶
13.) 
 
As to the subject quiet enjoyment claim, the complaint only provides
the legal conclusion that the “elevator malfunction alleged
constituted a violation of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment[.]” (Compl.,
¶ 25, citing Civ. Code § 1955.) There are no facts showing how a single
instance of an elevator sensor malfunction could “substantially interfere” with
Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of
her lease. Plaintiff presents no authority that a Defendant’s
maintenance of a malfunctioning, common area elevator sensor could be
considered a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Plaintiff instead cites inapposite cases
discussing the general duties of landlords’ concerning “common areas under its
control” without any reference to the covenant of quiet enjoyment. (See Ann
M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Center (1993) 6 Cal.4th 666, 675
[discussing premises liability under a negligence theory; disapproved of on
other grounds by Reid v. Google (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512].) In the absence of such authority, the
Court is not inclined to grant leave to amend.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
