v. Boutboul
CASE NO.:                23SMCV01992
MOTION:                  Motion
to Tax/Strike Costs
HEARING DATE:   7/16/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b);
Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606.) “Prevailing party”
includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. (CCP § 1032 (a)(4).) 
 
“Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.” (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).) “If the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State
Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774.) On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.) 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiffs Rudy and Carole Gabsi move to tax costs claimed
by Defendant Yoni Boutboul.  The
memorandum of costs claims $ 1,050.70 in costs. Plaintiff objects to a
portion of item no. 1 (filing and motion fees) and the entirety of item no. 16
(other costs).
 
As
to item no. 1, Plaintiffs note that Defendant claims the initial filing fee of
$435.00 twice. The memo breaks down the costs as follows: a) $508.61 for first
paper fee and demurrer hearing reservation fees; b) $461.17 for a motion to
strike; and c) $13.12 for a “Demurrer.” The Court finds Defendant’s claim for these
costs are internally inconsistent. Indeed, Defendant twice claims the initial
filing fees as costs. Defendant provides a declaration from counsel, claiming
that he was charged twice for both his “Demurrer with Motion to Strike” and for
his “Motion to Strike (not initial pleading).” Defendant only supplies one reservation
receipt for $508.61 which accurately reflects the memorandum. (Greene Decl., Ex
A.) The court’s records reflect that only one hearing for the Demurrer with
Motion to Strike was scheduled and removed, which bears this reservation
number. This amount includes the $13.12 for credit card fees separately claimed
in the memo. (Id.) The supplied other receipt shows costs of $437.25, which
does not reflect any of the amounts identified in the memorandum. (Id., Ex. B.)
Thus, the Court is persuaded that only the claim of $508.61 is accurate. 
 
As
to item no. 16, Defendant claims costs for downloading a document from the LASC
online docket. Such costs are not expressly allowed. (CCP § 1033.5(a).)
Further, the Court does not find downloading a document from the LASC website
to be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than
merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation. (CCP §1033.5(c).) Therefore,
the entirety of item 16 will be stricken.
 
Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED. Item 16 is stricken. Item 1 is reduced to $508.61.
