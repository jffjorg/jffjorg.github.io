And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Ontiveros v. SM 10000 Property LLC, et al. (Case No. 23SMCV05863). The Defendant has demurred to the Plaintiff's complaint, alleging that the Plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment. The Plaintiff alleges that an elevator malfunction at the apartment complex where she resides caused her to suffer an injury to her right hand and fear for her dog's safety. The Judge has found that the Plaintiff's complaint does not provide sufficient facts to support a claim for breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, as the elevator malfunction was a single incident and did not substantially interfere with the Plaintiff's use and enjoyment of her lease. The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff cannot revise the complaint to address the alleged defects. The Plaintiff must file an answer to the demurrer within 10 days.
