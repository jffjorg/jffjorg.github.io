And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion by plaintiffs Rudy and Carole Gabsi to tax costs claimed by defendant Yoni Boutboul. The defendant has claimed $1,050.70 in costs, but the plaintiffs object to a portion of item no. 1 (filing and motion fees) and the entirety of item no. 16 (other costs). The court finds that the defendant's claim for costs is internally inconsistent and that the defendant has been charged twice for the initial filing fees. The court also finds that the cost for downloading a document from the LASC online docket is not allowed and is not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. As a result, the court will strike item no. 16 and reduce item no. 1 to $508.61.
