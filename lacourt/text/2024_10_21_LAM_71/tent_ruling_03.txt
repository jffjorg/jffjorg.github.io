Plaintiff
Husam Asi (“Asi”) (“Plaintiff”) moves, in pro per, to disqualify Latham
& Watkins LLP (“Latham”), including Robert Ellison (“Ellison”) from
representing Defendant Hollywood Foreign Press Association (“HFPA”)
(“Defendant”) in this action.  (Notice
Disqualify, pg. 2; RPC, Rule 1.9.) 
Plaintiff moves on the basis that Latham’s prior representation of
Plaintiff in matters substantially related to this action creates an
impermissible conflict of interest under California Rules of Professional
Conduct, Rule 1.9, and Latham’s continued representation of Defendant also
violates the advocate-witness rule, and the possession and use of Plaintiff’s
privileged emails further demonstrate the need for disqualification.  (Notice Disqualify, pg. 2.)
Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses from Defendant in response to his Request for
Production (Set One) (“RFP 1”).  (Notice
MTCF RFP1, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2031.310, 2023.010, 2023.030.)  Plaintiff further moves for monetary
sanctions in the amount of $4,000.00. 
(Notice MTCF RFP1, pg. 2.)
Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses from Defendant in response to his Request for
Production (Set Two) (“RFP 2”).  (Notice
MTCF RFP2, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2031.300(a), 2031.310.)  Plaintiff further moves for monetary
sanctions in the amount of $3,000.00. 
(Notice MTCF RFP2, pg. 2; C.C.P. §2023.010.)
Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses from Defendant in response to his Request for
Production (Set Three) (“RFP 3”). 
(Notice MTCF RFP3, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2031.300(a), 2031.310.)  Plaintiff further moves for monetary
sanctions in the amount of $3,000.00. 
(Notice MTCF RFP3, pg. 2; C.C.P. §2023.010.)
Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses from Defendant in response to his Form
Interrogatories (Set One) (“FROG 1”). 
(Notice MTCF FROG1, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2030.300, 2030.220.)  Plaintiff further moves for monetary
sanctions in the amount of $3,000.00. 
(Notice MTCF FROG1, pg. 2; C.C.P. §2023.010.)
Defendant
moves to bar Plaintiff from directly contacting or communicating with Defendant
or any of its Board Members, including Gabriel Lerman.  (Notice Motion Quash; Notice Motion Amended Quash;
C.C.P. §§128(a), 2019.020, 2025.410, 2025.420; RPC, Rule 4.2; Rappleyea v.
Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 985; Kobayashi v. Superior Court (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 536, 543.)
Defendant
moves for a protective order in response to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production
on the grounds that certain documents sought by Plaintiff in his Requests for Production
should only need to be produced subject to the Protective Order and designated
as Confidential thereunder.  (Notice PO;
C.C.P. §§2016.030, 2031.060.)
 
1.    
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Disqualify Latham & Watkins
Background
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on July 8, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on October 8, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his reply on October 14,
2024.
 
Legal
Standard
“Before
an attorney may be disqualified from representing a party in litigation because
his representation of that party is adverse to the interest of a current or
former client, it must first be established that the party seeking the
attorney’s disqualification was or is ‘represented’ by the attorney in a manner
giving rise to an attorney-client relationship.”  (Shen v. Miller (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th
48, 56, citing Koo v. Rubio’s Restaurants, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
719, 729; id. n.3 [“Generally, before the disqualification of an
attorney is proper, the complaining party must have or have had an
attorney-client relationship with that attorney.”].)  Plaintiff bears the burden to establish that
an attorney-client relationship existed.  (See Koo, 109 Cal.App.4th at pg. 729.)
The
general rule is that an attorney’s client is the corporate entity, and
individuals within an organization “cannot presume that corporate counsel is
protecting their interests.”  (Sprengel
v. Zbylut (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 1028, 1042, citing La Jolla Cove Motel
& Hotel Apartments, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 773,
784.) 
“An
attorney-client relationship is not created by the unilateral declaration of
one party to the relationship . . .. Rather, the relationship can only be
created by contract, express or implied.”  (Koo, 109 Cal.App.4th at pg. 729, citations
omitted.)  “An implied contract is one,
the existence and terms of which are manifested by conduct.”  (Responsible Citizens v. Superior Court
(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1717, 1732, quoting Civ. Code §1621).  Courts will thus consider the “totality of the
circumstances” in determining whether an attorney-client relationship exists.  (Koo, 109 Cal.App.4th at pg. 732.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
motion to disqualify Latham is denied.
Plaintiff
fails to meet his burden to establish that the has ever had an attorney-client
relationship with Latham.  First, Plaintiff
fails to demonstrate that he had an express, written agreement with Latham.  (See Decl. of Ellison ¶7; Bus. &
Prof. Code §6148(a).)  
Second,
Plaintiff fails to demonstrate he had an implied contract with Latham for legal
services.  In re Marriage of Zimmerman
(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 556, 560, an appellant claimed she had spoken for about
twenty minutes with an attorney during which she purportedly “‘outlined’ the
case for [the attorney] by providing him with all ‘pertinent’ information.”  (Zimmerman, 16 Cal.App.4th at pg. 565.)
 After the attorney joined a firm that
was adverse to appellant in a pending lawsuit, the appellant moved to
disqualify the attorney. The Zimmerman Court affirmed that the
attorney’s brief conversation with the appellant was insufficient to disqualify
the attorney or his new firm.  (Id.
at pgs. 564-565 [“While [the attorney] may have offered appellant his initial
impressions of the case, he obviously was not called upon to formulate a legal
strategy and, by the very limited nature of his contact with appellant, could
not have gained detailed knowledge of the pertinent facts and legal principles]”.)

Here,
like in Zimmerman, Plaintiff’s email correspondence with Joe Calabrese
(“Calabrese”) on March 18, 2021, to inquire about suing various outlets for
defamation is insufficient to establish an attorney-client relationship.  (See Decl. of Asi ¶3, Exh. 3.)  In his response to Plaintiff’s email,
Calabrese explicitly states, “Copying in Rob and Marvin, who are best suited to
answer your question on litigation.” 
(Decl. of Asi ¶3, Exh. 3.) 
Calabrese’s response to Plaintiff contains no legal advice on defamation
or litigation and merely offers sympathy to Plaintiff’s predicament.  (Id. [“From a purely human-standpoint,
I am shocked at the tone.”].)  Plaintiff’s
declaration that he followed up his email conversation with Calabrese on an
unspecified date, wherein Calabrese advised Plaintiff that there was no legal
remedy to protect him from the defamatory information about him in the press,
and that Ralph Ellison (“Ellison”) would reach out to him for further advice is
not sufficient evidence alone to support an implied attorney-client
relationship.  (See Decl. of Asi
¶4.)  Plaintiff’s evidence in support his
argument only demonstrates his communications, like in Zimmerman, were
“of a preliminary and peripheral nature.” 
(Zimmerman, 16 Cal.App.4th at pg. 565.)  
Third,
Plaintiff’s argument that Ellison’s electronic invite to Plaintiff on or about
March 30, 2022, and his conversation with Ellison along with other members of
the Hollywood Foreign Press Association obviates a reasonable belief of the
formation of an attorney-client relationship because of the presence of other
members on the invitation and in the group meeting.  (See Decl. of Asi ¶5.)  Further, Plaintiff’s argument is contradicted
by Ellison’s declaration stating that he provided the participants with a warning,
expressly advising them that Latham represented Defendant.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶5.)
Finally,
Plaintiff’s declaration that during his first meet and confer with Ellison on
May 2, 2024, Ellison told him he should be suing The Wrap and The LA
Times rather than Defendant does not constitute legal advice.  Therefore, Plaintiff failed to meet his
burden that Latham previously represented him, necessitating Latham’s
disqualification as Defendant’s counsel.
          Plaintiff’s argument that Latham’s
possession and use of his privileged emails further demonstrates the need for
Latham’s disqualification is also unavailing.
          When an attorney comes into possession
of what appears to be another
party’s
potentially privileged communications, the attorney is permitted to review only
as much as is necessary to make that determination and must then to cease
review and notify opposing counsel immediately.  (See State Compensation Insurance Fund v.
WPS, Inc. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 644, 656-657.)
          Here, after the HFPA was able to
recover the approximately 31,000 emails that were deleted from Plaintiff’s HFPA
account, Latham reviewed a metadata report of the emails.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶¶9-10.)  In reviewing the metadata, Latham observed
that some of the recovered emails were to or from Plaintiff’s former counsel.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶¶9-10.)  Latham refrained from reviewing any of these communications,
sequestered them from review, and immediately informed Plaintiff’s then-counsel.
 (Decl. of Ellison ¶10, Exh. E.) 
          Moreover, on October 11, 2022, Plaintiff’s
former counsel produced to Latham a full back up of Plaintiff’s HFPA email
account, and the backup contained additional communications that Defendant did
not recover with the initial 31,000 emails.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶14.)
          As a matter of law, any of the emails
Plaintiff sent using his HFPA email account waived Plaintiff’s protections
afforded by the attorney-client privilege.  (See Holmes v. Petrovich Development Co. (2011)
191 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1068-1071 [holding, in a subsequent lawsuit against her
employer, that employee waived privilege over emails sent from her employer’s
email account to her attorneys because she did not have reasonable expectation
of privacy].)  Plaintiff’s knowledge that
Defendant controls his HFPA email account does not create a reasonable
expectation that Plaintiff’s emails would not be readily accessible to the Defendant.  (See id. [concluding that emails sent
via employer’s email account were “akin to consulting her lawyer in her
employer’s conference room, in a loud voice, with the door open, so that any reasonable
person would expect that their discussion of her complaints about her employer
would be overheard by him”].)  Therefore,
Defendant’s conduct related to Plaintiff’s email communications with his former
attorney is not grounds for Latham’s disqualification.
          Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is
denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to disqualify Latham as Defendant’s counsel is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
 
2.    
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFP 1
Meet
and Confer
Plaintiff
met and conferred with Defendant’s counsel at an IDC held on August 20, 2024,
and the Court deemed the issues unresolved. 
(8/20/24 IDC Minute Order.) 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is proper.
 
Background
On
April 18, 2024, Plaintiff served his RFP 1 on Defendant.  (Decl. of Asi ¶1, Exh. A.)  Defendant responded on May 21, 2024, with
unverified responses.  (Decl. of Asi ¶2,
Exh. B.)  Defendant served verifications
on June 4, 2024.  (Decl. of Asi ¶6, Exh.
G.)  
On
June 11, 2024, this Court ordered Defendant to (i) provide Code-compliant
responses to Plaintiff’s RFP 1; (ii) produce all non-privileged
documents that are responsive to the RFP and not subject to any motion for a
protective order by Defendant, (iii) move for a protective order as to any
documents Defendant believes in good faith warrant confidentiality protection
and is thus withholding from production until the adjudication of any such
motion; and (iv) produce a privilege log. 
(6/12/24 Notice of Entry of Order IDC.)
On July 31, 2024, Defendant produced a portion
of the requested documents along with a privilege log.  (Decl. of Asi ¶8, Exhs. H, I.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on August 12,
2024.  Defendant filed its opposition on September
24, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his reply on
October 1, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
“The
party claiming the privilege has the burden of establishing the preliminary
facts necessary to support its exercise, i.e., a communication made in the
course of an attorney-client relationship.”  (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court
(2009) 219 Cal.4th 725, 733.)  This is
done by providing a privilege log, which contains sufficient information for
judicial evaluation of a claim of privilege.  (Best Products, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004)
119 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1188.)  “Once that
party establishes facts necessary to support a prima facie claim of
privilege, the communication is presumed to have been made in confidence and
the opponent of the claim of privilege has the burden of proof to establish the
communication was not confidential or that the privilege does not for other
reasons apply.”  (Costco Wholesale
Corp., 219 Cal.4th at pg. 733.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses from Defendant as to RFP 1 is denied.  Defendant produced a detailed privilege log,
which demonstrates that the documents withheld on the basis of privilege are
communications made in the course of an attorney-client relationship, either
with outside counsel or the Defendant’s COO and General Counsel, Greg Goeckner.
 (Decl. of Ellison ¶¶7, 9, Exh. 5.)
Here,
Defendant’s privilege log states the withheld documents.  The privilege log denotes the individuals who
are attorneys with an asterisk on the log itself.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶¶7, 9, Exh. 5.)  Each entry in the “Description” field explains
that the communication is one which involves “providing legal advice,”
“requesting legal advice,” “memorializing legal advice,” or otherwise provides
an even more specific description of the attorney function being performed in
that specific communication.  (Decl. of Ellison
¶¶7, 9, Exh. 5.)  Defendant’s privilege
log provides sufficient factual information for Plaintiff and this Court to
evaluate the merits of that claim.  (Catalina
Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1123 [“Even
a minimal statement . . . is sufficient.”].)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses is denied.
 
          Sanctions
          In light of the Court’s ruling on the
instant motion, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to his RFP 1 is denied.
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
 
3.    
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFP 2
Meet
and Confer
Plaintiff
met and conferred with Defendant’s counsel at an IDC held on June 11, 2024, and
the Court deemed the issues resolved.  (6/11/24
IDC Minute Order.)
 
Background
On June
14, 2024, Plaintiff served his RFP 2 on Defendant.  (Decl. of Asi ¶1, Exh. A.)  Defendant responded on July 16, 2024, with
objections.  (Decl. of Asi ¶2, Exh.
B.)  
On July 29 and 31, 2024,
Defendant produced the documents it agreed to produce at the June 11, 2024,
IDC, along with a privilege log.
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on July 25,
2024.  Defendant filed its opposition on October
8, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his reply on
October 14, 2024.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses from Defendant as to RFP 2 is denied as moot.  Defendant produced a detailed privilege log
on or before the agreed production deadline of July 21, 2024.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶¶2-4.)  Plaintiff’s motion fails to meet its burden to
demonstrate that the communications in the privilege log are not confidential
or that the privilege does not apply for other reasons.  (Costco Wholesale Corp., 219 Cal.4th
at pg. 733.)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to RFP 2 is denied as moot.
 
          Sanctions
          In light of the Court’s ruling on the
instant motion, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to his RFP 2 is denied as moot.
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
 
4.    
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to RFP 3
Meet
and Confer
Plaintiff
met and conferred with Defendant’s counsel at an IDC held on October 1, 2024,
and the Court deemed the issues unresolved. 
(10/1/24 IDC Minute Order.) 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is proper.
 
Background
On July
1, 2024, Plaintiff served his RFP 3 on Defendant.  (Decl. of Asi ¶1, Exh. A.)  Defendant responded on August 2, 2024, with objections,
and failed to produce any of the requested documents.  (Decl. of Asi ¶2, Exh. B.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on August 12,
2024.  Defendant filed its opposition on
September 24, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his
reply on October 1, 2024.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses from Defendant as to RFP 3 Request Nos. 2,
4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11-15 is denied.  Request
Nos. 2-7 and 11-15 seek all contracts or agreements between Defendant and
various organizations or individuals.  The
terms of those contractual relationships have no bearing on any claim or
defense in the case, and none of those third parties deliberated with Defendant’s
Board or voted on Plaintiff’s expulsion. 
(Decl. of Kargher ¶2, Exh. 2 at RFA No. 33.)
Further,
Plaintiff’s argument that these agreements are “crucial for establishing a
pattern of corrupt practices, bias and retaliatory behavior within the HFPA,” is
unavailing.  A contract or agreement cannot
not demonstrate “malicious intent” or “retaliatory actions” against Plaintiff,
nor can documents and communications related to offers to acquire Defendant, as
sought in Request No. 15.  The documents
sought are also confidential and subject to a protective order. Section 4.16 of
Defendant’s Bylaws specifically prohibits the disclosure of information not
generally known to the public which may be revealed at any meetings of the
members, including “Association financial information, business plans,
salaries, awards, legal matters and/or intellectual properties.”  (Decl. of Goeckner ¶¶2-3, Exh. 1 at pg. 13 of
33.)  Defendant maintains confidentiality
over the requested agreements.  (Decl. of
Goeckner ¶4.)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses is denied.
 
          Sanctions
          In light of the Court’s ruling on the
instant motion, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to his RFP 3 is denied.
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
 
5.    
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to FROG 1
Meet
and Confer
Plaintiff
met and conferred with Defendant’s counsel at an IDC held on October 1, 2024,
and the Court deemed the issues unresolved. 
(10/1/24 IDC Minute Order.) 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is proper.
 
Background
On April
29, 2024, Plaintiff served his FROG 1 on Defendant.  (Decl. of Asi ¶1, Exh. A.)  Defendant provided verified responses on May
31, 2024, with objections.  (Decl. of Asi
¶2, Exh. B.)  On July 12, 2024, Defendant
served its verified supplemental and amended responses.  (Decl. of Asi ¶5, Exh. E.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on July 30,
2024.  Defendant filed its opposition on October
8, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his reply on
October 14, 2024.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses from Defendant as to FROG 1 is denied.  Defendant’s responses are Code-compliant.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶9, Exh. 3.)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses is denied.
 
          Sanctions
          In light of the Court’s ruling on the
instant motion, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to his FROG 1 is denied.
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
 
6.    
Defendant’s
Motion to Quash
On
July 24, 2024, Plaintiff initially moved to quash or stay the deposition of
Gabriel Lerman (“Lerman”) and for an order to bar Plaintiff from directly
contacting or communicating with Defendant or any of its Board Members,
including Lerman, while this action is pending. 
(Notice Quash, pg. 2; C.C.P. §128(a), 2019.020, 2025.410, 2025.420; RPC,
Rule 4.2; Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 985; Kobayashi
v. Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536, 543.)
On
October 7, 2024, Defendant filed a notice of partial withdrawal of its motion
pertaining to its request to quash or stay Lerman’s deposition.  (Notice Partial Withdrawal, pg. 2.)  Defendant’s notice states it does not
withdraw its request for an order barring Plaintiff from directly contacting or
communicating with Defendant or any of its Board Members, including Lerman,
while this action is pending.  (Notice
Partial Withdrawal, pg. 2.)
 
Discussion
C.C.P.
§128(a)(5) provides that the Court has the power to control in the furtherance
of justice the conduct of all persons in any manner connected with a judicial
proceeding before it, in every matter pertaining thereto. In an ordinary action
where all parties are represented by counsel, an attorney cannot contact a represented
person about the action directly or indirectly without the consent of the
opposing attorney.  (RPC, Rule 4.2.)  This rule exists to preserve the
attorney-client relations from an opposing attorney’s (and party’s) intrusion
and interference.  (Jackson v.
Ingersoll-Rand Co. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1163, 1167 [discussing Rule 2-100,
which is a precursor to Rule 4.2].)
To
effectuate this rule, courts commonly issue orders that prohibit communications
with represented parties.  (See, e.g.,
Hernandez v. Vitamin Shoppe Industries, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
1441, 1454-1460 [affirming order issued pursuant to C.C.P. §128 that prohibited
communications with represented parties].) Similarly, where the represented person
is an employee or agent of a corporation, it is settled that a court can issue
a protective order barring such contact when the person is privy to privileged
information and there is a real danger that such information might be disclosed
if the person is contacted ex parte (i.e., without his or her counsel).  (See Bobele v. Superior Court (1988)
199 Cal.App.3d 708, 714-715.)
The
Court of Appeal has held that the Rules of Professional Conduct should apply to
parties who elect to proceed pro per in litigation:
Pro. per. litigants are
held to the same standards as attorneys . . . We see no reason why the rules of
professional conduct, at least as those rules govern conduct in the actual
course of litigation, should not apply to pro per litigants in the very cases
where pro per litigants elect to act as their own attorneys. To say otherwise would
be to give pro per litigants (and particularly vexatious litigants representing
themselves) an unfair advantage over parties represented by attorneys bound by
that code.
 
(Kobayashi
v. Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536, 543.)
Here, Plaintiff
has attempted to contact Lerman directly. 
(See Supp.-Decl. of Asi ¶1 [“On July 26, 2024, I called Mr.
Gabriel Lerman via WhatsApp.”]; id. at ¶2 [“On August 28, 2024,
following the Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) where the court ordered me to
disclose Mr. Lerman’s identity as my witness and directed the HFPA to withdraw
their motion to quash his deposition, I sent Mr. Lerman a message via WhatsApp.”];
id. at ¶3 [“On October 4, 2024, I spoke with Attorney Neville Johnson,
who confirmed that he was representing Mr. Lerman in a potential class action
lawsuit against the HFPA until his clients’ retainer ran out. Later that day, I
sent another message to Mr. Lerman via WhatsApp, informing him of the content
of my conversation with Mr. Johnson.”].) 

Plaintiff
is subject to the same standards of conduct as any attorney in this
action.  Therefore, Plaintiff is
prohibited from communicating with Defendant’s represented members without the
consent of Defendant’s counsel.  (RPC,
Rule 4.2.)
Accordingly,
Defendant’s partial motion to prohibit Plaintiff from contacting Defendant’s
represented members without the consent of their counsel is granted.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion to prohibit Plaintiff from contacting Defendant’s represented members
without the consent of their counsel is granted.
Moving
Party to give notice.
 
7.    
Defendant’s
Motion for Protective Order
Meet
and Confer
          C.C.P. §2031.060 provides, in part:
When an
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of documents, tangible things,
places, or electronically stored information has been demanded, the party to
whom the demand has been directed, and any other party or affected person, may
promptly move for a protective order. This motion shall be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
 
(C.C.P.
§2031.060(a), emphasis added.)
Defendant’s
counsel declares that on May 21, 2024, he and Plaintiff met and conferred, and
Plaintiff stated that he did not wish to sign a protective order despite the
fact that it would provide him with his requested documents at an earlier date
because he has “nothing to lose” from continued opposition to the entry of a protective
order.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶15.)  The Court finds Defendant’s counsel’s
declaration states facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to
resolve the matter outside of court. 
(C.C.P. §§2016.040, 2031.060(a).)  Therefore, the Court will consider the
instant motion.
 
Legal Standard 
C.C.P. §2031.060(b) provides that “[t]he court,
for good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any
party or other person from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression,
or undue burden and expense.”  (C.C.P.
§2031.060(b).)
The decision upon whether to enter a protective
order lies within the sound discretion of the court.  (Raymond Handling Concepts
Corp. v. Superior Court (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 584, 588, 591; Meritplan Insurance
Co. v. Superior Court (1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 237, 242.)  Moving
parties have the burden to show good cause for protective order.  (Emerson
Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1101,
1110.)   
 
          Discussion
Defendant’s
motion for protective order is granted.  Defendant
requests this Court impose a protective order related to the investigative
report Plaintiff seeks in his RFPs that concerns allegations of sexual
harassment and sexual misconduct.  
“The
state Constitution expressly grants Californians a right of privacy. (Cal.
Const. art. 1, §1.)  Protection of
informational privacy is the provision’s central concern.  (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn.
(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35.)  In Hill,
the California Supreme Court established a framework for evaluating potential
invasions of privacy.  The party
asserting a privacy right must establish a legally protected privacy interest,
an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances,
and a threatened intrusion that is serious.”  (Id. at pgs. 35-37.)
“The
Hill test, conceived in the context of a pleaded cause of action for
invasion of privacy, has been applied more broadly, including to circumstances
where litigation requires a court to reconcile asserted privacy interests with competing
claims for access to third party [personal] information.”  (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3
Cal.5th 531, 532.)
“Assuming
that a claimant has met the foregoing Hill criteria for invasion of a
privacy interest, that interest must be measured against other competing or countervailing
interests in a ‘balancing test.’”  (Pioneer
Electronics (USA), Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 360, 371.)  “Protective measures, safeguards and other
alternatives may minimize the privacy intrusion. ‘For example, if intrusion is
limited and confidential information is carefully shielded from disclosure except
to those who have a legitimate need to know, privacy concerns are assuaged.’”  (Id., citing Hill, 7 Cal.4th at pg.
38.)
The
Los Angeles Superior Court developed a Model Protective Order specifically for
this purpose.  (See Superior Court
of California, County of Los Angeles Model Stipulation and Protective order –
Confidential Designation Only, available at https://www.lacourt.org/division/civil/pdf/formprotectiveorder1confidential_1.pdf.)
          First, good cause exists to enter the
proposed, modified version of the LASC Model Protective Order offered by
Defendant.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶¶6-7,
Exhs. 6-7.)  Defendant seeks to safeguard
a legally protected privacy interest, namely Defendant’s 86-page investigative report
(“Investigative Report”) conducted by Ramsey & Ehrlich LLP into allegations
of sexual harassment.  Exhibits 3 and 4
to the Investigative Report includes private text messages between two third
parties obtained by the investigators.  Defendant
also seeks to safeguard Defendant’s internal communications related to the
investigation and the accusers, Defendant’s internal communications related to
PR from the investigation, and Defendant’s internal communications regarding
Plaintiff and Defendant’s policies. 
These documents implicate the legally protected information privacy
interests of third parties who have alleged sexual misconduct by Plaintiff.  (Hill, 7 Cal.4th at pg. 37.)
          Second, the third parties have a
reasonable expectation of privacy in their reports of misconduct to Defendant.  Defendant’s Whistleblower Policy, Code of
Conduct, and Bylaws all expressly promise confidentiality.  (Decl. of Ellison ¶¶16-18, Exhs. 14-16.)  As the Court of Appeal specifically noted in
its decision affirming in part and reversing in part the Defendant’s special motion
to strike Plaintiff’s complaint, Plaintiff’s accusers are Covered Persons under
Defendant’s Whistleblower Policy. The Whistleblower Policy’s express terms state
that the identity of such Covered Persons is to be concealed “to the greatest
extent practicable given legal requirements, consistent with the need to
conduct a fair and adequate investigation and take necessary corrective
action.”  (Decl. of Ellison ¶14, Exh. 14
at §5.)
          Defendant’s Code of Conduct also contains
a section entitled “Confidential Reporting and Non-Retaliation,” which explains
that “[a]lthough individuals are encouraged to identify themselves while making
reports so that any necessary follow-up can be undertaken, the hotline accepts
anonymous reports. In any case, the HFPA will protect the reporter’s
confidentiality to the fullest extent possible (although information may need
to be shared to facilitate an investigation and response to a report.)”  (Decl. of Ellison ¶15, Exh. 15 at pg. 5.)
          Defendant’s Bylaws also enshrine these
protections: “Information disclosed at any meeting of the Members that is not
generally known to the public, including Association financial information,
business plans, salaries, awards, legal matters and/or intellectual property
shall[] not be disclosed by Members to third parties at any time without
approval of the Chief Executive Officer or the Board.”  (Decl. of Ellison ¶16, Exh. 16 at §4.16.)
          Here, the accusers had a reasonable
expectation of privacy with respect to their participation in Defendant’s
investigation.  The Court of Appeal determined
that Defendant’s Whistleblower Policy, Code of Conduct, and Bylaws all applied
to Plaintiff’s accusers.  (Asi v.
Hollywood Foreign Press Association (Cal. Ct. App., Oct. 13, 2023, No.
B327002) 2023 WL 6783094, at *18-20.)[1]
          Finally, not designating the
Investigative Report and associated materials as confidential under the
proposed protective order poses serious threats of privacy intrusions to third
parties.  Plaintiff’s past conduct of
using confidential materials against other HFPA members, including those who
have accused him of misconduct, warrants the protection sought in this
motion.  (See Decl. of Ellison
¶¶2-6, 19-20, Exhs. 1-5, 17-18.)
          Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for
the proposed protective order is granted.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion for a protective order is granted.
Moving
Party to give notice.
