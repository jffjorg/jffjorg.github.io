Plaintiff Blanca
Cabrera (“Cabrera”) (“Plaintiff”) moves for this Court to reconsider, reverse,
or vacate its March 6, 2023, order (“3/6/23 Ruling”) granting Defendant Nissa
North America, Inc.’s (“Nissan”) (“Defendant”) motion to compel arbitration and
stay proceedings.  (Notice of Motion, pg.
2; C.C.P. §1008(c).)  
 
Procedural Background
          On December 14, 2021, Plaintiff filed
her operative complaint against Defendant alleging five causes of action: (1)
violation of Civil Code §§1793.2(D); (2) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(B);
(3) violation of Civil Code §1793.2(A)(3); (4) breach of implied warranty of
merchantability (Civ. Code §§1791.1, 1794, 1795.5); and (5) fraudulent
inducement- concealment, arising from Plaintiff’s purchase of a 2019 Nissan
Altima (“Subject Vehicle”).
          On March 6, 2023, this Court granted
Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims.  (3/6/23 Ruling.)
          Plaintiff filed the instant motion on July
11, 2024.  Defendant filed its opposition
on October 8, 2024.  Plaintiff filed her
reply on October 14, 2024.  
 
Motion for
Reconsideration
C.C.P. §1008(a)
provides, as follows:  “When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.
The party making the application shall state by affidavit what application was
made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and
what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.”  (C.C.P. §1008(a), emphasis added.)
Defendant’s objection
to Plaintiff’s motion as untimely because it was not filed within 10 days of
notice of entry of the 3/6/23 Ruling is unavailing.  In Malek v. Blue Cross of California (2004)
121 Cal.App.4th 44, the Court of Appeal determined that a change in the law
required the trial court to reconsider its prior ruling compelling
arbitration.  (Id. at pgs.
59-60.)  The Malek Court stated,
“the progress of the arbitration is not material when considering a change in
the law affecting whether the arbitral forum was a correct one.”  (Id. at pg. 60.)  
“If a court believes
one of its prior interim orders was erroneous, it should be able to correct
that error no matter how it came to acquire that belief. For example, nothing
would prevent the losing party from asking the court at a status conference to reconsider
a ruling.  (See Weil & Brown,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial, supra, §
9:327.8, p. 9(1)–107.)  But a party may
not file a written motion to reconsider that has procedural
significance if it does not satisfy the requirements of section 437c,
subdivision (f)(2), or 1008. The court need not rule on any
suggestion that it should reconsider a previous ruling and, without more,
another party would not be expected to respond to such a suggestion.”  (Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35
Cal.4th 1094, 1108, as modified (June 10, 2005).)  
          Plaintiff requests this Court
reconsider its 3/6/23 Ruling in light of Kielar v. Superior Court of Placer County (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614, Yeh v. Superior
Court of Contra Costa County (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 264, Ford Motor
Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, Montemayor v. Ford Motor
Company (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th, and Davis v. Nissan North America
Inc. (2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 825, which distinguish and disagree with
Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486.
Here, the Court has
been put on notice of new case law that disagrees with Felisilda, the
case on which this Court relied to grant Defendant’s 3/6/23 Ruling. 
Accordingly, the Court will sua sponte reconsider its Order.
Parties are to submit simultaneous briefs on November 15, 2023, regarding
the new case law that disagrees with Felisilda.  The parties are
also to address any prejudice caused by the timing of this motion.  
Accordingly, the Court sua sponte sets a hearing to reconsider Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration for December 11,
2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion
for reconsideration is denied.
The Court sua
sponte sets a hearing to reconsider Defendant’s motion to compel
arbitration for Wednesday, December 11, 2024, at
8:30 a.m.  Parties are to submit
simultaneous briefs on November 15, 2024.
Moving Party to give notice.
