[1] CRC, Rule 8.1115(b)(1) provides, “An unpublished
opinion may be cited or relied on: (1) When the opinion is relevant under the
doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel.”  Here, the unpublished opinion of the Court of
Appeal in this matter is the law of the case and can therefore be cited and
relied on.
