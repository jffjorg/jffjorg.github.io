     CASE NO.: 21VECV00218
 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART DEFENDANT MILAD KESHAVARZ’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
 
 





 
I.              
INTRODUCTION
This action was
brought by Plaintiffs DRW Real Estate, LLC and Roger K. Rosen (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) for an alleged breach of a commercial leasing agreement with a
tenant whose primary use was intended to be a chiropractic clinic located at
10801 Foothill Blvd., San Bernardino, CA 91730 (the “Premises”). Defendants
allegedly failed to pay rent in April 2020, Plaintiffs served a Notice of
Termination on December 3, 2020, and the Defendants vacated the Premises on
January 4, 2021.
Plaintiffs’ operative
complaint alleges the following causes of action: (1) Breach of contract
against Defendants Cora Lanyon, Jeffrey F. Lanyon, and C Lanyon Chiropractic
Professional Corporation dba Core Integrated Health; (2) Common Counts by
Plaintiffs against Defendants Cora Lanyon, Jeffery F. Lanyon, and Milad Keshavarz
(“Keshavarz”); (3) Fraud against Defendants Cora Lanyon and Jeffrey F. Lanyon;
and (4) Negligence against Keshavarz. 
On June 17,
2024, this Court found in favor of Keshavarz after holding a non-jury trial and
ordered Plaintiffs to incorporate the Court’s ruling into the Final Judgment at
the appropriate time. 
Keshavarz now
seeks his attorney’s fees and costs as the prevailing party.
II.           
PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
On February
22, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint. 
On April 20,
2021, Plaintiffs amended their Complaint by adding Defendant Corlan, LLC, an
Arizona Limited Liability Company, a party previously identified as Doe 1. Given
the way Plaintiffs pled their Complaint, Corlan was added as a defendant to
every cause of action by way of Paragraph 4.b.(1).
On April 18,
2023, Plaintiffs requested and obtained entry of default as to Defendants Cora
Lanyon and Jeffrey F. Lanyon.
On May 25,
2023, the previously assigned bench officer sustained Keshavarz’s Demurrer without
leave to amend as the first cause of action, overruled it as to the second
cause of action, and sustained it with leave to amend as to the fourth cause of
action. Plaintiffs never filed an amended complaint.
Sometime
between May 25 and June 22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended
Complaint. The date is uncertain because it never appeared on the docket until
the Court pointed it out at the time of trial against Keshavarz. Apparently,
however, Plaintiffs served it on Keshavarz at the least and since Keshavarz
filed his Answer timely, there was no prejudice to the Court receiving it at
the time of trial against him.
On June 22,
2023, Keshavarz filed his Answer to First Amended Complaint. 
On May 13,
2024, Plaintiffs dismissed Defendants Core Health and C. Lanyon Chiropractic
Professional Corporation with prejudice. Plaintiffs intend on proceeding with a
default prove-up as to the remaining defendants, Cora Lanyon and Jeffrey F.
Lanyon, at a later time.
On June 17,
2024, this Court found in favor of Keshavarz after holding a non-jury trial and
ordered Plaintiffs to incorporate the Court’s ruling into the Final Judgment at
the appropriate time. 
On September
9, 2024, Keshavarz filed the instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs
(“Motion”). 
On November
4, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Opposition. 
Keshavarz did
not file a reply. 
III.        
LEGAL
STANDARD
“A party
is entitled to an award of¿attorney¿fees¿if there
is a specific authorization therefor by statute or private agreement.” (Beverly Hills Properties v.
Marcolino (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 7, 10.)  
 “With respect to attorney fees
incurred to litigate a contract claim, the recovery of such fees are governed
by¿Section 1717.”
(Intelligent Investments Corp. v. Gonzales (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1,
4.) Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a)
provides in, pertinent part, “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract
specifically provides that¿attorney's¿fees¿and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the¿prevailing¿party, then the party who is determined
to be the¿party¿prevailing¿on the contract, whether he or she is
the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable¿attorney's¿fees¿in addition to other costs.”
“California
courts liberally construe the term ‘on a contract’
as used within¿section
1717. As long as the action involves a contract it is ‘on
the contract’
within the meaning of¿Section
1717.”
(Dell Merk Inc. v. Franzia (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 443, 455, (internal
citations omitted).) 
“The court…shall determine who is the
party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section, whether or not
the suit proceeds to final judgment…the party prevailing on the contract shall
be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract. The
court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for
purposes of this section.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1717(b).)
Code of Civil Procedure § 1032(b)
provides that, “[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled … to recover costs in any action or proceeding.”
Attorneys’ fees awarded pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1717 are
allowable as costs under Code of Civil Procedure § 1032 as they are attorneys’
fees authorized by contract. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B); Code
Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(10)(A).) Attorneys’ fees are therefore recoverable as an
element of costs.
IV.         
ANALYSIS 
A.       Keshavarz’s
Fees Are Granted in Part.
1.              
Request for Judicial Notice
As a preliminary matter,
Plaintiffs request this Court take judicial notice of “the article downloaded
by Plaintiffs’ counsel Michael Worthington from the Los Angeles Times web page
archives dated 09/05/2014 titled ‘A cure for diabetes?  Don’t look to chiropractors, state says’.”
(Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice.) The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request,
but only as to the existence of the article, not as to its content. Courts may
not take judicial notice of the contents of Internet sites and blogs but may as
to their existence. (See Ragland v. U.S. Bank National Assn. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 182, 194.) 
2.              
Keshavarz is Entitled to an Award
of Reasonable Attorney’s Fees and Costs Under Code of Civil Procedure § 1717(a).
Keshavarz requests a total of $34,582.50 in
attorney’s fees and $2,661.31 in costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §
1717(a). (See Motion, pg. 11.) Keshavarz argues he is entitled to
attorney’s fees because the contract on which Plaintiffs based their First
Amended Complaint, the commercial lease, contains a prevailing party attorneys’
fees clause and Keshavarz is the prevailing party. (See Motion, pg. 5-7.)

In opposition,
Plaintiffs seek to relitigate their claims against Keshavarz. (See Opposition,
pg. 14 (“Plaintiffs respectfully[sic] request that the court determine
Plaintiffs are the prevailing party on the First Cause of Action for breach of
contract, the Second Cause of Action on Common Count for monies due on an open
book account, on the Third Cause of Action for Fraud and the Fifth Cause of
Action for Exemplary Damages and that Keshavarz has not prevailed on any
contract related claim.” (emphasis added).) The Court will not consider
Plaintiffs’ attempts to revive their claims against Keshavarz as such arguments
are inapplicable to the instant Motion and inappropriate at this stage.
Plaintiffs’ attempts to address the merits of the instant Motion are similarly
unpersuasive. For example, Plaintiffs argue this Court should determine they
are the prevailing parties on the contract for purposes of attorney’s fees
and costs. In support of this argument, Plaintiffs quote Scott Co. v.
Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1109, which states “[i]f neither party
achieves a complete victory on all the contract claims, it is within the
discretion of the trial court to determine which party prevailed on the contract
or whether, on balance, neither party prevailed sufficiently to justify an
award of attorney fees.” But Plaintiffs’ citation to Scott is unhelpful
to their argument. Here, Keshavarz achieved “complete victory” on all
Plaintiffs’ claims against him. 
The Court thus finds Keshavarz is entitled to
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Though not party to the contract,
Keshavarz is entitled to recover his attorney’s fees and costs under the
contract because Plaintiffs would have been entitled to recover their fees and
costs under the contract had they prevailed at trial. (See Real Property Services
Corporation v. The City of Pasedena (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 375, 382.) The Court also finds
Keshavarz is the prevailing party because this Court found in favor of him
after a non-jury trial. 
Accordingly, Keshavarz is
entitled to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs under Code of
Civil Procedure § 1717(a) as the prevailing party in this action.
2.       Mr. Grace and Mr. Denny’s Rates are
Reasonable 
Keshavarz’s counsel, Mr. Scott Grace (“Mr. Grace”)
provides a declaration detailing his requested hours and providing support for
the billing rate of he and his paralegal, Mr. Dave Denny (“Mr. Denny”). (See
Declaration of Scott Grace filed September 11, 2024 (“Grace Decl.”).) Mr.
Grace also details Mr. Denny’s hours. (See Grace Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. B.) 
The Court finds Mr. Grace’s billing rate of $525.00/hour
reasonable given the prevailing rates in the Greater Los Angeles Area for
attorneys with the same level of experience as Mr. Grace, who has been licensed
to practice law in California for approximately 17 years, as well as the level
of complexity of the case and skill demanded by it. (See Grace Decl., ¶¶
7-10, 12-14.) The Court also finds Mr. Denny’s billing rate of $125.00/hour
reasonable given the prevailing rates in the Greater Los Angeles Area for paralegals
with the same level of experience as Mr. Denny, who has worked in the civil
defense field for over 14 years. (See Grace Decl., ¶¶ 11-13, 15.)
3.       Not
All of Mr. Grace and Mr. Denny’s Hours Are Reasonable.
Mr. Grace’s requested $31,395.00 in fees account for
a total of 59.80 hours of legal work. The Court finds most of Mr. Grace’s
request appropriate. However, the Court finds some of Mr. Grace’s requested
hours to be excessive given his experience. The Court also finds some of Mr.
Grace’s hours were more appropriate for his paralegal Mr. Denny to perform and
has reduced the applicable billing rate to that of Mr. Denny’s for those tasks.
Mr. Grace’s reduced hours and billed time are below. 
Mr. Grace, on behalf of Mr. Denny, requested
$3,187.50 in fees, accounting for Mr. Denny’s total 25.50 hours of paralegal
work. The Court again finds most of Mr. Denny’s request appropriate, however, the
Court finds some of Mr. Denny’s billed time lacks the detail necessary to describe
what task was performed such that the Court can properly evaluate the
reasonableness of said task. Mr. Denny’s reduced hours and billed time are also
below.

Based on the foregoing, the Court finds it appropriate
to reduce Mr. Grace’s requested fees by $1,567.00 for a total of $29,828.00 in
fees. The Court also finds it appropriate to reduce Mr. Denny’s hours by 4.8
hours, resulting in 20.7 hours of paralegal work and $2,587.50 in fees. 
In total, the Court finds it appropriate to award
Mr. Grace $32,415.50 in fees.
5.       Keshavarz
is Not Entitled to Costs
Keshavarz requests $2,661.31 in costs. Keshavarz is
not entitled to costs as he did not file a Memorandum of Costs as required by
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.
V.            
CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant Milad Keshavarz’s Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs and awards him $32,415.50
in attorney’s
fees. Defendant Milad Keshavarz is not entitled to costs. 
IT IS SO
ORDERED.
