And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Milad Keshavarz is entitled to attorney's fees and costs as the prevailing party in this action. The Court found that Keshavarz is the prevailing party after a non-jury trial. Keshavarz sought $34,582.50 in attorney's fees and $2,661.31 in costs, but the Court reduced the requested fees and costs due to excessive billing. The Court awarded Keshavarz $32,415.50 in attorney's fees and denied his request for costs because he failed to file a Memorandum of Costs as required by the Rules of Court. The Court granted Keshavarz's motion for attorney's fees and costs in part, but denied his request for costs in full. The ruling is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to reply to the tentative ruling.
