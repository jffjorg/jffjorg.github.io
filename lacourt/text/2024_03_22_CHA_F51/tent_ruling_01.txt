MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV01803

 
Motion filed: 10/26/23 
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Jonathan C. Teller (“Counsel”)
CLIENT: Plaintiff Jullion Jason Hernandez (“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Counsel as attorney
of record for Plaintiff.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is granted.
 
In a civil action, an attorney may
move to be relieved as counsel at any time during the proceedings after giving
notice to his client. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284.) The moving attorney shall file
with his motion: (1) a notice of the motion, directed to the client using
Judicial Council form MC-051; (2) a declaration in support of the motion using
Judicial Council form MC-052; and (3) a proposed order granting the motion; all
to be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.) If the notice is served on the client by
mail, the motion must also be supported by a declaration “stating facts showing
that either: (A) The service address is the current residence or business
address of the client; or (B) The service address is the last known residence
or business address of the client and the attorney has been unable to locate a
more current address after making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days
before the filing of the motion to be relieved.” (Id., subd.
(d)(1).)  
 
Here, Counsel filed this motion to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff on 10/26/23. Counsel served his client by
mail to Plaintiff via personal service on 11/3/23. (11/6/23 Proof of Service.)
Counsel also filed a proof of service showing that the requisite documents were
electronically served on Defendants’ counsel on 10/26/23.
 
Counsel properly filed an
accompanying notice of the motion using Judicial Council form MC-051, a
declaration in support of his motion using form MC-052, and a proposed order
granting the motion using form MC-053. In the MC-052 declaration, Counsel cited
a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship such that Counsel must withdraw
from representation of Plaintiff. (Decl. of Jonathan C. Teller, ¶ 2.) The next
hearing date in this action is a post-mediation status conference, set for 10/8/24.
Therefore, Counsel’s withdrawal does not raise the risk of unduly prejudicing his
client. 
 
Accordingly, the statutory
requirements for the motion have been satisfied, and Counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff is GRANTED.
