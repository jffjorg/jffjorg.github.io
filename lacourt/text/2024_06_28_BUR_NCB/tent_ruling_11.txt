 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
Motion to compel depositions of defendants and for
  sanctions  
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiff V&S Complete Auto Repairs,
Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the First Amended Complaint for unlawful detainer
against Defendants Ara Ohanjanyan and Arman Arutyunyan (“Defendants”) on December
13, 2023.  The property at issue is
located at 7139 Foothill Blvd., Tujunga, CA 91042.  Plaintiff alleges that the parties entered
into a written lease agreement on July 27, 2017.  Plaintiff alleges that it served a 3-day
notice to pay rent or quit, and the period for Defendants to comply expired on November
17, 2023.  Plaintiff seeks possession of
the premises, costs incurred in the proceeding, past due rent of $11,000,
reasonable attorney’s fees, forfeiture of the agreement, and damages at the
rate of $366.67 per day beginning December 1, 2023.  
B.    
Motion on Calendar 
On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion
to compel the depositions of Defendants. 

On June 14, 2024, Defendants filed an
opposition brief.
On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply
brief. 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff moves to compel the depositions of Defendants Ara Ohanjanyan and
Arman Arutyunyan.  
            Plaintiff argues that on March 15,
2024, Defendants’ depositions were noticed for May 10, 2024.  Plaintiff’s counsel acknowledged in an email
that the deposition dates were unilaterally set, but that they would act as
placeholders until the parties could finalize deposition dates.  Plaintiff argues that while defense counsel
promised to provide dates, no deposition dates were provided.  Plaintiff thereafter noticed Defendants’
depositions on May 14, 2024, setting depositions for May 20, 2024.  Plaintiff argues that it did not receive any
response or objection from Defendants. 
Plaintiff’s counsel attended the depositions on May 20, 2024 and
obtained certificates on non-appearance against Defendants.  
            In opposition, Defendants argue that
this motion is moot as defense counsel has provided available dates for
Defendants’ depositions and never disputed that Defendants should be produced
for their depositions.  Defendants also
argue that the deposition notices setting the depositions for May 20, 2024 were
not timely served by email on May 14, 2024, as the email notice did not provide
5 days of notice, plus 2 court days for electronic service.  (See CCP § 2025.270(b), 1010.6.)[1]
            Based on the parties’ papers,
neither party disputes that Plaintiff is entitled to take the depositions of
Defendants.  Based on defense counsel’s
May 24, 2024 email to Plaintiff’s counsel, defense counsel offered to make
Arman Arutyunyan available on June 18, 20, or 21 in the afternoon and Ara
Ohanjanyan available on June 24 or 25 in the afternoon.  (Opp., Ex. 2.)  Plaintiff’s reply brief was filed on June 20,
2024 and does not discuss whether these alternate dates were accepted.  Based on the conclusion of the reply brief
wherein Plaintiff requests that the depositions take place within 10 days of
the order, the Court infers that the parties have not agreed on a deposition
date and that the depositions have not gone forward. 
            As the parties do not dispute that
Defendants should be deposed, the Court will grant the motion to compel
Defendants’ depositions.  The parties are
ordered to meet and confer regarding a mutually agreeable deposition date.  Plaintiff shall initiate meet and confer
efforts and defense counsel shall be ordered to respond with proposed dates of
availability of their clients within 5 business days.  If the parties are unable to find a mutually
agreeable date after good faith meet and confer efforts, Plaintiff may notice
Defendants’ depositions within 10 days of Plaintiff’s last meet and confer
letter.   
Plaintiff seeks $4,713.07 in sanctions
against Defendants and their counsel of record (= $1,947.44 in attorney’s fees
and mileage cost for the depositions + $2,765.63 in fees and costs for the
motion).  Plaintiff’s counsel states that
he is not in receipt of the court reporter’s invoice.  (Rifat Decl., ¶9.)  In the Court’s view, if there was a dispute
about the deposition, Defendants should have at least notified the Plaintiff’s
counsel of the dispute so that a reporter did not need to appear. The Court thus
grants Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in the reasonable amount of $950,
representing the costs of the deposition appearances.   In opposition, Defendants seek $2,750 in
sanctions against Plaintiff.  Defendant’s
request for sanctions is denied. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff V&S
Complete Auto Repairs, Inc.’s motion to compel the
depositions of Defendants is granted.  The parties are
ordered to meet and confer regarding a mutually agreeable deposition date.  Plaintiff shall initiate meet and confer
efforts and defense counsel shall be ordered to respond with proposed dates of
availability of their clients within 5 business days.  If the parties are unable to find a mutually
agreeable date after good faith meet and confer efforts, Plaintiff may notice
Defendants’ depositions within 10 days of the Plaintiff’s last meet and confer
letter.   
Defendants and their counsel of record, jointly and severally, are ordered to
pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $950 to Plaintiff, by and through
counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order.
Plaintiff shall
provide notice of this order.
