Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff's motion to strike the answers of Kristie Blocher, Isaac Blocher, and Blocher Holdings, LLC. The reasons for the strike are:

1. The answers were not signed by the defendants.
2. Blocher Holdings, LLC filed its answer in propria persona, which is improper as a corporate entity cannot represent itself in propria persona.
3. The answers contained misleading information about the law firm "HAHN & HAHN LLP".

The judge has also noted that the defendants did not pay their court filing fees and did not file a request for fee waiver. Therefore, the answers are stricken for Kristie Blocher, Isaac Blocher, and Blocher Holdings, LLC's failure to pay their court fees.
