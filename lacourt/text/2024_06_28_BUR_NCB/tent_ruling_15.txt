  Date:  June 28, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion for a protective order
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiff Lena Mestrandrea (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that on August 22, 2023 at approximately 1 P.M. at or near 4041 Whitset
Avenue in Studio City, she was attacked and bit by Defendant Nancy Ming Ling
Chen’s (“Defendant”) German Shepherd Mix dog. 
Plaintiff alleges that she was jogging past Defendant on a public street
when Defendant was unable to control her dog and, without warning or
provocation, the dog viciously attacked and bit Plaintiff.  
The complaint, filed February 23, 2024,
alleges causes of action for: (1) negligence; and (2) strict liability. 
B.    
Motion on Calendar 
On May 14, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for
a protective order regarding Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, set one
(“SROG”).      
On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition brief. 
On June 20, 2024, Defendant filed a reply
brief. 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant moves for a protective
order regarding Plaintiff’s SROGs, arguing that Plaintiff propounded 94
interrogatories.  Defendant seeks an
order that: (a) Defendant need not respond to the 94 SROGs or (b) the number of
SROGs be limited and Defendant be given 30 days to provide responses.  
            Defendant argues that on April 15,
2024, Plaintiff propounded 46 FROGs, 94 SROGs, 33 RPDs, and 31 RFAs on
Defendant.  Defendant argues that this
action involves a non-complex, dog-bite personal injury case, such that excessive
discovery is not warranted.  Defendant
argues that the SROGs seek information about “defendant’s
ownership of the dog and its health condition (1-6, 25-27), other bites and
complaints (10-11 and 70), a muzzle (12-14), dog parks (15-16), groomers,
trainers, vets and training (19-24, 71, 86), boarding facilities (72), the
dog’s name, breed, the dog’s temperament and propensities (35-38, 57-65, 68-69,
82-85), remedial measures (87-88), and incident information (39-50, 89-90),”
which Defendant claims can better be addressed in a deposition; and the SROGs
seek information that is publicly available such as “suits regarding other
bites (7-8), complaints to animal control (9), suits involving any animal owned
by defendant (55-56) and government agency complaints/designations of
defendant’s dog as dangerous (73-77).”  (Mot. at p.5.) 
Defendant also argues that SROGs 17-18, 28-30, 78-81, and 91-94 seek
information that is duplicative of information sought in FROG Nos. 12.1, 4.1,
15.1, 16.1, and 16.3.  (Id.)  Defendant argues that SROG Nos. 31-34 and
51-54 regarding negligence are excessive in light of Plaintiff’s strict
liability claims, where no proof of negligence is required for a dog bite
case.  
            Defendant
states that in meet and confer efforts, Plaintiff agreed to withdraw SROG Nos.
17-18, 28-30, 78-81, and 91-94 as they were duplicative of Plaintiff’s FROG
requests, but Defendant argues that there are still 81 SROGs that remain.  (Mot. at p.6; Opp. at p.5.)  
             
             In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant
has failed to inform the Court that only 81 SROGs are at issue since Plaintiff
agreed to withdraw 18 SROGs.  Plaintiff
also argues that Defendant has not established good cause regarding why a
protective order is necessary since Defendant does not object that the SROGs
are relevant, only that they are excessive in number.  
            In Plaintiff’s counsel declaration in support of the excessive number
of SROGs (CCP § 2030.050), Plaintiff’s counsel states that the number of
discovery questions is warranted because “of the quantity, defendant parties,
and the nature of the issues presented in this case.”  (Shmeckpeper Decl., Ex. A [Elias Aydin Decl.,
¶8].)  A party may propound additional
SROGs for the reasons stated in section 2030.040(a): “(1) The complexity or the quantity of the existing and
potential issues in the particular case. (2) The financial burden on a party
entailed in conducting the discovery by oral deposition. (3) The expedience of
using this method of discovery to provide to the responding party the
opportunity to conduct an inquiry, investigation, or search of files or records
to supply the information sought.”  (CCP
§ 2030.040(a).)  It is unclear what
Plaintiff’ meant by “the quantity” and “defendant parties” when providing
reasons for the additional SROGs.  With
respect to the nature of the issues presented in this action, this is a
straightforward personal injury action involving a dog bite.  The Court finds that Plaintiff’s counsel’s
declaration in support of the additional SROGs does not adequately address why
additional discovery over the 35-interrogatory limit is necessary.  This is a ground to grant the motion.  
            Although
the parties agreed that 13 SROGs would be withdrawn, such that 81 SROGs remain,
the remaining 81 SROGs are still excessive in number.  Based on the Court’s review, the
additional SROGs are not justified by the alleged complexity of the litigation.
 As stated above, the action involves a
single dog bite, which does not present a complex issue.  Plaintiff should either: (a) pick 35 SROGs
that Plaintiff wants Defendant to respond to from those already propounded, or
(b) Plaintiff may redraft 35 SROGs from the SROGs propounded and re-propound
them on Defendant.  
            Defendant seeks sanctions against
Plaintiff and her counsel of record in the amount of $1,823.52 for bringing the
motion.  Plaintiff seeks $3,520 in
sanctions against Defendant for filing the opposition brief.  At this time, the Court declines to award
sanctions on this motion.  However, if
the parties continue to have discovery disputes, the Court would be inclined to
impose sanctions on future motions.     
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Defendant Nancy Ming Ling Chen’s motion for
a protective order regarding Special Interrogatories, set one is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to: (a) pick 35 SROGs
that Plaintiff wants Defendant to respond to and propound them on Defendant, or
(b) Plaintiff may redraft 35 SROGs and re-propound them on Defendant.  Defendant is ordered to respond to the SROGs
within 30 days of receipt of the requests from Plaintiff. 
No sanctions shall be awarded.  
Defendant shall provide notice of this
order.
