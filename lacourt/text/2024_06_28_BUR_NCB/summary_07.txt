And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to reconsider the judgment, vacate the judgment, or grant a new trial. The motion was filed by the defendant, Alternative Automotive Solutions, LLC, after the court issued a statement of decision and entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Tommy Sabre Buttner, in the amount of $28,095.

The defendant argued that the court improperly failed to allow an equitable setoff for the defendant's loss due to the fact that the vehicle was stolen and the defendant was an innocent recipient. The court found that the defendant did not have any legal or equitable right to retain any portion of the proceeds of the sale.

The defendant also argued that the court improperly found that the plaintiff was not damaged by making minor repairs to the vehicle during its use. The court found that the plaintiff did receive substantial value in the use of the vehicle and that the minor repairs were not a significant loss.

The defendant also argued that the court should have considered new evidence that the vehicle was recently sold for a lower price than what the defendant had offered the plaintiff. The court found that the new evidence was not sufficient to warrant a new trial.

The judge has denied the defendant's motion and has ordered that the defendant provide notice of the order.
