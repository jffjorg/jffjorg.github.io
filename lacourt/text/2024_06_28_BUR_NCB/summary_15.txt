And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge John Kralik regarding a motion for a protective order filed by Defendant Nancy Ming Ling Chen. The motion is related to the propounding of special interrogatories by Plaintiff Lena Mestrandrea. The Judge grants the motion, ordering Plaintiff to either pick 35 SROGs from the original propounded list or redraft and re-propound 35 new SROGs within 30 days. The Judge declines to award sanctions at this time, but warns that sanctions may be imposed if the parties continue to have discovery disputes. The case involves a dog bite attack on August 22, 2023, and the parties have been engaged in a dispute over the number of SROGs propounded by Plaintiff. The Judge finds that the additional SROGs are not justified by the complexity of the litigation, which is a straightforward personal injury action.
