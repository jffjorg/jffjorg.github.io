 [TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion to set aside default and default judgment and default
  judgment



 
BACKGROUND
A.    Allegations

Plaintiff
Highland Industrial Center, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges that on July 23, 2020, it
entered into a lease agreement with Defendants American Sunshine Transportation
Corp. (“American Sunshine”) and Ye Jin (“Jin”) for real property located at
1801 Highland Avenue, Unit D, Duarte, California 91010.  The lease agreement included monthly rent
amounts in increasing amounts from the years 2021 to 2024 and called for
Defendants to pay additional costs, including Common Area Maintenance charges,
taxes, and insurance.  During
negotiations and prior to signing the lease, Plaintiff alleges it relied on Jin’s
representation that the property would be used for distribution operations of a
third-party logistics provider and related office use.  
On August 1,
2020, Defendants moved into the subject property, but the property was not used
for the represented purpose, but instead was used to operate a large scale
and/or commercial cannabis cultivation operation.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants falsely
represented the use of the property and that it would not have leased the
property to Defendants had it known the true intentions.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ use of the
property for cannabis operations is unpermitted and Defendant lacks proper
licensures. 
The complaint,
filed March 30, 2021, alleges causes of action for: (1) fraud; (2) fraud by
omission; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of contract; (5) negligence; and
(6) damage to property. 
On April 29,
2021, Plaintiff filed Amendments to the Complaint naming Li Fan (Doe 1),
Krystal Williams (Doe 2), Weixian Lo (Doe 3), and Peng Gao (Doe 4). 
B.     Relevant
Background 
On May 14, 2021,
the default of American Sunshine was entered. 

On June 30,
2021, the defaults of Krystal Williams and Weixian Lo were entered. 
On July 19,
2021, the default of Ye Jin was entered. 
On July 21,
2021, the default of Peng Gao was entered. 

On August 27,
2021, the default of Li Fan was entered. 

On September 21,
2021, the Court noted at the Case Management Conference that all Defendants had
been defaulted.  Pursuant to Plaintiff’s
counsel request, Defendant Krystal Williams was dismissed with prejudice from the
action. 
On May 10, 2022,
Peng Gao was dismissed from the complaint without prejudice. 
On December 18,
2023, judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants American
Sunshine, Ye Jin, Li Fan, and Weixian Lo on the 1st to 6th
causes of action.  Plaintiff was awarded
$141,717.25 in damages, $31,798.99 in prejudgment interest, $3,307.17 in
attorney’s fees, and $1,142.25 in costs, for a total damages award of
$177,965.66 against American Sunshine and Ye Jin.  Plaintiff was awarded $44,746.00 in damages
and $10,040.12 in prejudgment interest, for a total damages award of $54,786.12
against Weixian Lo and Li Fan.  
C.     Motion
on Calendar 
On May 15, 2024,
Li Fan filed a motion to set aside the default and default judgment.  
            The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief. 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            Li Fan
requests judicial notice of Exhibit 1, which includes the Hague Service
Convention.  The request is granted.  
DISCUSSION
Li Fan moves to
set aside the default pursuant to CCP §§ 473(b) and 473.5.  A copy of the proposed answer is attached as
Exhibit 7 to the moving papers.  
Li Fan argues
that he is a Chinese citizen and thus cannot be sub-served or mailed documents
and the Hague Convention must be complied with. 
He argues that default was improperly entered against him as he was not
properly served, he did not have actual notice in time to defend the action,
and default judgment was entered against him as a result of his own surprise
and excusable neglect.  He also argues
that there are equitable considerations to set aside the default and default
judgment.  
The proof of
service of the summons and complaint, filed on June 30, 2021, regarding Li Fan
states that Li Fan was served by substituted service on May 25, 2021 at 12:05
p.m. by leaving the documents at his home located at 14401 Monte Vista Ave.,
Chino Hills, CA 91710 with Jane Doe (Asian, female, 5’4” height, age 30, 110
weight, and black hair).  The documents
were thereafter mailed on May 25, 2021. 
Service was completed by Brian Sevilla, a registered California process
server.  
In support of
the motion, Li Fan provides his declaration. 
He states that on April 25, 2021, without knowledge of the lawsuit, he
left the United States and returned to China and remained there for
approximately one year.  (Fan Decl.,
¶3.)  He states that on May 25, 2021,
Plaintiff attempted to serve him at the corporate address, but he did not
receive the documents because he was in China, he does not work at that
location or supervise persons there, and no one contacted him about the documents.  (Id., ¶4.)  He states that the Monte Vista Ave. address
is not his home or work address, but is the address of American Sunshine; he
states that while he is the owner and registered agent for service of process,
he did not go to that address.  (Id.,
¶¶5, 7.)  Li Fan states that he was not
the individual served in the proof of service (Jane Doe) and was not present at
the time of service since he was in China. 
(Id., ¶6.)  He provides a
copy of his ID card and business information in China, showing his Chinese
residence and company addresses.  (Id.,
¶7, Ex. 1 [Business License].)  He states
that he was born in China, is a citizen and resident of China, owns an
apartment in Beijing (Shangdi Xili Fengfangyuan, Building No. 1, Door 1, Unit
302, Haidian District, Beijing City, China), owns a company named Beijing Luyan
Puzhao Shengshi Technology Limited (Zhongguancun Kemao Market 5F 5A08, 18
Zhongguancun St., Haidian District in Beijing City, China), and his temporary
home address in the United States is 6931 Riverside Drive, Chino, CA 91710
which is confirmed by his driver’s license. 
(Id., ¶7, Ex. 6 [Driver’s License].)  He states that in March 2024, he received a
notice of involuntary lien from the County Recorder’s Offices indicating that
there was an abstract of judgment recorded on his home co-owned by him and his
wife at the Riverside Drive address, which has been his home since May
2021.  (Id., ¶8.)  Li Fan states that according to his passport,
he was in China from April 26, 2021 to May 2022, he did not receive legal
documents during this time, and he only became aware of the judgment in March
2024.  (Id., ¶10, Ex. 2 [Passport,
Visa].)  He states that he did not timely
respond to the complaint because he did not receive actual notice of
Plaintiff’s action until recently.  (Id.,
¶11.)  He states that he did not avoid service and the lack of notice was not caused by him; he states
he would have timely responded to the lawsuit if he had received notice in time.  (Id.) 
He states that once he received notice in late March 2024 of the
abstract filing, he contacted his attorney, Law Offices of Sam X.J. Wu, APC, to
investigate the basis of the abstract and the lawsuit and he retained them to
handle the case.  (Id., ¶12.)  
With
respect to the purported service on Li Fan at 14401
Monte Vista Ave., while he is the registered agent for service of process of
American Sunshine, this did not amount to service of Li Fan as an individual
defendant.  As stated in his declaration,
this was not his place of business nor as indicated in the proof of service,
his home.  He states that he was not
served with the documents after they were mailed to that location either.  
In addition, Li
Fan states in his declaration that the 14401 Monte Vista Ave. was not his place
of residence.  Instead, he provides his
California driver’s license showing that his home in California is located at
6931 Riverside Drive.  It does not appear
that service was effectuated at this address. 
According to the declaration of diligence attached to the proof of
service, service as only attempted at the 14401 Monte Vista Ave. location in
May 2021.  A certified translated copy of
his passport also indicates that he was not present in the United States at the
time of service on May 25, 2021.  
CCP § 413.10(c)
states: “Except as otherwise provided by statute, a
summons shall be served on a person: … (c) Outside the
United States, as provided in this chapter or as directed by the court
in which the action is pending, or, if the court before or after service finds
that the service is reasonably calculated to give actual notice, as prescribed
by the law of the place where the person is served or as directed by the
foreign authority in response to a letter rogatory. These rules are subject to the provisions of the Convention
on the ‘Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents’ in Civil or
Commercial Matters (Hague Service Convention).”  (Emphasis added.)  China is a
signatory to the Hague Convention.  
As Li
Fan is a Chinese citizen, Plaintiff was required to serve him pursuant to the
Hague Convention. (See Watts v. Crawford (1995) 10 Cal.4th 743.)  “Failure to
comply with the Hague Service Convention procedures voids the service even
though it was made in compliance with California law. [Citation.] This is true
even in cases where the defendant had actual notice of the lawsuit. [Citation.]”  (Kott v.
Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1136.)  Li Fan has provided his work and home
addresses in China, such that his addresses in China are known.  (Id. at 1136 [“The only method of service under California law which does
not require the transmission of documents abroad, and consequently does not
implicate the Hague Service Convention, is service of summons by publication
where the party's address remains unknown during the publication period despite
the exercise of reasonable diligence.”].) 

            Li
Fan also provides his residence in California. 
He states in his declaration that “If I had been served at my residence,
my wife would have given me the documents and I would have responded to the
lawsuit.”  (Fan Decl., ¶11.)  Thus, it appears that Li Fan would have also
been amenable to being served at his California residence.  Given that he is willing to submit to the
jurisdiction of the Court, the Court is inclined to grant him a hearing on the
merits of the case despite the improbability that he did not know of the case. 
The
Court notes that this motion is a motion to set aside the default and judgment,
not a motion to quash service of the summons and complaint.  As such, the Court will grant the motion to
vacate the default and judgment entered in this action against Li Fan.  By way of filing of this motion, Li Fan is
submitting to the Court’s jurisdiction and seeks to defend the action by filing
an answer.  
Based on the
declaration of Li Fan, the Court finds that there is substantive merit to
granting the motion pursuant to CCP §§ 473(b) and 473.5.   Finally, the policy of the law strongly
favors a hearing on the merits, which supports granting this motion.  (Thompson
v. Sutton (1942) 50 Cal.App.2d 272, 276.) 
The motion is granted.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
            Defendant Li Fan’s motion to set
aside the default and default judgment is granted.  Defendant is ordered to electronically file his
answer following the hearing on the matter.   
            A case management conference is set
for September 26, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  
Defendant
shall
provide notice of this order.
