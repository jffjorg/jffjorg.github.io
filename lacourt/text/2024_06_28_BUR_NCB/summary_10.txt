This is a tentative ruling by Judge John J. Kralik regarding a motion to deem facts admitted. The defendant, Shlomi Asiss, filed a motion on April 30, 2024, to have the requests for admissions (RFAs) served on the defendant Fabiano Iha deemed admitted. Asiss argues that the time to respond to the RFAs has expired and Iha did not request an extension. As of the filing of the motion, Asiss has not received responses from Iha. The judge grants Asiss's unopposed motion, deeming the RFAs admitted against Iha, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 2033.280. No sanctions were requested.
