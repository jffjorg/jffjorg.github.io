And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in favor of Li Fan's motion to set aside the default and default judgment. Li Fan, a Chinese citizen, was served with the summons and complaint on May 25, 2021, but did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit until March 2024. The judge finds that Li Fan did not have actual notice of the lawsuit at the time of service and that the service was not properly effectuated. The judge also notes that Li Fan would have been amenable to being served at his California residence, which is now his permanent address. The judge grants the motion to set aside the default and default judgment and orders Li Fan to electronically file his answer following the hearing on the matter. A case management conference is set for September 26, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
