And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Sandra D. Santopietro, granting her motion for summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication. The judge has found that the plaintiff, Michele A. Santopietro, has failed to raise a triable issue of material fact regarding the elements of fraud. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred by the 3-year statute of limitations for fraud.

The judge has reviewed the evidence presented by the parties and has found that the defendant's material facts are undisputed. The judge has also considered the plaintiff's opposition brief and has found it to be unpersuasive.

The judge has ordered the defendant to lodge a proposed judgment with the court and serve it on the plaintiff within 10 days, and to provide notice of this order.
