 Case Number:  23BBCV00567    Hearing Date:   June 28, 2024    Dept:  NCB The Court
has reviewed the petitions and finds the settlements fair and reasonable. The
parties have an agreement for attorney’s fees, which is attached to the
petitions, the Declaration of Counsel is sufficient to substantiate the work
done in connection with this matter, and the petition is properly verified by
Petitioner.  The Court is therefore
inclined to grant the petitions. 
 
Per CRC
Rule 7.952, Petitioner and the Claimant are required to attend the hearing on
the petition.  The Court will therefore
require attendance at the hearing in order to grant the petition.
