Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the depositions of the defendants. The parties have not agreed on a deposition date, and the plaintiff's counsel attended the depositions on May 20, 2024, and obtained certificates on non-appearance against the defendants. The defendants argue that the motion is moot since they have provided available dates for their depositions, but the court finds that the parties have not agreed on a deposition date and that the depositions have not gone forward.

The judge orders the parties to meet and confer regarding a mutually agreeable deposition date. The plaintiff shall initiate the meet and confer efforts, and the defense counsel shall respond with proposed dates of availability of their clients within 5 business days. If the parties are unable to find a mutually agreeable date, the plaintiff may notice the defendants' depositions within 10 days of the plaintiff's last meet and confer letter.

The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $950, representing the costs of the deposition appearances. The defendants' request for sanctions against the plaintiff is denied.
