And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant, Plumbers on Demand, to file a cross-complaint against the plaintiff, Deep Green Housing and Community Development. The defendant argues that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the underlying complaint by the plaintiff. The defendant seeks payment of $59,853.83 remaining from the same services rendered at the same properties during the same time frame. The judge finds that there is substantive merit to granting the motion and grants the motion for leave to file the cross-complaint. The defendant is ordered to electronically file a copy of the cross-complaint following the hearing on this matter and shall give notice of this order.
