And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the case and has determined that the parties must attend the hearing on the claim of exemption so that the court can determine the amount of the exemption, if any. The judge notes that the defendant has the burden of proof to show that she is entitled to a claim of exemption. The judge has not received the defendant's claim of exemption and therefore cannot determine its validity at this time. The parties are ordered to attend the hearing to present evidence and allow the court to make a determination on the claim of exemption.
