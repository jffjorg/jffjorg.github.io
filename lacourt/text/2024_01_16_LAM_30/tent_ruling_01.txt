Lisitsa
vs. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, et. al., Case No. 22STCV40100
Tentative Ruling
re:  Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees 
Plaintiff Yevgeniya Lisitsa (Plaintiff) moves for an
award of attorney’s fees and costs against Defendant Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC (Defendant). The Court awards attorney’s fees in the amount of
$21,570, and costs in the amount of $913.56.
“[A]s a general rule, attorney fees
are not recoverable as costs unless they are authorized by statute or
agreement.” (People ex rel. Dept. of
Corporations v. Speedee Oil Change Systems, Inc. (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
424, 429.)  
In a lemon law action, costs, and expenses,
including attorney fees, may be recovered by a prevailing buyer under the
Song-Beverly Act. (See Civ. Code, §§ 1790, et seq.) Civ. Code § 1794,
subd. (d) provides,
If the buyer prevails
in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to
recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs
and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.
The
attorney bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).) This burden requires competent evidence as
to the nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) “Testimony of an
attorney as to the number of hours worked on a particular case is sufficient
evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed
time records.” (Ibid.)  
A
plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs,
expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred. (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d
677, 682.) “In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of
work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the
specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier
Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) 
            In determining whether the requested
attorney’s fees are “reasonable,” the Court’s “first step involves the lodestar
figure—a calculation based on the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the lawyer’s hourly rate. The lodestar figure may then be
adjusted, based on consideration of facts specific to the case, in order to fix
the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp.
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774 [internal citations omitted].) In determining
whether to adjust the lodestar figure, the Court may consider the nature and
difficulty of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required
and employed to handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure,
and other circumstances in the case. (EnPalm
LLC v. Teitler (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)
 
The parties’ settlement provides that Defendant shall pay Plaintiff’s
reasonably incurred attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses. (Kohen Decl. ¶ 11.) Plaintiff
requests a base fee award of $24,195, based on 41.2 hours billed at an hourly
rate of $525 for counsel Issac Kohen, and 9 hours billed at an hourly rate of
$285 for counsel Tamara R. Imber. (Kohen Decl. ¶ 37, Ex. 1 [30].) Defendant
challenges both the requested hourly rate and the number of hours claimed.
 
Fee rates are recoverable if they
are “within the range of reasonable rates charged by and judicially awarded
comparable attorneys for comparable work.” (Children’s Hospital &
Medical Center v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740, 783.) In calculating the
lodestar rate, “the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with
the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the
attorney requesting fees [Citation], the difficulty or complexity of the
litigation to which that skill was applied [Citations], and affidavits from
other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate
determinations in other cases. [Citation.]” (569
East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437.)
 
The Court
finds that counsel’s hourly rate of $525 is reasonable. While Defendant argues
that there is no evidence that counsel has actually billed at this rate, this
point is irrelevant: “The
reasonable market value of the attorney's services is the measure of a
reasonable hourly rate. [Citations.] This standard applies regardless of
whether the attorneys claiming fees charge nothing for their services, charge
at below-market or discounted rates, represent the client on a straight
contingent fee basis, or are in-house counsel. [Citations.]’” (Center For Biological Diversity v. County of
San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 619.) 
 
Defendant argues that a number of
counsel’s billing entries are excessive, pointing to 1.4 hours billed by
counsel for client intake; 3.8 hours billed for research into TSBs, customer
complaints, and recalls relating to Plaintiffs’ vehicle; 1.8 hours to draft the
Complaint; 4.6 hours to draft discovery requests (RFAs, Special
Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories, and Requests for Production); and 13
hours billed in connection with the current motion. (Kohen Decl., Ex. 1.)
Defendant also argues that counsel has billed excessive amounts to review and
write short emails or other simple documents.
 
            The Court
agrees that the 13 hours billed for this motion are excessive, and so reduces
that amount. The Court finds that the requested fees are otherwise reasonable,
and awards a lodestar figure of $21,570.
 
Plaintiff requests a lodestar
multiplier of 1.1x. While the lodestar reflects the basic fee for comparable
legal services in the community, it may be adjusted based on various factors,
including “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the
skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent
nature of the fee award” and (4) the success achieved. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)
 
The Court declines to award a
multiplier. This straightforward lemon law case did not involve any
particularly novel or complex issues, and the other relevant factors also do
not warrant a multiplier.
 
Defendant does not challenge the
costs requested by Plaintiff, and so those costs are awarded in the amount of $913.56.
