And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Burbank has demurred to the Complaint filed by Nicholas Gutierrez, alleging that the City's method of at-large elections for its City Council violates the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA) and the Equal Protection Clause of the California Constitution. The Judge has reviewed the Complaint and has sustained the demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead his CVRA cause of action. Specifically, the Plaintiff has not specified which protected class has been harmed by the City's alleged voter dilution. The Judge has also sustained the demurrer as to the Plaintiff's second cause of action, alleging a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, as the Plaintiff has presented no argument regarding this claim.
