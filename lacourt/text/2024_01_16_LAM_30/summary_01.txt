And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs. The plaintiff, Yevgeniya Lisitsa, seeks to recover $21,570 in attorney's fees and $913.56 in costs from the defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The defendant challenges the reasonableness of the plaintiff's attorney's fees, citing excessive billing entries and hourly rates.

The judge finds that the defendant's challenges to the hourly rate are not relevant, as the reasonable market value of the attorney's services is the measure of a reasonable hourly rate. The judge also finds that the 13 hours billed for the current motion are excessive and reduces that amount.

The judge awards a lodestar figure of $21,570, which represents the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community. The judge declines to award a multiplier, as the case did not involve any particularly novel or complex issues.

The judge awards costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $913.56, as the defendant does not challenge those costs. Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the plaintiff, awarding attorney's fees and costs in the amounts requested.
