Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiffs' motions for summary adjudication of the claims for breach of fiduciary duty and accounting. The Judge has also denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, motion for summary adjudication. The Judge has further denied Plaintiffs' motion for sanctions.

The Judge found that there were triable issues of fact as to whether Defendants misrepresented their intent to develop the properties and as to when Plaintiffs knew or should have known of their claims. The Judge also found that Plaintiffs' claims for fraud were not barred by the statute of limitations.

The Judge noted that the discovery process had been used improperly, but did not impose sanctions as the Defendants had provided supplemental responses to Plaintiffs' requests for production.

The Judge's ruling will be considered final unless a party submits written objections by the hearing date.
