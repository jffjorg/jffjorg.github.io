And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to bifurcate the trial. The defendant had argued that bifurcation was necessary to avoid prejudice and promote efficiency, as the damages portion of the trial would involve complex expert testimony and emotional issues. However, the judge found that the defendant's motion was insufficient because it lacked supporting evidence or declarations to back up its claims. The judge noted that the defendant failed to provide a factual basis for its arguments and relied on conclusory statements. As a result, the motion to bifurcate is denied.
