And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of continuing the trial by three months and reopening discovery. The defendants, Jack Abraov, requested this continuance to allow them to depose Dr. David K. Wellisch and arrange an independent mental examination of Mr. Suleminian. The judge found that a limited continuance and reopening of discovery is necessary to allow the defendants to complete discovery and gather important testimony regarding Mr. Suleminian's emotional and mental health, which is an issue pertinent to the case. The judge also considered the factors listed in California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1332, including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance. The judge notes that public policy favoring disposition on the merits outweighs the competing policy favoring judicial efficiency. The parties are requested to meet and confer regarding their availability for a new trial date in June or July 2025.
