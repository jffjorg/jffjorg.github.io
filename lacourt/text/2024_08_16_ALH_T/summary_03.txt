And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for summary judgment is denied, and the motion for summary adjudication is granted as to the plaintiff's third cause of action for negligence. The case involves a trip and fall incident on a sidewalk with a concrete cover installed by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). The plaintiff, Armenuhi Aharonyan, alleges that the City of Los Angeles and LADWP are responsible for the dangerous condition of the sidewalk. The defendants argue that the alleged defect is trivial as a matter of law, open and obvious, and that they did not have actual or constructive notice of the defect. The plaintiff argues that the defect is not trivial, and that the defendants had notice of the defect. The judge finds that the defendants have not met their burden to show that the alleged defect is trivial as a matter of law, and that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether the defect is open and obvious and whether the defendants had notice of the defect. The judge also grants summary adjudication as to the plaintiff's third cause of action for negligence, finding that the plaintiff has not alleged a valid statutory basis for liability.
