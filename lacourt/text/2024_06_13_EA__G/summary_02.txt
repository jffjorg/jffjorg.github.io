And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Girl Scouts USA's motion to quash service of summons. The court finds that Doe failed to provide evidence of jurisdictional facts to establish jurisdiction over Girl Scouts USA. The court rejects Doe's argument that Girl Scouts USA has general jurisdiction over Girl Scouts LA, as the court finds no evidence of continuous and systematic contacts. The court also rejects Doe's argument that Girl Scouts LA's contacts with California can be imputed to Girl Scouts USA through the alter ego or agency theory. Finally, the court denies Doe's request for leave to amend, as Doe failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish jurisdiction over Girl Scouts USA.
