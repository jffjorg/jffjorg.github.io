  Case Number:  23PSCV01731    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s Application for Default
Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s Application for
Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action arising from a credit card agreement. Plaintiff JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (Chase Bank) alleges Defendant Hung Sy is the obligor of a
credit card account and currently owes an outstanding balance of $25,917.55.
On June
9, 2023, Chase Bank filed a complaint against Sy, alleging the following causes
of action: (1) open book account and (2) account stated. On August 15, 2023,
Chase Bank’s process server served Sy with substitute service in El Monte.
On May
21, 2024, the Court entered default against Sy after Sy failed to timely file
an answer. On the same day, Chase Bank submitted the present application for
default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for June 13, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Chase
Bank seeks default judgment against Sy in the total amount of $25,917.55 in
damages. Because the Court finds Chase Bank has submitted sufficient evidence,
the Court GRANTS their application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Chase
Bank’s application for default judgment is GRANTED.
