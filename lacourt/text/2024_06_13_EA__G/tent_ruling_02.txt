 Case Number:  23PSCV03011    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Girl Scouts of the United States of America’s
Motion to Quash Service of Summons
Respondent: Plaintiff Jane JB
Doe
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant Girl Scouts of the United States of
America’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This is an action for sexual
abuse and assault. In 2019, Plaintiff Jane JB Doe joined Troop 78394 of
Defendant Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles (Girl Scouts LA). During Doe’s
time with Troop 78394, Brittany Boyd served as a leader for the teenage girls.
Doe alleges Boyd showed a special interest in Doe by repeatedly sitting with
Doe, touching Doe’s thighs, hugging Doe, giving Doe gifts, and repeatedly
messaging Doe. From January to March 2023, Doe alleges Boyd sexually assaulted
Doe on multiple occasions before troop meetings. Doe also alleges Boyd took Doe
to a hotel in February 2023 and forced Doe to participate in sexual activities.
In March 2023, Doe told Doe’s parents about Boyd’s alleged sexual assaults when
they discovered text messages from Boyd on Doe’s phone. After Doe’s parents
reported the incident to law enforcement, law enforcement had Doe call Boyd
while they monitored the conversation in which Boyd allegedly admitted to sexual
abuse. Boyd was then arrested.
On October 2, 2023, Doe,
through guardian ad litem Jessica Corona, filed a complaint against Defendant
Girl Scouts of the United States of America (Girl Scouts USA), erroneously
named as “Girl Scouts of America,” and Does 1-100, alleging the following
causes of action: (1) negligence, (2) negligent supervision, (3) sexual
battery, and (4) sexual harassment.
On February 16, 2024, Doe
filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against Girl Scouts USA, Girl Scouts LA,
and Does 1-100, alleging the same causes of action.
On March 28, 2024, Girl
Scouts USA filed the present motion.
On April 15, 2024, Doe filed
a motion to compel.
A hearing on the present
motion and a case management conference are set for June 13, 2024. A hearing on
Doe’s motion to compel is also set for July 2, 2024.
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL
NOTICE
Doe requests the Court take
judicial notice of Girl Scouts USA’s 2023 Blue Book pursuant to Evidence Code
section 452, subdivision (h). Pursuant to Evidence Code section 452,
subdivision (h), the Court may take judicial notice of any “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” But while the Court may take judicial notice of the
Blue Book’s existence, the Court may not take judicial notice of the
truthfulness of any of the facts or propositions asserted in that document. (See
LG Chem, Ltd. v. Superior Court of San Diego County (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th
348, 362, fn. 7 [declining to take judicial notice of a company website’s
contents in determining personal jurisdiction].)
Thus, the Court GRANTS Doe’s
request as to the 2023 Blue Book’s existence but declines to take judicial notice
of the truthfulness of facts or propositions contained within.
ANALYSIS
Girl
Scouts USA moves to quash Doe’s service of summons on the grounds that the Court
lacks personal jurisdiction. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS Girl Scouts USA’s
motion.
Legal
Standard
“A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a
notice of motion . . . [t]o quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd.
(a)(1).)
“When
a nonresident defendant challenges personal jurisdiction the burden shifts to
the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of the¿evidence that all
necessary jurisdictional criteria are met.” (Jewish Defense Organization,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 1045, 1054-1055, quoting Ziller
Electronics Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222,
1232-1233 (Ziller).) A plaintiff meets this burden by providing
“competent evidence in affidavits and authenticated documentary evidence.” (Id.,
at p. 1055, quoting Ziller, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p.
1232-1233.)
“Personal
jurisdiction may be either general or specific.” (Vons Companies, Inc. v.
Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 445 (Vons Companies).) “A
nonresident defendant may be subject to the¿general¿jurisdiction of the
forum if his or her contacts in the forum state are ‘substantial . . .¿
continuous and systematic.’” (Ibid, quoting Perkins v. Benguet
Consol. Mining Co. (1952) 342 U.S. 437, 445-446.) “In that situation, the
cause of action need not be related to the defendant's contacts.” (Thomson
v. Anderson (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 258, 266.) “Such a defendant's contacts
with the forum are so wide-ranging that they take the place of physical
presence in the forum as a basis for jurisdiction.” (Vons Companies, supra,
14 Cal.4th at p. 446.)
“Specific
jurisdiction results when the defendant's contacts with the forum state, though
not enough to subject the defendant to the general jurisdiction of the forum,
are sufficient to subject the defendant to suit in the forum on a cause of
action related to or arising out of those contacts.” (Aquila, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 556, 569-570, quoting Sonora
Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 536 (Sonora
Diamond).) “Specific jurisdiction exists if: (1) the defendant has
purposefully availed itself of forum benefits with respect to the matter in
controversy; (2) the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant's
contacts with the forum; and (3) the assertion of jurisdiction would comport
with fair play and substantial justice.” (Id., at p. 570, quoting Sonora
Diamond, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 536.) “[C]ourts must
additionally evaluate ‘the burden on the defendant of appearing in the forum,
the forum state's interest in adjudicating the claim, the plaintiff's interest
in convenient and effective relief within the forum, judicial economy, and the
shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive
social policies.’” (Id., quoting Vons Companies, supra, 14
Cal.4th at p. 447-448.)
Discussion
As
an initial matter, Doe argues Girl Scouts USA’s motion to quash should be
denied as untimely as it is being heard more than thirty days after the notice
of motion on March 28, 2024. (Opp., e.p., 2:9-13.) Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 418.10, subdivision (b), a notice for a motion to quash must “designate,
as the time for making the motion, a date not more than 30 days after filing of
the notice.” But failure to do so does not provide the Court with grounds to deny
the motion. (Preciado v. Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (2023)
87 Cal.App.5th 964, 969, fn. 4.) Thus, this argument is rejected as meritless
and the Court now considers whether it has general or specific personal
jurisdiction over Girl Scouts USA.
General Jurisdiction
In
this case, Doe argues the Court has general jurisdiction over Girl Scouts USA
because they have substantial, continuous, and systematic contact with
California. (Opp., e.p. 6:5-6.) While Doe concedes a California court has not
examined a similar scenario involving the exercise of personal jurisdiction over
Girl Scouts USA, Doe argues the Court should follow the example of Steir v.
Girl Scouts of USA (D.N.H. 2002) 218 F.Supp.2d 58 (Steir).
In Steir,
a federal district court found Girl Scouts USA had continuous and systematic
contacts with New Hampshire because the local chapter at issue in that case existed
as an arm of Girl Scouts USA, carried out Girl Scouts USA’s goals and purposes,
and could not exist without Girl Scouts USA’s approval as Girl Scouts USA
exercised “considerable control over regional councils.” (Id., at p. 64.)
But here, Doe fails to carry the evidentiary burden of establishing Girl Scouts
USA exercises the same level of control over Girl Scouts LA. While Doe requested
the Court take judicial notice of Girl Scouts USA’s policies and procedures
contained within the 2023 Blue Book, the Court is unable to do so for the
reasons noted above. And, to the extent Doe relies on factual background allegations
in Doe’s FAC (Opp., e.p. 7:15-22), the allegations of the unverified pleadings
alone are insufficient to defeat a challenge to personal jurisdiction as “plaintiff
must support its allegations with ‘competent evidence of jurisdictional facts.’”
(See Rivelli v. Hemm (2021) 67 Cal.App.5th 380, 393 (Rivelli),
quoting In Re Automobile Antitrust Cases I & II (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 100, 110 (Automobile Cases).)
In
a declaration, Doe’s guardian ad litem, Jessica Corona, states Doe was a member
of Troop 78394 and Girl Scouts USA.
(Corona Decl., ¶ 6.) Corona states Doe had to sign up through Girl Scouts USA’s
website for some troop activities including selling Girl Scout cookies and
purchasing merchandise. (Corona Decl., ¶ 7.) Corona also states all troop
activities and documents that were provided had Girl Scouts USA’s emblem and insignia.
(Corona Decl., ¶ 8.) Last, Corona states at least one of the troop leaders
attended annual meetings of the “national organization.” (Corona Decl., ¶ 9.)
Nevertheless, the court finds
these facts do not establish how Girl Scouts USA exercised control over Troop
78394 or Girl Scouts LA. Instead, the facts merely suggest an affiliation which
is insufficient to establish continuous and systematic contacts. For example,
in Steir, the court noted that merely receiving revenue from cookie and
uniform sales in New Hampshire would be insufficient to establish general
jurisdiction and instead focused on the nature of Girl Scouts USA’s control
over the local Hew Hampshire chapter. (Steir, supra, 218
F.Supp.2d at p. 64.)
Doe also argues Girl Scouts
LA’s contacts with California can be imputed to Girl Scouts USA through the
alter ego or agency theory. (Opp., e.p. 8:4-19.) To establish the existence of
an alter ego, “there must be such a unity of interest and ownership between the
corporation and its equitable owner that the separate personalities of the
corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist.” (Sonora Diamond,
supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 538.) And “there must be an inequitable
result if the acts in question are treated as those of the corporation alone.”
(Ibid.) Furthermore, a subsidiary may be treated as the agent of the
parent corporation if the parent “exercised pervasive and continuous control
over [the subsidiary’s] day-to-day operations that went beyond the normal
parent-subsidiary relationship.” (BBA Aviation PLC v. Superior Court (2010)
190 Cal.App.4th 421, 433.) Here, as noted above, Doe failed to provide any
evidence establishing Girl Scouts USA’s ownership or control over Girl Scouts
LA.
Accordingly, the court finds Doe
failed to establish a basis for the Court to exercise general jurisdiction over
Girl Scouts USA.
Specific Jurisdiction
Doe next contends the Court
has specific jurisdiction over Girl Scouts USA because they purposefully
availed themselves of the laws of California. (Opp., e.p. 9:13-16.) But like
Doe’s general jurisdiction argument, this argument also relies on the rejected
request for judicial notice and unverified allegations of the FAC as opposed to
admissible and competent evidence. Because Doe failed to provide evidence that
establishes Girl Scouts USA availed itself of California law and aimed its
conduct at the state, Doe cannot establish specific jurisdiction.
Continuance for Leave
to Amend
Last, Doe maintains the Court
should grant leave to amend for Doe to allege additional jurisdictional facts.
(Opp., e.p. 11:17-19.) The court determines, however, that leave to amend would
be futile as Doe can only defeat Girl Scouts USA’s motion with evidence of
jurisdictional facts, not unverified pleadings. (See Rivelli, supra, 67 Cal.App.5th at p. 393.) The court
also notes that Doe did not request a continuance to conduct further
jurisdictional discovery. (See Automobile Cases, supra,
135 Cal.App.4th at p. 127.) As such, Doe failed to provide sufficient evidence
to establish the Court has personal jurisdiction over Girl Scouts USA.  Therefore, the motion by Girl Scouts USA is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Girl
Scouts USA’s motion to quash Doe’s service of summons is GRANTED.
