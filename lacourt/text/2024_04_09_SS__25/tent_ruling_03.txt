The  Court granted Plaintiff’s motion and vacated the dismissal on June 22, 2022.   On August 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed  a joint stipulation between itself and Defendant Hernandez indicating that the  parties had reached a settlement in the case for $5,172.70 and requested the  case dismissed without prejudice.   On August 18, 2022, the Court  ordered the dismissal of the case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation  for Dismissal with the Court retaining jurisdiction pursuant CCP § 664.6.    On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff  filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment Pursuant to CCP  § 664.6.    No opposition has been filed.    MOVING PARTY  POSITION   Plaintiff prays for the Court to set aside  the dismissal entered on August 18, 2022, and enter judgment against Defendant  Hernandez in the sum of $4,721.51 for the following: the unpaid principal  amount of $2,972.70 plus $1,523.81 in interest at the rate of 10 percent per  annum from December 14, 2018, and $225.00 in court cost. Plaintiff states  that Hernandez has failed to make her monthly payments per the stipulation  necessitating the instant motion.   OPPOSITION               No  opposition has been filed.    REPLY               No reply  has been filed.    ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard Code of Civil Procedure section  664.6 (“CCP § 664.6”) states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a  writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally  before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon  motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If  requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to  enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) For  purposes of the statute, “a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any  of the following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The party. (2) ¶ An attorney  who represents the party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b) [emphasis  added].)    “On a motion to enforce, the court  must determine whether the settlement agreement is valid and binding.  [Citation.] The court assesses whether the material terms of the settlement  were reasonably well-defined and certain, and whether the parties expressly  acknowledged that they understood and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In  re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 911.]” (Estate of  Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952.)    The court may interpret the terms and conditions of a  settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the  court may not create material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding  what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed upon (Weddington  Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810).   II.        Discussion    A.  Retention of Jurisdiction              “‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special  proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’ (Conservatorship  of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867.) ‘If requested by the  parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties  to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of  Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) “‘Because of its summary  nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is  prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement  agreement.’” (Id. (quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.  Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)   “A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction  under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the  Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement  of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of  the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the  parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally  before the court.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th  429, 440).) “The ‘request must be express, not implied from other language, and  it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen, supra,  97 Cal.App.4th at 440).)   Here,  the parties signed a stipulation containing the parties’ agreement for the  Court to retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce  the terms of the Stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default. (08-16-22  Stipulation.) Before dismissing the action, the parties signed the Stipulation  and submitted it to the Court. (Id.  at p. 5.) On August 18, 2022, the Court dismissed the entire case without  prejudice, according to the Stipulation, and expressly stated that it “shall  retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” (08-18-22 Order) Therefore, the  Court finds that the Stipulation complies with the requirements under CCP §  664.6, and it has retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the  parties’ Stipulation in this action.   B.  Entry of Judgment    The Settlement  Agreement, filed on August 16, 2022, provides that the parties agreed to settle  the matter for a principal sum of $5,172.70, with Hernandez agreeing to pay a monthly  installment of $100.00 from August 30, 2021, to July 30, 2023, which would  increase to $150.00 per month from August 30, 2023, to July 30, 2024. (Brian P.  Tapper Decl. ¶¶ 2, 4, Exh. A.) Thereafter, Hernandez would make monthly  payments of $200.00 per month from August 30, 2024, to November 30, 2024, and make  a final payment of $172.70 by or before December 30, 2024. (Id.) Plaintiff  provides the Court with the declaration of its counsel who avers that Hernandez  made payments totaling $2,200.00, however to date Hernandez has not made any  payments per the Agreement on or after August 30, 2023. (Id. ¶ 5.) Accordingly,  due to Hernandez’s failure to comply with the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff  requested that a judgment be entered against Hernandez. (Id. ¶ 6.) The Court  finds the Settlement Agreement valid and enforceable under CCP § 664.6. Here,  Plaintiff provides evidence that Hernandez has not made payments per the  agreement. (Id. ¶ 5.)  Therefore, since a valid and signed settlement agreement between the parties  has been breached, and the Court retains jurisdiction to enter judgment, the  motion satisfies the requirements under CCP § 664.6. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and  Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Dismissal entered on August 18, 2022, is vacated.  Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Hernandez in the amount of $4,721.51 for  the following: the unpaid principal amount of $2,972.70 plus  $1,523.81 in interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum from December 14,  2018, and $225.00 in court costs.   III.       Conclusion               Plaintiff Harco National Insurance Company’s Motion to  Vacate the Dismissal Entered on 08/18/2022 is GRANTED.   Judgment Pursuant to Written Stipulation (CCP 664.6) is  entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant Marie Nicole Hernandez in the amount of $4,721.51.   Moving party is ordered to give  notice.
