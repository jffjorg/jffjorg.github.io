On September 13,  2023, the Court instructed Silvia to file a revised separate statement that  reflects the most recent responses served by Defendants, explaining why these  responses remained incomplete and permitted no other papers. On September 26,  2023, Silvia filed his amended separate statement. The Court granted Silvia’s motion  and ordered Sharaf to pay $1,461.65 in monetary sanctions.    On March 07, 2024, Silvia amended  Plaintiff’s complaint to name PSDS Investment Corporation (“PSDS”) for Doe 1 as  a Defendant to the action.    On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff Thomas  filed the instant Motion to Compel  Responses to Request for Production for Documents Propounded on Defendant;  Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories Set One Propounded on  Defendant; and Requests for Monetary Sanctions.    Defendant files in opposition to the motion. Thomas files in reply.    MOVING PARTY  POSITION               Thomas  prays for the Court to issue an order compelling Defendant to serve responses  to both Thomas’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production  of Documents Set One under CCP §§ 2030.290(b) and 2031.300(b). Thomas asserts  that Defendant and his counsel have failed to timely respond to his discovery  requests thereby necessitating the motions. Thomas additionally requests that the  Court award $474.77 in monetary sanctions for each motion under CCP §§  2030.290(c) and 2031.300(c) for the sum of one hour spent by Thomas’s counsel  preparing the instant motions at a rate of $400.00 per hour plus $74.77 in  court costs.    OPPOSITION               In  opposition, Sharaf argues that the motions should be denied because Thomas has  failed to meet the statutory elements by not providing a meet and confer  declaration under section 2016.040. Sharaf further asserts that he has complied  with Thomas’s document requests without objection and that sanctions are  unjustified considering the miscommunication between the parties regarding the  meet and conferral.       REPLY               In reply, Plaintiff  asserts that the discovery responses are incomplete and that there is no meet  and confer requirement when no responses have been served. Plaintiff  specifically points out that responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories  Nos. 1-6 and Plaintiff’s RFPs Nos. 1 and 2 are incomplete, ambiguous, and  evasive.  Plaintiff also requests further  sanctions in the amount of $1,000 for each motion for additional attorney time  spent reviewing the late discovery responses and preparing its reply.   ANALYSIS   I.          Legal  Standard A party must respond to  interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after  service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,  subd. (a).) If a party to whom interrogatories or requests for production of  documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party  may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 2030.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also  waives the right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or  work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ.  Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel  responses to interrogatories or production of documents other than the cut-off  on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §§  2024.020, subd. (a), 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) No meet and confer  efforts are required before filing a motion to compel responses to the  discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko  Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148  Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)    II.        Discussion    A.                 Motion Compelling Responses to Thomas’s Special Interrogatories  and Request for Production               Plaintiff  Thomas moves to compel Defendant to serve responses to Thomas’s Special Interrogatories, Set One  and Request for Production, Set One. In opposition, Sharaf claims that  Thomas’s motion should be denied as Thomas has not complied with statutory  elements under 2031.310 and that Sharaf has already provided responses to  Thomas’s discovery request. Noting that the motions essentially provide the same  facts, the Court will address both motions together in this order.                As a preliminary matter, to the extent Defendant argues  the Motion must be denied because Thomas did not properly meet and confer, the  Court is not persuaded. As noted above, no meet and confer efforts are  required before filing a motion to compel initial responses. Sharaf has  not cited any legal authority demonstrating otherwise. Moreover, Thomas  does provide a meet and conferral declaration through Latoya S. Reed who states  that she wrote an email correspondence to defense counsel on February 26, 2024.  (Latoya S. Reed, Esq. ¶ 2; Exh B.) Ms. Reed further states that Defense counsel  responded that he sent responses. (Id.) Thus, the Court moves now to the  merits of the motion.                Thomas  provides his own sworn declaration, in which he states that on January 19,  2024, he served both his Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request for  Production, Set One, on Defendant. (Manley Thomas Decl. ¶ 3; Exh A.) Thomas  declares that he and other Plaintiffs only received miscellaneous documents with  a letter from defense counsel dated February 23, 2024, three days past the due  date for responses. (Id. ¶ 5; Exh. C) As of March 11, 2024, Thomas avers  that he has yet to receive responses to his discovery requests. (Id. ¶  4.)                In  opposition, Sharaf provides the declaration of his counsel who states that on  March 26, 2024, he served Defendant’s responses to all of Thomas’s discovery  requests. (Hamid Soleimanian Decl. ¶ 2.; Exh. A.)    The  Court notes that the responses are verified, however, they are untimely. Responses are to be served 30 days after personal  service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) Here, responses should have  been served by February 19, 2024, the latest being March 08, 2024, noting  Thomas’s extension. Sharaf’s counsel did not serve his verified responses until  March 26, 2024.    Here, the Court finds that although Defendant has provided  the requested responses since Plaintiff’s motions were filed, Plaintiff has  submitted support through its reply and separate statements indicating their  insufficiency.  A motion to compel may be  heard even if tardy responses are served after the motion is filed. (7.  [8:1136] Motion to Compel Answers:, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch.  8F-7).  Ordinarily, if there is any  issue regarding the sufficiency of the responses, then such issue must be  addressed via a motion to compel further responses. However, based  on Plaintiff’s moving papers, Defendants’ responses to the Special  Interrogatories and Request for Production remain insufficient, and the Court  may compel further answers.  As the court  in Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants  noted “If the propounding party proceeds with the motion, …the trial court has  the discretion to rule on the motion. The trial court might compel responses  without objection if it finds no legally valid responses have been provided to  one or more interrogatories; it might deny the motion to compel responses as  essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions; it  might treat the motion as one under section 2030.300 and either determine that  further answers are required,[141 or order the propounding party to "meet  and confer" (§ 2030.300, subd. (b)) and file a separate statement (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1020(a)(2), (c)); or it might take the motion off  calendar, thereby requiring the propounding party to file a motion under  section 2030.300.”  (148 Cal.App.4th at  pp. 408-409.)     Thus, Plaintiff’s requests to compel responses to the  interrogatories and request for production are GRANTED.     B.        Sanctions              The Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(c) provides  in relevant part that,     “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under [Section  2023.010] against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”   (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2030.290(c).) CCP section 2031.300(c) similarly provides the same  remedy when a party fails to respond to a demand for production of documents. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(c).) A court may still award sanctions for the failure to  timely respond to discovery requests despite an opposing parties’ attempt to  serve tardy responses after the motion has been filed Sinaiko Healthcare  Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra, 148 CA4th at  410-411.)   Here, Plaintiff requests sanctions for each motion in the  amount of $474.00 for one hour of attorney time preparing at $400 per hour,  plus $74.77 for the filing fees.  In  addition, in Plaintiff’s reply, he requests an additional $1,000 in sanctions for  each motion for 2.5 hours of attorney time representing two hours in reviewing  the discovery served and filing the reply and accompanying separate statements plus  an anticipated 0.5 hours for preparation and appearance for the hearing.  The Court finds the hourly rate to be  reasonable but does not find that time spent reviewing the responses should be  included for sanctions.  As such, the  Court awards a total of 2.5 hours of attorney time plus costs for each motion  in the amount of $1,074.77.     III.       Conclusion                           Plaintiff Manley Thomas’s Motion to Compel Responses to  Request for Production for Documents Propounded on Defendant is GRANTED.   Plaintiff Thomas’ Motion to Compel Responses to Special  Interrogatories Set One Propounded on Defendant is GRANTED.                Plaintiff Thomas' Motion for Sanctions is GRANTED,  in part, in the amount of $1,074.77 for each motion.    DEFENDANT IS ORDERED TO RESPOND TO PLAINTIFF MANLEY THOMAS' REQUEST  FOR PRODUCTION NO. 1 AND 2 WITH CODE COMPLIANT, OBJECTION-FREE VERIFIED  RESPONSES WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS FROM NOTICE OF THIS COURT’S ORDER.    DEFENDANT IS ORDERED TO RESPOND TO PLAINTIFF MANLEY THOMAS' SPECIAL  INTERROGATORIES NO. 1-6 WITH CODE COMPLIANT, OBJECTION-FREE VERIFIED RESPONSES  WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS FROM NOTICE OF THIS COURT’S ORDER.    DEFENDANT IS ADDITIONALLY ORDERED TO PAY PLAINTIFF MANELY THOMAS SANCTIONS  IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,074.77 WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM NOTICE OF THIS COURT’S ORDER.   Moving party is ordered to give  notice.
