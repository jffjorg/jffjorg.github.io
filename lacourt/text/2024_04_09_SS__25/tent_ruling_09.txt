BACKGROUND
 
On June 04, 2020, Plaintiff State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance (“Plaintiff”) filed an automobile subrogation
action against Defendants Andrew S. Carpio (“Carpio”) and Agatha Perez
(“Perez”) (collectively “Defendants”). 
 
Defendant Perez filed her Answer to
the Complaint on November 18, 2020. Defendant Carpio filed his Answer on August
09, 2021. 
 
On June 07, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
notice that a conditional settlement agreement had been reached among the
parties.
 
On June 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
joint stipulation between itself and Defendant Carpio indicating that the
parties had reached a settlement in the case for $9,936.00 and requested for
the case to be dismissed without prejudice.
 
On June 27, 2022, the Court ordered
the dismissal of the case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation for
Dismissal, with the Court retaining jurisdiction pursuant CCP § 664.6. 
 
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment Pursuant to CCP
§ 664.6. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Plaintiff prays for the Court to set aside
the dismissal entered on September 22, 2020, and enter judgment against
Defendant Carpio in the sum of $2,099.40 for the following: the principal
amount of $9,936.00 less $8,336.60 in payments made by Carpio, plus $500.00
in costs consisting of $370.00 for the Complaint filing fee, $89.50 service of
process fee and $60.00 motion fee (costs are capped at $500.00
per the agreement). Plaintiff asserts that Carpio has defaulted on his monthly
payments under the stipulation. Around December 19, 2023, Plaintiff mailed a default
letter to Carpio regarding the missed payments as required by the Agreement.
Since notifying Carpio about the default, Plaintiff alleges that Carpio has
failed to correct the missed payments. Thus, because of the payment default,
Plaintiff brings the instant motion.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6 (“CCP § 664.6”) states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) For
purposes of the statute, “a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any
of the following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The party. (2) ¶ An attorney
who represents the party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b) [emphasis
added].) 
 
“On a motion to enforce, the court
must determine whether the settlement agreement is valid and binding.
[Citation.] The court assesses whether the material terms of the settlement
were reasonably well-defined and certain, and whether the parties expressly
acknowledged that they understood and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In
re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 911.]” (Estate of
Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952.) 
 
The court may interpret the terms and conditions of a
settlement (Fiore v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the
court may not create material terms of a settlement, as opposed to deciding
what terms the parties themselves have previously agreed upon (Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 810).
 
II.        Discussion 
 
A.
Retention of Jurisdiction
            
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special
proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’ (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867.) ‘If requested by the parties,’
however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce
[a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.’ (§ 664.6,
italics added.)” (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles (2019)
33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) “‘Because of its summary nature, strict compliance
with the requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of
the court to impose a settlement agreement.’” (Id. (quoting Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
30, 37).)
 
“A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction
under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement
of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of
the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the
parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally
before the court.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
429, 440).) “The ‘request must be express, not implied from other language, and
it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen, supra,
97 Cal.App.4th at 440).)
 
Here,
the parties signed a stipulation containing the parties’ agreement for the
Court to retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce
the terms of the Stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default. (See 06-24-22
Stipulation.) Before dismissing the action, the parties signed the Stipulation
and submitted it to the Court. (Id.
at p. 3.) On June 27, 2022, the Court dismissed the entire case without
prejudice, according to the Stipulation, and expressly stated that it “shall
retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” (See 06-27-22 Order for Dismissal.)
Therefore, the Court finds that the Stipulation complies with the requirements
under CCP § 664.6, and it has retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant
to the parties’ Stipulation in this action.
 
B.
Entry of Judgment 
 
The Settlement
Agreement, filed on June 24, 2022, provides that Plaintiff and Defendant Carpio
agreed to settle the matter for a principal sum of $9,936.00, with Carpio making
an initial payment of $4,936.00 by July 1, 2022, then making a subsequent
payment of $2,500.00 on September 12, 2022, thereafter, making monthly payments
of $100.00 beginning on October 12, 2022, until the remaining settlement amount
was paid in full. (Harlan M. Reese, Esq. Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Plaintiff provides
the Court with the declaration of its counsel who avers that Carpio made
monthly payments totaling $8,336.60 pursuant to the agreement but has since
defaulted on his payments. (Id. ¶ 4.) Counsel declares that per the
Agreement, around December 19, 2023, Plaintiff mailed Carpio a default letter
regarding the missed payments. (Id. ¶
5; Exh. C.) The Agreement provides that if no payment correcting the default is
made within fourteen (14) days of issuing a default letter, Plaintiff is
entitled to file a motion vacating the dismissal and have judgment entered. (Id. ¶ 6.) Accordingly, due to
Defendant’s failure to comply with the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff
requested that a judgment be entered against the Defendant. (Id. ¶ 7.)
The Court
finds the Settlement Agreement valid and enforceable under CCP § 664.6. Here,
Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant Carpio has failed to continue making
payments under the parties’ agreement or cured the default after Plaintiff sent
notice. (Id. ¶¶ 4-6.)
Therefore, since a valid and signed settlement agreement between the parties
has been breached, and the Court retains jurisdiction to enter judgment, the
motion satisfies the requirements under CCP § 664.6.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate Dismissal and
Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Dismissal entered on June 27, 2022, is vacated.
Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $2,099.40 for
the following: the principal amount of $9,936.00 less $8,336.60
in payments made by Defendant Carpio, plus $500.00 in cost consisting of
$370.00 for the Complaint filing fee, $89.50 service of process fee and $60.00
motion fee (costs are capped at $500.00 per the agreement).
 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co.’s Motion
to Vacate the Dismissal Entered on 06/27/2022 and Enter Judgment is GRANTED.
 
Judgment By Court Pursuant to Stipulation (CCP 664.6)  is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant
Carpio in the amount of $2,099.40.
