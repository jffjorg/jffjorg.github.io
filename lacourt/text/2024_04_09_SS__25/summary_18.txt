"The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to its discovery requests, finding that the defendant's responses were untimely and insufficient. The court also awarded sanctions in the amount of $1,645.50 to the plaintiff, as the defendant's failure to provide timely responses constituted a misuse of the discovery process. The defendant is ordered to provide compliant, objection-free responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests within 20 days of notice of this order. The defendant is also ordered to pay the plaintiff's attorney's fees and court fees in the amount of $1,645.50 within 30 days of notice of this order. The trial date is set for January 7, 2025."
