And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for enforcement of settlement agreement filed by Plaintiff Shama Enterprises, LLC. The plaintiff is seeking to enforce a settlement agreement reached with Defendants Clinica Medica San Miguel I.P.A. Medical Group and Mahfouz M. Michael on February 18, 2020. The settlement agreement provides for the payment of $250,000, with $30,000 paid upfront and 60 monthly installment payments of $3,500, with a balloon payment of $10,000 at the end. The defendants defaulted on their payments in April 2023, and the plaintiff is seeking to accelerate all remaining installments and declare the entire unpaid balance immediately due and payable.

The court finds in favor of the plaintiff, granting the motion to enforce the settlement agreement as to the defendants. However, the court denies the motion as to the guarantors, MSP Properties, LLC, MSP Properties V, LLC, and MSP Properties VIII, LLC, as they are not parties to the action and cannot be held liable for the defendants' default. The court orders the plaintiff to provide an updated proposed judgment itemizing the amount due and owing, the liquidated damages, interest, service costs, and attorneys' fees, and any other relevant terms to the settlement agreement's entry as a judgment.
