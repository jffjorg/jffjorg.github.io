 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Ronald Holmes’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and
  Costs.



 
Background
Pleadings
Plaintiff Colbert L. Cobene
(deceased) and Ronald Holmes—individuals within the “age” protected class of
the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA)—sued Defendant Midnight Mission, a
business entity, exact form unknown, and Does 1 through 100 pursuant to a July
1, 2019 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Discrimination Based on Age in
Violation of FEHA (Cal. Govt. Code § 12940(a)), (2) Wrongful Discharge in
Violation of Public Policy, (3) Failure to Prevent Discrimination (Violation of
Government Code §12940 et seq.).
The claims arose from allegations
that, among other things, Plaintiffs were employed by Midnight Mission,
experienced age discrimination during the employment, and were subsequently
terminated from that employment in violation of public policy. Examples of
discrimination alleged by Plaintiff Holmes included being placed on the
graveyard shift, being put on probation, being repeatedly written up, being
micromanaged, being accused of things that were not his fault, and being
terminated.
Relevant Procedural History
In 2019, Plaintiff Cobene died. On
November 30, 2020, the Court granted a motion that permitted his surviving wife
and son to substitute in as Plaintiffs and dismiss this action on behalf of
Plaintiff Cobene’s estate.
Between late June and mid July
2023, a jury trial was held in this action, as between Plaintiff Holmes and
Midnight Mission.
On July 13, 2023, the jury returned
a special verdict in favor of Plaintiff Holmes on all causes of action and
awarding $340,752 in past economic loss damages and $1,000,000 in noneconomic
loss damages.
On July 31, 2023, Plaintiff Holmes
filed a proposed judgment.
On August 2, 2023, the Court signed
and entered judgment.
That same day, the Clerk noticed
entry of judgment on the parties.
On August 4, 2023, Plaintiff Holmes
filed a stipulation and order by the parties for a temporary stay of
enforcement of the money judgment in this action. The judgment was stayed
“until 10 days after the last day on which a notice of appeal may be filed in
this matter ….”
On August 7, 2023, the Court signed
and entered the stipulation.
On August 17, 2023, Midnight
Mission noticed its intent to move for a new trial and to move for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict.
On August 18, 2023, Midnight
Mission noticed the association of counsel Fisher & Phillips, LLP as
counsel of record in association with Frank Revere of Revere & Wallace.
On September 7, 2023, Midnight
Mission filed and served its motions for new trial and for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict.
On September 19, 2023, Plaintiff
Holmes opposed both motions in a combined opposition.
On September 25, 2023, Midnight
Mission made separate replies in favor of its two motions.
On October 10, 2023, the Court
heard oral arguments on Midnight Mission’s motions and took the ruling under
submission.
On October 11, 2023, the Court conditionally
granted the motion for a new trial, unless Plaintiff accepted a remittitur
reducing the verdict for economic damages only to $54,713, and otherwise denied
both motions. Plaintiff agreed to accept the reduced economic damages later
that day.
Motion Before the Court
On August 9, 2023, Plaintiff Holmes
filed a memorandum of costs.
On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff
Holmes moved for attorneys’ fees and costs in this action.
On October 18, 2023, Defendant
Midnight Mission opposed the fees and costs motion.
On October 25, 2023, Plaintiff
Holmes file errata notices regarding his moving papers.
On October 26, 2023, Plaintiff
Holmes replied to the opposition.
The motion for attorneys’ fees and
memorandum of costs are now before the Court.
 
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
Preliminary
Note
On
August 7, 2023, the Court signed a stipulation and order by the parties
agreeing to staying the judgment “until 10 days after the last day on which a
notice of appeal may be filed in this matter ….” (See 8/7/23 Stipulation and
Order [stay based on Code Civ. Proc., § 918, subd. (b)].)
A
notice of appeal may be filed no later than the earliest of various dates: (1)
60 days after notice of entry of judgment by the Clerk; (2) 60 days after
notice of entry of judgment by a party; or (3) 180 days after judgment. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 8.104, subd. (a)(1)(A)-(C).)
However,
where a motion for new trial is filed, the deadline for the notice to appeal is
extended to, for example, 30 days after the prevailing party at trial accepts a
remittitur in damages. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.108, subd. (b)(2)(A).)
Where a JNOV motion is filed and denied, the deadline to notice an appeal is
the earliest of (1) 30 days after notice of the denial by the Clerk or any
party, (2) 30 days after denial by operation of law, or (3) 180 days after
judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.108, subd. (d)(1)(A)-(C).)
Here,
on October 11, 2023, the Court granted the motion for new trial only as to a
remittitur in damages and denied the JNOV motion. That same day, Plaintiff
Holmes served a notice of the October 11th ruling and noticed an acceptance of
the Court’s remittitur.
Thus,
the deadline to appeal the judgment in this action is 30 days from October 11,
2023, i.e., Friday, November 10, 2023. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1010.6, subd.
(a)(3)(B)(iii), 1013, subds. (a), (c), (e) [extensions for time to act based on
service by email, mail, overnight delivery, and fax not applicable to noticing
an appeal].)
Moreover,
per the August 7, 2023 stipulation, judgment is stayed until 10 days after the
last day to notice appeal (Friday, November 10, 2023), i.e., stayed until
Monday, November 20, 2023.
Thus,
to the extent that any fees and costs are awarded here, because those fees and
costs are based on the August 3, 2023 judgment, an order awarding these fees
and costs will also be stayed until November 20, 2023.
Legal
Standard 
A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b).) Attorney’s fees are also recoverable as
costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(10).) In civil actions brought under the FEHA, the court, in its
discretion, may award to the prevailing party, including the department,
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, including expert witness fees, except
that, notwithstanding Section 998 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a prevailing
defendant shall not be awarded fees and costs unless the court finds the action
was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought, or the plaintiff
continued to litigate after it clearly became so. (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd.
(c)(6).)
The
Court begins this inquiry “with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there, the “lodestar figure
may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier enhancement] based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.) Relevant
multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which
the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and]
(4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
No
specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are
required; the record need only show that the attorney’s fees were awarded
according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo
Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In
re Marriage of Demblewski (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7
[disagreement as to statement of decision requirements].) The Court has broad
discretion to determine the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which
will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial
error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)
Order
Granting Fees and Costs: GRANTED.
Plaintiff
Ronald Holmes seeks an award of $210,067 in base attorneys’ fees, a 2.0 attorneys’
fees multiplier enhancement award of an additional $210,067 (for a total of $420,134)
plus $13,971.61 in costs pursuant to Government Code section 12965, subdivision
(c)(6). (Mot., pp. 3-4; see Reply, p. 2 [agreeing to reduction in lodestar from
$217,667 to $210,067 based on one duplicative entry of 9.5 hours on June 28,
2023].)
I. Reasonable Fees
Plaintiff
Ronald Holmes seeks recovery of fees based on work expended by various
attorneys and a paralegal as follows:
(1)
Timothy B. Sottile at a rate of $800 per hour (partner at Plaintiff’s counsel’s
firm, Sottile Baltaxe);
(2)
Michael F. Baltaxe at a rate of $800 per hour (partner at Sottile Baltaxe);
(3)
Payam I. Aframian at a rate of $450 per hour (associate no longer working for Sottile
Baltaxe);
(4)
Victoria Felder at a rate of $300 per hour (associate no longer working for
Sottile Baltaxe);
(5)
Jennifer Zide at a rate of $575 per hour (associate no longer working for Sottile
Baltaxe);
(6)
Nicole C. Burgos Romero at a rate of $250 per hour (associate currently working
for Sottile Baltaxe);
(7)
Charles Casado at a rate of $250 per hour (associate no longer working for
Sottile Baltaxe);
(8)
Robert Golde at a rate of $525 per hour (associate currently working for
Sottile Baltaxe); and
(9)
Thomas Still at a rate of $100 per hour (paralegal currently working for
Sottile Baltaxe).
(Mot.,
p. 6; see Mot., Comp. of Decls., Ex. 1, Sottile Decl., ¶ 25.)
The
rates are supported by declarations from Timothy B. Sottile, Michael F.
Baltaxe, Nicole C. Burgos Romero, and Joshua Milon. (See Mot., Comp. of Decls, Ex.
1, Sottile Decl., ¶¶ 4-6, 8-10, 11-12, 24-25; Sub-Exs. A-G [verified time
records]; id. at Ex., Ex. 2, Baltaxe Decl., ¶¶ 11-31, Sub-Ex. A [verified
time records]; id. at Ex. 3, Burgos Romero Decl., ¶¶ 2-7, 9, Sub-Ex. A
[verified time records]; id. at Ex. 4, Milon Decl., ¶¶ 1-37 [declaration
from third-party attorney supporting the fee rates requested by Plaintiff].)
A
review of the opposition shows that the fee rates (and costs) were not
contested by Midnight Mission, which only disputed the reasonableness of hours
expended on this action and the appropriateness of an enhancement award.
(Opp’n, pp. 2-7.)
The
reply notes this failure to oppose the fee rates. (Reply, p. 1 [“It appears
that the Defendants accepts the reasonableness of the hourly rates requested by
Plaintiff in his motion for attorney[s’] fees”].)
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiff on this issue.
The
Court makes its determination based on the educational and/or professional
background provided by the Sottile, Baltaxe, and Burgos Romero declarations, as
well as prevailing market rates in the Los Angeles area and the Court’s own experience.
II. Reasonable Hours
In
his motion, Plaintiff Holmes makes a brief argument in favor of reasonableness
in hours expended by counsel. In full, Plaintiff Holmes argues that “[t]he time
expended by Holmes’ counsel, as well as descriptions of work performed, is set
forth in the timesheets attached to the Declarations of Timothy B. Sottile,
Michael F. Baltaxe[,] and Nicole C. Burgos Romero,” for which reason Plaintiff
“Holmes therefore asks that the Court find that the reasonable time spent is
376.9 hours.” (Mot., pp. 5-6; see Mot., Comp. of Decls., Ex. 1, Sottile Decl.,
¶ 25 [breakdown of rates, hours, and totals for each attorney’s and paralegal’s
work], Sub. Exs. A-G [verified time records for counsel Aframian, Zide, Felder,
Casado, Golde, Still (paralegal), and Sottile]; id. at Ex. 2, Sub-Ex. A
[verified time records for Baltaxe]; id. at Ex. 3, Sub-Ex. A [verified
time records for Burgos Romero].)
In
opposition, Midnight Mission argues that the hours requested should be reduced.
The reasons provided by Midnight Mission are that the billing entries in the
verified time records are vague, do not describe the tasks performed by
counsel, are excessive, and contain block billing, particularly in the form of
quarter-hour-plus increments. Midnight Mission specifically challenges billings
related to Payam Aframian, Jennifer Zide, Charles Casado, Victoria Felder,
Timothy Sottile, and Nicole Burgos Romero, including one instance of apparent
duplicative billing by Timothy Sottile. Midnight Mission argues that a
$36,522.50 reduction is merited based on this billing. In conclusion, Midnight
Mission argues that $7,200 should be reduced from the base fees request based
on duplicative billing, and an additional 20% of the remainder should be
reduced based on block billing and based on a 20% block billing reduction set
out in the Ninth Circuit’s Welch v. Metro Life Ins. Co. (9th Cir. 2007)
480 F.3d 942, 948-949 (Welch). (Opp’n, pp. 2­-4.)
In
reply, Plaintiff Holmes argues that the opposition arguments are contradictory,
criticizing Plaintiff’s counsel for block billing and padding while
simultaneously arguing that counsel did not spend a sufficient amount of time
in this action (an argument responsive to the enhancement award position taken
by Midnight Mission that the case was not complex). Plaintiff Holmes further
argues that the time expended by counsel was proper and advanced the case, such
as by developing the case, making filings, conducting discovery, and preparing
for trial, with many of the hours expended by counsel being expended before the
Court. Plaintiff Holmes agrees, however, that 9.5 hours ought to be reduced
from the fees request based on duplicative billing for Timothy Sottile,
bringing down the base fees award request to $210,067. (Reply, pp. 1-2.)
The
Court finds in favor of Plaintiffs. As an overall matter, the Court finds that
a total bill of $210,067 is in fact very low for a case brought under FEHA in
the Court’s experience, where it includes all of the pretrial matters including
drafting the complaint, discovery, preparation for trial as well as 11 days of
trial, post-judgment matters, and the motion for attorney fees.
As
to Payam Aframian, Jennifer Zide, Victory Felder, Charles Casado, and Robert
Golde, the Court’s review of the verified billing records—which are entitled to
deference (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of Calif. State Univ. (2005)
132 Cal.App.4th 359, 397)—shows that the tasks described were performed in
reasonable time. (Mot., Comp. of Decls., Ex. 1, Sottile Decl., Sub-Exs. A-E.) Moreover,
the hours expended by Payam Aframian, Jennifer Zide, Victory Felder, Charles
Casado, and Robert Golde are few—four, three, 17, three, and 7.8 respectively—and
are shown by the records to have been expended on specific tasks rather than
various tasks combined into a single block for billing purposes, undercutting
the block billing argument as to these attorneys. (Ibid.; see Mountjoy
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 280 [“Block billing
occurs when ‘a block of time [is assigned] to multiple tasks rather than
itemizing the time spent on each task,’” citation omitted].) Again, even if on
the outer edge of reasonability, the above referenced hours were reasonably
expended by counsel.
The
opposition does not dispute the reasonableness of paralegal Thomas Still’s
work, which the Court finds reasonable. (Mot., Comp. of Decls., Ex. 1, Sottile
Decl., Sub-Ex. F see Opp’n, p. 4 [Plaintiff Holmes “[s]pecifically” challenges
block billing by Payam Aframian, Jennifer Zide, Charles Casado, Victoria
Felder, Timothy Sottile, and Nicole Burgos Romero].) Indeed, the Court notes that
this individual, a paralegal, who billed $100 per hour, undoubtedly assisted in
keeping the overall amount billed to the case quite low.
As
to Timothy Sottile, the Court agrees that the billing records are not particularized
between time expended on various tasks, thus supporting a finding of block
billing. For example, on a number of days attorney Sottile wrote as to time expended
on the “Activity” “TBS – prepare for trial,” which accounts for eight billing
entries totaling 41.8 hours without explanation as to the specific tasks
performed to prepare for trial. Similar entries exist for traveling to and from
the Court, conducting trial, and reviewing and summarizing transcripts. (Mot.,
Comp. of Decls., Ex. 1, Sottile Decl., Sub-Ex. G; Christian Research
Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325-1326 [Block billing
can exacerbate the vagueness of an attorney’s fees request and support a
court’s finding that time entries were inflated and non-compensable].) 
            However, “consistent precedent in
California cases . . . provide[s] trial courts with the discretion about
whether [or not] to penalize block billing.” 
(Heritage Pacific Financial v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972,
1010, fn. 6. [italics in original; brackets added].) The 20% reduction that was
upheld in Welch, supra, 480 F.3d at pp. 948-949, was based on a
report that concluded that block billing “may increase time by 10% to 30%.”
            Here, the Court finds that the days
for which this block billing occurred were for pre-trial and during trial. The
hours requested for the eight days of trial preparation and the eleven days of
trial ranged from 4-6.5 hours preparing for trial and ranged from 8-10 hours during
trial. Given the quantity of work to be done on any given day of trial, 8-10
hours is very low, including as it must not only the time spent in the courthouse
(between about 9:30 and 4:30) but also travel time and preparation for the
following day. Preparation time necessarily includes preparing for all of the witnesses,
both on direct and on cross, as well as preparing for the Final Status
Conference and argument on all the motions in limine, brought by both plaintiff
and defendant. A total of 41.8 hours to prepare for trial over 8 days both
before and during trial is not an inflated or padded sum, and thus this Court does
not find that this is an appropriate case in which to deduct hours solely
because of block-billing or rounded hours.
The
opposition does not dispute the reasonableness of Michael Baltaxe’s work, which
the Court finds reasonable. (Mot., Comp. of Decls., Ex. 2, Baltaxe Decl.,
Sub-Ex. A; see Opp’n, p. 4 [Defendant “[s]pecifically” challenges block billing
by Payam Aframian, Jennifer Zide, Charles Casado, Victoria Felder, Timothy
Sottile, and Nicole Burgos Romero].)
Last,
as to Nicole Burgos Romero, the Court finds that the hours requested are
reasonable. These hours involve no more than four hours on any tasks, where the
tasks are sufficiently specific as to the nature of the tasks performed while
also involving tasks that could take several hours to complete. (Mot., Comp. of Decls., Ex. 3, Burgos Romero Decl., Sub-Ex. A.)
The
Court thus finds that the hours requested for the work of Payam Aframian,
Jennifer Zide, Charles Casado, Victoria Felder, Thomas Still, Timothy Sottile, Michael
Baltaxe, and Nicole Burgos Romero are reasonable.
III. Enhancement Award
After
review, the Court finds that a minimal enhancement award is proper here. (See
Mot., pp. 7-10; Opp’n, pp. 5-7; Reply, pp. 3-5.) The Court finds that some of
the factors support an enhancement, while others do not. Those factors affirmed
by the California Supreme Court in Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d
25, 49 that are relevant here include: 1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved; 2) the skill displayed in presenting them; 3) the extent to which the
nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; and 4)
the contingent nature of the fee award. (See also Bernardi v. County of
Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1399.)
Reviewing
those factors, the Court finds that a minimal enhancement of 1.25 is
appropriate. The case was not novel or complex, although certainly not an easy
case to win, either. Plaintiff’s counsel exercised skill in presenting the matter,
as seen by the jury’s verdict and as observed by the Court. There was no showing
by Plaintiff’s counsel that the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys. However, the contingent nature of the fee award is a strong factor
supporting a multiplier here, a contingency made all the more risky by the fact
that the Plaintiff’s economic damages were low and punitive damages were
unavailable. 
            “An enhancement of the lodestar
amount to reflect the contingency risk is “[o]ne of the most common fee
enhancers.’” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1379, 1399, quoting Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th
553, 579.) “The contingent fee compensates the lawyer not only for the legal
services he renders but for the loan of those services. …’ [Citation.] ‘A
lawyer who both bears the risk of not being paid and provides legal services is
not receiving the fair market value of his work if he is paid only for the
second of these functions. If he is paid no more, competent counsel will be
reluctant to accept fee award cases.’ [Citations.]” (Amaral v. Cintas Corp.
No. 2 (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1157, 1217-1218, citing Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132–1133.) 
Therefore,
the Court grants a 1.25 multiplier to account for the skill demonstrated and contingent
risk, for a total of $210,067 x 1.25= $262,583.75.
IV. Costs
Plaintiff
seeks $13,971.61 in costs related to prosecuting this action. The costs were
sought in an August 9, 2023 memorandum of costs. (See Mot., Comp. of Decls.,
Ex. 1, Sottile Decl., Ex. H [memo of costs].)
A
review of the opposition shows that the costs were not contested by Midnight
Mission, which only disputed the reasonableness of hours expended on this
action and the appropriateness of an enhancement award. (Opp’n, pp. 2-7.)
The
Court finds that these costs are (1) mandatory per the Rules of Court (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(4)) and (2) reasonable in amount
($13,971.61). 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Ronald Holmes’s Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs is GRANTED, in Part, in the amount of $262,583.75
for fees and $13,971.61 in costs.
