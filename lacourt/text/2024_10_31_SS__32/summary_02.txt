And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion filed by defendant Zhores Markaryan's counsel, Bradley J. Yourist, to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The motion is unopposed, but the court notes that counsel has not provided information for all future proceedings in the case and has not shown proof of service of the moving papers on all parties who have appeared in the action. The court denies the motion to relieve counsel, citing the attorney's ethical obligation to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the client's interests. Counsel is directed to provide notice of the court's ruling and file proof of service of such notice.
