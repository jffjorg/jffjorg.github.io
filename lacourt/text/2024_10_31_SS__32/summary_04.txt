Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for leave to conduct a second physical examination of the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims injuries to his knees, cervical spine, and shoulders, and the defendant seeks to examine him on November 27, 2024, by an orthopedic specialist. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that there is no good cause for the examination and that it violates his right to privacy. The judge finds that the defendant has made a good faith effort to meet and confer with the plaintiff's counsel, and that there is good cause to grant leave for the examination. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has waived his right to privacy by filing the lawsuit and claiming injuries to his neck, shoulders, and knees. The defendant is granted leave to conduct the second physical examination, and must provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
