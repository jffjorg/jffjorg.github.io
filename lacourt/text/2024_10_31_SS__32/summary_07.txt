And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) is seeking to dismiss a personal injury lawsuit brought by Ok Hee Yang (Plaintiff) and impose sanctions of $2,360 against Plaintiff and/or her attorneys.

The judge notes that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court's discovery orders, including failing to respond to discovery requests and failing to pay sanctions ordered by the Court. LACMTA argues that Plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests has prevented them from adequately defending against Plaintiff's claims.

The judge has continued the motion to November 18, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse. Defendant LACMTA is ordered to give notice of the motion to all parties, and Plaintiff is given the opportunity to serve belated discovery responses and file an updated opposition.

The judge notes that the Court may impose terminating sanctions against Plaintiff, including dismissing the lawsuit, striking out Plaintiff's pleadings, or rendering a judgment by default against Plaintiff, if Plaintiff fails to comply with the Court's orders. The judge also notes that the Court has the authority to prohibit the withdrawal of the motion and adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
