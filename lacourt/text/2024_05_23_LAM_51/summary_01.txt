Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for a charging order against the transferable interest of the defendant in three limited liability companies. The charging order is necessary to permit the plaintiff to enforce the judgment. The defendant has failed to make any payments towards the judgment, and the plaintiff seeks a lien against the defendant's membership interests in the limited liability companies. The defendant has a perfected security interest in the same interests, but the court finds that the charging order would not take precedence over the security interest. The court concludes that the charging order is warranted and grants the motion.
