STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On August 8, 2023, Plaintiffs Seung Jin Jwa and Run Rye Lee
(Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint against Defendant Eung Hee Lee aka Eunghee Lee
(Defendant) with six causes of action for: (1) Breach of the Implied Covenant
of Quiet Enjoyment; (2) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability; (3)
Breach of Lease; (4) Violation of L.A.M.C. Section 151.01 et seq.; (5)
Violation of Business and Profession Code Section 17200, et seq.; and (6)
Negligence.
 
According to the Complaint, this concerns a property located
at 500 South Berendo Street, Apartment 411, Los Angeles, California 90020-5606
(the Property) that Plaintiffs lease from Defendant.  Plaintiffs allege they lived at the Property
since June 15, 2019, and that Defendant demanded Plaintiffs vacate on June 21,
2023, so they could remodel it and sell the unit. Plaintiffs allege various
problems with the Property during their tenancy of which they notified
Defendant. 
 
On October 2, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer to the
Complaint, which the court SUSTAINED with leave to amend. 
 
On January 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) with four causes of action for: (1) Breach of Lease; (2)
Violation of L.A.M.C. Section 151.01 et seq.; (3) Violation of Business and
Profession Code Section 17200, et seq.; and (4) Negligence.
 
On February 22, 2024, the Court overruled Defendant’s
demurrer to the first, second, and fourth causes of action, and sustained the
demurrer to the third cause of action with leave to amend.
 
On March 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the operative Second
Amended Complaint (SAC) alleging the same causes of action.
 
On March 25, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer to
the SAC with motion to strike. On May 9, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition.
No reply has been filed.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only
issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
 
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as
true. (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.) Courts also consider exhibits
attached to the complaint and incorporated by reference. (See Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94 (Frantz).)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Meet and Confer
 
As an initial matter, there is no meet and confer
declaration for either the demurrer or motion to strike as required by CCP
§§430.41(a), 435.5(a). While the Court may not deny the motions based on this,
the Court overrules the demurrer and denies the motion to strike based on the
following procedural issues. 
 
Combined Motions
 
Defendant has also improperly combined two motions into one,
i.e., the demurrer and the motion to strike. Each motion must be separately
brought and noticed. This is grounds for denial.
 
Failure to State
Grounds for Demurrer
 
Defendant has failed to state the grounds for the demurrer
to the third cause of action. “Each ground of demurrer must be in a separate
paragraph and must state whether it applies to the entire complaint,
cross-complaint, or answer, or to specified causes of action or defenses.”
(CRC, Rule 3.1320(a).) 
 
Defendant only provides: “Defendant also moves to demur to
the Third Cause of Action.” (Notice of Motion, p. 2.) This is insufficient.
Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
Strike Entire Cause
of Action
 
Lastly, Defendant moves to strike the entire “Second Cause
of Action for Violation of LAMC Section 151.01 et seq.” (Notice of Motion, p.
1.) However, Defendant argues that only the additional allegations and facts in
support of the second cause of action are improper because the demurrer was
overruled as to that cause of action, not that the entire cause of action is
improper. Accordingly, the Court would only strike the portions of the second
cause of action that are improper, rather than the entire cause of action. 
 
From a practical standpoint, Defendant has not provided
which allegations are requested to be stricken as improper. From a procedural
standpoint, the CRC requires that “[a] notice of motion to strike a portion of
a pleading must quote in full the portions sought to be stricken except where
the motion is to strike an entire paragraph, cause of action, count, or
defense. Specifications in a notice must be numbered consecutively.” To the
extent Defendant intended to strike the entire second cause of action based on
the above argument, not all the allegations are improper, and Defendant still
has not complied with the CRC. Accordingly, the motion to strike is DENIED.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
Demurrer to the third cause of
action is OVERRULED.
 
Motion to strike second cause of
action is DENIED. 
 
Defendant to Answer only within 10 day notice of this
ruling.
Responding party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
