LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Pursuant to Code Civil Procedure section
708.310, “[i]f a money judgment is rendered against a partner or member
but not against the partnership or limited liability company, the judgment
debtor’s interest in the partnership or limited liability company may be
applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment by an order charging the
judgment debtor’s interest pursuant to Section 15907.03, 16504, or 17705.03
of the Corporations Code.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.310.)
 
“A lien on a judgment debtor’s
interest in a partnership or limited liability company is created by service of
a notice of motion for a charging order on the judgment debtor and on either of
the following: (1) All partners or the partnership [or] (2) All
members or the limited liability company.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.320,
subd. (a).)
 
Pursuant to Corporations Code section
15907.03, subdivision (a), “[o]n application by a judgment creditor of a
member or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the
transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the
judgment. A charging order constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor’s
transferable interest and requires the limited liability company to pay over to
the person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that would
otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor.” (Corp. Code, §17705.03,
subd. (a); see also Corp. Code, § 15907.03, subd. (a).)
 
 
Request for Judicial Notice:
 
1.      Judgment
Creditor request for judicial notice is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code
sections 452(d) and 453.
2.      Third-Party
Jason Caramanis as Trustee for Ya-Ya Legacy Trust’s request for judicial notice
is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code sections 452(d) and 453.
ANALYSIS: 
 
Judgment Creditor moves for a charging order against the
transferrable interest of Judgment Debtor in (1) Saticoy Property Managers,
LLC; (2) 1880 Tunnel Road, LLC; and (3) Magnolia Management, LLC (“Specified
Entities”) for the unsatisfied amount of the money judgment of $9,000,000.00
entered in favor of Judgment Creditor against Judgment Debtor. Judgment
Creditor argues Judgment Debtor is a member of each of the Specified Entities
and issuance of the charging order is essential to permit it to enforce the
Judgment.
 
Claimant opposes the present motion on the grounds that he
holds (1) a perfected security interest liens the Specified Entities; and (2)
direct liens in the assets of 1880 Tunnel Road, LLC, thus making his position
senior to that of Judgment Creditor. 
 
In Rice v. Downs (2021) 73 Cal.App.5th 213, the court
concluded that “a charging order would not take precedence over a security
interest perfected before any judgment lien or charging order lien was in
place.” (Rice v. Downs (2021) 73 Cal.App.5th 213, 232, fn. 9 (Rice).)
 
The Court finds that Judgment Debtor has failed to make any
payments toward the Judgment entered against it on November 17, 2022.
Furthermore, Judgment Creditor seeks merely a lien against Judgment Debtor’s membership
interests in the Specified Entities. Essentially, Judgment Creditor requests a
lien be issued on Judgment Debtor’s rights to distributions in accordance with
the operating agreements in the Specified Entities such that no distribution
payments are paid directly to Judgment Debtor. Likewise, Judgment Creditor makes
no arguments or concessions that the requested charging order shall take
precedence over Claimant’s lien interests in the same entities. Moreover,
Claimant provides no case or statutory authority to support denial of a
charging order simply because perfected security interests in the same
interests of an LLC exist. By contrast, the sole case authority on such matters
indicates that a charging order may be issued but would not take precedence
over a security interest perfected before any judgment lien or charging order
lien was in place because priority should be given to the first creditor that
obtained a lien. (Rice, supra, 73 Cal.App.5th at 230.) Thus, even with a
charging order in place, it is likely that Claimant would receive distributions
before Judgment Creditor. Lastly, notice of the instant motion was provided to
all the members of the Specified Entities, therefore it complies with the
requirements of Code Civil Procedure section 708.320,
subdivision (a).
 
Accordingly, the Motion for Order Charging Interests of Judgment
Debtor in Specified Entities is warranted in this matter. 
 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor Sabag Holdings, LLC’s
Motion for Order Charging Interests of Judgment Debtor in Specified Entities is
GRANTED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
