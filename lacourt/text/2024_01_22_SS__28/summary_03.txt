And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment and has ruled as follows. The Plaintiff, Hagob Kevorkian, has requested a default judgment against the Defendants, Pacifico S. Ner, Maria C. Ner, Ner Family Trust, and Mehial F Evseff, seeking damages of $1,033,523.78. However, the Judge has denied the application because the Plaintiff did not provide the required documents and attachments, including a brief summary of the case, declarations or other admissible evidence, and a request for attorney fees. Additionally, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff did not dismiss the Doe defendants and did not provide sufficient evidence to support the request for $1,000,000.00 in general damages. The Judge concludes that the application is denied without prejudice, and the Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
