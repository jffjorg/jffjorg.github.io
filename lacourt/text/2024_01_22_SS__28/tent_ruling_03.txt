against Defendants Pacifico S. Ner (“Pacifico Ner”), Maria C. Ner (“Maria Ner”),
Ner Family Trust (“Trust”), and Does 1-25 for negligence. 
On
March 16, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant Mehial F

On
February 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed statements of damages sought against Evseff
and Maria Ner.  
On
February 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed statements of damages sought against Trust

On August

On
August 10, 2023, the clerk entered Maria Ner’s default.  On August 11, 2023, the clerk entered Evseff’s
default. 
On
November 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on
January 22, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter a default judgment against Defendants and award
Plaintiff $1,033,523.78, consisting of $32,275.89 in special damages,
$1,000,000.00 in general damages, $0.00 in prejudgment interest, $0.00 in
attorney’s fees, and $1,247.89 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint,
plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case
for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].)
           The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a
defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for
personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
The
JUD-100 form refers to Attachment 5a. 
There is no attachment. 
Plaintiff
has not dismissed the Doe defendants. 
The
application does not support the request for $1,000,000.00 in general damages.   
The
Court denies the application. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Hagob Kevorkian’s application for default judgment filed
on November 28, 2023 without prejudice. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
