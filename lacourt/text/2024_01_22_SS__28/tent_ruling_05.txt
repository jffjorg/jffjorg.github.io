of the Estate of Titus Young, filed an answer. 
On February

On
September 25, 2023, the Los Angeles County Public Guardian (“Public Guardian”),

PUBLIC GUARDIAN’S REQUEST 
The
Public Guardian asks the Court to approve a settlement in which the Estate will
pay Plaintiff $55,000.00, with each side to bear their own fees and costs, in
return for Plaintiff’s dismissal of the case upon full payment of the settlement amount. 
LEGAL STANDARD Probate
Code section 2502 provides: 
“Court approval is required for a compromise or
settlement of a matter when the transaction requires the transfer or
encumbrance of property of the estate, or the creation of an unsecured
liability of the estate, or both, in an amount or value in excess of
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).” 
(Prob.
Code, § 2502.) 
          Probate Code section 2505, subdivision (a), provides in
part: 
“. . . where the claim or matter is the subject of a
pending action or proceeding, the court approval required by this article shall
be obtained from the court in which the action or proceeding is pending.” 
(Prob. Code, § 2505, subd.
(a).) 
DISCUSSION 
The
Court has reviewed the petition and finds that it is fair and reasonable and in
the best interest of Titus Young.

states that he does not oppose the “gravamen” of the petition and asks that the
case not be dismissed until the settlement sum is paid to Plaintiff’s counsel. 
 The Court grants the petition.
