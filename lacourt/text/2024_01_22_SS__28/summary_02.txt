And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff Oliver Pozo's motion to reopen discovery, allowing Plaintiff to complete the discovery needed to oppose Defendant Stater Bros. Markets' pending summary judgment motion. The judge denies Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Stater's person most knowledgeable and Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Stater's employee Yesenia Aragon.

The judge finds that Stater's person most knowledgeable was available to testify on June 6, 2023, but Plaintiff's counsel cancelled the deposition on the day of the deposition without providing a valid reason. The judge also finds that Plaintiff failed to show that Stater failed to serve a valid objection to the deposition notice.

Regarding Yesenia Aragon's deposition, the judge finds that Stater objected to the deposition notice and provided alternative dates, but Plaintiff failed to respond to those dates and did not make any further efforts to schedule the deposition.

The judge denies both parties' requests for sanctions and orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service with the court within five days.
