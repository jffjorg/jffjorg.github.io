And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers and rules as follows. The Plaintiff, Eusebio Hernandez, was injured in an accident while working as a landscaper at the La Perla construction project. The Defendant, Mr. Crane, Inc., filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Plaintiff's claim is barred by the exclusive remedy of workers' compensation because he was Mr. Crane, Inc.'s special employee at the time of the accident.

The Court denies the motion for summary judgment, finding that Mr. Crane, Inc. has not carried its initial burden on summary judgment of proving that the Plaintiff was its special employee. The undisputed evidence shows only that the Plaintiff was assigned to work with Dillard, a Mr. Crane, Inc. employee, and Mr. Crane, Inc. has not shown that it controlled the manner in which the Plaintiff carried out this work.

The Court concludes that the existence of an employment relationship between the Plaintiff and Mr. Crane, Inc. is a question for the trier of fact, but can be decided by the court as a matter of law if the evidence supports only one reasonable conclusion. The Court finds that the evidence does not support a conclusion that the Plaintiff was Mr. Crane, Inc.'s special employee, and therefore denies the motion for summary judgment.
