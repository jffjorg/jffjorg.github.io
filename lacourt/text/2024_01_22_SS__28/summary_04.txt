And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment and has ruled as follows. The plaintiff, Douglas Rhee, Jr., filed a complaint against the defendants, Hilarion Candido Varela and Steve Song, on April 27, 2022, alleging motor vehicle and general negligence. The plaintiff served the defendants with a statement of damages and filed proofs of service showing personal service of the statement on November 12, 2022, and November 17, 2022. The court entered the defendants' default on April 12, 2023, and September 5, 2023.

The plaintiff is seeking a default judgment against the defendants in the amount of $9,156,747.96, consisting of $2,150,000.00 in special damages, $7,000,000.00 in general damages, $0.00 in prejudgment interest, $0.00 in attorney's fees, and $6,747.96 in costs. However, the court has denied the application because the plaintiff's calculation of damages is incorrect, and the plaintiff has not provided evidence to support their request for general damages. The court has also denied the application because the plaintiff has not provided evidence to support their request for future medical expenses and loss of future earning capacity. The court has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
