  Case Number:  22STCV22553    Hearing Date:   April 26, 2024    Dept:  74 Michael Benincaso v. Luke Rottman 
 
Plaintiff Michael Benincaso’s Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories – General (Set One) from
Defendant Luke Rottman and Request for Sanctions
 
BACKGROUND
            This
action arises from a contractual dispute.
            On
July 12, 2022, Plaintiff Michael Benincaso (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant Luke Rottman (Defendant). The complaint alleges breach of
contract and intentional misrepresentation. 
            On
April 14, 2023, Plaintiff propounded form interrogatories on Defendant.
            On
May 16, 2023, Defendant provided responses. Plaintiff was dissatisfied.
            The
parties met and conferred to no avail.
            On
September 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 8.2, 15.1, and 50.1-50.6.
LEGAL STANDARD 
            ¿¿A
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response to interrogatories
if the propounding party deems that an answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete, or that an objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a).) Such a motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks further responses to
Form Interrogatory Nos. 8.2, 15.1, and 50.1-50.6. As a preliminary matter, the
court finds good cause for the requested discovery. Although Plaintiff did not
include a meet and confer declaration with his motion, the attached exhibits
demonstrate that he made a good faith effort to meet and confer. (Ex. 3; Ex.
4.) Because Defendant did not respond or object to Form Interrogatory Nos. 8.2
and 50.1-50.6, further response to these interrogatories is necessary. The
court notes Defendant objected to Form Interrogatory No. 15.1. But Defendant’s
boilerplate objections are too general and improper. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (a); Korea Data Systems v. Superior Court (1997) 51
Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516.) Moreover, Defendant did not expand on these objections
in a timely opposition. Further response to Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 is
necessary. 
            In
addition, Plaintiff seeks sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.300, subdivision (d). However, Plaintiff has not substantiated his request
for $5,091.65 with a proposed hourly rate and breakdown of work performed.
CONCLUSION
                The court grants Plaintiff’s motion
to compel Defendant’s further responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 8.2, 15.1,
and 50.1-50.6. Defendant shall provide further Code-compliant responses,
without objections, within 30 days of this order. The court denies Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions.
                Plaintiff shall give notice.
