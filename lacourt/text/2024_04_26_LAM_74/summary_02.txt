And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to deem the requests for admission (RFAs) admitted. The defendant has shown that the plaintiff received the RFAs, and the plaintiff has failed to respond to them. Therefore, the court grants the motion and deems the RFAs admitted. Additionally, the court awards the defendant's counsel attorney fees in the amount of $761.65, which is reasonable given the work performed. The plaintiff must pay the attorney fees within 30 days of the order.
