Williams v. Corey Flournoy Williams
Defendant Corey Flournoy William’s
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission (Set One) Admitted and Request for
Sanctions
 
BACKGROUND 
            This action arises from a property
dispute.
            On November 10, 2022, Plaintiff
Queen Williams (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendant Corey Flournoy
Williams (Defendant). In the complaint, Plaintiff alleges the following causes
of action: (1) financial elder abuse, (2) conversion, (3) unjust enrichment,
(4) cancellation of instrument, (5) cancellation of instrument, (6) quiet
title, (7) quiet title, (8) violation of Tom Bane Civil Rights Act, (9)
violation of Civil Code Section 789.3, and (10) wrongful eviction.
            On October 27, 2023, Defendant
served Plaintiff with requests for admission (set one) (RFAs) by mail and
email. (Chen Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff’s daughter acknowledged receipt of the
discovery by email but told Defendant’s counsel that the email address did not
belong to Plaintiff. (Chen Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff’s daughter later asked
Defendant’s counsel to send all documents to her via the same email address.
(Chen Decl., ¶ 12.)
            On December 22, 2023, Defendant’s
counsel called Plaintiff about her failure to respond to the RFAs. Plaintiff
confirmed her mailing address but claimed she had not received the RFAs. (Chen
Decl., ¶ 9.) 
            On January 19, 2024, Defendant had
the RFAs personally delivered to Plaintiff’s address. (Chen Decl., ¶ 10; Ex.
F.) 
            On January 31, 2024, Defendant’s
counsel sent a letter to Plaintiff regarding her failure to respond to the
RFAs. (Chen Decl., ¶ 11.) 
            To date, Plaintiff has not provided
responses to the RFAs.
            On February 20, 2024, Defendant
filed this motion to deem the RFAs admitted.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If a party to whom requests for
admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the requesting party
may move for an order that the truth of any matters specified in the requests
be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b).) Further, the Court¿shall¿make this order, “unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing¿on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) ¿
            While tardy
responses may defeat the motion, they will not avoid monetary sanctions. (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction [Citation] on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure
to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.”].)  
DISCUSSION  
            The
court grants Defendant’s motion to deem the RFAs admitted. Defendant has
persuaded the court that Plaintiff has received the discovery at issue. On
October 27, 2023, Defendant mailed the RFAs to Plaintiff’s confirmed mailing
address. (Chen Decl., ¶¶ 4, 9.) That same day, Defendant emailed the RFAs to
Plaintiff’s daughter, who has expressed that all documents should be emailed to
her. (Chen Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6, 12.) In addition, Defendant had the RFAs personally
delivered to Plaintiff’s confirmed address on January 19, 2024. (Chen Decl., ¶¶
9, 10.) Moreover, Plaintiff has provided no evidence to the contrary in a
timely opposition. Given Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond, the court
grants this motion.
            Moreover,
sanctions are mandatory. (Code of Civ. Proc. §
2033.280, subd. (c).) The court finds Defendant’s counsel’s proposed hourly
rate reasonable, and he has substantiated his request for attorney fees with a
breakdown of work performed. (Chen Decl., ¶ 14.) However, this motion largely
duplicates Defendant’s prior discovery motion. The court will adjust the award
accordingly: $761.65 ($350/hr x 2 hours + $61.65).
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendant’s motion to deem the RFAs admitted. The court grants
Defendant’s request for sanctions. Plaintiff shall pay Defendant’s counsel
attorney fees in the sum of $761.65 within 30 days of this order.
Defendant shall give
notice.
