And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling relates to a contractual dispute between Michael Benincaso (Plaintiff) and Luke Rottman (Defendant). The dispute arose from a breach of contract and intentional misrepresentation. The Plaintiff filed a complaint in July 2022, and subsequently propounded form interrogatories on the Defendant. The Defendant provided responses in May 2023, but the Plaintiff was dissatisfied. The parties met and conferred, but were unable to resolve the issues. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to compel further responses to specific interrogatories and a request for sanctions. The court finds good cause for the requested discovery and orders the Defendant to provide further responses within 30 days. The court also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions.
