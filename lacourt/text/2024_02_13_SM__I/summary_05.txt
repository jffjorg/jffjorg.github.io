And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling states that the court cannot enter a default judgment because there is no specific number of damages set forth in the complaint, and no Statement of Damages was served prior to entry of default. The court notes that entering a judgment without these details would be a denial of due process and potentially unenforceable. Therefore, the court will vacate the entry of default, allow the plaintiff to submit a Statement of Damages, and then allow the plaintiff to seek default again. This outcome may lead the defendant to answer the complaint rather than proceed by default. The court will discuss this decision with the plaintiff at the upcoming hearing.
