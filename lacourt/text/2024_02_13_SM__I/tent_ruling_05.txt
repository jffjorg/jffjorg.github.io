 Case Number:  23SMCV01095    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for the entry of a default judgment.  The court cannot enter the judgment.  The court notes that there is no specific
number set forth in the complaint as to damages.  That is not improper, perhaps, but it is
nonetheless the case.  Nor is there a
Statement of Damages that was served prior to entry of the default.  There was a Statement of Damages that was
filed on February 13, 2024, but that was after default was entered.
Because of the foregoing, the court cannot enter an
award.  It is a denial of due process to
enter a judgment that is in excess of the number set forth in the complaint or
Statement of Damages (assuming the Statement of Damages is filed and served
before entry of default). 
Therefore, sadly, the court’s only course would be to vacate
entry of default, allow plaintiff to submit a Statement of Damages, and then
allow plaintiff to again seek default. 
Of course, once the defendant knows of the potential recovery, the
defendant might very well elect to answer rather than go by way of default,
which is the whole theory behind this doctrine.
The court will discuss this with plaintiff at today’s
hearing.  Given the facts of this case,
the court is not thrilled with this outcome. 
But the court is aware of no other course.  Any judgment entered under these
circumstances would be void on its face and unenforceable.
