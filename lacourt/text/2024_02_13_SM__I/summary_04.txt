And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions brought by the defense: a motion to compel further deposition of the plaintiff, McCourt, and a motion to deem requests for admission to be admitted. The court has considered the arguments presented by both sides and has decided to grant the motion to compel further deposition, but only for a limited period of time. The court has also decided to deem some of the requests for admission to be admitted, but has declined to do so for others. Additionally, the court has imposed sanctions on Fuller in the amount of $3905 for failing to verify his responses to the requests for admission in a timely manner. The court has encouraged the parties to resolve their disputes through negotiations and has expressed its frustration with the time wasted by the parties in preparing for and conducting the deposition.
