And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a request from the defendant to re-open discovery and set a trial date. The Judge has reviewed the opposition to the ex parte and the defendant's further statement. The Judge is concerned about whether the plaintiffs have assigned their claim, as the defendant claims that there is reason to believe that the claim was assigned to the carrier, which would mean that the plaintiffs lack standing. The Judge is also curious about the provenance of a draft complaint that was produced by the defendant.

The Judge believes that it is important to resolve the issue of whether the plaintiffs have assigned their claim before proceeding with the trial. The Judge also believes that the defendant has failed to demonstrate diligence in seeking to obtain discovery, and therefore the request to re-open discovery is denied.

The Judge intends to set a trial date in the relatively near future and discovery will remain closed. The Judge notes that the case will "jump the line" because the plaintiffs at least attempted to move forward with the FSC process, while the defense did not. The Judge also notes that the defendant will need to bring a motion to re-open discovery if it believes that discovery should be re-opened for a specific purpose.
