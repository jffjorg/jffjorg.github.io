And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike in this case. The demurrer has been overruled, allowing the request for declaratory relief to proceed. The court agrees that there is a controversy, which is enough to support a request for declaratory relief, even if the claims may be duplicative. The motion to strike has been denied. The court also notes that the request for punitive damages for breach of fiduciary duty may be thin, but it will be better tested on a motion for summary adjudication rather than a demurrer. Cross-defendant has 30 days to answer.
