And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has posted a tentative ruling for a case management conference (CMC) scheduled for December 5, 2024. Due to a conflict on the morning of the hearing, the court is providing a tentative ruling for parties to consider. The court notes that the parties' CMC statements do not demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with California Rules of Court Rule 3.724. Despite this, the court sets the following dates: trial on June 29, 2026, final status conference on June 18, 2026, and a status conference on February 4, 2026. The court also orders counsel to appear in person for the final status conference and to submit joint trial notebooks by June 16, 2026. Additionally, the court reminds parties that if they request a jury trial and have not yet paid jury fees, those fees are due by December 19, 2024, and failure to pay may result in the waiver of the right to a jury trial.
