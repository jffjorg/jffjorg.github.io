And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in a case management conference (CMC) setting dates for the parties. The Court notes that the parties' CMC statements do not reflect a good faith effort at compliance with California Rules of Court Rule 3.724, specifically regarding the timing of completion of discovery and Meet and Confer. Despite this, the Court sets the following dates: trial on June 29, 2026, at 10:00 a.m., final status conference on June 18, 2026, at 9:30 a.m., and status conference on February 4, 2026, at 8:30 a.m. The Court also orders counsel to appear in person for the final status conference and to deliver Joint Trial Notebooks by June 16, 2026. Additionally, the Court reminds parties that if they request a jury trial but have not yet posted jury fees, those fees are due by December 19, 2024, and failure to pay may result in their right to a jury trial being waived.
