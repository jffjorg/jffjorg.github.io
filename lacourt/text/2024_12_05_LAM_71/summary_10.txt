And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a preliminary decision regarding a case management conference (CMC) and an order to show cause hearing. The case is still in the early stages, and the defendant's response is not yet due. The court has noted that the plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that the defendant was served on November 14, 2024. As a result, the court has decided to continue the CMC and set a hearing on February 20, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. At this hearing, the court will consider whether the complaint should be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned $250 for failing to request entry of default against the defendant.
