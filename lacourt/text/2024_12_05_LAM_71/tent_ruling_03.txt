Meet and Confer
On November 12, 2024, the parties engaged in an
IDC before this Court, regarding Plaintiff’s RFP and the issues were deemed
unresolved.  (See 11/12/24 Minute
Order, pg. 4 of 5.)
 
1.    
Motion to Compel Further Responses- Carolwood
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses from Carolwood to Plaintiff’s RFP, the Court
rules as follows:
          On May 3, 2024, Plaintiff served RFP on Carolwood.  (Decl. of Dicecca ¶5, Exh. 1.)  On
July 2, 2024, Carolwood served unverified responses without accompanying
documents.  (Decl. of Dicecca ¶5.)  On or about July 23, 2024, Carolwood served
verifications to RFP without supplemental responses.  (Decl. of Dicecca ¶7, Exh. 3.)  Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses.  
          Plaintiff’s motion to compel further Code-compliant
responses from Carolwood to RFP Request Nos. 3, 5, 11-12, 17-19, 27, and
29 is granted.  The Court finds the objections raised in response to the RFPs
are nothing more than boilerplate.  (Korea
Data Systems Co. Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516.) To
the extent any documents are subject to privilege, Carolwood cannot simply
object to production on that basis; Carolwood must provide a Code-compliant
privilege log identifying with particularity each document it claims is
protected from disclosure and provide sufficient factual information for the
propounding party and court to evaluate whether the claim has merit.  (E.g., Catalina Island Yacht Club v.
Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1130, citing C.C.P. §§2031.240(b),
(c).)  Accordingly, Carolwood has failed
to justify its objection to these requests on the grounds of confidentiality.  Carolwood is ordered to provide
Code-compliant responses to RFP within 20 days of this ruling.
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $2,810.00 against Carolwood and its counsel, Lawrence
C. Ecoff, Alberto J. Campain, and Aristotle Alsua, jointly and severally.
          The Court awards sanctions against Carolwood and its
counsel, jointly and severally, pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.310(h) in the amount
of $936.67, calculated as follows:
(5.0 hours to prepare instant motions x $550.00/hour)
+ $60.00 filing fee = $2,810.00/3 motions = $936.67

The sanctions are payable,
jointly and severally, by Carolwood and its attorneys, Lawrence C. Ecoff,
Alberto J. Campain, and Aristotle Alsua, within 20 days of this order.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.

verifications to RFP without supplemental responses.  (Decl. of Dicecca ¶7, Exh. 3.)  Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses.  
          Plaintiff’s motion to compel further Code-compliant
responses from Rubin to RFP Request Nos. 5, 10, 13-14, 27-29, 33-34, and
40-43 is granted.  The Court finds the objections
raised in response to the RFPs are nothing more than boilerplate.  (Korea Data Systems Co. Ltd. v. Superior
Court (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516.) To the extent any documents

Accordingly, Rubin has failed to justify its objection to these requests
on the grounds of confidentiality.  Rubin
is ordered to provide Code-compliant responses to RFP within 20 days of this
ruling.
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $2,810.00 against Rubin and his counsel, Lawrence C.
Ecoff, Alberto J. Campain, and Aristotle Alsua, jointly and severally.
