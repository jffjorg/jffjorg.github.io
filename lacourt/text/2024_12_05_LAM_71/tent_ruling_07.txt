 Case Number:  24STCV11523    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2024    Dept:  71 NOTE: The Court has a conflict  on the morning of December 5, 2024.  For  the convenience of the parties, the Court is posting the following  tentative.  If the parties stipulate to  the tentative, so advise the Judicial Assistant upon checking in at 8:30 a.m. via  Court-Connect.  If either party wishes to  be heard, the Court will call the matter at 11:00 a.m. The matter is on calendar for a Case  Management Conference (CMC).  The Court  notes that the parties’ CMC Statements do not reflect a good faith effort at  compliance with California Rules of Court Rule 3.724.  Specifically, the Statements are silent on  the timing of completion of discovery and of any agreements reached at the  requisite Meet and Confer.  Notwithstanding  this failure, the Court sets the following dates: Trial:  June 29, 2026, at 10:00 a.m. Final Status Conference:  June 18, 2026, at 9:30 a.m.   Note that counsel are ordered to  appear in person for the Final Status Conference and to have their Joint Trial  Notebooks delivered to Department 71 by June 16, 2026.  See Department 71’s Information Page on the  Court’s website for details.             Status  Conference: February 4, 2026, at 8:30 a.m.             Joint  Status Conference Report:  January 28,  2026.   The Joint Status Conference Report  simply needs to advise the Court of the status of the parties’ discovery,  settlement efforts, and trial readiness.                If either  party requests a jury trial but has not yet posted jury fees, those fees are  due by December 19, 2024.  If fees are  not paid by then, that party’s right to a jury trial may be deemed waived.   Plaintiff is to give notice of this ruling.
