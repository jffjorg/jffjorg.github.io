And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer motion filed by the County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), a defendant in the case, against the complaint filed by plaintiff Irineo Domingo Duran III. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff failed to comply with the pre-litigation governmental claims presentation requirements under the Government Claims Act and the Tort Claims Act. The plaintiff alleges that he sustained injuries on February 20, 2019, while riding a defective "Jump Scooter" and that the MTA was negligent in maintaining the public property and supervising the "Juicers" who docked the scooters on the sidewalk.

The court holds that the plaintiff's failure to file a claim with the MTA within the six-month time limit bars his claims against the MTA. The court notes that the claim presentation period began on February 20, 2019, and that the plaintiff had until August 20, 2019, to file a claim directly with the MTA. The plaintiff failed to comply with this requirement, and therefore, his claims against the MTA are barred.

The court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be allowed to revise his complaint to include the required claim presentation information.
