And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendants, Dreamskin Spa Beverly Hills and Michele Goralnick. The plaintiff, Tannaz Nouri, alleges that the defendants are liable for medical malpractice and claims that the statute of limitations was tolled.

The judge has determined that the plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action and that the defendants are entitled to judgment on the pleadings. The judge has also determined that the plaintiff's notice of intent to sue was served within the 90-day period required by statute, which tolls the statute of limitations.

The judge has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the plaintiff's complaint states a cause of action and that the statute of limitations was tolled. The judge has also criticized the defendants' argument that the plaintiff did not wait the required 90-day period to file suit, finding that this argument is incongruous with the purpose of the statute.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 438, 439, 340.5, 364, and 365, as well as case law, including Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp., Wise v. Pacific Gas and Elec. Co., Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court, Larson v. UHS of Rancho Springs, Inc., Woods v. Young, Toigo v. Hayashida, and Russel v. Stanford Univ. Hosp.
