And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from April 30, 2024 to a date to be determined. The defendant filed a motion to continue the trial date to allow for her motion for summary judgment (MSJ) to be heard prior to trial. The plaintiff opposes the motion. The Judge finds that there is good cause to continue the trial date, citing that the defendant filed her MSJ within the time limits of CCP ยง 437c and that there is no prejudice shown to any party if the trial is continued. The Judge also notes that the parties must plan all discovery and trial preparation accordingly, and that the Court will not grant any further continuances.
