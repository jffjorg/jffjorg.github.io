And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion for summary adjudication will be taken off the calendar due to insufficient statutory notice. The motion was filed and served electronically on December 28, 2023, but the notice requirement of 75 days' notice before the hearing date was not met. The plaintiff is entitled to 75 days' notice to prepare for the hearing, and there is no stipulation to shorten the time. The judge has ordered the defendants to give notice and has encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. The parties are also advised to submit to the tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
