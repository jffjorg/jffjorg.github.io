Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel discovery responses from the defendant, Brian Sanchez Rojas. The plaintiff, Vincent Rossiello, had propounded form interrogatories on March 22, 2023, but the defendant failed to respond. The defendant claims that he served verified responses to the form interrogatories on January 12, 2024, but the plaintiff disputes this claim and asserts that he did not receive the responses. The judge finds that the defendant failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests and that the plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling the defendant to respond without objections. The judge also awards the plaintiff attorney fees and sanctions against the defendant and his attorney in the amount of $685. The defendant is ordered to serve verified responses to the plaintiff's form interrogatories within 15 days and to pay sanctions within 20 days.
