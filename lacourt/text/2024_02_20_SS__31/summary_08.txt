And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's petition for relief from failure to file a timely claim with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA). The plaintiff alleged that she was a passenger on a city bus that abruptly stopped, causing her to hit her forehead. She claimed that she failed to file a timely claim with LACMTA due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had waited too long to file her claim, which exceeded the one-year deadline specified in the Government Code. Additionally, the judge determined that there was no statutory ground for which LACMTA should have granted the plaintiff's late claim application. The judge also noted that the plaintiff failed to exercise due diligence in determining the proper entity to file her claim with. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's petition for relief.
