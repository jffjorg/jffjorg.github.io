Summary in English text:

The judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, issues a tentative ruling granting Defendant Target Corporation's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiff Maria Sanchez's failure to provide adequate discovery responses. The judge finds that Defendant complied with the procedural requirements, including attending a meet and confer conference and an informal discovery conference (IDC), and that Plaintiff failed to appear at the IDC conferences and did not comply with promises made concerning discovery responses. The judge awards sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $1,850.00. The judge also grants Defendant's motion to compel further responses and orders Plaintiff to provide further responses to the requests within 20 days.
