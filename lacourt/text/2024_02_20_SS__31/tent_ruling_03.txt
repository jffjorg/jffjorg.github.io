Background¿ On March 22, 2023, plaintiff Vincent Rossiello (“Plaintiff”) propounded form interrogatories, set one, on defendant Brian Sanchez Rojas (“Defendant”). After having received no response, Plaintiff’s counsel sent letters to defense counsel on May 2, 2023 and June 15, 2023 requesting responses without objections. To date, Defendant has not served responses. Plaintiff therefore seeks an order compelling Defendant to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  In opposition, Defendant contends he served verified responses to the form interrogatories and requests for admission on January 12, 2024, and served verified responses to special interrogatories and request for production of documents on February 1, 2024.  In reply, Plaintiff disputes the claim that Defendant had served verified responses and contends Defendant’s opposition did not attach the purported verified responses as proof. Plaintiff’s counsel declares he did not receive verified responses.   II. Motion to Compel For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); § 2031.300, subd. (a).)    The evidence shows Defendant was properly served with discovery and failed to respond. Although Defendant opposes the motion, Defendant has not substantiated the claim that verified responses were served, especially in light of Plaintiff’s representation that verified responses were not in fact received. Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered to serve verified responses to Plaintiff’s form interrogatories, set one, without objections, within fifteen (15) days. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a),(b).)  III. Sanctions¿ Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c).) Defendant did not successfully oppose the motion. Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $1,060 for the motion. A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)       Plaintiff is awarded 1.5 hours to prepare the motion and reply together, and one hour to appear at the hearing, all at the requested rate of $250 per hour, for a total of $625 in attorney fees. Further, Plaintiff is awarded one motion filing fee of $60, as costs.      Sanctions are sought and imposed against Defendant and his attorney of record. Defendant and/or his counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $685, within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 16th day of February 2024      Hon.
