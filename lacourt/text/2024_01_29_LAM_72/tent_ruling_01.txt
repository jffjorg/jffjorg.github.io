                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
 
FREEVOLT USA, INC.,

 Case No: 
  23STCV12545 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 29, 2024
 Calendar Number:  3



 
 
 
 
Plaintiff TP I Investment, LLC (“Plaintiff”) seeks default
judgment against Defendant Freevolt USA, Inc. (“Defendant”).
 
Plaintiff requests:
 
(1)  damages
in the amount of $241,608.72;
 
(2)  interest
in the amount of $21,859.00; and
 
(3) costs of suit in the amount of $570.00.
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for default judgment.  Case law indicates that an assignment of
interest in a debt must be reflected in the complaint in order to form a basis
for a default judgment.  Accordingly,
service of an amended complaint reflecting the assignment will be necessary.
 
Background
 
          This
is a contract case. On April 26, 2021, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a
written agreement (the “Agreement”) for Defendant to install a solar panel
system at Plaintiff’s property. The solar panel was still not operational as of
November 3, 2023.
 
The Agreement provided that if the solar panel system was
not operating by September 25, 2021, Defendant would pay Phuc Thien Phan, the
Managing Member of Plaintiff, a sum of $30,000.00. (Phan Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. A at
p. 1.) In addition, Defendant would pay Mr. Phan’s electric bill for the meter
connected to solar for each month that the system was not operational from
September 25, 2021 until the system is fully operational with permission to
operate from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (“LADWP”). (Phan
Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. A at p. 1.)
 
          Defendant
has not made the foregoing payments.
 
          Plaintiff
filed this action on June 6, 2023.
 
Default was entered  against
Defendant on September 6, 2023.
 
Plaintiff filed this application for default judgment on
November 15, 2023.
 
December 18, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on
default judgment because Phan, who is not a party, and not Plaintiff, was the
real party in interest.
 
On January 8, Plaintiff filed a Declaration of Phuc Thien
Phan indicating that Phan had assigned his rights to receive payments for his
electricity bill and to sue on the nonpayment thereof to Plaintiff.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7);
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief requested
(Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief. “[W]hen recovering damages in a default judgment, the
plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint.” (Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.)  
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
The proof of service filed by Plaintiff on August 22, 2023
shows that E. Ratliff served the complaint and summons on Defendant’s
authorized agent for service of process, Bartosz Makas, on June 13, 2023 at
42005 Cook Street, Suite 310, Palm Desert, CA 92260.
 
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Court has dismissed the Doe defendants from this case at
Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Dana Seyler avers that Defendant is not in military service.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in the
Declaration of Phuc Thien Phan. 
 
As noted above, under the Agreement, Defendant owes the late
fee and electricity bill reimbursements to Phan, who is not a party to this
action. Ordinarily an LLC is considered a separate legal entity, distinct from
its members and managers, with separate and distinct liabilities and obligations.
(Curci Investments, LLC v. Baldwin (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 214, 220.)
Phan’s rights are therefore separate from Plaintiff’s rights, even though Phan
is the managing member of Plaintiff. Thus, Phan is the real party in interest
in this action, and ordinarily must be joined as a plaintiff.  
 
At the previous hearing on this application for default
judgment, Plaintiff’s counsel suggested that Phan assign his rights to
Plaintiff. The Court continued the hearing to allow Plaintiff to do so.
 
Upon further research, however, it appears that evidence
alone of assignment is not sufficient. “Generally, one suing as an assignee
must allege and prove the assignment to recover on the assigned claim.” (Emerald
Bay Community Assn. v. Golden Eagle Ins. Corp. (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1078,
1091.) “However, unless defendant could show it was misled or would be
prejudiced by plaintiff's failure to allege the assignment, the trial court
would have probably abused its discretion if it denied recovery solely on this
ground.” (Ibid.) The assignment of the right to sue is not a
technicality, but a substantive right which must be alleged and proven like any
other material allegation. (Sterling Adjustment Co. v. Laher Auto Spring Co.
(1931) 116 Cal.App. 100, 101.)
 
Although the facts alleged in the complaint (other than
damages) are deemed admitted on default judgment, they must still be alleged.
Furthermore, it is possible that defendant was prejudiced by lack of the
allegation of an assignment.  For
example, a defendant may choose to default because it does not believe that the
party suing it is actually able to obtain relief.
 
Thus, in order for Plaintiff to recover on the contract, it
must amend the Complaint to allege the assignment of Phan’s rights to recover
on the contract to Plaintiff and serve the amended complaint on Defendant. If
Defendant defaults on the amended complaint, Plaintiff may then seek default
judgment as normal.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
Phan avers that he is owed $211,608.72 in electricity bills
under the agreement, plus the $30,000.00 late fee. (Phan Decl. ¶ 4-8; Exh. A at
p. 1.)
 
 
Interest
 
Plaintiff seeks interest in the amount of $21,859.00. Dana
Seyler avers to the accuracy of this calculation based on the statutory rate of
10% per annum. (Seylers Decl. at ¶ 2, Unmarked Exbibit at p. 1; see also Civ.
Code, § 3289, subd. (b).) 
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff provides a memorandum of costs wherein Dana Seyler
avers that Plaintiff spent $570.00 in costs on this action.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
          Plaintiff
does not seek attorney’s fees in this action.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
          Plaintiff
provides a proposed form of judgment.
 
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
          California
Rule of Court 3.1806 states that “unless otherwise ordered” judgment upon a
written obligation requires a clerk’s note across the face of the writing that
there has been a judgment. Here, Plaintiff has not submitted the original
documents. The Court does not discern any practical need for such a clerk’s
note on the written obligation in the current case and therefore orders that it
need not be included. If this causes any issues for any party or non-party they
are authorized to bring the matter to the Court’s attention.  
 
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
