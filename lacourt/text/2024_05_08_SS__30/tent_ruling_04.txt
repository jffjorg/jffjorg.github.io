 Case Number:  20STCV40739    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  30 RODOLFO ZARATE BLANCO vs KIRSTIE LEE WALKER, et al.TENTATIVEDefendants’ motion for a protective order is DENIED. Both parties’ request for sanctions is DENIED. Moving party to give notice.Legal Standard“Before, during, or after a deposition, any party, any deponent, or any other affected natural person or organization may promptly move for a protective order.” (CCP § 2025.420(a).) This motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under CCP section 2016.040. (Ibid.) “The court, for good cause shown, may make an order that justice requires to protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.” (CCP § 2025.420(b).)CCP section 2025.420(b) provides a nonexclusive list of permissible directions that may be included in a protective order. (Nativi v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 316.) These directions include, inter alia, that the deposition not be taken at all; or that the deposition be taken on specified terms and conditions. (CCP §§ 2025.420(b)(1); 2025.420(b)(5).) Ultimately, “the burden is on the party seeking the protective order to show good cause for whatever order is sought.” (Nativi, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at 318.)The court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion for a protective order, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2025.420(h).)DiscussionDefendants move for a protective order, barring the deposition of CHP Officer J. Inzunza or requiring Defendants to provide Plaintiff with video remote access at Defendants' expense. Plaintiff argues that the deposition and a Court hearing in this department were set on the same day without knowledge or fault of either side, but upon learning of the conflict, Defendant deliberately reset the deposition 113 miles further from the initial location, and again, for the same time as the court hearing, thereby displaying contempt for the priority of the court hearing and an intent to make it impossible for Plaintiff’s counsel, known by defense to be solely representing Plaintiff, to attend both proceedings. Further, Plaintiff argues that Defendants engaged in the misuse of discovery by refusing to provide remote video access to Plaintiff’s counsel through Zoom. Plaintiff argues forcing Plaintiff’s counsel who is 67 years old to attend in-person would be an undue risk to his health from contracting COVID.In opposition, Defendants argue the motion is moot. Defendants argue this motion pertains to an old deposition notice and subpoena served on March 27, 2024 (two more amended subpoenas were served on April 2, 2024 and April 24, 2024 in Defendants’ attempt to accommodate Plaintiff’s counsel). Most notably, the most recent Third Amended Deposition Notice and Subpoena for Officer Inzunza rescheduled the deposition to May 9, 2024, at 10 a.m., with videoconference option, and all of Plaintiff’s issues are now resolved.The Court finds the motion is moot as the deposition is now set for a date that is not in conflict with the Court hearing, and there is a remote option.As the motion is denied, Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is also denied.Plaintiff’s request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)Defendant’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff is also denied. Although the motion for a protective order was unsuccessful, Plaintiff had substantial justification at the time to move for a protective order.ConclusionBased on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for a protective order is DENIED. Both parties’ request for sanctions is DENIED.
