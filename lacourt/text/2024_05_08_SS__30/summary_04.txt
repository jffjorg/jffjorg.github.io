And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the defendants' motion for a protective order, which sought to prevent the deposition of CHP Officer J. Inzunza. The defendants had also requested sanctions against the plaintiff. The judge finds that the motion is moot, as the deposition has been rescheduled to a date that is not in conflict with the court hearing, and there is a remote option available. The plaintiff's request for sanctions is also denied, as the court cannot impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery. The defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff is also denied, as the plaintiff had substantial justification at the time to move for a protective order. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's motion for a protective order is denied, and both parties' requests for sanctions are denied.
