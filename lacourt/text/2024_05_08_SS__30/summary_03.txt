significant_statements:
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.

(Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014))
  - "Lack of diligence may be deemed willful in the sense that the party understood his obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to comply." (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978))
```

And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's unopposed motion for terminating sanctions, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint against the defendant with prejudice. The court finds that the plaintiff has been engaging in discovery abuse and has failed to comply with the court's order to respond to discovery. The court concludes that terminating sanctions are warranted in this instance, as the plaintiff has willfully misused the discovery process. The court also denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, finding that it would be duplicative.
