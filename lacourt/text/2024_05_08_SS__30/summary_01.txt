And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant moves to compel the plaintiff's physical independent medical examination (IME) after the plaintiff failed to appear for the scheduled examination. The defendant also requests sanctions for the plaintiff's failure to appear. However, the defendant's motion does not comply with the legal requirements for a motion to compel a physical examination, as it does not specify the time, place, identity and specialty of the examiner, and the manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination. Therefore, the motion is denied. Additionally, the defendant's request for sanctions is denied.
