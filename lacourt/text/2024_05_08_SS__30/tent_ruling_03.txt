 Case Number:  20STCV31220    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  30 FRANK E. GRODSKI vs SOKAINA QUABADITENTATIVEDefendant’s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions dismissing Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendant is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendant is dismissed with prejudice.Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.Legal Standard"The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang v. Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 (citation omitted).)"Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders." (Id. (citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244- 1246); see, e.g., Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 (terminating sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery); Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal App 3d 481, 491 (disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCucchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4) (terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes).)DiscussionDefendant moves for terminating and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff based on Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s February 8, 2024 order to respond to discovery.On February 8, 2024, this Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories, and Request for Production. The Court ordered Plaintiff to serve verified responses, without objections, to the discovery at issue within 20 days. (2/8/2024 Minute Order.) Plaintiff was present at the hearing. (Id.) On the same day, the clerk mailed the Notice of Ruling on the parties. (2/8/2024 Certificate of Mailing.) To date, Plaintiff failed to provide the responses as ordered by the Court. (Rubin Decl., ¶ 10.)The Court finds Plaintiff has been engaging in discovery abuse. Defendant propounded on Plaintiff discovery requests, yet Plaintiff failed to comply with his discovery obligations. Further, Plaintiff has also failed to provide responses to the discovery, even after this Court ordered him to do so. Based on Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s Order, the Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted in this instance. Additionally, Plaintiff has not filed an opposition, and thereby has failed to explain why she failed to comply with the Court’s order. As a result, the Court finds that Plaintiff has willfully misused the discovery process by this lack of diligence. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787 [“Lack of diligence may be deemed willful in the sense that the party understood his obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to comply.”]) Also, Plaintiff’s failure to comply is detrimental to Defendant’s ability to prepare for trial. As such, because there is a willful history of discovery abuse after numerous attempts to obtain such discovery, to the detriment of Defendant, the motion for terminating sanctions is granted.As the motion for terminating sanctions is granted, the request for monetary sanctions is denied as it would be duplicative.ConclusionBased on the foregoing, Defendant’s unopposed motion for terminating sanctions dismissing Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendant is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s complaint against Defendant is dismissed with prejudice.Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.
