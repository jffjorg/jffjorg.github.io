And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The defendant, Energy Rentals, LLC, has filed a motion for leave to file an amended answer to the original answer, which incorrectly named Energy Rentals, LLC as the defendant. The defendant argues that the correct defendant is actually Clean Initiative, LLC, and that the error was due to a mistake. However, the court has denied the motion because it does not comply with California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324. Specifically, the motion does not provide the required information about what allegations are proposed to be deleted or added, nor does it provide a declaration that meets the requirements of Rule 3.1324(b). As a result, the defendant's motion for leave to file an amended answer is denied without prejudice.
