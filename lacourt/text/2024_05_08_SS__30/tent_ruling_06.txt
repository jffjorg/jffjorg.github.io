 Case Number:  21STCV09786    Hearing Date:   May 8, 2024    Dept:  30 ANNASTACIA LAMBRINOS vs SHIRIN TOWFIGH, M.D.TENTATIVEDefendant’s motion for summary judgment is DENIED. Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.Legal StandardThe function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) CCP Section 437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facia showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(2).) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)ObjectionsThe Court declines to rule on Defendants’ objections to Plaintiff’s evidence as the evidence was not relied upon by the Court. While the Court “must” rule on all evidentiary objections made at the summary judgment stage, it is permitted to focus its attention on those which are “important.” (See Reid v. Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 532; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (q) [the court need only rule those objections to evidence that were material in the disposition of the MSJ].)DiscussionDefendant seeks summary judgment of the cause of action for medical malpractice. However, the FAC raises two main claims. The first claim relates to Plaintiff’s alleged allergic reaction to Ovitext mesh and or polypropylene sutures and Defendant’s performing of surgeries without removing the mesh. The second claim at issue in the FAC relates to damages to Plaintiff’s urethra arising out of Defendant’s placement of the catheter. While Defendant initially moved for summary judgment as to both claims, the parties subsequently stipulated to remove the claims relating to the urethra from this motion. Thus, based on the parties’ stipulation, Defendant is only moving for summary judgment as to the claims relating to the mesh. Unfortunately, Defendant moved only for summary judgment. Defendant did not alternatively move for summary adjudication, so the Court cannot rule on individual claims. (See Jimenez v. Protective Life Ins. Co. (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 528, 534 [noting that courts may not grant summary adjudication when motion was only for summary judgment]; see also Slovensky v. Friedman (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1518, 1527, 49 Cal.Rptr.3d 60 [absent alternative motion for summary adjudication, defendant “must show conclusively” that all of the plaintiff's causes of action or legal theories fail as a matter of law]; cf. Barber v. Chang (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1456, 1469, 60 Cal.Rptr.3d 760 [where defendant failed to meet burden and did not alternatively move for summary adjudication on another ground, summary judgment was improper].)As such, Defendant has not shown that Plaintiff’s cause of action fails as a matter of law without addressing the allegations relating to the urethra. The Court is precluded from ruling on this motion for summary judgment. The motion is DENIED.ConclusionBased on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
