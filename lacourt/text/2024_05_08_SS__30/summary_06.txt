And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the Judge's thinking based on information presented before the Court. The Defendant, SHIRIN TOWFIGH, M.D., moved for summary judgment, claiming that the Plaintiff, ANNASTACIA LAMBRINOS, has no valid cause of action for medical malpractice. The Judge ruled that the Defendant did not meet the burden of showing that the Plaintiff's cause of action has no merit, and therefore the motion for summary judgment is DENIED. The Plaintiff is ordered to give notice. The Judge also noted that the Defendant failed to alternatively move for summary adjudication, which is a separate motion that allows the Court to rule on individual claims.
