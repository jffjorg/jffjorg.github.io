**English Text Summary**

The judge grants Woojoo Kim's motion to vacate the default and default judgment. The court finds that Woojoo Kim did not receive actual notice of the complaint and that the default judgment was obtained through mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect. The court also finds that Woojoo Kim diligently sought relief upon execution of the writ to the bank account and that the underlying collection unfairly imposes a hardship on Woojoo Kim, thereby warranting adjudication on the merits.
