On July 12, 2022, the court granted the motion of
Defendant Haute
House Home Furnishings, Inc. to compel arbitration. On March 26, 2024, the
court restored the case to the civil active calendar pursuant to the parties
oral stipulation. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Counsel for
Defendant Haute
House Home Furnishings, Inc. moves to be relieved as counsel of record,
due to “Professional considerations require termination of representation. See
ABA Opinion 476.” The court electronic filing system shows no opposition or
reply on file at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff. 
 
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to
withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) The court
accepts the “professional considerations” concern. The court will meet counsel
in chambers, if requested. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6068, subd. (e); Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1133; Aceves
v. Superior Court (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 584, 590- 593.) The motion
otherwise complies with all procedural requirements. The unchallenged motion is
therefore granted. 
 
Order not effective until service on the client. The
corporate entity, in whatever form, cannot appear in the action without
representation from an admitted attorney, if applicable. (Merco Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d
724, 731.)
 
The court will concurrently conduct the case management
conference.
