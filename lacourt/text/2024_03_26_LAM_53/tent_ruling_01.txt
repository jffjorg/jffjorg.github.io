  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to strike answer and for
  monetary sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff JG Concepts Inc.      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Strike Answer and for Monetary Sanctions
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff JG Concepts Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
(1) striking the answer filed by defendant Jeremy Mathiason (“Defendant”) and
entering his default, and          (2)
awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $1,635.  Plaintiff moves for
this relief on the ground that Defendant did not comply with the court’s
November 22, 2023 order. 
If
a party engages in a misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose
monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.)  Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010 provides, in relevant part, that “[m]isuses of the discovery
process include, but are not limited to, the following: . . . . (d) Failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. . . . . (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.”¿ Moreover, if a party fails to
obey an order compelling answers to interrogatories pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, “the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  In lieu of or in addition to that sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction” pursuant to that chapter.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
“The
trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after
considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to
determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party;
and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’”¿ (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390, quoting Lang
v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)¿ “Generally, ‘[a] decision
to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.¿ But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’”¿ (Los
Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation
omitted].)¿¿¿ 
“Under
this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when
parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”  (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.
App. 4th at p. 390, citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal. App. 4th at pp.
1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson & Kaplan v. Hartunian
(1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating sanctions imposed after
defendants failed to comply with one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna
Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 481, 491,
disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal. 4th
469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to
comply with a discovery order and for violating various discovery
statutes].)¿¿¿ 
On November
22, 2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant to serve responses
to its Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories and ordered Defendant
to serve, without objections and within 20 days of the date of service of the
court’s order, full and complete verified answers (1) to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, and (2) to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories.  (Nov. 22, 2023 Order, p. 2:13-19.)  The court also imposed monetary sanctions
against Defendant and in favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $935, to be paid within
90 days of the date of service of the court’s order.  (Id., p. 2:20-21.)  Plaintiff served Defendant with notice of the
court’s November 22, 2023 order by email on November 27, 2023, and again on
December 20, 2023, by mail and email. 
(Nov. 27, 2023 Notice of Ruling, p. 6 [Nov. 27, 2023 Proof of Service];
Feb. 20, 2024 Proof of Service of Minute Order, p. 5 [Dec. 20, 2023 Proof of
Service].)  Plaintiff has presented
evidence showing that Defendant did not timely serve responses to its discovery
and had not served responses as of the date that Plaintiff filed this motion on
February 20, 2024.  (Meaglia Decl.,
¶¶ 6-7.)  Defendant has not filed an
opposition to this motion establishing that responses have since been served. 
The court
finds that Defendant’s failure to comply with the court’s order to serve
responses to Plaintiff’s discovery is prejudicial to Plaintiff because the
interrogatories request information that is central to its claims in this
action.  For example, Form
Interrogatories numbers 12.1, 15.0, 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, and 50.6
request information regarding any known witnesses, the facts on which Defendant
bases his (i) denial of material allegations and (ii) special or affirmative
defenses, and facts concerning the contract alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint,
any contended breaches thereof, excusals of performance thereunder, and the enforceability
of any such agreements.  (Mot. to Compel
Responses filed by Plaintiff on April 5, 2023, Meaglia Decl., Ex. 2, Form
Interrogatories, pp. 5, 6, 8.)  Similarly,
Special Interrogatory number 1 asks if Defendant contends that he does not owe
money to Plaintiff, and numbers 2-4 request information supporting that
contention.  (Mot. to Compel Responses
filed by Plaintiff on April 5, 2023, Meaglia Decl., Ex. 1, Special
Interrogatories, p. 2:17-25.)  The other
interrogatories request information regarding any contention that Defendant owes
money to Plaintiff and any work performed by Plaintiff on behalf of
Defendant.  (Mot. to Compel Responses
filed by Plaintiff on April 5, 2023, Meaglia Decl., Ex. 1, Special
Interrogatories, pp. 2:26-3:18.) 
Thus, the
court finds that the information requested in the Form Interrogatories and
Special Interrogatories is directly relevant to Plaintiff’s claims against
Defendant, which are based on the allegations that (1) Plaintiff and Defendant
entered into various oral agreements, pursuant to which Plaintiff would perform
work for Defendant at different construction projects, and (2) although
Plaintiff performed work for Defendant as agreed, Defendant has not paid
Plaintiff.  (Compl., ¶¶ 8-12 14-16,
18-19, 21.)  The court therefore finds
that Defendant’s failure to respond to this discovery is prejudicial to
Plaintiff. 
Based on
the evidence presented, and in light of the fact that Defendant did not file an
opposition to Plaintiff’s motion, the court finds that Defendant has engaged in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process by willfully disobeying the
court’s November 22, 2023 order and by failing to submit to authorized methods
of discovery (i.e., Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories and Special
Interrogatories).  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010, subds. (g), (d), 2030.290, subd. (c).)  The court has also determined that Defendant’s
failure to respond to this discovery is prejudicial to Plaintiff for the
reasons set forth above.  The evidence
further shows that the less severe sanctions of monetary sanctions issued by
the court in its November 22, 2023 order has not produced compliance by
Defendant with the discovery rules or the court’s order.  Finally, Defendant has not filed opposition
papers or other evidence with the court disputing his failure to comply with
the court’s order or setting forth other circumstances for the court to
consider in connection with this motion. 
The court therefore finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its
discretion, to impose terminating sanctions against Defendant pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (d).
The court
grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.030, subd.
(a), 2030.290, subd. (c).)  The court
finds that $1,110 ((3 hours x $350 hourly rate) + $60 motion filing fee) is a
reasonable amount of monetary sanctions to impose against Defendant.  (Meaglia Decl., ¶ 15.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff JG
Concepts Inc.’s motion to strike answer and for monetary sanctions.
            The court orders that the answer
filed by defendant Jeremy Mathiason on February 14, 2023 is stricken.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d)(1).) 
            The court orders plaintiff JG
Concepts Inc. to file a Request for Entry of Default (Judicial Council form
CIV-100) as to defendant Jeremy Mathiason no later than April 5, 2024.  
            The court sets an Order to Show
Cause re entry of default and default judgment for hearing on June 25, 2024, at
8:30 a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders plaintiff JG
Concepts Inc. to file default judgment documents required by California Rules
of Court, rule 3.1800 (including a proposed judgment on Judicial Council form JUD-100)
no later than May 31, 2024.    
            The court vacates the Final Status
Conference set for November 8, 2024, and the trial set for November 20, 2024. 
            The court orders plaintiff JG
Concepts Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
