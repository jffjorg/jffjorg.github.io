And here is a summary in English text:

The judge, Robert B. Broadbelt III, has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff, Emilio Reyes, leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint. The plaintiff seeks to remove certain causes of action against defendants Andrew Salas, Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc., Lorraine Ann Escobar, and Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC, and add new facts and bases in support of his claims. The court finds that the plaintiff has not justified his delay in seeking to amend his complaint and that the defendants would be unduly prejudiced if the amendment were allowed. The court notes that the plaintiff's proposed amendment would require additional discovery and potentially delay the trial, which would cause added costs and increased discovery burdens for the defendants. As a result, the court denies the plaintiff's motion for leave to file the Fourth Amended Complaint.
