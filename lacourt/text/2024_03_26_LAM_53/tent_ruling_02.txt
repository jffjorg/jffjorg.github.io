Order
  RE:
 
defendants’ motion to compel arbitration 
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:
            Defendants Church of
Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., and Religious Technology
Center
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Jane Doe
Motion to Compel Arbitration
Defendants Church of Scientology International, Bridge Publications,
Inc., and Religious Technology Center (“Defendants”) filed the pending motion
to compel arbitration on September 18, 2023, moving the court for an order
compelling plaintiff Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”) to submit the claims alleged in her
complaint to binding arbitration.
On February 14, 2024, the court issued an order (1) noting defects
with the parties’ papers, and (2) continuing the hearing on this motion (i) to
give Plaintiff an opportunity to file an amended opposition memorandum that
complied with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, and (ii) to give
Defendants an opportunity to file a revised application to seal.  (Feb. 14, 2024 Order, pp. 1:23,
2:18-22.)  The court further set a
hearing on Defendants’ application to seal for March 26, 2024, and ordered
Defendants to file an amended application no later than February 28, 2024.  (Feb. 14, 2024 Order, p. 3:10-15.) 
On February 28, 2024, defendant Religious Technology Center filed a
“Notice of Intent Not to File Certain Exhibits Under Seal,” stating that it
believed that the documents should be placed in the public record.  (Def. Notice, p. 3:3-9.)  Thus, Defendants did not file a revised
application to seal.  Thereafter, on
March 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to seal documents that have been filed
in connection with the motion to compel arbitration.  Plaintiff’s motion to seal is set for hearing
on April 16, 2024, i.e., after the date that the motion to compel arbitration
is set for hearing.  As set forth above,
the court set for hearing a motion to seal filed by Defendants, and did not set
for hearing a motion to seal filed by Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not file an ex parte
application requesting that the court advance the hearing on her motion to seal
to be heard concurrently with Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration.  
In order for the court to establish what the evidentiary record will
be on the motion to compel arbitration, the court exercises its discretion to
continue the hearing on Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration to April 16,
2024, so that it can be heard with Plaintiff’s motion to seal. 
ORDER
The court orders that (1) the hearing on defendants Church of
Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., and Religious Technology
Center’s motion to compel arbitration, and (2) the Case Management Conference
are continued from March 26, 2024, to April 16, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in
Department 53. 
The court orders that the briefing and evidence presented in
connection with the motion to compel arbitration has been completed and is now
closed.  The court therefore orders that
the parties shall not file any additional evidence, briefing, or papers in
connection with the motion to compel arbitration. 
 
 
 
 
The court orders defendants Church of Scientology International and
Bridge Publications, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  March 22, 2024
