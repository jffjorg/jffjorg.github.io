Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on the defendants' motion to compel arbitration to April 16, 2024, to be heard with the plaintiff's motion to seal. The defendants, Church of Scientology International, Bridge Publications, Inc., and Religious Technology Center, had filed a motion to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff, Jane Doe, opposes. The court had previously ordered the parties to file amended papers, but the defendants did not file a revised application to seal. The plaintiff has filed a motion to seal documents, which is set for hearing on a later date. The judge is continuing the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration to allow the court to establish the evidentiary record and to hear the motion to seal. The parties are not allowed to file any additional evidence, briefing, or papers in connection with the motion to compel arbitration.
