 TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendants
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and Marco Garcia’s Demurrer
is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend as to allege the date he filed his
claim against the LA County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in compliance
with the Government Claims Act Compliance, and OVERRULED as to the
1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th
causes of action. Plaintiff Aaron Celious (“Celious”)
does not plead when his alleged GCA claim was filed, but only that the alleged
GCA claim was rejected on February 2, 2023. (Compl., ¶ 16.) The rejection date
is not enough to plead compliance with the GCA.  Moreover, Celious fails to allege facts showing
the claim he made was timely filed within one year “after the accrual of the cause
of action. (Govt. Code 911.2.)  The
general demurrer to the complaint for failure to allege timely compliance with
the GCA is SUSTAINED, with leave to amend.
