TENTATIVE
RULING
            
            Defendants Falakassa Law, P.C and
Joshua S. Falakassa’s Demurrer without Motion to Strike is OVERRULED as to the
Plaintiff Sarbjit Gill’s 1st cause of action for Negligence and  2nd cause of action for Breach of
Fiduciary Duty.  Defendants argue
Plaintiff does not plead the required facts to states causes of action for
Negligence and Breach of Fiduciary Duty, plus the complaint is uncertain. “[D]emurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored, and are granted only if the pleading is so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.” (Lickiss v.
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th
1125, 1135, 146 Cal.Rptr.3d 173.) 
 
            Plaintiff pleads all the required elements of a claim for
professional negligence, or attorney malpractice, for the 1st cause
of action. (See Compl., ¶¶ 5–9; see also CACI, 601; Schultz v. Harney
(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1621. [“The elements of a cause of action for attorney
malpractice are: (1) the duty of the attorney to use such skill, prudence and
diligence as members of the profession commonly possess; (2) a breach of that
duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting
injury; and (4) actual loss or damage.”] 
Plaintiff pleads all the required elements of the 2nd cause
of action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty. (See Compl., 5–8; see also Mendoza
v. Continental Sales Co., Inc. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1405 [“The
elements of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty are (1) the existence of a
fiduciary relationship, (2) its breach, and (3) damage proximately caused by
that breach.”].)  Plaintiff’s the
complaint is not so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond
