And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants (Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Marco Garcia, and Nustats LLC) is sustained in part and overruled in part. The judge has sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend as to the cause of action related to the Government Claims Act (GCA) compliance, as the plaintiff (Aaron Celious) failed to plead when his alleged GCA claim was filed and did not show timely filing of the claim. The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff failed to plead compliance with the GCA and failed to show that the claim was timely filed within one year after the accrual of the cause of action.
