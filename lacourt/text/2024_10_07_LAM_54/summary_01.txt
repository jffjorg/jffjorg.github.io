And here is a plain English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has reviewed the case documents and is issuing a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the complaint. The defendant, Sang Jun Jin, is challenging the plaintiff's claims of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, arguing that he does not owe the plaintiff a duty of care or a fiduciary duty as a property manager acting on behalf of the Homeowner's Association. The judge has found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the existence of a duty and that the defendant breached that duty by failing to remedy the conditions of the neighboring unit. Therefore, the judge is overruling the defendant's demurrer and ordering the defendant to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 30 days.
