And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion filed by James Rodriguez, the judgment creditor, to reassign the judgment in the case against The Boys, LLC, et al. The judgment creditor originally assigned the judgment to Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC, but the assignee has been suspended by the California Secretary of State for nonpayment of taxes and has refused to reassign the judgment back to the judgment creditor. The judge finds that the judgment creditor maintains an equitable interest in the judgment and that the assignee's failure to reassign the judgment is a breach of its fiduciary duty. The judge therefore orders the judgment to be reassigned back to the judgment creditor.
