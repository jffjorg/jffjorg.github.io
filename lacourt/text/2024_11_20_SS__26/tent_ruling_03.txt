ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff James
Rodriguez (“Judgment Creditor”) filed the instant action for civil rights
violations against Defendant The Boys, LLC (“Judgment Debtor”) on February 29,
2008. Default judgment was entered against Judgment Debtor on April 14, 2009. On
September 29, 2008, Judgment Creditor filed a Notice of Case Assignment. Acknowledgment
of Partial Satisfaction of Judgment was filed on August 22, 2011 and April 2,
2015. The judgment was renewed on October 24, 2018. 
 
On September 16,
2024, Judgment Creditor filed the instant Motion for Order Reassigning
Judgment. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Judgment Creditor moves for an order reassigning the
judgment in this case back to them from Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC, the Assignee
of Record. The Motion is made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(4), and sections 177, 187, and 410.50, which give the Court inherent
equitable, statutory, and jurisdictional powers to enforce their judgments and
compel obedience to their orders. (See Blueberry Properties, LLC v. Chow
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1020-1021.) Judgment Creditor assigned the
judgment in this action to Judgment Assignee, which has since been suspended by
the California Secretary of State for nonpayment of taxes. (Motion, Rodriguez
Decl., Exhs. 1-2.) Despite multiple requests, Judgment Assignee refuses to
reassign the judgment back to Judgment Creditor. (Id. at ¶6-8 and Exh.
3.) Judgment Creditor maintains an equitable interest in the judgment, despite
assigning it to Judgment Assignee. (See Clark v. Andrews (1952) 109
Cal.App.2d 193, 198-199.) Judgment Assignee’s failure to reassign the judgment
back to Judgment Creditor is a breach of its fiduciary duty to Judgment
Creditor. (See Cross v. Bonded Adjustment Bureau (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th
266, 276-277 [citing Elam v. Arzaga (1932) 122 Cal.App. 742].)
Accordingly, Judgment Creditor is entitled to an order reassigning the judgment
back to them to pursue enforcement proceedings. 
 
Conclusion
 
Judgment Creditor James
Rodriguez’s Motion for Order Reassigning Judgment is GRANTED.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
