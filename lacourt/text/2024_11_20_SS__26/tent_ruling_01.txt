the petition for release order must be verified by the petitioner and allege
the following:
 
(a) The date of recordation of the
claim of lien. A certified copy of the claim of lien shall be attached to the
petition.
(b) The county in which the claim of
lien is recorded.
(c) The book and page or series number
of the place in the official records where the claim of lien is recorded.
(d) The legal description of the
property subject to the claim of lien.
(e) Whether an extension of credit has
been granted under Section 8460, if so to what date, and that the time for commencement
of an action to enforce the lien has expired.
(f) That the owner has given the
claimant notice under Section 8482 demanding that the claimant execute and
record a release of the lien and that the claimant is unable or unwilling to do
so or cannot with reasonable diligence be found.
(g) Whether an action to enforce the
lien is pending.
(h) Whether the owner of the property
or interest in the property has filed for relief in bankruptcy or there is
another restraint that prevents the claimant from commencing an action to
enforce the lien.
 
(Civil Code, § 8484.) The Petition contains all the above
information, as required. However, Civil Code section 8486, subdivision (b)

same manner as service of summons, or by certified or registered mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested . . . .” (Civ. Code, § 8486, subd. (b).) No
proof of service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing have been filed to date.
The Court cannot reach the merits of the Petition without Petitioner’s
compliance with the statutory service requirements.
