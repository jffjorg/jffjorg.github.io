ANALYSIS:
 
On March 5, 2024,
Plaintiff National Recovery, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this subrogation action
against Defendants El Arabachi, El Arabachi Express, LLC dba El Arabachi, JCG,
Inc. dba El Arabachi; Cindy Cea aka Cindy Noemi Cea aka Cindy Abril aka Cindy
Noemi Abril, and Jose Abril aka Joey Abril (“Defendants”). On April 2, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement (Conditional). On September 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Enforce
Settlement, and Enter Judgment. To date, no opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) The settlement agreement complies
with the statutory requirements set forth above because it was signed by all
parties. (Motion, Besnyl Decl., Exh. A, p. 8.)
 
The settlement provides that
Defendants would pay Plaintiff $23,999.95 through monthly payments starting on March
20, 2024. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶2.) The settlement agreement also provides
that in the event of Defendant’s default, Plaintiff may seek judgment plus interest
and costs. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶7.) Payments of $10,000.00 were made towards
the settlement, after which Defendant defaulted. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. B.)
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to entry of judgment against
Defendants in the amount of $13,999.95 principal ($23,999.95 - $10,000,00) 18
percent interest from July 21, 2021, and $575.00 in costs. (Id. at ¶5.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff National Recovery,
Inc.’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED. JUDGMENT TO BE
ENTERED IN PLAINTIFF’S FAVOR AND AGAINST DEFENDANTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,999.95
PRINCIPAL, PLUS 18 PERCENT INTEREST FROM JULY 14, 2021, AND $575.00 COSTS.
