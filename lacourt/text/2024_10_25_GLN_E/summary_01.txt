Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to a request for production (RFP) served by the plaintiff, Niko Vega. The RFP seeks various documents from General Motors LLC (GM), including warranty policy and procedure manuals, failure rates of vehicles, and policies and procedures for handling customer complaints. GM objects to the RFP on various grounds, including vagueness, ambiguity, and overbreadth. The judge will hear argument on the motion and tentatively rules that some of the RFPs are granted, while others are denied. The judge also notes that GM's objections were either boilerplate or not compliant with the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP).
