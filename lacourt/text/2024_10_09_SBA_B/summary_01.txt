And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion by Rocketship Entertainment, LLC to reopen discovery and a motion by Webtoon Entertainment, Inc. to bifurcate an equitable issue. The lawsuit has a long history, with the trial previously set for April 2021 but stayed pending an appeal by Rocketship Entertainment, LLC. The appeal was resolved in February 2024 when the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal as there was not yet an appealable order.

The judge has several questions for the parties at the upcoming hearing. First, Rocketship Entertainment, LLC must explain the significance of management changes at Webtoon Entertainment, Inc. and why the discovery requested is appropriate. Second, Webtoon Entertainment, Inc. must discuss whether it intends to use print publication information at trial. Third, the parties must discuss why it is not appropriate to provide actual sales/profit information to Rocketship Entertainment, LLC. Fourth, the parties must address the significance of the fact that Rocketship Entertainment, LLC did not identify an expert witness to address damages claimed by either party. Finally, the parties must discuss the status of the Han equitable claim for rescission in light of the fact that the Rocketship Entertainment, LLC contract has expired.
