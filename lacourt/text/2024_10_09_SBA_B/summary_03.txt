**Significant Statements**
```
- "The Court does not believe that the relationship requires that the Court recuse itself in this matter." (Judge Stern)
- "Failure to timely respond to RFA does not result in automatic admissions. Rather, the propounder of the RFA must 'move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction' under § 2023.010 et seq." (Weil & Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial, ¶ 8:1370)
- "The court 'shall' grant the motion to deem RFA admitted, 'unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.'" (CCP § 2033.280(c))
- "The Court finds that a total of 3 hours is appropriate for all four motions." (Judge Stern)
- "The Court awards 4 hours of attorney time at a rate of $400 per hour for $1,600 as a reasonable attorney's fee, plus the filing fees of $240 for the four motions." (Judge Stern)
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motions to compel the defendant to respond to discovery requests. The defendant failed to respond to the discovery requests, and the plaintiff has sought sanctions for this failure. The court finds that the defendant's failure to respond is a misuse of the discovery process and orders the defendant to pay a monetary sanction of $1,840.00. The court also orders the defendant to respond to the discovery requests without objections and to pay a reasonable attorney's fee of $1,600.00 to the plaintiff's attorney.
