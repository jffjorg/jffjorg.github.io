Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production of Documents, Set One. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Rowena Calacsan, Julius Calacsan, Czarina Calacsan, and Cesar Calacsan, against the defendant, Michael Makar Butler. The Judge has denied the motion due to several procedural defects, including the improper combination of two motions into one, failure to file separate statements, and failure to identify the requests for production that they seek to compel further. The Judge has also ruled that the defendant acted with substantial justification in opposing the motion, and therefore, sanctions are not warranted.
