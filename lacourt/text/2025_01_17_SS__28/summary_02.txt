Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving papers and notice of non-opposition and rules as follows. Edison seeks to amend its cross-complaint to add Johan Kafil as a cross-defendant and new factual allegations supporting alter ego liability and vicarious liability. The proposed amendments are based on the same alleged facts giving rise to Plaintiffs' complaint and Edison's cross-complaint. The Court finds that the amendments would not prejudice the other parties. Therefore, the Court grants Edison's motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint.
