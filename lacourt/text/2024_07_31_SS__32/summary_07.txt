And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery to take depositions of medical experts. The plaintiff argued that the depositions are necessary and that he has been diligently seeking to schedule them, but the judge found that the plaintiff did not establish diligence. The judge noted that discovery has been closed since 2023 and that the plaintiff has not provided specificity regarding the experts to be deposed and their availability. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claim of no prejudice due to the October trial date is unsubstantiated. The judge denied the motion and ordered the plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
