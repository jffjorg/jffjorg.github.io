Here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint. The motion is granted because the Plaintiffs have shown that the amendment is necessary and proper, and that there will be no prejudice to the remaining parties. The Plaintiffs' original complaint did not specify the California Fire Code sections that were violated, but the Court's March 13, 2024 ruling on the demurrer required the Plaintiffs to amend their complaint to comply with the Court's order. The First Amended Complaint must be filed and served within 10 days, and notice and proof of service must be provided.
