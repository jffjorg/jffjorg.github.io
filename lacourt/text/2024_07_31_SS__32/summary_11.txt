The Judge's tentative ruling is to grant the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from October 18, 2024 to April 18, 2025. The defendant requests additional time to commence discovery, complete depositions, explore settlement opportunities, and prepare for trial. The plaintiff has not filed opposition to the motion. The court finds good cause to continue the trial given the defendant's recent appearance in the case and the need for additional discovery time.
