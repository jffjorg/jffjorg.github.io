The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for protective order filed by Plaintiff Raphael Pariente Zapotitla. The motion seeks to compel Defendant to choose between a neurosurgeon and an orthopedic spine surgeon, or to strike the expert designations of both. Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the experts will opine on different areas of medicine. The Court denied the motion, finding that the testimony is not cumulative based on Defendant's representation that the experts will provide different opinions. The Court notes that Plaintiff's argument is based solely on the possibility that one expert could testify on both topics, and that the Court cannot conclude that the testimony will be cumulative without deposition transcripts. Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of the Court's order and file proof of service.
