The judge grants the motion in part and advances the hearing on the summary judgment motion, which was previously set for May 23, 2025, to September 25, 2024. The final status conference is continued to October 14, 2024, and the trial is continued to October 28, 2024. All discovery and pre-trial motion cut-off dates will be adjusted accordingly. The defendants are required to give notice of this order and file proof of service.
