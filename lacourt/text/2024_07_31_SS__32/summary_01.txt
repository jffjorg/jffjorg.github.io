And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition filed by Petitioner Jasmine Bledsoe on behalf of Claimant Jayden Coleman, age 15. The petition seeks a minors compromise, but the judge denies it without prejudice. The judge notes that there is a discrepancy between two items in the petition, but after reviewing the proposed order, it appears that the values in one item merely reflect reimbursements for attorney fees and costs that Petitioner will be obligated to pay following the settlement payment. The judge also points out that the term "guardianship of the estate" is not applicable in this case, and instead, Petitioner must mark item 18b(2) instead. The judge orders the moving party to give notice.
