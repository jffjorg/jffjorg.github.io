  Case Number:  20STCV16438    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  1 20STCV16438           HOOMAN
MELAMED, M.D., INC. vs BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA
Plaintiff’s Motion to Relate Cases (Case Nos. 20STCV16438
and 22STCV01382)
TENTATIVE RULING:        Plaintiff’s Motion to Relate Cases (Case Nos.
20STCV16438 and 22STCV01382) is GRANTED. 
Department 1 relates 22STCV01382 with 20STCV16438. The Court orders
22STCV01382 reassigned to Department 16 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all
purposes. All hearings currently set in 22STCV01382 are hereby advanced and
vacated.  Counsel for Plaintiff to give
notice.
 
On March 3, 2022, Judge Laura A. Seigle issued an order
finding the cases were not related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300. 
In opposition, Defendant contends the motion is “fatally
defective,” (Opp. at 6:10-15), citing California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(e),
which provides “[t]he Notice of Related Case must be served and filed as soon
as possible, but no later than 15 days after the facts concerning the existence
of related cases become known.” This deadline, which is not jurisdictional,
applies to the filing of a Notice of Related Case, not a motion to relate, and
is therefore inapposite. Defendant also contends the motion is an untimely
motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. (Opp. at
6:25-7:4.) However, Plaintiff’s motion is expressly permitted by California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(D) and is not constrained by the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008.
Defendant further contends the motion “appears to be asking
that this Court both relate and consolidate the matter simultaneously.” (Opp.
at 6:16-24.) However, the motion acknowledges it does not seek consolidation
with this motion. (Mot. at 2:10-13 (“Plaintiff seeks an order relating and
assigning both cases to the Judge assigned the lowest-numbered case so that a
motion to consolidate can be brought pursuant to California Rules of Court
3.350.”).) Moreover, Department 1 does not consolidate cases and does not
address the merits of the arguments in favor or against consolidation. 
Plaintiff’s motion to relate is timely and properly brought
before Department 1. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC Local Rule
3.3(f)(3).) 
The Court finds the Two Cases are Related 
Cases are related when they (1) involve the same parties and
are based on the same or similar claims, (2) arise from the same or
substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact,
(3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the same
property, or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct.,
rule 3.300(a).)
 
Plaintiff contends the cases are related based upon the
first, second, and fourth grounds enumerated in Rule 3.300(a). While Defendant
contends Plaintiff has not demonstrated the cases are related, (Opp. at
7:5-8:17), Plaintiff notes Defendant filed the initial notice of related case.
(Reply at 1:2-10.) Plaintiff argues Defendant’s current opposition to relation
is improper. However, Plaintiff’s reliance upon the doctrine of judicial
estoppel is misplaced. (Reply at 1:13-1:21.) For judicial estoppel to apply,
the court must have adopted the position previously raised by the party. (See
Aguilar v. Lerner (2004) 32 Cal.4th 974, 986 (“The doctrine applies when . . .
(3) the party was successful in asserting the first position (i.e., the
tribunal adopted the position or accepted it as true).”).) Judge Seigle did not
relate the two cases in response to Defendant’s Notice of Related Case. 
The two cases do not involve the same parties as Hooman
Melamed, M.D., in his individual capacity, is not a party to both cases. (Cal.
R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(1).) In opposition, Defendant argues the cases do not
have similar or overlapping claims. (Opp. at 8:1-6, Fogarty Decl. Ex. A-F.)
Defendant cites instances where Plaintiff’s counsel has differentiated between
the two cases as one seeking quantum meruit and reimbursement and the other
seeking redress for retaliation. (Ibid.) As noted by Plaintiff in reply, (Reply
at 2:10-3:20), these statements are not binding judicial admissions that
preclude Plaintiff’s motion. (Travelers Indemnity Company of Connecticut v.
Navigators Specialty Insurance Company (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 341, 360–361 (“A
judicial admission is a waiver of proof of a fact by conceding its truth, and
it has the effect of removing the matter from the issues. . . . the declaration
or utterance must be one of fact and not a legal conclusion, contention, or
argument.”).) Moreover, the statements do not demonstrate the cases are not
related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300. 
The cases arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(a)(2).) Both cases assert claims under Business and Professions Code
section 17200 based upon similar conduct. In both cases, Plaintiff alleges
Defendant’s policy and practice is to deny claims as medically unnecessary or
elective procedures in support of the Section 17200 claims. (See e.g. 20STCV16438
TAC ¶¶ 104-106; 22STCV01382 SAC ¶¶ 9, 13, 20.) While one case relies upon
Defendant’s alleged retaliatory motive and the other does not, this difference
is insufficient to deny relation. Both cases will require similar
determinations regarding Defendant’s policies and practices as they relate to
Plaintiff’s reimbursement claims, the denial thereof, and Plaintiff’s appeals.
Both complaints cite Title 28, Section 1300.71 of the California Code of
Regulations. (TAC ¶¶ 18-19; SAC ¶¶ 8, 20, 27, 35.) Plaintiff alleges in both
cases that Defendant failed to pay the reasonable and customary value of the
services rendered. (TAC ¶ 18 (“[the Plan shall remit to the provider] the
payment of the reasonable and customary value for the health care services
rendered . . .”); SAC ¶ 8 (“Blue Shield must pay the reasonable and customary
value for those services based on criteria set forth by California law.”).) 
The cases are also likely to require a substantial
duplication of judicial resources if they continue before different judges.
(Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(4).) On October 11, 2023, Judge Upinder S. Kalra
issued an order in 22STCV01382 providing “parties will meet and confer
regarding modifying protective order in 20STCV16438.” As noted by Defendant,
Judge Kalra also indicated “if Plaintiff’s UCL claim survives, the court might
stay the Retaliation Lawsuit pending the conclusion of the Quantum Meruit Lawsuit.”
(Opp. at 5:15-17; Fogarty Decl. Ex. D at 25:23-26:9.) A stay to await the
outcome of a separate lawsuit will necessarily duplicate judicial resources as
the stayed case is likely to require continuances, status conferences, and
review of the other proceedings. Notably, the alleged conduct at issue in
22STCV01382 is alleged to be the continuation and consequence of the conduct
alleged in 20STCV16438. Furthermore, judicial efficiency is promoted by a
single judicial officer overseeing the entirety of the dispute between the
parties. 
The Court finds the cases are related within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300 and the motion is GRANTED.
