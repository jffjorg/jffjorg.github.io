And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to deem cases related, relating the unlawful detainer case 23PDUD02724 with the unlimited civil case 23STCV24643. The unlawful detainer case is reassigned to Department 68 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all purposes, and all hearings currently set in the civil law case are advanced and vacated. The judge finds that the cases are related because they involve title to and possession of the same property, the Pacoima property, and there is a risk of conflicting rulings if the cases are determined separately. The judge orders that the cases be related, allowing for a single judicial officer to determine the appropriate remedy, whether to stay the unlawful detainer action or consolidate the actions.
