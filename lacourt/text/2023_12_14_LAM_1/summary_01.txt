And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to relate cases 20STCV16438 and 22STCV01382. The judge finds that the two cases are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300, as they involve the same or similar claims, arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, and are likely to require a substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. The judge orders case 22STCV01382 to be reassigned to Department 16 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse and advances and vacates all hearings currently set in that case. The judge also notes that the cases are likely to require similar determinations regarding Blue Shield of California's policies and practices as they relate to the plaintiff's reimbursement claims, the denial thereof, and the plaintiff's appeals.
