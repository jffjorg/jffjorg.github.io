And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request to stay an appeal and is weighing the factors to determine whether to grant the stay. The judge notes that the plaintiff's name is unclear, with the plaintiff's filings using the spelling "Nthrop" but a substitution of attorney filing using the spelling "Northrup". The judge also points out an error in the caption of the document, which mistakenly states that the defendant is the Redlands Unified School District. The judge grants the parties' requests for judicial notice, which allows them to submit evidence outside of the pleadings.

The judge rejects the plaintiff's argument that the likelihood of success of an unrelated appeal is a factor in deciding whether to grant the stay. Instead, the judge relies on the traditional factors for staying an appeal, which include whether the stay applicant is likely to succeed on the merits, whether they will be irreparably injured if the stay is not granted, whether the stay will substantially injure other parties, and where the public interest lies.

The judge also notes that the lack of "scheduled actions" in the second and first appellate district cases supports a showing of undue delay, which may weigh in favor of granting the stay. The judge is tentatively ruling that the third factor (issuance of a stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding) does not apply, and is considering the other factors before making a final decision.
