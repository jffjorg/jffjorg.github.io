[1] It is unclear whether Nothrop is spelled as Northrup
(with a ‘u’) or Nothrop (with an ‘o’) as Plaintiff’s filings use the latter
spelling but the 1/22/2024 Substitution of Attorney filing uses the former. 


[2] The caption of the CC mistakenly states it is filed
by Defendant ‘Redlands Unified School District.’ 
 


[3] Though no substitution of attorney form has been
filed, the non-opposition was filed by Richard J. Schwab of Trygstad, Schwab
& Trygstad. 


[4] The parties’ RJNs are granted.  
 


[5] This first factor does not apply. (Motion p. 10.) 
 


[6] In Opposition, Plaintiff also states that the
“likelihood of success of the unrelated appeal” is also a factor. (Opp. p.
4.:21-22.) Not so. For one, Plaintiff cites to Landis and Farmland,
but neither of those cases provide that factor. As for Plaintiff’s final citation
to Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009), that case is inapposite
because it involved the “traditional” standard for a stay in a federal case.
Under that
standard, a court considers four factors: “(1) whether the stay applicant has
made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether
the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance
of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the
proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.” (Id. at p. 426.) The
standards in staying a state action versus federal are different. 
 


[7] Per Plaintiff’s RJN, the third appellate district
denied Stockton Unified School District’s petition for writ of mandate as did
the California Supreme Court. (See Plaintiff’s RJN, Ex. 1, p. 11-13 of 170 of
PDF.) 
 


[8] See also Farmland, supra, wherein the there
was a federal action (involving patent law) and a state action. 


[9] Perhaps even longer as based on the court’s review of
the dockets as of 6/20/24 at 11 AM, no oral argument has been scheduled in the
second appellate district case nor the first appellate court district case. The
lack of “scheduled actions” in either case supports a showing of undue delay.
(See Opp. pp. 11-12, citing Landis, supra, 299 U.S. at p. 258 [stay
should not be granted unless it appears likely the other proceedings will be
expected with a “reasonable time.”].)
