  Case Number:  22STCV14395    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
DEFENDANT COVINA-VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 'S MOTION
TO STAY THE TRIAL is MOOT. 
 
Background
 
This case arises from allegations of sexual assault endured
when in school. Plaintiff NICHOLAS INCLAN (“Plaintiff”) asserts the following
allegations against Defendants COVINA VALLY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (“District”
or “Defendant”), a public entity, and KIMBERLY NORTHROP[1]
(collectively, “Defendants”): Defendant Northrop was a teacher at Northview
High School, where Plaintiff was her student during the 2004 to 2005 academic
year. Northrop began sexually grooming Plaintiff by seeking to earn his
emotional and psychological trust. After two weeks, Northrop began sexually
assaulting Plaintiff. Northrop also sexually assaulted two other students.
Plaintiff further alleges that another District’s teacher sexually assaulted
students. Despite the District’s awareness that at least one of its teachers
sexually abused a minor student at Northview High School, the District
continued to ignore Northrop’s inappropriate behavior. 
 
On April 29, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants
for the following causes of action (COAs): 1.    
Negligence 2.    
Negligent Supervision and Retention 3.    
Sexual Battery and 4.    
Sexual Harassment
On July 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint
(FAC), reasserting the same COAs against the same Defendants.
 
On August 4, 2022, the court found Defendant’ demurrer x MTS
moot.
 
On August 3, 2022, Defendant filed a demurrer to the MTS. 
 
On September 2, 2022, Northrop filed her answer.
 

On October 17, 2022, the court
issued its final ruling as to Defendant’s demurrer to the 4th COA
found in the FAC wherein the court overruled the namely because “employees of the
school district other than Northrop—specifically teachers and the vice
principal—observed Northrop’s inappropriate behavior and/or were aware of
information regarding Northrop’s improper/criminal activities involving
Plaintiff and other students. Yet, these employees who in the
scope of their employment, have a duty to protect students from certain
known/suspected abuses failed to take appropriate actions to safeguard
Plaintiff.” (See 10/17/22 Final Ruling, emphasis original.) 
 
On November 17, 2022, the District[2]
filed a cross-complaint (CC) against Northrop for:
 
1. Total Equitable Indemnity
2. Partial Equitable Indemnity
3. Declaratory Relief 
 
On November 17, 2022, the District
filed its answer to Plaintiff’s FAC.
 
On December 19, 2023, Northrop filed
her answer to the CC.
 
On January 22, 2024, Northrop filed
a substitution of attorney indicating Counsel William Blasser is no longer
serving as her counsel and she is representing herself.
 
On April 29, 2024, the District
filed the instant MOTION TO STAY THE TRIAL. 
 
On May 15, 2024, Northrup filed a
NON-OPPOSITION TO NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR STAY.[3]
 
On May 16, 2024, the District filed
a summary judgment motion (with a hearing date set for August 5, 2024).
 
On May 16, 2024, the court issued
the following minute order re: ‘Vacating Mandatory Settlement Conference with
Honorable Salvatore Sirna’: “After review of the immediate case, this Court
notes that no Mandatory Settlement Conference Briefs have been filed and
were ordered to be filed on or before 05/13/2024. On the Court's own
motion, the Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC) with Hon. Judge
Salvatore Sirna scheduled for 05/23/2024 is advanced to this date and
vacated. If the parties seek another Mandatory Settlement Conference,
parties are to contact their Home Court to make arrangements.” (emphasis
added). 
 
On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition to the Motion. 
 
On May 30, 2024, the District filed
its Reply.
 
On May 31, 2024, Northrop filed a
‘NON-OPPOSITION TO NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION TO STAY THE TRIAL.’
 
On June 24, 2024, Defendant filed a
notice of continuance on the hearing on the motion to stay from 6/25 to 8/15. 
 
On June 26, 2024, the court
continued the MSJ hearing from /805 to 8/15. 
 
On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
EX PARTE APPLICATION TO CONTINUE HEARING ON MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
/ ADJUDICATION OF COVINA-VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT PURSUANT TO CCP
§437c(h), which was denied. 
 
Legal Standard[4]
 
“The power to stay proceedings is
incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of
the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for
counsel, and for litigants.” (Landis v. North American Co. (1936) 299
U.S. 247, 254.) In exercising its discretion the court should consider the (i) “importance
of discouraging multiple litigation designed to harass an adverse party,”[5] (ii)
“avoiding unseemly conflicts with the courts of other jurisdictions,” and (iii)
“whether the rights of the parties can best be determined by the court of the
other jurisdiction because of the nature of the subject matter, the
availability of witnesses, or the stage to which the proceedings in the other
court have already advance.” (Motion p. 10 and Opp. pp. 4-5 both citing Farmland
Irrigation Co. Dopplmaier (1957) 48 Cal.2d 208, 215 (Farmland).)[6] 
 
Notwithstanding, “California courts
are guided by the strong principle that any elapsed time other than that
reasonably required for pleadings and discovery is unacceptable and should be
eliminated.” (Alpha Media Resort Investment Cases (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th
1121, 1132.)
 
Discussion
 
The District seeks a stay of the
case pending resolution of two cases before the appellate court: West Contra
Costa Unified School District v. The Superior Court of Contra Costa County (Case
No. A169314) (Contra Costa USD) and Roe #2 v. Superior Court (Cas
No. B334707).[7]
Both cases seek a writ compelling the trial court to reverse its decision
overruling a demurrer and MJOP, respectively. More specifically, the District
argues that this lawsuit “is on a collision course” because either of the
pending appellate cases could resolve the entirety of the action. (Motion p.
12, relying upon Caiafa Prof. Law Corp v. State Farm Firm & Casualty Co.
(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 800.)
 
Here, as the appellate court in the Contra
Costa USD case issued its opinion on July 31, 2024 determining that AB
218’s retroactive waiver of the claim presentation requirement does not
constitute an unconstitutional gift of public funds, this motion is moot. 
 
Even assuming the appellate court
had not spoken prior to this hearing, the motion would have been denied based
upon the following analysis. The circumstances here are different to those
presented in Caiafa. In Caiafa, attorney Caiafa entered into an
agreement with State Farm wherein Caiafa represented a defendant as independent
Cumis counsel. After a couple years of State Farm ceasing to make
payments to Caifa for his representation of the defendant, State Farm filed da
civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) action against
Caiafa (not his law corporation) in federal court for alleged fraudulent
billing. (Id. at p. 802.) Then, Caiafa, through his law corporation,
filed a state suit compelling arbitration to recover his unpaid Cumis fees.
(Id. at pp. 802-803.) State Farm opposed the petition on the grounds that
the matter should be stayed pending resolution of the Federal RICO action. Caifa
appealed the trial court’s ruling to stay further proceedings pending the
outcome of the RICO action. (Id. at p. 803.) In affirming the trial’s
court decision, the appellate court observed that “Caiafa's appointment
as Cumis counsel and his claim for fees pursuant to that
appointment represent collateral matters to the main litigation…
[t]o put it another way, no matter what happened in the state section
2860 arbitration it could not resolve all the issues implicated
in the far broader Federal RICO
action. So this Federal action will proceed to decision in any event. The
potential for ‘unseemly conflict’ is great, unless both forums should reach the exact
same resolution of the issues.” (Id. at pp. 805-807, emphasis added.)
 
Here, however, for one, the
“unseemly conflicts with courts of other jurisdictions” is not an issue because
whereas in Caiafa there was a matter in federal and state court,
here, the matter is only within state court (i.e., one jurisdiction).[8] Additionally,
the cases on appeal while they involve the same legal issue (i.e.,
constitutionality of AB 218), they do not involve similar parties
(different plaintiffs and/or school districts) nor similar facts (i.e.,
specifics of the grooming/sexual assault, whether the district was put on
notice, etc.). (See also Opp. p. 11.) 
 
Thus, as the main litigation is the instant
case (not the cases on appeal), the second factor of the need to avoid conflict
rulings is not at issue here. (See Motion p. 12.) 
 
Ultimately, on such a motion,
the “burden is a heavy one, requiring the District to ‘make out a clear case of
hardship or inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair
possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to someone else.’”
(Opp. p. 9:15-17.) However, as conceded by Defendant, “no one knows the
outcome, it is reasonable to infer that the appellate courts will either find
that AB 218 is constitutional or not” (Reply p. 4:3-4.) Moreover, writ
proceedings do not even automatically stay the very trial proceedings from
which the petitions are taken. (Opp. p. 11, citing Paul Blanco’s Good Car
Company Auto Group v. Sup. Ct. of Alameda County (2020) 56 Cal. App. 5th
86, 97-98 [writ proceedings not entitled to automatic stay].) In fact, neither
of the trial courts where the writs on which the District relies has entered a
stay of its own proceedings. (Opp. p. 11:22-24.) 
 
With that, as staying a case for
months[9]
based upon speculation of what the appellate courts may do, the court,
exercising its sound discretion, determines that Defendant has not met its
burden. In sum, as the District can adequately defend itself in this action
without work from the appellate courts (Landis, supra, 299 U.S. at p.
254), the motion would be denied.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing—as the basis
for the stay has already been resolved—the motion is moot.
