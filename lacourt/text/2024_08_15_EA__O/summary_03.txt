And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motions filed by Plaintiffs' Counsel Jorge Ledezma to be relieved as counsel for Driszel Salcedo, Edgar Montanez, and Kendrick Montanez. The judge finds that an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship has occurred, making it impossible for Ledezma to continue representing the plaintiffs. Although no opposition was filed by the plaintiffs, the judge notes that they have ample opportunity to find new counsel before the next scheduled conference on October 29, 2024. The motions are granted effective upon service of the motion and the court's order upon all parties.
