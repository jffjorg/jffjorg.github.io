And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is sustained with leave to amend. The Plaintiff, Virginia Hoge, alleges cyber spying and cyber harassment by the defendant, Google LLC. The defendant removed the case to federal court, where the claims based on federal law were dismissed and the remaining claims were remanded to the California court. The Plaintiff fails to specify which causes of action they assert against the defendant and which allegations about the defendant support those causes of action, making the complaint uncertain. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 10 days and for the defendant to provide notice and proof of service.
