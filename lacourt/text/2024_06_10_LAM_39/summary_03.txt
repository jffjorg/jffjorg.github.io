And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Defendant Chris Tolles. The Plaintiff, Virginia Hoge, alleges that she was stalked, harassed, and spied on online by trolls connected with Defendant, CEO of Topix.com. The Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant hired the trolls to attack her. However, the Plaintiff's complaint fails to specify which causes of action she asserts against Defendant and which allegations about Defendant support those causes of action. As a result, the court grants Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, but allows the Plaintiff to amend her complaint within 10 days.
