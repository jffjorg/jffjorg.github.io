SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff
Justine Amanda Cruz Echavez (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendant California
Institute of the Arts (Defendant) on April 18, 2023. On July 7, 2023, Plaintiff
served Defendant with Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One. On
September 19, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with objections and responses to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories without verifications.
 
Plaintiff
claims that Defendant objected to Interrogatories Nos. 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 and
that Defendant’s responses were evasive, incomplete, and unresponsive.
Plaintiff sent Defendant a meet and confer letter on October 30, 2023,
regarding the alleged deficiencies. On November 20, 2023, defense counsel
requested additional time to respond. Plaintiff agreed to a 30-day extension.
On December 22, 2023, Defendant served supplemental responses to the Interrogatories
but failed to provide verification, and Plaintiff still found the responses to the
Interrogatories to be deficient.
 
On January 3,
2024, Plaintiff sent another meet and confer letter. After following up with
defense counsel several times, a final deadline of February 7, 2024, was set.
Prior to Plaintiff filing this motion on February 6, 2024, Defendant never
addressed the deficiencies.
 
In Defendant’s
opposition filed on April 23, 2024, Defendant argues that it has provided all
the information that it is able and willing to provide in response to
Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatoreis. Defendant claims that it has no further
information to provide.
 
Plaintiff
argues in her reply filed on April 29, 2024, that Defendant’s opposition was
late because it was served on Plaintiff on April 25, two days late, and should
not be considered. The Court will consider Defendant’s opposition, however,
because it was timely filed with the Court. Plaintiff also argues that
Defendant’s responses are not sufficient.
 
ANALYSIS
Pursuant to CCP
§ 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action or any motion made in that action.” (See also, Dimpling v. Super. Ct.
(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 798, 808.) This standard should be applied liberally and
doubts should be resolved in favor of permitting discovery. (Irvington-Moore,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 733, 738-739.)
 
The following
are the Special Interrogatories at issue and the response:
 
SPECIAL
INTERROGATORY NO. 6: 
IDENTIFY all instances (including dates
and the nature of the discipline) where YOU disciplined PLAINTIFF, formally or
informally, for conduct/performance that YOU contend was deficient or
inadequate, from January 1, 2020 through the end of PLAINTIFF’s employment. 
 
RESPONSE TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 6: 
Responding party objects to this
interrogatory on the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous and it is overly
broad, burdensome and harassing. Responding Party further objects to the extent
it seeks information that is protected by the attorney-client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine. Responding party also objects to the extent
this request seeks confidential or proprietary information, and/or to the
extent such information is subject to privacy protections. Subject to and
without waiving the foregoing objections, Responding party responds as follows:

Ms. Echavez was warned by email and
verbally about mistakes in payroll for a duration of time leading to December
2022
 
SPECIAL
INTERROGATORY NO. 7: 
IDENTIFY each PERSON who recommended, for
or against, participated in, approved, opposed, or ratified, PLAINTIFF’s
termination, or was asked for his or her recommendation whether to terminate
PLAINTIFF, regardless of responsiveness. 
 
RESPONSE TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 7: 
Responding party objects to this
interrogatory on the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous and it is overly
broad, burdensome and harassing. Responding Party further objects to the extent
it seeks information that is protected by the attorney-client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine. Responding party also objects to the extent
this request seeks confidentialor [sic] proprietary information, and/or to the
extent such information is subject to privacy protections. Subject to and
without waiving the foregoing objections, Responding party responds as follows:

Responding party IDENTIFIES Mr. Ryan
Sizemore, Ms. Trish Patryla, Mr. Nasser Albeiruti, Sherilyn Froehlich, and
Panela Prescod-Caesar, each c/o counsel for Defendant.
 
SPECIAL
INTERROGATORY NO. 9: 
IDENTIFY all requests for accommodation
YOU received from PLAINTIFF relating to her own or her son’s medical condition
or disability. 
 
RESPONSE TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 9: 
Responding party objects to this
interrogatory on the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous and it is overly
broad, burdensome and harassing. Responding Party further objects to the extent
it seeks information that is protected by the attorney-client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine. Responding party also objects to the extent
this request seeks confidential or proprietary information, and/or to the
extent such information is subject to privacy protections. Subject to and
without waiving the foregoing objections, Responding party responds as follows:

Although the forms for accommodations were
provided to plaintiff, she did not complete and submit them.
 
SPECIAL
INTERROGATORY NO. 10: 
IDENTIFY any actions YOU took and any
actions YOU considered taking relating to each of the accommodation requests
identified in Special Interrogatory 9, including any steps you took to engage
in the interactive process. 
 
RESPONSE TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 10: 
Responding party objects to this
interrogatory on the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous and it is overly
broad, burdensome and harassing. Responding Party further objects to the extent
it seeks information that is protected by the attorney-client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine. Responding party also objects to the extent
this request seeks confidential or proprietary information, and/or to the
extent such information is subject to privacy protections. Subject to and
without waiving the foregoing objections, Responding party responds as follows:

Accommodation forms were provided to
plaintiff, but she did not complete or submit them.
 
SPECIAL
INTERROGATORY NO. 11: 
If DEFENDANT contends any of PLAINTIFF’s
requests for accommodation would have caused YOU undue hardship, IDENTIFY all
facts that support this contention. 
 
RESPONSE TO
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 11: 
Responding party objects to this
interrogatory on the grounds that it is vague and ambiguous and it is overly
broad, burdensome and harassing. Responding Party further objects to the extent
it seeks information that is protected by the attorney-client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine. Responding party also objects to the extent
this request seeks confidential or proprietary information, and/or to the
extent such information is subject to privacy protections. Subject to and
without waiving the foregoing objections, Responding party responds as follows:

Although the forms for accommodations were
provided to plaintiff, she did not complete and submit them, and thus no
determination was made
 
Plaintiff
objects to Defendant’s response to Interrogatory No. 6 because Defendant
answered that Plaintiff was warned by email as well as verbally but did not
give a date for the email warning. Defendant argues in its opposition that
there was no timestamp because the warning was verbal, but Defendant’s response
clearly indicates that there was an email warning. Defendant must provide time
details about the email warning in a further response.
 
For
Interrogatory No. 7, Plaintiff argues that two of the people listed by
Defendant no longer work for Defendant, so Defendant should provide their
contact information. Defendant argues in opposition that they can still be
contacted through Defendant’s counsel. Plaintiff indicates in her reply that
there has been some conflict over whether Defendant would accept a subpoena on
behalf of the people who no longer work for it. However, the Court would point
out that the request does not ask for any contact information; it only asks for
the names of persons involved in Plaintiff’s termination. Whether Defendant
will accept subpoenas on behalf of the former employees is a separate issue
from this interrogatory. No further response is required.
 
For
Interrogatory Nos. 9, 10, and 11, Plaintiff argues that Defendants responses do
not indicate whether it took any actions in response to Plaintiff’s requests
for accommodations. However, as Defendant argues in its opposition, Defendant
states that it provided Plaintiff with the forms, but Plaintiff never submitted
them. That appears to mean that Plaintiff never made any requests for
accommodations. Defendant has responded to these interrogatories to the best of
its ability. Though Plaintiff may not like Defendant’s responses, that is not
reason to compel further responses. No further responses are necessary for these
interrogatories. 
 
To the extent
that Defendant has not provided supplemental verification for these responses,
Defendant must provide verification.
 
             Sanctions
Pursuant to CCP
§ 2030.300(d), courts “shall impose a monetary sanction” against a party or
attorney who unsuccessfully opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories without substantial justification. It is a misuse of the
discovery process to make unmeritorious objections and evasive responses and
such misuse is sanctionable. (CCP § 2023.010.)
 
Plaintiff has
requested sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record. The
only discovery response that Defendant unsuccessfully opposed further response
to was No. 6. Sanctions against Defendant are warranted for only that response
and the verification issue. Plaintiff has requested $4,725 in sanctions based
on 9 hours at $525 an hour. (Khatib Decl., ¶¶ 12-13.) Because the Court is only
granting the motion for one of the interrogatories and the verification issue,
the Court will only assess sanctions for 2 hours at $525 an hour for a total of
$1,050.00.
 
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is granted in the amount of $1,050.00 against Defendant
and Defendant’s counsel of record.
 
ORDER
1.      Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents is
granted for Special Interrogatory No. 6 and the verification of responses.
2.      Defendant
must provide a further response to Special Interrogatory No. 6 and verified
responses within 30 days.
3.      Defendant
and Defendant’s counsel of record are ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of
$1,050.00 to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days.
