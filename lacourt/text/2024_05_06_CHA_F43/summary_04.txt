And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories for Special Interrogatory No. 6. The judge finds that Defendant's responses to this interrogatory were incomplete and requires a further response. The judge also orders Defendant to provide verification for its responses to special interrogatories.

The judge also grants sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,050. The judge finds that Defendant's opposition to the motion was not substantially justified and that Defendant engaged in a misuse of the discovery process.

The judge orders Defendant to provide a further response to Special Interrogatory No. 6 and verified responses within 30 days. The judge also orders Defendant and its counsel to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,050 to Plaintiff's counsel within 30 days.
