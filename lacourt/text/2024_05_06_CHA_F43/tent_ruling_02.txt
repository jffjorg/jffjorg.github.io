Attorneys for Defendant
are requesting to be relieved as counsel.
 
RULING: Motion
to be relieved as counsel is granted
 
Jerry L. Kay
and Loren N. Cohen of Sklar Kirsh, LLP, counsel of record for Defendant Julie
Dunmire, seek to be relieved as counsel for that party.¿Counsel filed a motion
with the required Forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. Counsel’s declaration
states that there has been a breach of the material terms of the attorney
client agreement and that it is no longer possible for Dunmire’s attorneys to
fulfill their obligations under the Rules of Professional Conduct.
 
Absent a
showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.¿(People v. Prince¿(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)¿There is no
showing of prejudice, and counsel’s motion complies with California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362 and meets its requirements. Additionally, Dunmire filed a
substitution of attorney form on March 8, 2024, indicating that she has
obtained new counsel.
