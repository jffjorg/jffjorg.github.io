And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Julie Dunmire. The attorneys for Defendant, Jerry L. Kay and Loren N. Cohen of Sklar Kirsh, LLP, filed a motion to be relieved as counsel due to a breach of the material terms of the attorney-client agreement. The breach has made it impossible for the attorneys to fulfill their obligations under the Rules of Professional Conduct. The judge notes that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. Since there is no showing of prejudice, and the motion complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, the motion is granted. The moving party is required to give notice.
