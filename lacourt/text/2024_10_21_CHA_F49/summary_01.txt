And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, set two, filed by defendant/cross-complainant Aiden Bohlouli due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the court's June 17, 2024, order. The plaintiff, James Hoseini, is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses to Bohlouli's requests for production of documents, set two, within 20 days. The court also grants Bohlouli's request for monetary sanctions in part, ordering Hoseini to pay $1,264.50 in sanctions to Bohlouli's counsel. The court finds that Hoseini's responses were non-compliant with the court's order and failed to provide sufficient information regarding the requested documents.
