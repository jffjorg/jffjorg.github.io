Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants defendant Peter Elias' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiff Rachel Neu. The court dismisses plaintiff Rachel Neu from the action. The judge finds that plaintiff Rachel Neu lacks standing because she was not properly appointed as a co-trustee. The trust instrument does not provide for the appointment of a trustee by unanimous agreement of the beneficiaries, and the SAC does not allege that Neu is a trust company that may be appointed by agreement of all the beneficiaries. The judge orders defendant Peter Elias to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
