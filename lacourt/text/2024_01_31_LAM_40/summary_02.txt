And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court is ruling on the motion to strike improper claims for damages from the Plaintiff's Complaint. The Plaintiff, Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio, filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on January 16, 2024, which mooted the Defendants' motion to strike. The court notes that a party may amend its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard. The FAC was filed well within the statutory timeframe and was filed as a matter of right. Therefore, the court finds that the motion to strike is moot and denies it as such.
