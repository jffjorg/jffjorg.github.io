Court
Order
The Court begins by noting that Plaintiff
Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio’s filing of a January 16, 2024 First Amended
Complaint mooted Defendants’ December 1, 2023 motion to strike.
On August 2, 2023, Plaintiff Aidee
Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio sued Defendants Khowsrow Benji, Anna Benji, and Does 1
through 100 pursuant to a Complaint alleging 21 counts involving Fair
Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Labor Code, assault and battery, and other
claims.
On September 13, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a notice and acknowledgment of receipt for service of the Complaint,
summons, and other documents on Khowsrow Benji on August 23, 2023.
On November 14, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a notice and acknowledgment of receipt for service of the Complaint,
summons, and other documents on Anna Benji on August 23, 2023.
On December 1, 2023, Defendants
Khowsrow and Anna Benji (the Benji Defendants) filed a motion to strike, which
challenges the Complaint’s allegations of and prayers for attorneys’ fees and
punitive damages.
On January 16, 2024, instead of
opposing the motion to strike, Plaintiff Tinoco Bucio filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) alleging the same 21 causes of action against the Benji
Defendants.
“A party may amend its pleading
once without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or
motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but
before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended pleading is
filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the
demurrer or motion to strike. A party may amend the pleading after the date for
filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike, upon stipulation by
the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).) “All papers opposing a
motion so noticed shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each party
at least nine court days … before the hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd.
(b).) “[T]he filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a prior
complaint.” (JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477; see also Sylmar
Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122
Cal.App.4th 1049, 1054 [“The filing of [a] first amended complaint render[s] [a
movant’s] demurrer moot since “‘an amendatory pleading supersedes the original
one, which ceases to perform any function as a pleading”‘“ (citations
omitted)].) Accordingly, a “demurrer [directed to the original pleading] should
[be] taken off calendar” when an amended complaint is filed. (People ex rel.
Strathmann v. Acacia Research Corp. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 487, 506.)
This right is limited to the
amendment of a complaint initiating an action into a first amended complaint;
otherwise stated, a party cannot amend an already amended complaint as a matter
of course even though a demurrer has been directed to the operative and already
amended pleading. (Hedwall v. PCMV, LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 564,
572-579 [holding, as a matter of first impression, that a party’s right to
amend a pleading as a matter of course under Code of Civil Procedure section
472, subdivision (a) is limited to the original pleading commencing the
action].) Further, one defendant’s filing of an answer did not divest the
plaintiff of the right to amend the complaint with respect to the causes of
action brought against other demurring defendants. (Barton v. Kahn
(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1219-1221.)
Here, the hearing on the Benji
Defendants’ motion to strike was set for January 31, 2024. Nine court days
prior to January 31, 2024 was Thursday, January 18, 2024. Here, the FAC was
filed on January 16, 2023, well within the statutory timeframe. (FAC, p. 1; Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 472, subd. (a), 1005, subd. (b).) Moreover, because the
amendment was one from a complaint to a first amended complaint, the FAC was
filed as a matter of right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a); Hedwall v.
PCMV, LLC, supra, 22 Cal.App.5th at pp. 572-579.)
No reply by the Benji Defendants
appears in the record.
Defendants Khowsrow and Anna Benji’s Motion to Strike Improper
Claims for Damages from Plaintiff’s Complaint is thus MOOT.
