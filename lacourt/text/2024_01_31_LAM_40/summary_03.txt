And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer and "motion to strike" filed by defendant Joseph Rechtman, and has determined that they are moot. The plaintiff, Richard McCoy, filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on January 30, 2024, which was eight court days late. Despite the late filing, the court will exercise its discretion and permit the FAC to be considered.

The FAC was filed in response to the demurrer and "motion to strike," which were filed by the defendant on October 21, 2023. The plaintiff had nine court days to file a response to the demurrer and "motion to strike," but did not do so until January 30, 2024.

The court has determined that the FAC will permit an adjudication on the merits, and that adherence to a strict rule regarding the filing of the FAC would add nothing to the court's review and would delay the proceedings for no reason. Therefore, the court will permit the late filing of the FAC and will consider the demurrer and "motion to strike" moot.
