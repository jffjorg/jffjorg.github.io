And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Petitioner's motion to enforce the writ of administrative mandate. The motion is procedurally defective because it was not served on Respondent's counsel and did not include a memorandum of points and authorities. The court construes the absence of a memorandum as an admission that the motion is not meritorious and cause for its denial. The motion is based on a writ of mandate that was issued in 2022, which ordered the Commission to set aside its original decision. The Commission reconsidered its decision and imposed the same discipline on Petitioner. Petitioner filed an objection to the return on writ of mandate, but it was filed over two years after the court's ruling and was not noticed or served on the court. The court has denied the motion to enforce the writ of mandate because it is procedurally defective and Petitioner has not received proper notice.
