And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to augment the administrative record. The Court finds that the Regional Board properly excluded most of the evidence submitted by Petitioner, including Exhibits 1-39, 56-57, and 61, as well as Exhibits 40-49, due to their voluminous nature and lack of relevance. However, the Court grants the motion with respect to Exhibits 50-52, which are written statements from the EPA regarding Method 1668C, and Exhibits 58-60, which are recent stormwater monitoring reports. The Court also finds that Petitioner failed to comply with the regulations governing incorporation by reference and therefore excluded Exhibits 53-55. The Court's ruling is based on its independent judgment on the evidence and its consideration of the relevant statutes and regulations.
