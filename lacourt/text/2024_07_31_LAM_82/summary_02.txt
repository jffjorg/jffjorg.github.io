And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petitions filed by Ronsel-Lamond: Mitchell, a self-represented litigant, and has determined that they lack merit. The petitions seek to challenge court-ordered child support and allege that the government contract is invalid. However, the court has found that one need not "contract" with the government in order to be subject to child support orders. Additionally, the court does not have jurisdiction to review the orders of another Superior Court Judge, and such matters must be raised with the District Court of Appeal. Therefore, the court is dismissing the case without prejudice.
