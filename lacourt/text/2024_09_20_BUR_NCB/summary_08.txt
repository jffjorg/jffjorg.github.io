Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by the defendants (Roland Markarian, RRRM Holding Company, LLC, Ara Ohanjanyan, and Arman Arutyunyan) against the first amended complaint (FAC) filed by the plaintiffs (Vagan Sardariani and V&S Complete Auto Repairs, Inc.).

The judge has sustained the demurrers to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd causes of action for fraud, intentional concealment, and negligent misrepresentation, respectively, with leave to amend. The judge has found that the allegations in these causes of action are insufficiently pled and lack specificity.

The judge has also continued the Case Management Conference to November 25, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and has ordered the defendants to provide notice of this order.

The judge has not requested oral argument on this matter, and the tentative ruling will become the final ruling of the court if no argument is received within the allotted time.
