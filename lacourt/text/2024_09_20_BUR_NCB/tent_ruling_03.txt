On August 16,
2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Chandler Village, LLC (“Defendant”) filed 4
motions to compel initial responses from Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Vision
Construction Group, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) for: (1) Form Interrogatories, set one (“FROG-1”);
(2) Form Interrogatories, set two (“FROG-2”); (3) Form Interrogatories, set one
(“FROG-3”); and (4) Request for Production of Documents (“RPD”), set one.  
On July 1, 2024,
Defendant served on Plaintiff the discovery requests, such that responses were
due by August 2, 2024.  As of the filing
of the motions, Defendant states that it has not received responses from Plaintiff.  Plaintiff has filed not opposition.  Failure to file an opposition to the motion
indicates the other parties' acquiescence that the motion is meritorious. CRC
Rule 8.54(c).
Defendant’s unopposed
motions to compel responses to the FROG-1, FROG-2, FROG-3, and RPD are granted
pursuant to CCP §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses to Defendant’s
discovery requests, without
objections, within 20 days of notice of this order.  
Defendant
requests sanctions against Plaintiff and its attorney in the amount of $1,573
for each of the three FROG motions and $2,810.80 for the RPD motion.  The requests are granted in in the reasonable
amount of $2,500 in total attorney’s fees on these relatively simple and
essentially duplicative motions to compel initial responses, plus $240 in
filing fees.  Plaintiff and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, are ordered to
pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,740 to Defendant, by and through
counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order. 
Defendant shall provide
notice of this order.
