The FAC alleges negligence, breach of oral contract, and breach of fiduciary duty against Zimmerman and other defendants. The Court has overruled the demurrer to the 1st cause of action for negligence, finding that the FAC sufficiently alleges facts showing that Plaintiff discovered the facts regarding Defendant's alleged malpractice in late 2023. The Court has sustained the demurrer to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action with leave to amend, finding that the allegations are duplicative of a negligence cause of action and that further facts should be alleged to support the nature of the fiduciary relationship and how the defendants breached that duty.
