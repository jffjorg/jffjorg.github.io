And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff, Brandon Edward Bourgeois, in a case against Ford Motor Company and Star Ford Lincoln Mercury. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to honor the warranty on a 2020 Ford Escape vehicle and seeks compensation for the defects and nonconformities that manifested during the warranty period.

The defendants had filed a motion to compel the plaintiff's further responses to special interrogatories, and the plaintiff had failed to file an opposition brief. However, the plaintiff later filed an opposition brief and served supplemental, verified responses prior to the hearing.

The court has denied the motion to compel further responses, finding that the supplemental responses were provided prior to the hearing and that the motion is therefore moot. The court has also declined to award sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $560 as requested by the defendants.

The parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding the supplemental responses, and if there are still issues, the defendants may file a motion to compel further responses based on the supplemental responses.
