On August 12,
2024, Defendant CBO Foods, LLC (“Defendant”) filed a motion for order deeming the
Amended Requests for Admissions (“RFA”), set one, admitted.  Defendant requests sanctions against
Plaintiff and his attorney in the amount of $1,592.50.  
On July 27,
2023, Defendant served various discovery requests, including the RFA on
Plaintiff.  (Nurinda Decl., ¶3, Ex.
A.)  On September 28, 2023, Plaintiff
served objections/responses and verifications on November 1, 2023.  (Id., ¶4, Ex. B.)  Defendant states that the parties met and
conferred via letter and email.  (Id.,
¶4, Exs. C-D.)  According to Plaintiff’s
counsel’s email dated December 6, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel stated they were
amenable to extending Defendant’s motion date to January 19, 2024 (originally
due by December 19, 2023 for a motion to compel further, 45 days from November
1, 2023) so that the parties could meet and confer properly, and stating that
Plaintiff could not respond to RFA Nos. 1-14 as currently drafted.  (Id., Ex. D.)  On December 8, 2024, defense counsel states
that she met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel telephonically and
Plaintiff’s counsel insisted that RFA Nos. 1-14 needed to be amended and
re-served.  (Id., ¶5.)  On December 21, 2023, Defendant served on
Plaintiff amended RFA requests, such that responses were due by January
22, 2024.  (Id., ¶¶7-8, Ex.
E.)  As of the filing of the motions, Defendant
states that it has not received responses to the amended RFA from Plaintiff.  (Id., ¶9.)  
On September 9,
2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition brief, stating that he provided responses
on September 8, 2023 and verifications on November 1, 2023 to the original RFA
requests.  Plaintiff argues that
Defendant should have filed a motion to compel further responses
following the November 1, 2023 verifications to the original RFA requests, or
propounded RFA set two regarding the “amended” RFAs. 
On September 13,
2024, Defendant filed a reply brief, arguing that the parties had an
understanding that amended RFA Nos. 1-14 would be re-propounded.  Defendant argues that there is no authority
holding that amended requests should not be treated as new requests.   
While the
parties had some written correspondence, it appears that a misunderstanding
arose during subsequent telephonic/oral meet and confer efforts.  Defense counsel states that Plaintiff’s
counsel represented that Plaintiff would not respond to RFA Nos. 1-14 (regarding
authentication of documents) unless amended and re-served.  (Nurinda Decl., ¶5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel states that he did not
agree to re-respond to updated RFA Nos. 1-14 since Plaintiff already responded
to the initial RFA Nos. 1-14 (Chavez Decl., ¶5); rather, Plaintiff argues he
agreed to respond to the RFAs if they were propounded in a second set of RFAs
(such as RFA set two, Nos. 30-43).  Plaintiff
argues that the parties only discussed RFA Nos. 1-14 in their meet and confer,
but Defendant attempted to re-propound amended RFA (set one) Nos. 1-29 in their
entirety.  
In light of the
parties’ misunderstanding, the Court will order the parties to meet and confer
regarding this motion.  It is unclear why
the parties did not meet and confer earlier as Plaintiff seems to acknowledge receiving
the amended RFA requests in January 2024 (but did not respond) and Defendant
was aware that responses were not provided on the amended RFAs yet waited until
August 2024 to file this motion (or let the time expire to file a motion to
compel further responses to the original RFA responses).  Regardless of the confusion or the delays, it
appears that Plaintiff was and has been willing to provide updated responses if
the RFAs were updated/amended.  If
Plaintiff is willing to respond to the discovery, Defendant should consider
serving the “amended” RFA (set one) Nos. 1-14 as RFA (set two) with new
numbering, and consider taking this motion off-calendar.  
Defendant’s motion for an order deeming
the Amended RFAs admitted is continued to October 25, 2024.  Prior to the continued hearing date, the
parties are ordered to file a status update on the meet and confer efforts by
the end of the business day of October 18, 2024.  This status update may be jointly or
separately filed by the parties.   
Defendant shall provide
notice of this order.
