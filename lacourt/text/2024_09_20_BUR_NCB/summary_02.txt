Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, Nelson Hernandez and Gonzalo Perez, in their motion to set aside the dismissal of their case and enter judgment against the defendants, To Your Home Delivery, Inc., et al.

The plaintiffs had entered into a settlement agreement with the defendants, which provided for the payment of $40,000.12 in installments. However, the defendants failed to make payments as agreed, and the plaintiffs are seeking to enforce the settlement agreement and enter the stipulated judgment.

The judge has found that there is substantive merit to granting the motion and has granted the motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment in the amount of $60,000. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs' counsel to electronically submit the judgment within 10 days, and the plaintiffs are required to provide notice of this order.
