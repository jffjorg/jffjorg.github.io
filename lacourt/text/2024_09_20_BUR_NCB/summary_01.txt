And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint in a case involving a breach of fiduciary duty and other claims. The plaintiff, Amy R. Amira, Trustee of The Cynthia L. Amira Family Trust, is seeking to file a second amended complaint that adds new causes of action for negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty to safeguard, breach of fiduciary duty to supervise, and negligent supervision and retention. The defendants, CMM, LLP, et al., have not opposed the motion.

The judge has granted the motion, allowing the plaintiff to file the second amended complaint. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to electronically file a separate copy of the complaint and to serve all defendants. The judge's ruling is based on the liberal policy of allowing amendments to pleadings, as well as the plaintiff's declaration addressing the factors under CRC Rule 3.1324.

The case involves allegations that the defendants, including CMM, LLP and its partner Gregory A. Mogab, breached their fiduciary duty to the Amira Trust and conspired to fraudulently induce the trust to enter into a limited partnership investment controlled by the defendants as the general partner. The plaintiff is seeking damages and other relief for the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and other wrongful conduct.
