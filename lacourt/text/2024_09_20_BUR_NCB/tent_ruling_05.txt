BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
Plaintiff Brandon Edward Bourgeois (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that on April 4, 2020, Plaintiff entered into a warranty contact with
Defendant Ford Motor Company (“FMC”) regarding a 2020 Ford Escape vehicle.  Plaintiff alleges that the warranty contract contained various warranties, including but not limited to the
bumper-bumper warranty, powertrain warranty, emission warranty, etc.  Plaintiff alleges that the defects and
nonconformities to the warranty manifested themselves during the applicable
warranty period, including but not limited to, engine defects, transmission
defects, infotainment defects, and electrical defects, among other defects and
non-conformities.  Plaintiff alleges that
FMC failed to promptly replace the vehicle or make restitution.  
Plaintiff
alleges that he delivered the vehicle to Defendant Star Ford Lincoln
Mercury (“Star”) for substantial repair on at least one
occasion, but Star failed to use ordinary care and skill to properly store,
prepare, and repair the subject vehicle. 

The complaint, filed August 16, 2023,
alleges causes of action for: (1) violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(D); (2) violation
of Civil Code, § 1793.2(B); (3) violation of Civil Code, § 1793.2(A)(3); (4)
breach of the implied warranty of merchantability (Civil Code, §§ 1791.1, 1794,
and 1795.5); and (5) negligent repair. 
B.    
Motion on Calendar 
On July 9, 2024, Defendants Ford Motor
Company (“FMC”) and Star Ford Lincoln Mercury (“Star”) filed a motion to compel
Plaintiff’s further responses to Special Interrogatories, set one (“SROG”).  
On August 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a CCP §
473(b) declaration of Anna Weiser regarding Plaintiff’s failure to file an
opposition to the motion.
The matter initially came for hearing on
August 7, 2024 so that the judicial officer (Judge J. Kralik) could make a
disclosure regarding former representation of Ford Motor Company.  The parties expressed at the hearing that
they were willing to waive any issues regarding bias and the Court continued
the hearing on the motion.  At the
initial hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel orally requested leave to file an
opposition brief on behalf of Plaintiff based on the continued hearing date,
which the Court allowed. 
On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
untimely opposition brief and a CCP § 473(b) declaration of Nino Sanaia regarding
Plaintiff’s failure to file an opposition to the motion.
DISCUSSION
            FMC moves to compel Plaintiff’s
further responses to SROG Nos. 1-3, 7-8, and 15-18. FMC seeks $560 in sanctions
against Plaintiff.   
            In
the August 1, 2024 declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, Ms. Weiser states that
she inadvertently failed to file an opposition brief following her discussion
about discovery with defense counsel regarding over 30 cases.  She states that Plaintiff supplemented his
responses on August 1, 2024, with verifications to follow.  (Weiser Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2.)  
            In the subsequent September 13, 2024
declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, Mr. Sanaia states that Plaintiff served
responses to the SROG on April 8, 2024 and verifications on April 17, 2024,
making FMC’s motion to compel further deadline June 3, 2024.  (Sanaia Decl., ¶5.)  Thus, he argues that the motion to compel
further is untimely as it was filed on July 9, 2024.  (Id., ¶¶5-6.)  He states that Plaintiff served further
verified responses on August 1, 2024, such that FMC’s motion is procedurally
moot.  (Id., ¶¶7-8.)  
            In Plaintiff’s September 13, 2024
opposition papers, Plaintiff provides the further verified responses served on
August 1, 2024 as Exhibit 4.  The
supplemental responses are directed to SROG Nos. 1-22 and 24-26.  The verification is dated August 2, 2024 and
was served on August 5, 2024.  (Opp. at
Ex. 4.)  
             As supplemental responses were provided prior
to the hearing, the motion to compel further responses to the SROG is
denied.  The parties are ordered to meet
and confer regarding the supplemental responses dated August 1, 2024 with
verifications signed on August 2, 2024.  If
there are still issues with the supplemental responses, then FMC should file a
motion to compel further responses based on the supplemental responses.   
            FMC requests sanctions in the amount
of $560 against Plaintiff.  At this time,
the Court declines to award sanctions.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Defendant Ford
Motor Company’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to the Special Interrogatories
is denied in light of Plaintiff’s service of supplemental, verified
responses.  No sanctions will be awarded
on this motion. 
Defendants shall provide notice of this
order.
