And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling overruling the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff alleges that she was subjected to sexual abuse by the defendant, Fred Tah, when she was 17 years old and a student at Vista High School. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's employer, Lynwood Unified School District, was negligent in hiring, supervising, and retaining the defendant, and failed to report suspected child abuse. The defendant argued that the fourth cause of action is based on a criminal statute that does not require the district to report suspected child abuse or neglect, and that the negligence claims are duplicative. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims are not duplicative and that the district's liability is based on the employees' negligence and the district's failure to discharge its duty to supervise and protect the plaintiff. The judge also found that the plaintiff is not required to identify specific witnesses and evidence, and that the district's contention that the plaintiff is asserting a private right of action under the Child Assault and Neglect Reporting Act (CANRA) is not supported. The judge ordered the district to answer the complaint within 10 days.
