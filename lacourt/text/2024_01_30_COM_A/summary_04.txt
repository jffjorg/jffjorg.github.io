And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiff's complaint alleging an unlawful detainer action. The Defendant claimed that the Plaintiff failed to make needed repairs and breached the warranty of habitability, entitling the Defendant to withhold rent. However, the Judge found that the Defendant's arguments raise tenant defenses that should be raised in an answer, not in a motion to strike. The Judge also noted that the Defendant's claims do not appear on the face of the complaint or in any matter subject to judicial notice. As a result, the Judge denied the motion to strike and ordered the Defendant to file an answer within five days.
