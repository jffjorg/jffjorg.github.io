Here is a summary of the English-text:

The Judge's tentative ruling overrules the demurrer to the second cause of action for fraudulent inducement/concealment and denies the motion to strike the claim for punitive damages. The Judge finds that the complaint adequately alleges a claim for fraudulent inducement/concealment and that the economic loss rule does not bar the claim. The Judge also finds that the claim is not preempted by federal law.

The Judge notes that the complaint alleges that Defendant failed to disclose defects in the sensing system and that Plaintiff relied on representations made by Defendant and its authorized technicians. The Judge finds that the claim for punitive damages is supported by the predicate acts of fraudulent concealment and that the conduct of the Defendant was intentional and malicious.

The Judge also denies the motion to strike the claim for punitive damages, finding that the complaint adequately alleges the necessary elements for a claim for punitive damages. The Judge notes that the White v. Ultramar, Inc. case does not require the identification of a specific corporate agent who engaged in the unlawful acts, but rather requires evidence that the corporate employee had broad discretionary powers and exercised substantial discretionary authority in the corporation.
