And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted plaintiff Xiaoke Li's motion to compel defendant CTour Holiday LLC to provide responses to special interrogatories. The motion is unopposed, and CTour failed to provide responses by the original deadline and a subsequent deadline set at an informal discovery conference. The judge notes that failing to respond to special interrogatories within the time limit waives most objections to the interrogatories and gives the propounding party the right to move for an order compelling responses.

The judge has denied plaintiff's request for a $1,860 monetary sanction against CTour and defense counsel without prejudice. The request can be re-raised if CTour fails to comply with this ruling.
