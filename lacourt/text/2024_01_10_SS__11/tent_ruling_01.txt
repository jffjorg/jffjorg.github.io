TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant CTour Holiday LLC (“CTour”) to
provide responses to special interrogatories (set one) is granted.
 
Plaintiff’s request for a monetary sanction is denied without
prejudice.
 
BACKGROUND
 
“This is a ‘wage and hour’ putative class action.”  (6/2/23 Ruling Re: Motion to Lift Arbitration
Stay, p. 1.)
 
“On 10/1/20, Defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 1/26/21, Judge Ann Jones granted the motion to compel and stayed the
case pending the completion of arbitration.” 
(Ibid.)
 
“On 12/30/22, the arbitration provider emailed an initial invoice to the
parties.”  (Ibid.)
 
“On 3/15/23, the arbitration provider confirmed that it had not received
payment from Defendants.”  (Ibid.)
 
On 4/17/23, Plaintiff filed a motion to lift the arbitration stay.
 
On 6/2/23, this Court granted Plaintiff’s motion.
 
On 7/18/23, Plaintiff served special interrogatories (set one) on
Defendant CTour.
 
On 11/6/23, the Court held an informal discovery conference.  CTour agreed to respond to the special
interrogatories without objections by 11/20/23, and the Court granted Plaintiff
leave to file a motion to compel in the event CTour failed to provide timely
responses.
 
On 12/13/23, Plaintiff filed the motion to compel.
 
Now, the Court considers whether the motion should be granted.
 
DISCUSSION
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
motion to compel should be granted because:
 
* it is unopposed;
 
* CTour failed to provide
responses by either the original deadline (8/21/23) or the deadline set at the
informal discovery conference (11/20/23);
 
* to date, CTour still has not
provided responses; and
 
* “[f]ailing to respond” to
special interrogatories “within the time limit waives most objections to the
interrogatories, including claims of privilege and ‘work product’
protection[,]” and gives “the propounding party” the right to “move for an
order compelling responses[.]”  (Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group June 2023 Update) ¶¶ 8:1030, 8:1137; see also Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290,
subds. (a), (b).)
 
Plaintiff’s request for a $1,860
monetary sanction against CTour and defense counsel is denied without
prejudice.  The request can be reraised
if CTour fails to comply with this ruling.
