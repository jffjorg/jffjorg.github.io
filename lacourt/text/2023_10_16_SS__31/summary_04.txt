And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses in the case of Ronald Belton vs. House of Uhuru, ET AL. The defendant, Watts Healthcare Corporation, has moved to compel the plaintiff to provide further responses to discovery. However, the judge has found that the parties did not participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) prior to the motions being heard, as required by the court's standing order. Therefore, the judge has ordered the parties to participate in an IDC and has continued the hearing on the motions to compel further responses to a new date. The parties are also encouraged to meet and confer to try to reach an agreement and are required to submit a joint statement of items in dispute if they are unable to resolve all outstanding issues at the IDC.
