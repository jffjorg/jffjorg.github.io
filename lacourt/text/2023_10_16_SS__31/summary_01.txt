The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a case between Interinsurance Exchange of The Automobile Club (Plaintiff) and Alma Lorena Oseguera, ET AL. (Defendant). The Plaintiff seeks to set aside a dismissal and enter judgment against the Defendant, alleging that the Defendant breached the terms of a stipulation for conditional settlement and entry of judgment. The stipulation requires the Defendant to make payments to the Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff claims that the Defendant has failed to make these payments.

The Judge notes that the parties' stipulation provides that if the Defendant defaults on payments, the Plaintiff may file a stipulation for judgment for the amount of $33,754.26. The Plaintiff's counsel declares that the Defendant has made payments totaling $1,905, but is more than 15 days delinquent with respect to all payments.

The Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment in the amount of $31,849.26 plus $450, in the total amount of $32,299.26, in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Defendant. The Judge finds that the Defendant breached the terms of the stipulation and that the Plaintiff is entitled to judgment.

The Judge orders that the Plaintiff give notice, and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
