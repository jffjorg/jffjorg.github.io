And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the motion to bifurcate the trial, filed by defendant Gabriel's Cleaning Maintenance & Pressure Washing, LLC and joined by the City of Los Angeles. The motion sought to separate the issues of liability and damages for trial. The judge found that the trial court should determine whether bifurcation is warranted, rather than the court ruling on the motion. The motion is denied without prejudice, allowing the defendant to raise the issue again at the trial court's discretion. The judge has ordered the bifurcation briefing to be included in the trial binders and has encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
