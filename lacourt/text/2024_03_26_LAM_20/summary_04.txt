And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling regarding the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees filed by the defendants, Morad Golcheh and Nahid Golcheh. The defendants are seeking $37,040 in attorneys’ fees in connection with the summary judgment motion they filed and won. The plaintiff, Rafie Rafiee, argues that there is no contractual authority for the fees because his claims are based on a separate oral agreement, rather than the written sales contract. However, the Court disagrees with the plaintiff’s interpretation of its previous order and finds that the defendants are entitled to the fees. The Court also finds that the amount sought is reasonable given the parties’ extensive litigation. The Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is granted.
