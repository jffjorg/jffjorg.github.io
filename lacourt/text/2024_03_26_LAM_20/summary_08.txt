And here is the English-text summary:

This is a habitability matter involving a complaint filed by multiple plaintiffs against defendant Maria Leon. The plaintiffs, including minor children, seek a trial preference under Code Civ. Proc. § 36(b) due to their alleged exposure to hazardous conditions in the subject premises. The defendant argues that due process rights will be violated due to insufficient time for discovery, but the court finds that the language of the statute is mandatory and that counsel should be able to prepare for a routine habitability matter within a reasonable timeframe. The court grants the motion for trial preference and sets the trial date for July 24, 2024.
