And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a dispute between Khatri and RKA regarding the life-safety significance of observed conditions in a building. Khatri argues that the conditions are not a safety concern, while RKA disagrees. The judge has reviewed the evidence and finds that the parties have presented conflicting opinions on the issue. The judge is considering the proportionate liability of the parties and will make a decision based on the evidence presented. The judge notes that the issue is not straightforward and that the parties have presented different interpretations of the same data. The judge will issue a final ruling after considering all the evidence and arguments presented.
