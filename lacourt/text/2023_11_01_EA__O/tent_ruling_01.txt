Nos. 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 21, 23, 24, 29, 33, 39, 41, 51, 54, 56, 57, 58,
62, 66, 72, 83, 91, 96, 101, 106, 108, 109, 118, 120, 123, 125, 126, 129, 130,
131, 132, 137 140, 141. 
 
Plaintiff seeks, inter alia, Internal Knowledge and
Investigation related to the Transmission Defects and Engine Defects in 2021
GMC Canyon vehicles, (ii) Summaries, Memoranda, Power Points related to the
Transmission Defects and Engine Defects in 2021 GMC Canyon vehicles, (iii) Policies
and Procedures related to the Song Beverly Act, (iv) Communication With
Governmental Agencies and Suppliers related to the Transmission Defects and
Engine Defects in 2021 GMC Canyon vehicles, and (v) Other Documents Related To
The Subject Vehicle’s Defects in a basic SBA case. 
Pursuant to the Song-Beverly Act, a plaintiff “has
the burden to prove that (1) the vehicle had a nonconformity covered by the
express warranty that substantially impaired the use, value or safety of the
vehicle (the nonconformity element); (2) the vehicle was presented to an
authorized representative of the manufacturer of the vehicle for repair (the
presentation element); and (3) the manufacturer or his representative did not
repair the nonconformity after a reasonable number of repair attempts (the failure
to repair element).” (Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101, citing Civ. Code, § 1793.2 and Ibrahim v. Ford Motor
Co. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 878, 886-887.) In Donlen v. Ford Motor Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138 (Donlen), the court held a jury’s verdict
that the manufacturer failed to bring the vehicle into conformity with warranty
was supported by sufficient evidence, including evidence establishing the
manufacturer was already aware of ongoing defects through service messages and
technical service bulletins. (Id., at p. 153-154.)
Defendant attempts to distinguish Donlen on
the grounds that the case did not rule on the propriety of discovery. (Opp. p.
7.) Defendant is correct that Donlen did not deal with a discovery
dispute and instead assessed whether the jury’s verdict in a lemon law action
was supported by substantial evidence. However, because Donlen such
evidence supported the jury’s verdict, it is necessarily relevant and
discoverable. 
To the extent that Defendant cites to another
case, it is an unpublished, trial court decision.
To the extent that some of the discovery is
confidential/constitutes as trade secrets, Defendant could have filed for a
protective order/stipulated to one with Plaintiff. 
To the extent that Defendant objects on the
grounds that the electronically stored information (ESI) is burdensome, GM's
Opposition is silent as to the specific nature of the burden such as time,
labor, and monetary costs or prejudice incurred. (Code Civ. Proc. §2019.030
[quoting the general discovery provisions].) 
Thus, the court summarily overrules Defendant’s
boilerplate objections as entirely devoid of merit. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further is GRANTED as to Request Nos. 18, 21, 23, 24,
29, 33, 39, 41, 51, 54, 56, 57, 58, 62, 66, 72, 83, 91, 96, 101, 123, 125, 126,
129, 130, 131, 132, 137 140, 141. (Opp. p. 8.) 
As for the Subject Vehicle Discovery, this category
comprises documents and information concerning the Subject Vehicle itself,
defined as the "2021 GMC Canyon vehicle identification number
1GTG6FENXM1186442”, which was manufactured and/or distributed by GM. These
documents are indisputably relevant to Plaintiff's SBA. (See Krotin v.
Porsche Cars N. Am., Inc., (1995) 38 Cal. App. 4th 294, 303 (an automobile
manufacturer's "dealers’ service records” are probative of whether a
particular vehicle is defective); see also Jensen v. BMW of N. Am., LLC,
328 F.R.D. 557, 562 (S.D. Cal. 2019) (records concerning the specific vehicle
at issue" are relevant to proving liability under the SBA). In opposition,
Defendant maintains it has provided responses to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, and
11, and the Reply appears silent on the matter. Thus, the RFPs as to Nos 1, 2,
3, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are MOOT. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted in its
entirety. No monetary sanctions are imposed.
