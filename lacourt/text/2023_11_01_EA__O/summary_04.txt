Significant Statements:
  - The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending final resolution upon a trial.
  - The plaintiff must show the absence of an adequate damages remedy at law.
  - The court considers two factors in determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction: (1) the likelihood the plaintiff will prevail on the merits of its case at trial, and (2) the interim harm the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff, CYNTHIA ESCUTIA-COBAIN, is seeking to remove two individuals, ISABEL HSIEH and KAREN LEE, from the Board of Directors of the HOA because they are not resident unit owners, as required by Article IV of the bylaws. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff has failed to show irreparable harm and that the defendants have presented evidence that they are, in fact, resident unit owners. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's characterization of the action as an "election challenge under Civil Code section 5145" is misplaced. As a result, the motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.
