[“[P]resumption of fairness exists where . . . investigation and discovery are
sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act intelligently”] (emphasis
added); see also Erreca’s v. Superior Court (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1475,
1495 [“[T]he trial court had before it a good deal of evidence on the
proportionate liability of the parties, and made factual evaluations of that
evidence. The trial court could properly utilize its own experience, the attorneys'
evaluations, and expert opinion in making a decision upon the valuation
issue.”].)

that it is reasonable to believe that the roof framing is incapable of
functioning adequately to protect the life-safety of occupants.”) 
 


[5] According to the Englekirk report, he “disagree[d] with
the life-safety significance of the observed conditions” reported in the Khatri
reports. (FAC, Ex. 6, p. 130 of 264 of PDF, emphasis original) Khatri
appears to argue that this statement was about the City’s decision, but the
statement only refers to the Khatri Reports. The Englekirk report did, however,
disagree with the City’s interpretation of the 2021 Report. (Id. at p.
131 [“The City of Diamond Bar appears to have come to such an interpretation of
the 2021 Report because they issued an Order to Vacate. I disagree with this
interpretation.”], emphasis original.) 
 


[6] As conceded by Khatri, though Tao’s Vacate Order was
based on his experience and qualifications as a licensed engineer and his
independent analysis of all of the available data, “that did include the
Khatri Reports.” (Reply to Avalon p. 6:24-27, emphasis added.) 
 


[7] See motion p. 16:26-28 [“KHATRI’s potential liability
is very low . . . KHATRI did not recommend immediate evacuation of the second
story units—rather that was an interpretation and decision made solely by TAO
and the CITY.”].) 
 


[8] Neither opposition addresses Khatri’s argument. 
 


[9] Neither opposition discusses this argument. Although,
RKA’s opposition may corroborate Khatri’s position as RKA, also citing to State
Ready Mix, Inc. v. Moffatt & Nichol (2015) 232 Cal.App.4th 1227,
maintains that it has a strong defense based upon the economic loss rule. (RKA
Opp. p. 13.)
