The tentative ruling grants in part the motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents, but does not impose monetary sanctions. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, Antonio Lopez, against General Motors, LLC, regarding a lemon law case. The plaintiff seeks production of documents related to transmission defects and engine defects in 2021 GMC Canyon vehicles, as well as policies and procedures related to the Song-Beverly Act. The court finds that the defendant's objections to production of certain documents are without merit, and grants the motion as to certain requests for production. The court also finds that the defendant's responses to certain requests for production are moot. The ruling is based on the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, California Code of Civil Procedure, and Civil Code.
