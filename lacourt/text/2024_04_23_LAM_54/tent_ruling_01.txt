Plaintiff moves for an order allocating
all settlement funds to Plaintiff under Insurance Code § 1871.7(g)(2)(B), which provides, “If the person bringing the action, as a
result of a violation of this section has paid money to the defendant or to an
attorney acting on behalf of the defendant in the underlying claim, then he or
she shall be entitled to up to double the amount paid to the defendant or the
attorney if that amount is greater than 50 percent of the proceeds [of settlement].
That person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court
finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorney's fees and
costs. All of those expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the
defendant.”
 
Plaintiff represents that it paid Defendant more than the settlement
amount prior to the suit due to Defendant’s allegedly illegal insurance scheme.
Plaintiff is entitled to the settlement proceeds under Insurance Code § 1871.7(g)(2)(B). The motion is
GRANTED.
