v. CR&R Incorporated, Case No. 23NWCV03414
 
This
case is about a motor vehicle accident. Defendant CR&R Incorporated seeks
ex parte relief to advance the hearing dates on its Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One and Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One to April 30, 2024.
They are currently set for September 24, 2024, and November 6, 2024,
respectively. 
 
A
party may seek ex prate relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Defendant
asserts that severe prejudice and significant waste will occur if the hearing
dates are not advanced and consolidated because the issues presented by each of
the three motions are identical. (Mot., pg. 2.) 
 
Based
on the above, the Court grants the motion. The two motions are advanced from
September 24, 2024, and November 6, 2024, to today’s date and CONTINUED to
April 30, 2024 in Dept. SE-C at 10:30 A.M.
