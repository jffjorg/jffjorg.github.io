And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the fourth cause of action in the plaintiff's first amended complaint is off-calendar as moot, and that the defendant's unopposed motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's first amended complaint is granted without leave to amend. The judge has also granted the motion to strike punitive damages since the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages is premised on the viability of their fourth cause of action for fraud, which is now moot. The judge has based this decision on California law and federal law, specifically the Song-Beverly Warranty Act and the California Civil Code.
