TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (set one) is
GRANTED in part.  Further responses are
due in 30 days.  
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
This lemon law action was filed by Plaintiffs JOSE
SANCHEZ OREJEL and SUSANA SANCHEZ (“Plaintiffs”) on December 22, 2022. 
 
On
October 25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the subject Motion, which seeks to compel
Defendant’s further responses to Request for Production of Documents (set one)
Nos. 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, and 45-46.

 
CCP § 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion
compelling further answers to document requests if it finds that the response
is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  The motion
shall be accompanied with a meet and confer declaration.  (CCP § 2031.310(b).)  
The Motion is GRANTED
in part. 
Request Nos. 20, 22,
23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 32
As to Requests Nos. 20, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 32, Defendant
responds that it has made a diligent search and reasonable inquiry and no such
documents have ever existed. 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request to compel further response to Requests Nos. 20, 22, 23, 26,
27, 28, 29, 30, and 32 is DENIED.  
Requests Nos. 45 and 46
Request No. 45: All
DOCUMENTS evidencing complaints by owners of 2019 Honda Civic vehicles
regarding any of the complaints that the SUBJECT VEHICLE was presented to YOUR
or YOUR authorized repair facilities for repair during the warranty period.
Request No. 46: All
documents evidencing warranty repairs to 2019 Honda Civic vehicles regarding
any of the components that YOU or YOUR authorized repair facilities performed
repairs on under warranty
Requests Nos. 45 and 46
are overbroad because they seek documents related to 2019 Honda Civic vehicles,
worldwide. These requests will be limited to documents concerning Honda Civic
vehicles sold in California.  
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further response to Requests Nos. 45 and 46 is
GRANTED in part.  Further responses are
due in 30 days.  
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories or demand for production of documents unless the party subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or the sanction would
otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310,
subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) The Court finds that Defendant acted with
substantial justification.
