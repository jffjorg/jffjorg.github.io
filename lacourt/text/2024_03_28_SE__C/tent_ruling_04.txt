     I.       
Defendant GENERAL MOTORS LLC’s Demurrer to the
Fourth Cause of Action in Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is OFF-CALENDAR
as MOOT pursuant to the Request for Dismissal without prejudice of the
Fourth Cause of action FILED on March 19, 2024. 
 
    II.       
Defendant GENERAL MOTORS LLC’s unopposed Motion
to Strike Punitive Damages from Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is GRANTED
without leave to amend pursuant to the Request for Dismissal without
prejudice of the Fourth Cause of action FILED on March 19, 2024. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
Motion to Strike
 
A motion to strike lies either when (1) there is “irrelevant, false or
improper matter inserted in any pleading”; or (2) to strike any pleading or
part thereof “not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule or order of court.” (CCP §436.)
 
As a matter of law, punitive damages are not available under
the remaining three causes of action, which are based on violations of the
Song-Beverly Warranty Act. (See Cal. Civ. Code §1794; 15 U.S.C §2301). 
 
Since Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages is premised on
the viability of their fourth cause of action for Fraud, the Motion is GRANTED
without leave to amend pursuant to the Request for Dismissal without prejudice
of the Fourth Cause of action for Fraud – Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment
filed on March 19, 2024.
