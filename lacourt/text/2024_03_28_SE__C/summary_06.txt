Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling continuing the motion for leave to file a first amended cross-complaint to May 30, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. The moving party is required to give notice of the continued hearing date. The judge notes that no opposition has been filed as of March 25, 2024, and that no proof of service or notice of hearing has been filed with the court. Although plaintiff's counsel was present at an ex parte hearing, there is no record of a waiver of notice. Therefore, the judge finds that plaintiff/opposing parties did not receive adequate notice of the hearing. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of the continued hearing date and requires the parties to file and serve opposition and reply papers in accordance with the new hearing date.
