And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The Plaintiffs' proposed Second Amended Complaint is not deemed filed until the Court's issuance of this Order, and the Plaintiffs are ordered to file it within 5 days. The Judge finds that the Motion complies with the requirements set forth by California Rules of Court and that the proposed amendments are not procedurally defective. The Judge also notes that California recognizes a general rule of liberal allowance of amendments and that great liberality is employed when ruling on motions for leave to amend. Therefore, the Judge grants the Motion and allows the Plaintiffs to file the proposed Second Amended Complaint, while also giving the Defendants the opportunity to demur, move for judgment on the pleadings, move to strike, or move for summary judgment.
