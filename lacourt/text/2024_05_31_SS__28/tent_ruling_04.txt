and production of documents, to be heard on March 22, 2024.  The Court continued the hearing to May 31,
2024.  Perez has not filed an opposition.

PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Jacob
Finn asks the Court to compel Perez to attend a deposition and produce
documents.  Jacob Finn also asks the
Court to impose sanctions on Perez. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party,
or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.

 “(g) (1) If a motion under subdivision (a) is granted,
the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the
court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. . . .” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b), (g)(1).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
October 23, 2023, Jacob Finn noticed Perez’s deposition for November 14, 2023.  Counsel met and conferred and agreed to move
the deposition to December 19, 2023.  On
October 31, 2023, Jacob Finn served an amended notice setting Perez’s
deposition on December 19, 2023. 
On December
14, 2024, at Perez’s counsel’s request, Jacob Finn’s counsel agreed to change
the location of the deposition.  Jacob
Finn served a second amended deposition notice reflecting the new location.
 The deposition
notice stated in part: 
“NOTICE IS FURTHER GIVEN that in the event the
Deponent cancels their Deposition less than seventy-two (72) hours in advance
of the Deposition (as scheduled herein or as alternatively stipulated) or
Deponent fails to appear at the Deposition without prior notice, said Deponent
shall be responsible for any late cancellation fees assessed by any court
reporters, interpreters, videographers or otherwise and shall remit payment of
the same to the attorneys for the party serving this Notice within ten (10) days
of service of written notice of the accrual of any such fees.” 
Perez
did not serve objections to the deposition notices served on October 23,
October 31, and December 14, 2023. 
On
December 18, 2023, less than 24 hours before the scheduled deposition, Perez’s
counsel cancelled the deposition.  Perez
did not appear for the December 19, 2023 deposition or provide the documents
requested in the deposition notice.  Due
to the late cancellation, Jacob Finn incurred costs for the interpreter, videographer,
and court reporter retained for the deposition. 
On
December 19, 2023, Jacob Finn’s counsel attempted to meet and confer with Perez’s
counsel to reschedule the deposition in January 2024.  Perez’s counsel did not respond to the
attempt to meet and confer. 
Based on these undisputed facts, the Court finds good cause to grant the motion.  The Court orders Perez
to appear for a deposition and provide responsive documents within 30 days of
the hearing on the motion. 
          Jacob Finn asks the Court to award $4,865.65 in sanctions, consisting of $3,444.00 for attorney time, $1,360.00 in fees for the interpreter,
videographer and court reporter, and one $61.65 filing fee.  Jacob Finn does not state the amount of time
his attorney spent preparing this motion or the attorney’s billable rate.  
The
Court grants $2,171.65 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at a
reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour ($750.00), fees for the interpreter,
videographer, and court reporter ($1,360.00), and a filing fee ($61.65). 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Jacob Michael Finn’s motion
to compel Plaintiff Aristides Perez’s deposition
and orders Plaintiff Aristides Perez to appear for a deposition
and provide responsive documents within 30 days of the hearing on this motion. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Jacob Michael Finn’s request for sanctions and orders
Plaintiff Aristides Perez and his counsel to pay Defendant Jacob Michael Finn $2,171.65 within 30 days of the hearing on
this motion. Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
