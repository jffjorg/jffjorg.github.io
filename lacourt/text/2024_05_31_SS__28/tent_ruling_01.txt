On

On
May 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on May

$27,799.50 as the demand of the complaint, $8,407.64 in prejudgment interest, and

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff has submitted a completed default judgment
packet with all applicable attachments. 
Under Vehicle Code section 17151, Rizo-Uribe and Uribe
are jointly and severally liable for $17,799.50, in damages, $5,383.25 in
interest and $635.00 in costs.  Rizo-Uribe
is also liable for the remaining $10,000.00 in damages and $3,024.39 in
interest. 
The Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of
the Automobile Club’s application for default judgment filed on May 1, 2024.  The Court awards Plaintiff Interinsurance
Exchange of the Automobile Club $23,817.75 against Defendants Breanna
Christina Rizo-Uribe and David Uribe, jointly and severally.  In addition, the Court
awards Plaintiff Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club $13,024.39
against Defendant Breanna Rizo-Uribe. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
