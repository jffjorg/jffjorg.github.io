Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,
and Requests for Production of Documents 
TENTATIVE
RULING

              Defendant is ordered to give notice

BACKGROUND 
This is a motor vehicle personal injury action. On January 19,
2024, plaintiff Carlos Mendoza (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Alejandro
Gomez (Defendant) and Does 1-10, alleging a cause of action for motor vehicle
negligence. 
On June 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions to compel Defendant’s
further responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for
Production of Documents. On June 26, 2024, Defendant opposed the motions. On July
2, Plaintiff replied. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Interrogatories
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300(a)
provides that on receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding
party deems that any of the following apply: (1) An answer
to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.  (2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3) An
objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300(d)
further provides that “[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd.
(d).) 
Requests
for Production of Documents
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(a)
provides that on receipt of a response to a request for production of
documents, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if: (1) A
statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2) A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An
objection in the response is without merit or too general. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(h)
further provides that “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter
7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)

DISCUSSION 
Meet and Confer 
A motion
to compel further responses requires the parties to meet and confer before
bringing such a motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(1).) Counsel
for Plaintiff provided a declaration indicating Plaintiff’s efforts to meet and
confer. (Berjis Decl., ¶ 9.) Unable to resolve their disagreement, the parties
proceeded to an Informal Discovery Conference on May 1, 2024. (Minute Order (5/1/24).)
At the IDC, pursuant to the agreement of counsel, the Court ordered Defendant
to serve supplemental responses by May 22, 2024. (Ibid.) The Court finds
Plaintiff’s meet-and-confer efforts satisfactory.  
            Analysis 
Plaintiff propounded his first sets of Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents on February
8, 2024. (Berjis Decl., ¶ 3.) Despite Defendant’s request for a three-week
extension, Plaintiff granted Defendant a two-week extension to respond. (Id., ¶¶
4, 5.) On March 28, 2024, the day that Defendant’s responses were due,
Defendant requested another extension. (Id., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff refused because
Defendant did not provide any explanation as to why another extension was
needed. (Id., ¶ 7.) That same day, Defendant served responses to Plaintiff’s
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of
Documents. (Id., ¶ 8.) Defendant objected to every single request and
interrogatory, except Form Interrogatory No. 1.1. (Ibid.) On June 3, 2024,
Plaintiff moved to compel further responses. 
On June 26, 2024, Defendant filed oppositions. Defendant contends
that Plaintiff’s motions are now moot because Defendant served further
responses on June 24, 2024. (Rabbani Decl., Exh. A, Proof of Service.)
Plaintiff’s counsel, in reply, stated that they never received the further
responses. Instead, Defendant’s further responses were only made available because
they were attached to Defendant’s oppositions. 
Plaintiff states that some of the responses that Defendant
ultimately provided are sufficient, but others remain inadequate. Plaintiff
maintains his request for an order compelling Defendant’s further responses to:
Request for Production of Documents and Things Nos. 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,
38, and 43; Special Interrogatories Nos. 5, 8, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35,
36, 37, 40, 41, and 47; and Form Interrogatories Nos. 2.3(b), 2.4, 2.5(b) and
(c), 2.6, 2.7(d), 7.1, 12.5, 12.6, 14.1, 20.2(a), (c), (e), (f) and (g), 20.5,
20.8(a), (b) and (c), and 20.9. 
A motion to compel further production must set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection
demand. (See, e.g., CCP § 2031.310(b)(1).) Plaintiff has not identified why
further responses should be required of Defendant. In his moving papers,
Plaintiff merely stated in a conclusory manner that “the documents sought will
not only help evaluate Plaintiff’s case, but it is most certainly necessary in
facilitating a settlement in this matter.” (RPD Motion, 8:3-4.) In reply, the
only reason Plaintiff provided for granting the motions is that “Defendant’s
responses are not in substantial compliance”. (RPD Reply, 4:12.) This falls
short of the “specific facts” standard. Further, there is no separate statement
identifying the particular responses and reasons for compelling further
responses. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s motions. 
The Court further DENIES Plaintiff’s requests for monetary
sanctions. Based on the declarations of Elham R. Rabbani, the Court finds that
given the circumstances regarding the unavailability of attorneys, and given
the early stage of this case and the lack of cooperation in granting the
requested extensions, that the imposition of monetary sanctions would be
unjust. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motions and further DENIES Plaintiff’s
requests for monetary sanctions. 
              Defendant is ordered to give notice
of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
