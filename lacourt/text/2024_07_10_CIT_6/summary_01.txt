Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendant. The judge found that the plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to justify compelling further responses from the defendant and that the defendant's objections to the plaintiff's requests were not without merit. The judge also found that the imposition of monetary sanctions would be unjust given the circumstances of the case, including the unavailability of attorneys and the early stage of the case. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days.
