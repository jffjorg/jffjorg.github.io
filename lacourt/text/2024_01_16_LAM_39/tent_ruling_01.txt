  Case Number:  19STCV28802    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2024    Dept:  39 Zaleka
Turner, et al. v. Shipt, Inc., et al.
Case
No. 19STCV28802
Motion
for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement
Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees and Service Awards 
 
            Plaintiffs
Zaleka Turner and Lauren Kiktavi (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed the instant
case against Shipt, Inc. and Target Corporation (collectively,
“Defendants”).  Plaintiffs asserted a
claim under the Labor Code Private Attorney General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), as
well as class action claims for alleged wage and hour violations.  The parties reached a settlement.  However, one of Plaintiffs’ attorneys (who
also represented plaintiffs in related cases) and the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency, Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor
Standards Enforcement (the “LWDA”) objected to the settlement.  The Court rejected the settlement.  (See Court’s Order, dated May 8, 2023.)  The initial settlement amount was $6,268,000, and the parties allocated one-third of this
amount—or $2,068,440—to attorneys’ fees. 
(Ibid.)  After expenses and
service awards, the State would receive only $500,000, and the class of
approximately 78,000 members would receive only $3,531,560.  (Ibid.) 

 
The parties participated in a mandatory settlement
conference with the Honorable Ruth A. Kwan, Superior Court Judge, over two
sessions, following which they reached a new settlement for a higher amount
that would resolve four cases: (1) Zaleka Turner v. Shipt, Inc., Case Number
19STCV28802, (2) Sander v. Shipt, Inc., Case Number RG19031481 in the Alameda
County Superior Court, (3) Cho v. Shipt, Inc., Case No. RG200083342 in the Alameda
County Superior Court, and (4) Green v. Shipt Inc., Case Number 20STCV01001 in
the Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
The plaintiffs’ lawyers on all four cases have been designated as
“Settlement Class Counsel.”  (See Court’s
Order, dated October 9, 2023.)  The class
is comprised of $118,628 class members. 
(See Declaration of Denise Islas, ¶ 6.) 
  
 
The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on
October 9, 2023.  The total settlement
amount is $14.5 million.  The settlement
administrator’s expenses are $229,979. 
(See id., ¶ 15.)  Plaintiffs’
counsel’s costs are $59,748.26.  (See
ibid.)  The PAGA penalty is $1,160,000,
of which the State of California will receive $870,000.  Plaintiffs’ counsel—which includes lawyers
for all four cases—are requesting a contingency fee of one-third of the total
settlement amount, which is $4,833,333. 
Plaintiffs also request a service award of $12,500 for each of the six
named plaintiffs.  The class members will
receive the remaining amount, which is $8,231,939.74 (assuming the Court
approves all of the requested deductions/expenditures).  
 
On October 18, 2023, notices were emailed to the class
members for whom there was a valid email address available.  (See Declaration of Denise Islas, ¶ 8.)  All other class members were notified by
first class mail.  (Id., ¶¶ 9-10.)  Following this process, only 109 notices were
determined to be “undeliverable,” which manes that 99.91% of all class members
received notice.  (Id., ¶ 10.)  The settlement administrator received 341
valid requests for exclusion from the settlement.  (Id., ¶ 17.) 
The settlement administrator received two written objections, one of
which “does not meet the criteria for a valid objection.”  (Id., ¶ 18.) 
The Court has reviewed and considered the two objections.  The first objection does not address the
terms of the settlement but instead argues that “[t]o take the word of the
Shipt organization for the amount of hours would be a grave injustice” and notes
that “[m]ost of these orders pay an average about $6.00 and gas is $5.00 . . .
.”  The second objection does not meet
the criteria for a valid objection, but argues that “$14,000,000 cannot fairly
compensate 120,000 shoppers for all the items brought forth in this settlement
. . . .” and challenges the requested service awards to the named
plaintiffs.  This shopper was free to
opt-out of the settlement and pursue her own case, though the Court agrees with
her criticism of the service awards (and had planned to reduce these awards even
before reading her objection).  The Court
notes that the vast majority of the class members do not object to the proposed
settlement, which is persuasive.    
 
The Court previously approved the settlement amount and
PAGA penalty.  The requested settlement
administrator expenses fall within the range previously approved by the Court
(under $300,000).  The settlement
administrator has provided a declaration describing her work to date, and
included in her request the anticipated future costs of calculating, issuing,
and mailing the settlement checks.  (See
Declaration of Denise Islas, ¶ 20.)  The
Court does not require additional detail to approve the request of $229,979, as
Ms. Islas provides sufficient detail concerning her work; this amount is less
than what the Court previously approved; and the requested amount is
commensurate with what the Court would expect for a class action with this many
members.
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel seek reimbursement of costs of
$59,748.26.  The attorneys have provided
declarations and underlying records summarizing these costs as follows:
 
1.  Costs in Turner v. Shipt, Inc.         $34,657.41     (Declaration of Shannon Liss-Riordan, ¶
36.)
2.  Costs in Sander v. Shipt, Inc.        $8,317.14       (Declaration of Lonnie C. Blanchard, ¶
38.)
3.  Costs in Sander v. Shipt, Inc.        $10,091.63     (Declaration of Peter R. Dion-Kindem, ¶
12.)
3.  Costs in Green v.
Shipt, Inc.          $5,649.79       (Declaration of Kyle Nordehaug, ¶
19.)  
4.  Costs in Cho v. Shipt, Inc.             $1,032.29       (Declaration of Steven G. Tidrick, ¶
21.)
5.  Total:                                             $59,748.26
 
Based
upon the foregoing, the Court approves reimbursement of costs of $59,748.26, as
reflected on the settlement administrator’s spreadsheet. 
 
            Plaintiffs’ counsel and the
settlement administrator seek a reserve fund of $200,000.  The Court approves this reserve fund on the
condition that any additional costs must be approved by the Court (which may be
done by way of ex parte application with five days’ notice).  If the funds are not used, they shall be
distributed to the class members without further order of the Court.  
 
            Plaintiffs’ counsel seek service
awards of $12,500 for each named plaintiff. 
The Court agrees that the named plaintiffs are entitled to additional
funds for acting as named plaintiffs. 
However, the Court finds that the requested amounts are too high.  The Court approves service awards of $5,000
for each named plaintiff.   
 
            Plaintiffs’ counsel seek a
contingency fee of one-third of the settlement amount, which is $4,833,333.  The Court notes at the outset that this
settlement resolves not just the instant case, but three other cases, and
Plaintiffs’ attorneys from all four cases have been included as “Settlement Class
Counsel.”  Thus, even though the request
for attorneys’ fees has increased since the prior motion, so too has the size
of the class and the number of attorneys who must be compensated for their
work.  However, as the Court previously
advised Plaintiffs’ counsel, the fee award is based upon a lodestar analysis, not
a simple contingency.  
 
The
determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound
discretion of trial courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.) “The determination of what
constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  (Ibid.) 
“[T]he lodestar is
the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be
adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In setting the
hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the
rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community
for similar work.’”  (Bihun v.
AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997,
overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993)
6 Cal. 4th 644, 664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to
prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center
for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App.
4th 603, 615.)
 
The Court has
broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award
which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a
prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial
evidence.”  (Bernardi v. County of
Monterey (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.)  The Court need not
explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail;
identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura
v. ABM Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)
 
The Court has
reviewed and considered the declarations from the attorneys who handled all
four cases.  Based upon the lodestar
analysis, Plaintiffs’ counsel claim a total of $2,334,775.15 in attorneys’ fees.      
 
A.        Turner v. Shipt, Inc. ($560,675)
 
Shannon
Liss-Riordan seeks a total of $560,675 in attorneys’ fees based upon the
following: (1) Shannon Liss-Riordan for 390 hours at a billing rate of $950 per
hour; (2) Adelaide Pagano for 80 hours at a billing rate of $600 per hour; and
(3) Associates and staff for the remaining hours at billing rates between $225
and $450 per hour.  (Declaration of
Shannon Liss-Riordan, ¶ 37.)  However, these
amounts include estimated future hours on this case.  (Ibid.) 
In general, the Court does not include future estimates in the lodestar
amount.  In this case, however, it is
clear that Ms. Liss-Riordan has assumed the role of lead counsel in finalizing
and effectuating the settlement. 
Therefore, the Court will approve these hours.  
 
B.        Sander v. Shipt, Inc. ($1,415,018.75)
 
Lonnie C.
Blanchard III seeks a total of $667,387.50 in attorneys’ fees based upon having
spent 721.5 hours at a billing rate of $925 per hour.  (Declaration of Lonnie C. Blanchard III, ¶¶
33, 35.)  Peter R. Dion-Kindem seeks a
total of $747,631.25 based upon 808.25 hours at a billing rate of $925 per
hour.  (Declaration of Peter R.
Dion-Kindem, ¶¶ 8-9.)  These amounts do
not include estimates for future work. 
(Declaration of Lonnie C. Blanchard III, ¶ 33; Declaration of Peter R.
Dion-Kindem, ¶ 8.)            
 
C.        Green v. Shipt, Inc. ($272,085.50)
 
Kyle Nordrehaug’s
firm seeks a total of $272,085.50 in attorneys’ fees based upon having spent 331
hours at billing rates between $450 and $995 per hour.  (Declaration of Kyle Nordehaug, ¶ 6.)  This amount does not include estimates for
future work.  (Id., Exhs. 2 &
3.)      
 
D.        Cho v. Shipt, Inc. ($37,488.40)
 
            Plaintiffs’
counsel seek a total of $37,488.40 based upon: (1) Steven G. Tidrick having
spent 18.7 hours at an hourly rate of $973 per hour, and (2) Joel B. Young
having spent 22.1 hours at an hourly rate of $873 per hour.  (See Declaration of Steven G. Tidrick, ¶ 8.)  This does not include estimates for future
work.  (Id., ¶ 8(a) & (b).)   
 
            E.         Additional Counsel ($49,487.50)
 
            Jeffrey
D. Holmes was co-counsel on three of the four cases.  (Declaration of Jeffrey D. Holmes, ¶ 1.)  He seeks a total of $49,487.50 based upon
having spent 53.5 hours at a billing rate of $925 per hour.  (Id., ¶¶ 9-10.)  This does not include estimates for future
work.  (Id., ¶ 11.)  
 
            F.         Total Lodestar ($2,334,755.15)
 
            In
total, Plaintiffs’ counsel seek a total of $2,334,755.15 based upon the
requested hours and billing rates for work performed as of the dates of their
declarations.  In terms of assessing the
reasonableness of the claimed hours and billing rates, the Court has some
concerns.  The partner billing rates of
$925 to $995 are slightly high, even acknowledging the attorneys’ experience
and the expertise required to handle a case of this nature.  The staffing of some cases and the entries on
some billing records suggest some (though not excessive) inefficiencies.  The Court gave some consideration to reducing
the lodestar to account for these issues, but declines to do so.  The billing rates are high but not
excessively so, and the billing records do not reflect excessive inefficiencies.  The Court will address these issues in
determining whether to award a multiplier and, if so, how much to award.    
 
            G.        Multiplier 
 
Once the Court
has determined an appropriate lodestar figure, the Court can determine whether
that figure should be adjusted with a positive or negative multiplier.  (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 997.)  “Whether a multiplier or demultiplier is
appropriate is based on several factors, including (1) the risks presented by
the litigation; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the legal and factual issues
involved; (3) the results obtained on behalf of the plaintiff; and (4) the
skill exhibited by counsel.  (In re Consumer Privacy Cases (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 545, 556.)  “The ‘results
obtained’ factor can properly be used to enhance a lodestar calculation where
[1] an exceptional effort produced [2] an exceptional benefit.”  (Graham
v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2005) 34 Cal.4th 553, 582, numerical alterations
added.)
 
Plaintiffs seek
a total of $4,833,333, of which only $2,334,755.15 is supported by the
lodestar.  That means that Plaintiffs
seek an additional $2,498,577.85, which is equivalent to a multiplier of 1.07.  
 
THE COURT HAS NO TENTATIVE ORDER
ON THE ISSUE WHETHER TO AWARD A MULTIPLIER AND, IF SO, HOW MUCH TO AWARD.
