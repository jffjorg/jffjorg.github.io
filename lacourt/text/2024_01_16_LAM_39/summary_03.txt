And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has not yet made a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to amend the complaint because the motion does not provide sufficient information. The judge is unclear about whether the proposed amendment will result in additional discovery requests. The judge intends to discuss these issues with the parties at the hearing and may rule at the hearing, take the motion under submission, or continue the hearing to allow plaintiff's counsel to provide a discovery plan outlining the additional discovery requested.
