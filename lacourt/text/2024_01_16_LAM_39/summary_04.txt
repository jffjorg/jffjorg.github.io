And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Isla Regan, et al. v. CHA Hollywood Presbyterian, Case No. 22STCV00384. The case involves a medical malpractice action filed by Isla Regan, who is the daughter of the deceased mother, against CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. The hospital has settled the case for $850,000, and the parties are seeking approval of the settlement. The Judge has approved the settlement, finding it to be fair and reasonable under the circumstances.

The Judge has also approved the costs of $28,810.45, which are reasonably related to the litigation. The attorneys' fees of $194,845.09 are also approved, as they are based on a sliding scale and are fair and reasonable under the circumstances.

The Judge has ordered that all proceeds must be used for the benefit of Isla Regan. The Court approves the use of $425,505.13 to purchase a single-premium deferred annuity, which appears to be a sound investment. The Court also approves a distribution of $20,000 to Isla Regan's guardian ad litem and father, Patrick Regan, but orders that these proceeds may only be used for the benefit of Isla Regan.

Finally, the Court notes that there is a Medi-Cal lien of $161,521.36, but Plaintiff's counsel intends to attempt to negotiate a further reduction in this lien. The Court orders that Plaintiff's counsel keep this amount in his attorney-client trust account until the lien is finalized, and counsels that he be prepared to discuss at the hearing how the balance of the funds should be distributed if there is a further reduction in the lien.
