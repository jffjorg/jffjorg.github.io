And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the plaintiff's complaint and has determined that the plaintiff, Kevin Garlington, lacks standing to pursue the action. As a non-lawyer, Garlington cannot maintain a derivative action on behalf of Serenity Inclusive Family Services, LLC, and the complaint does not allege that Garlington was a shareholder of the company during the relevant time period. The court has therefore granted its own motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the case with prejudice. The plaintiff is ordered to serve the order on the court's clerk and no further notice is required.
