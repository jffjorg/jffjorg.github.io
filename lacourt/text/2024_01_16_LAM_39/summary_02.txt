Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motions in limine. The plaintiff is seeking to exclude certain evidence that was produced late, including 12 videos that were not disclosed until September 14, 2023. The judge has granted the motion in part, excluding certain videos because they are not relevant or have little probative value. However, the judge has denied the motion with respect to other videos that are relevant to the issues in the case.

The judge has also ruled on the plaintiff's motion to preclude the defendant from calling Olga Perez Jiminez, one of the defendant's employees, to testify. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff did not establish compliance with the requirements for taking a second deposition of Jiminez.

The judge has also ruled on the admissibility of certain evidence under Penal Code section 632 and Evidence Code section 352. The judge has found that the videos are admissible for impeachment purposes, but not for any other purpose. The judge has also found that the defendant's failure to preserve evidence is not a basis for excluding the videos.

The judge has ordered the parties to file a joint statement listing the exhibits that are covered by the order on or before January 24, 2024. The judge has also set a hearing date of January 16, 2024, to consider the motions in limine.
