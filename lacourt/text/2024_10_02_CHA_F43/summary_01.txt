And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for a protective order filed by Plaintiffs Golden Hammer Ops, LLC and Gregory Rowlee. The Plaintiffs alleged that Defendant ADSB-X misappropriated their trade secrets and sold them to Defendant JETNET. To protect their trade secrets and sensitive information, the Plaintiffs requested that the court amend the parties' stipulated protective order to include additional source code protections.

The court found that there is good cause to adopt the amended protective order, as the parties' source codes are sensitive information and trade secrets that require special care. The proposed amendments include a pre-notification provision, restrictions on the inspection and use of the materials, and restrictions on the storage of printouts.

The court rejected the Defendants' arguments that the proposed amendments are unnecessary, burdensome, and premature. The court also rejected the Defendants' argument that the motion is procedurally improper because Plaintiffs did not give them proper notice of the motion.

The court granted the motion for a protective order and adopts the Plaintiffs' proposed protective order as the new protective order in this case. The parties must give notice of the new protective order.
