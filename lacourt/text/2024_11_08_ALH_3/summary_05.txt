Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendant Alta Los Angeles Hospitals Inc. (Bellflower) in a case brought by plaintiffs Beatriz Moreno and Jose Luis Zermeno, who seek damages and attorneys' fees for the death of their son, Julian Benito Zermeno. The case arises from Julian's death after being struck by an automobile following his transfer from Bellflower hospital to Valley Manor guest home.

Bellflower demurs to the Third Cause of Action (dependent adult abuse) and moves to strike punitive damages and attorneys' fees. The Court finds that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts for a punitive damages claim under Civil Code section 3294 and that the request for attorneys' fees is also inappropriate.

The Court grants Bellflower's motion to strike attorneys' fees and punitive damages without prejudice and sustains Bellflower's demurrer to the Third Cause of Action without prejudice. The Court notes that the parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit.
