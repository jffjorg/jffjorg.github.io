      CASE NO.: 23AHCV01622
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: PLAINTIFF’S APPLICATION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT AGAINST HU
   & ASSOCIATES, LLC, JOHN DEYONG HU, SYLVIA YOUNG, AND UNIVERSO HOLDINGS,
   INC.
 
 
 
 
Dept.

Plaintiff
Zixuan An seeks a default judgment against Sylvia Young, John Deyong Hu, Hu
& Associates, LLC, and Universo Holdings, Inc. (“Universo”). The Court
previously issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff’s application for
default judgment on the grounds that the Complaint was barred by the statute of
limitations. Plaintiff filed a supplemental brief on October 18, 2024, arguing
that the statute of limitations was tolled due to delayed discovery. However, the
issue of whether Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the statute of limitations is
currently before the Court of Appeal because Plaintiff appealed the Court’s ruling
sustaining the demurrer filed by defendants American Franchise Regional Center,
LLC, Americana Hesperia Retirement Funding LLC, and Agnes Sinclair aka Agnes
Yen. Accordingly, the Court lacks jurisdiction to rule on Plaintiff’s
application for default judgment until the matter is remanded. The Court
therefore sets a case management conference for May 8, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in
Department 3 so that the parties may apprise the Court of the appellate
proceedings. 
Dated
this 8th
day of November 2024
