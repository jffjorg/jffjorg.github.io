```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiff's medical battery claim, finding that the issue of informed consent is a triable issue of fact. The Judge also denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiff's intentional misrepresentation and concealment claims, finding that the defendants failed to show that their dental services were fairly priced.

The plaintiff, Ricardo Calvario, had undergone dental treatment in 2018, including the placement of six implant posts, and had claimed that the treatment plan recommended by Dr. Homayun was not appropriate and that the implant posts were inappropriately placed. The defendants had moved for summary adjudication, arguing that Calvario had provided informed consent and that the treatment was appropriate.

The Judge found that the issue of informed consent was a triable issue of fact, citing the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Civil Code. The Judge also found that the defendants had failed to show that their dental services were fairly priced, citing Calvario's testimony that he was given an estimate of $26,000 for the treatment, but ultimately paid $17,000.

The Judge therefore denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the medical battery claim, finding that the issue of informed consent was a triable issue of fact. The Judge also denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the intentional misrepresentation and concealment claims, finding that the defendants had failed to show that their dental services were fairly priced.
