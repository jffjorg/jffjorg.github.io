And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where plaintiff Zixuan An is seeking a default judgment against defendants American Franchise Regional Center, LLC, et al. The court previously denied the application for default judgment because the plaintiff's complaint was barred by the statute of limitations. The plaintiff filed a supplemental brief arguing that the statute of limitations was tolled due to delayed discovery. However, the issue of whether the plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations is currently before the Court of Appeal, and the court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the application for default judgment until the matter is remanded. Therefore, the court sets a case management conference for May 8, 2024, to discuss the appellate proceedings.
