          Plaintiff Ling
Chen seeks a default judgment against Bo Tai Group and Yong Han. The
application is defective because Item 2 of Form CIV-100 is not filled out and
instead refers to Form JUD-100. Form JUD-100, in turn, is not completed either
and instead references an “attachment.” There is no actual figure provided for
the amount of prejudgment interest requested on any of these three documents. Also,
Plaintiff’s request for $21,910 in attorney fees exceeds the amount Plaintiff
would be entitled to under Local Rule 3.214 ($15,643.80). Accordingly, the
hearing is CONTINUED to __________ at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra
Courthouse so that Plaintiff can submit a revised Form CIV-100 and Form JUD-100
which specifies all the amounts sought for her damages, prejudgment interest,
and a revised calculation of attorney fees pursuant to Local Rule 3.214, or an
explanation for why the Court should award an amount greater than that provided
in the default fee schedule. 
Dated
this 8th
day of November, 2024
