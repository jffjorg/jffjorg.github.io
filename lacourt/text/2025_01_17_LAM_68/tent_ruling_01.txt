SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Wendy
Viridinia Solano-Castro, et al. alleges the wrongful death of Raul Garcia-Leon
caused from as a stone fabricator and installer. Plaintiffs contend working
with “toxic” stone products led to the development of silicosis and death of Garcia-Leon
on February 16, 2023.
 
On
May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 582 paragraph complaint for negligence, strict
liability – warning defect, strict liability – design defect, fraudulent
concealment, and breach of implied warranties. On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff a 235
page first amended complaint for negligence, strict liability – warning defect,
strict liability – design defect, fraudulent concealment, and breach of implied
warranties. The action names a multitude of parties comprised of suppliers,
sellers, etc. The case was deemed non-complex on June 5, 2023, and assigned to
Department 68 on June 7, 2023. 
 
On
October 11, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended
complaint brought by MS International, Inc. to the fourth cause of action with
20 days leave to amend. On October 18, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer
to the fourth cause of action brought by M S International, Inc. On November 2,
2023, Caesarstone USA, Inc. filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, declaratory
relief and apportionment. On December 29, 2023, Lowes Home Centers, LLC filed a
cross-complaint indemnity, declaratory relief and apportionment.
 
On
September 5, 2024, the court granted the motion for trial preference based on
the age of Rebecca Garcia at the time of the filing of the motion.
 
RULING: Denied, without
prejudice.
Defendants Arriaga USA, Inc. dba Stoneland USA, Color Marble
Inc., and CSS Distributions Inc. move for a non-destructive site inspection of
the fabrication workshop premises of Cross-Defendant Bernadino Sanchez located
at 1802 1st Street, San Fernando. Defendants represent an initial
agreement to allow for inspection and efforts to agree upon a mutual time, but
the third party subpoena (prior to Sanchez’s appearance in the action as a
cross-defendant) was subsequently disregarded thereby necessitating the subject
motion. Defendants move on grounds that the condition of the premises is
material to defense of the claims within the action. Defendants Jacobe
Enterprises, Inc. and Paragon Industries filed joinders to the motion.
Cross-Defendant Bernadino Sanchez in opposition on grounds of an improper
service, untimely notice, and lack of accommodation to minimizing interference
with operations. Defendants in reply maintain proper service of a third party
deposition subpoena at the time, denies improper service, an entitlement to
conduct the inspection, and denial of any significant disruption. 
 
“If a subpoena
requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents,
electronically stored information, or other things before a court,
or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the
court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b)
... may make an order … directing compliance with it upon those terms or
conditions as the court shall declare...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd.
(a).) A party may demand that any other party
produce and permit the party making the demand, or someone acting on the demanding party's behalf, to inspect
and to photograph, test, or sample any tangible things that are in the
possession, custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.010, subd. (c).)
 
The
subpoena was served to counsel for Sanchez on November 19, 2024, with an
inspection date of December 10, 2024. [Declaration of Rey Yeng, Ex. A.] Counsel
served objections on December 5, 2024. [Id., Ex. C.] Sanchez appeared in the
action via answer on December 10, 2024. 
 
The motion lacks proof of service on Sanchez, and was only
served on counsel prior to any appearance. (Code Civ. Proc., 1985.6, subd.
(b-c).) The motion lacks any indication of an agreement by counsel for Sanchez
to accept service via email, as done by moving counsel. The court therefore
finds invalid service of the subpoena. Moving party otherwise presents no
revised effort to rectify the objections. The court declines to consider any
argument under party discovery statutes in that Defendant fails to establish a
right to establish to propound party discovery on a cross-defendant named by a
co-defendant. (Shepard
& Morgan v. Lee & Daniel, Inc.
(1982) 31 Cal.3d 256, 260-261; Bertero
v. National General Corp. (1974) 13 Cal.3d
43, 51; Pacific Finance Corporation v.
Superior Court of Los Angeles County
(1933) 219 Cal. 179, 182.)  The
court also declines to consider any improperly noticed and supported motion for
evidentiary or issue sanctions. 


The motion is DENIED in its entirety, without prejudice.

Defendant
Southland Stone USA, Inc. (Southland) moves for summary judgment on the entire complaint,
and alternatively, summary adjudication on the entire complaint, and the claim
for punitive damages. Southland moves on multiple grounds, including: Lack of
evidence establishing causation, privity, a duty to disclose, and corporate
knowledge; and a complete defense based on the sophisticated intermediary/user
doctrine. Plaintiffs in opposition challenge the motion on grounds that Southland
fails to shift the burden of proof on ground of insufficient competent evidence,
denial of application of the sophisticated intermediary/user defense, and
challenges any defense to fraudulent concealment or the punitive damages claim.

 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)” (Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App.
4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon
Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.)
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to
provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order
to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the
trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other
inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler
v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
A defendant may alternatively move for summary judgment on
grounds that Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence, and cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence in support
of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855; Collin
v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587; Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101; Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis).
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
The court finds the subject matter analogous to
asbestos litigation on the basis of latent injury caused by a dangerous
product, and therefore applies the substantial factor standard in the subject
action. (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation
Company (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1415, 1419.) “In the context of a cause
of action for asbestos-related latent injuries, the plaintiff must first
establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective asbestos-containing products, and must further establish in reasonable medical probability
that a particular exposure or series of exposures was a “legal cause” of his
injury, i.e., a substantial factor in bringing
about the injury. In an asbestos-related cancer case, the plaintiff need not prove that fibers from the defendant's product were the
ones, or among the ones, that actually began the process of malignant cellular
growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to
defendant's product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing
that in reasonable medical probability it contributed to the plaintiff or decedent's risk of developing cancer.” Rutherford
v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (1997) 16
Cal.4th 953, 982. “[W]e conclude that the proper analysis is to ask whether the
plaintiff has proven exposure to a defendant's product, of whatever duration,
so that exposure is a possible factor in causing the disease and then to
evaluate whether the exposure was a substantial factor.”  (Lineaweaver
v. Plant Insulation Company, supra, 31 Cal.App.4th at p. 1416.)  Exposure by a contributing party, among many,
is sufficient to establish triable issues of material fact.  The calculation of the probabilities of
whether even limited exposure constituted a substantial factor is more
appropriately addressed before the trial court. 
(Id. at pp. 1417-1419.)
 
“In the
context of a cause of action for [silica]-related latent injuries, the
plaintiff must first establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective [] products, and must further
establish in reasonable medical probability that a particular exposure or
series of exposures was a ‘legal cause’ of his injury, i.e., a substantial
factor in bringing about the injury. In a[] [silicosis] case, the
plaintiff need not prove that [particulate]
from the defendant's product were the ones, or among the ones, that actually
began the process of malignant cellular growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet
the burden of proving that exposure to defendant's product was a substantial
factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it
contributed to the plaintiff or decedent's risk of developing
[silicosis].” (Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982.)
 
Southland provides contradictory arguments and evidence regarding
exposure, but its separate statement (which the court will rely on) does not
dispute that Decedent worked with its product while at Bernadino Sanchez. [UMF
No. 1.] However, Southland contends it only distributed natural stone, and thus
there is no causation based on the substantial factor test and sophisticated
users/intermediary doctrine. As to the substantial factor argument, Southland relies
solely on the argument that natural stone does not contain the same elevated
levels of crystalline silica or hazardous materials as artificial stone,
therefore any potential exposure would not meet the substantial factor
threshold required to prove causation. In support of this contention, Southland
only cites to the allegations in the FAC in paragraphs 136 and 263. While the
allegations indirectly state that natural stone has less crystalline silica
content that artificial stone, it does not make any statement that completely
negates causation for purposes of summary judgment. Southland otherwise fails
to provide any other evidence or lack of evidence by Plaintiffs, and thus fails
to shift the burden. The court alternatively finds triable issues of material
fact that exposure to said silica containing stone products caused exposure and
led to the silicosis diagnosis and death. [Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman.]
Further, the court notes that there is testimony from Decedent’s co-worker
Cesar Quiroz identifying both natural and artificial Southland products at the
Decedent’s workplace, which undermines Southland’s argument and creates triable
issues as to the type of stone product supplied and exposure to the extent
Southland contends there was none. [Declaration of Brian P. Barrow: Depositions
of Cesar Quiroz, 66:23-67:12, 339:8-15, 929:9-23, 931:7-8.]
 
As to Southland’s lack of privity argument regarding the
breach of implied warranty claim, a worker who is injured in the course of his
work by a defective product purchased by his hirer is in privity with both the
manufacturer and the supplier of the product. (Peterson v. Lamb Lumber Co.
(1960) 54 Cal.2d 339, 347-348.) Southland fails to sufficiently address the
legal standard.
 
The motion for summary judgment and motion for
summary adjudication reliant on the absence of sufficient exposure, causation,
and privity is therefore DENIED. (McGonnell v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., Inc. (2002)
98 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1103-1104; Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const. Co. (1999)
69 Cal.App.4th 64, 81.)  
 
Southland also challenges the action under
sophisticated/intermediate user doctrines. The court reviews the standard. “In
general, a manufacturer or supplier has a duty to warn consumers about the
dangers and risks inherent in the use of its product. (Citations.) The
sophisticated user defense is an exception to the general duty to warn. (Citation.)
The defense concerns warnings and does not apply to a cause of action for
design defect. (Citation.) ... [¶] Under the sophisticated user defense,
a manufacturer is not liable to a sophisticated user of its product for failure
to warn about the product's dangers if the sophisticated user knew or should
have known of the dangers. (Citation.) The ‘should have known’ portion
of the formulation is an objective standard. (Citation.) ... The
rationale supporting the defense is that the failure to warn about risks
already known to a sophisticated user usually is not a proximate cause of the
user's injuries. (Citation.)” (Collin v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 601–602.)
 
The “obvious danger” standard within the sophisticated user
defense: “The obvious danger rule is an objective test, and the courts do
not inquire into the user's subjective knowledge in such a case. In other
words, even if a user was truly unaware of a product's hazards, that fact is
irrelevant if the danger was objectively obvious. ...  Thus, under the sophisticated user defense,
the inquiry focuses on whether the plaintiff knew, or should have known, of the
particular risk of harm from the product giving rise to the injury.” (Johnson
v. American Standard, Inc. (2008) 43 Cal.4th 56, 71.) 
 
While the danger of silica dust finds medical support (See
Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman), Southland relies on Decedent’s “experience”
as a fabricator to comprehend the medical dangers of silica dust caused by the
cutting of artificial stone. The argument provides no evidentiary support
establishing the obvious nature of such an injury. The court declines to find
as a matter of law that such a danger exists for purposes of ruling on the
motion. The court therefore finds Southland, again, fails to shift the burden. (See
McGonnell v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., Inc., supra, 98 Cal.App.4th at
pp. 1103-1104; Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const. Co., supra, 69
Cal.App.4th at p. 81.)
 
As to the sophisticated intermediary defense, Southland
relies on an apparent denial of any necessity to warn based on OSHA/Cal OSHA
regulations regarding employer responsibility to provide safety equipment, due
to an admittedly known hazard of silica particulate matter from stone
fabrication. Other than an admission to the hazards of silica dust, the motion
lacks legal support actually addressing the standard for warning or evidence of
the sufficiency of its warning, and instead offers deflection. The court finds
no legal or evidentiary support based on reliance and deflection under uncited
OSHA and Cal OSHA standards with insufficient legal address. (Webb v.
Special Electric Co., Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th 167, 187-188.) Plaintiff additionally
points out that Southland characterizes Decedent as an independent contractor,
not an employee for purposes of the uncited OSHA/Cal OSHA regulations. Further,
the sophisticated intermediary defense requires the producer to provide
adequate warnings to the intermediary, and then allows the producer to rely on
the intermediary to pass along those warnings. (Id. at 185-186.)
It is the producer’s burden to show it warned the intermediary. (Ibid.) Southland
provides no evidence it adequately warned a sophisticated intermediary thus
this argument fails. To the extent Southland relies on its arguments regarding
lack of exposure and the known hazards of natural stone, the court incorporates
its previous analysis. 
 
The court therefore DENIES the motion for summary judgment
and summary adjudication on the failure to establish insufficient evidence or a
complete defense on this basis. 
 
On fraudulent concealment, Southland
additionally challenges the lack of any basis of duty to disclose any
specific potential harms from the failure to warn. Southland relies exclusively
on the lack of any duty to disclose due to the absence of any fiduciary duty.
“[T]he elements of a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are: ‘(1)
the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the
defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff,
(3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with
the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware
of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed
or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of
the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage. [Citation.]’” (Kaldenbach
v. Mutual of Omaha Life Ins. Co. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850 (internal
quotation marks omitted.) 
 
“There are ‘four
circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts. [Citation.]’” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) “Each of the other three circumstances in which
nondisclosure may be actionable presupposes the existence of some other
relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose
can arise. … As a matter of common sense, such a relationship can only come
into being as a result of some sort of transaction between the parties.” (Id. at pp. 336–337.) 
 
“The
requirement's purpose is to inform consumers about a product's hazards and
faults of which they are unaware, so that they can refrain from using the
product altogether or evade the danger by careful use.” (Jones v.
ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198.) Users include
persons responsible for processing materials not privy to information regarding
necessary safety protocols. The withholding of said information subjects a
defendant to potential fraudulent concealment liability. (Id. at pp.
1199-1200.)
 
The operative complaint presents allegations
regarding knowledge of the allegedly toxic substance, crystalline silica,
dangers to workers engaged in the cutting, grinding, fabrication, polishing,
etc. with the product, and failure to disclose potential toxicity upon working
with said products. Decedent was specifically exposed and harmed as a result of
the non-disclosed hazards and continued work with the supplied product. The
allegations meet the standard for fraudulent concealment. (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78-79.)
 
Under the consideration for product liability summary judgment,
the court finds insufficient address of this standard by Southland for purposes
of shifting the burden. Southland’s citation to Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017)
7 Cal.App.5th 276 is misplaced as it is not a toxic tort case and hence
does not grapple with the unique public policies at play in such cases. Jones
v. ConocoPhillips Co., supra, a toxic tort case involving parties
with a similar relationship to the parties at present, is controlling. (See
Jones, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at 1198-2000; LiMandri, supra, 52
Cal.App.4th at 336; Hoffman
v. 162 North Wolfe LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1192.) The court therefore denies the motion for summary adjudication
on both the failure to shift the burden, and triable issues of material fact
regarding failure to warn on allegedly known hazards caused by fabrication of
products containing silica. [Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman; Declaration of
Brian P. Barrow, Exhs. 1 & 5.]
 
On punitive damages, Southland offers a conclusive challenge
regarding the lack of evidence to support the claim for punitive damages. On
punitive damages, Civil
Code section 3294, subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing
of malice, oppression, or fraud, which are defined as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
“‘[M]alice does not require actual
intent to harm. [Citation.] Conscious disregard for the safety of another may
be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such
consequences. [Citation.] Malice may be proved either expressly through direct
evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws
inferences.’ [Citations.]”  (Pfeifer
v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.) 
 
Consistent with the prior part of the order, the
court again finds Southland fails to shift the burden. Southland presents
insufficient evidence in support of its contentions, generally points to an
absence of evidence without any address, and relies on its previous arguments
which fail as discussed above. The court additionally finds there are triable
issues of material fact on the basis of knowledge, ratification, and malice. [Declaration
of Brian P. Barrow, Exhs. 1 & 5.] (White v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999)
21 Cal.4th 563, 576–577; Cruz
v. HomeBase (2000)
83 Cal.App.4th 160, 168.) The motion for summary adjudication is therefore
denied in its entirety. 
 
In summary, the court denies the motion for summary judgment
and summary adjudication.

SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Wendy
Viridinia Solano-Castro, et al. alleges the wrongful death of Raul Garcia-Leon
caused from working as a stone fabricator and installer. Plaintiffs contend
working with “toxic” stone products led to the development of silicosis and death
of Garcia-Leon on February 16, 2023.
 
On
May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 582 paragraph complaint for negligence, strict
liability – warning defect, strict liability – design defect, fraudulent
concealment, and breach of implied warranties. On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff a 235
page first amended complaint for negligence, strict liability – warning defect,
strict liability – design defect, fraudulent concealment, and breach of implied
warranties. The action names a multitude of parties comprised of suppliers,
sellers, etc. The case was deemed non-complex on June 5, 2023, and assigned to
Department 68 on June 7, 2023. 
 
On
October 11, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended
complaint brought by MS International, Inc. to the fourth cause of action with
20 days leave to amend. On October 18, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer
to the fourth cause of action brought by M S International, Inc. On November 2,
2023, Caesarstone USA, Inc. filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, declaratory
relief and apportionment. On December 29, 2023, Lowes Home Centers, LLC filed a
cross-complaint indemnity, declaratory relief and apportionment.
 
On
September 5, 2024, the court granted the motion for trial preference based on
the age of Rebecca Garcia at the time of the filing of the motion.
 
RULING: Denied.
No
evidentiary objections on file.
 
Defendant
Francini Inc. (Francini) moves for summary adjudication on the fourth cause of
action for fraudulent concealment, and the claim for punitive damages. Francini
moves on grounds that Plaintiffs cannot establish reliance and Plaintiffs have
no evidence of fraudulent concealment or officers, directors, or managing
agents acting with malice, fraud or oppression, based on devoid discovery
responses. Plaintiffs in opposition challenge the motion on grounds that Francini
fails to shift the burden of proof, due to the lack of sufficient competent
evidence and a failure to establish Plaintiff lacks sufficient evidence to
prevail, and triable issues of fact based on additional evidence of corporate
knowledge. 
 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)”  (Scolinos
v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
A defendant may alternatively move for summary judgment on
grounds that Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence, and cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence in support
of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855; Collin
v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587; Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 229, 234]
855Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis).
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
On the claim for fraudulent concealment,
Francini challenges the lack of any basis of intent to deceive or reliance by
Decedent. Francini argues that there is no evidence of intentional conduct by
it, or that Decedent ever read or relied on any of its written materials
whether they appeared on a slab, a label, a material safety data sheet, an advertisement,
its website, or anywhere else. 
 
In opposition,
Plaintiffs correctly point out that there is no reliance element for fraudulent
concealment as discussed below. Thus, this argument fails as a matter of law. 
 
“[T]he elements of
a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are: ‘(1) the defendant must
have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been
under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have
intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the
plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not
have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and
(5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff
must have sustained damage. [Citation.]’” (Kaldenbach v. Mutual of Omaha
Life Ins. Co. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850 (internal quotation marks
omitted.) 
 
“There are ‘four circumstances in
which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when
the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the
defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff;
(3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff;
and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses
some material facts. [Citation.]’” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) “Each of the other
three circumstances in which nondisclosure may be actionable presupposes the
existence of some other relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in
which a duty to disclose can arise. … As a matter of common sense, such a
relationship can only come into being as a result of some sort of transaction
between the parties.” (Id. at pp.
336–337.) 
 
The court
notes the standard for certain types of product potentially applicable, and
considered in a demurrer on the subject cause of action brought by a different
co-defendant. “The requirement's purpose is to inform consumers about a
product's hazards and faults of which they are unaware, so that they can refrain
from using the product altogether or evade the danger by careful use.” (Jones
v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198.) Users include
persons responsible for processing materials not privy to information regarding
necessary safety protocols. The withholding of said information subjects a
defendant to potential fraudulent concealment liability. (Id. at pp.
1199-1200.)
 
Paragraphs 541
through 547 of the operative complaint present allegations regarding knowledge
of the allegedly toxic substance, crystalline silica, dangers to workers
engaged in the cutting, grinding, fabrication, polishing, etc. with the
product, and failure to disclose potential toxicity upon working with said
products. Decedent was specifically exposed and harmed as a result of the
non-disclosed hazards and continued work with the supplied product. [First
Amend. Comp., ¶¶ 535-564.] The allegations meet the standard for fraudulent
concealment. (Bockrath
v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78-79.)
 
Under
the consideration for product liability summary judgment, the court finds
insufficient address of this standard by Francini for purposes of shifting the
burden. Francini’s citation to Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7
Cal.App.5th 276 is misplaced as it is not a toxic tort case and hence
does not grapple with the unique public policies at play in such cases. Jones
v. ConocoPhillips Co., supra, a toxic tort case involving parties
with a similar relationship to the parties at present, is controlling. (See
Jones, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at 1198-2000; LiMandri, supra, 52
Cal.App.4th at 336; Hoffman v. 162
North Wolfe LLC (2014) 228
Cal.App.4th 1178, 1192.) Further, the court
finds the evidence (or lack of evidence) presented by Francini to be
insufficient as well. Plaintiffs point out in their opposition that they provided
detailed information in their responses to discovery, including a number of
witnesses with corporate knowledge, but while Francini acknowledges this
information was provided, it fails to explain how the responses including the
witnesses identified are devoid. [Appendix of Evidence: Responses to Special
Interrogatories.] There is also no evidence or address relating to any other
discovery responses such as requests for production of documents. The court
therefore denies the motion for summary adjudication on the failure to shift
the burden. The court further finds triable issues of material fact regarding
failure to warn on allegedly known hazards caused by fabrication of products
containing silica. [Ibid.; Declaration of Brian P. Barrow, Exhs. 1-3.]
 
On
punitive damages, Francini challenges the sufficiency against the corporate
entity. Francini generally states that Plaintiffs have no evidence to support
this claim and relies on the same arguments made for the fraud cause of action
relating to devoid discovery responses.
 
On punitive damages, Civil Code section 3294,
subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing of malice,
oppression, or fraud, which are defined
as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means conduct which is intended
by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which
is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression” means despicable conduct
that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of
that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an intentional
misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the
defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving
a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
“‘[M]alice does not require actual intent to harm.
[Citation.] Conscious disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient
where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or
her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such consequences.
[Citation.] Malice may be proved either expressly through direct evidence or by
implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws inferences.’
[Citations.]”  (Pfeifer v. John Crane,
Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.) 
 
Consistent with the prior part of the order, the court again finds that Francini
presents insufficient evidence in support of its contentions, does not sufficiently
address the discovery responses provided including witnesses identified as
having corporate knowledge, and relies on its arguments regarding the fraud
cause of action which fail as discussed above. The court additionally finds
there are triable issues of material fact on the basis of knowledge,
ratification, and malice. [Appendix
of Evidence: Responses to Special Interrogatories; Declaration of Brian P. Barrow,
Exhs. 1-3.] (White v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 576–577; Cruz
v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 168.) The motion for summary adjudication is therefore
denied in its entirety. 
 
In summary, the
court denies the motion for summary adjudication.

SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Wendy
Viridinia Solano-Castro, et al. alleges the wrongful death of Raul Garcia-Leon
caused from as a stone fabricator and installer. Plaintiffs contend working
with “toxic” stone products led to the development of silicosis and death of
Garcia-Leon on February 16, 2023.
 
On
May 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a 582 paragraph complaint for negligence, strict
liability – warning defect, strict liability – design defect, fraudulent
concealment, and breach of implied warranties. On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff a 235
page first amended complaint for negligence, strict liability – warning defect,
strict liability – design defect, fraudulent concealment, and breach of implied
warranties. The action names a multitude of parties comprised of suppliers,
sellers, etc. The case was deemed non-complex on June 5, 2023, and assigned to
Department 68 on June 7, 2023. 
 
On
October 11, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the first amended
complaint brought by MS International, Inc. to the fourth cause of action with
20 days leave to amend. On October 18, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer
to the fourth cause of action brought by M S International, Inc. On November 2,
2023, Caesarstone USA, Inc. filed a cross-complaint for indemnity, declaratory
relief and apportionment. On December 29, 2023, Lowes Home Centers, LLC filed a
cross-complaint indemnity, declaratory relief and apportionment.
 
On
September 5, 2024, the court granted the motion for trial preference based on
the age of Rebecca Garcia at the time of the filing of the motion.
 
RULING: Denied.
Evidentiary
Objections to the Declaration of Barbara Hannah: Overruled. The court also
notes that only EIDP’s response to the objections appear to be on file, but not
the original objections.
 
Evidentiary
Objections to the Declaration of Simonetta Marshall: Overruled.
Evidentiary
Objections to Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman: Overruled. 
Evidentiary Objections to Declaration of Raphael Metzger: Overruled. (CCP § 437c(q).)
 
EIDP,
Inc. (EIDP) moves for summary judgment on the entire complaint, and
alternatively, summary adjudication on the entire complaint, and the claim for
punitive damages. EIDP moves on multiple grounds, including: Lack of evidence
establishing exposure, causation, privity, duty to warn, and corporate
knowledge; and a complete defense under sophisticated intermediary/user
doctrine. Plaintiffs in opposition challenge the motion on grounds that EIDP
fails to shift the burden of proof on ground of insufficient competent
evidence, denial of application of the sophisticated intermediary/user defense,
and challenges any defense to fraudulent concealment or the punitive damages
claim. 
 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)” (Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App.
4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon
Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.)
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to
provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order
to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the
trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other
inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  
 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant
moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing that a cause
of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements of the
cause of action . . . cannot be established.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) “Once the defendant . . . has
met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
A defendant may alternatively move for summary judgment on
grounds that Plaintiff lacks
sufficient evidence, and cannot reasonably obtain necessary evidence in support
of the claims.¿(Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th at pp. 854-855; Collin
v. CalPortland Co. (2014)
228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587; Andrews v. Foster Wheeler LLC (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 96, 101; Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.) The
court adheres to this standard for product liability cases, such as asbestos
and crystalline silica (e.g. latent exposure leading to mesothelioma or
silicosis).
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inference that may be drawn form that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An
issue of fact can only be created by a conflict in the evidence.  It is not created by speculation, conjecture,
imagination or guesswork.”  (Lyons v. Security Pacific National Bank
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 (citation omitted).)
 
The court finds the subject matter analogous to
asbestos litigation on the basis of latent injury caused by a dangerous
product, and therefore applies the substantial factor standard in the subject
action. (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation
Company (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1415, 1419.) “In the context of a cause
of action for asbestos-related latent injuries, the plaintiff must first
establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective asbestos-containing products, and must further establish in reasonable medical probability
that a particular exposure or series of exposures was a “legal cause” of his
injury, i.e., a substantial factor in bringing
about the injury. In an asbestos-related cancer case, the plaintiff need not prove that fibers from the defendant's product were the
ones, or among the ones, that actually began the process of malignant cellular
growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to
defendant's product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing
that in reasonable medical probability it contributed to the plaintiff or
decedent's risk of developing
cancer.” Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982. “[W]e conclude that the proper
analysis is to ask whether the plaintiff has proven exposure to a defendant's
product, of whatever duration, so that exposure is a possible factor in causing
the disease and then to evaluate whether the exposure was a substantial
factor.”  (Lineaweaver v. Plant Insulation Company, supra, 31
Cal.App.4th at p. 1416.)  Exposure by a
contributing party, among many, is sufficient to establish triable issues of
material fact.  The calculation of the
probabilities of whether even limited exposure constituted a substantial factor
is more appropriately addressed before the trial court.  (Id.
at pp. 1417-1419.)
 
“In the
context of a cause of action for [silica]-related latent injuries, the
plaintiff must first establish some threshold exposure to the
defendant's defective [] products, and must further
establish in reasonable medical probability that a particular exposure or
series of exposures was a ‘legal cause’ of his injury, i.e., a substantial
factor in bringing about the injury. In a[] [silicosis] case, the
plaintiff need not prove that [particulate]
from the defendant's product were the ones, or among the ones, that actually
began the process of malignant cellular growth. Instead, the plaintiff may meet
the burden of proving that exposure to defendant's product was a substantial
factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it
contributed to the plaintiff or decedent's risk of developing
[silicosis].” (Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois,
Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 982.)
 
EIDP relies on denial of any supply, manufacture or
distribution of silica containing products utilized by Decedent, while employed
as a fabricator. The position relies on a challenge to Plaintiffs’ evidence, as
well as the declaration of Barbara Hannah. Hannah provides that only
“certified” employers are authorized by EIDP to purchase or receive Corian or
Zodiac, and GTO Stone, Bernardino Sanchez, and San Remo Marble & Granite were
not certified. [Declaration of Barbara Hannah, ¶¶3-4.]
 
Other than citation to discovery responses (without
address in the moving papers) regarding the basis of the complaint, including
the performance of stone fabrication work without sufficient protective
equipment, the court finds no substantive basis for the challenge to the
insufficiency of evidence by Plaintiffs regarding the placement of EIDP
manufactured and/or distributed silica containing artificial stone products on
the premises of any and all of Decedent’s employers during the relevant
exposure period. [See Declaration of Deanne L. Miller, Appendix of Evidence:
Responses to Special Interrogatories and Request for Production.] Plaintiffs
present pages and pages of factually detailed discovery regarding the claim for
exposure. Likewise, the deposition testimony EIDP relies on of Decedent’s
co-workers and Sanchez are insufficient alone to negate any element.
Admittedly, co-worker Caesar Quiroz does recall working with Zodiaq for at
least a portion of his time at Bernadino Sanchez’s shop. [Declaration of Deanne
L. Miller: Deposition of Cesar Quiroz.] The conclusive arguments and reliance
on denial of sufficient evidence fails to shift the burden. (McGonnell v. Kaiser Gypsum Co., Inc. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1103-1104; Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const. Co. (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 64, 81.)  
 
While
EIDP also presents evidence that Decedent’s places of work were not “certified”
to purchase or receive its product (Zodiac or Corian), this is insufficient to
shift the burden when it also presented evidence that co-worker Caesar Quiroz
recalls working with Zodiaq for at least a portion of his time at Bernadino
Sanchez’s shop as referenced above. 
 
The court alternatively finds triable issues of material
fact based on the presence of silica containing EIDP products on the premises
of Decedent’s place of work during the relevant time period. Both EIDP and
Plaintiffs present testimony identifying EIDP products for Bernadino’s shop,
and Plaintiffs present invoices and records of sale of EIDP products to
Bernadino’s shop. [Declaration of Brian P. Barrow: Deposition of Cesar Quiroz, 419-421;
Declaration of Simonetta Marhsall, Exh. A.] There is also evidence the exposure
to said silica containing stone products caused exposure and led to the
silicosis diagnosis and death. [Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman.]
 
As to EIDP’s lack of privity argument regarding the breach
of implied warranty claim, a worker who is injured in the course of his work by
a defective product purchased by his hirer is in privity with both the
manufacturer and the supplier of the product. (Peterson v. Lamb Lumber Co.
(1960) 54 Cal.2d 339, 347-348.) EIDP fails to sufficiently address the legal
standard or provide any evidentiary support for its conclusory statement that
the product is also not defective.
 
Therefore, the motion for summary judgment and summary
adjudication reliant on the absence of sufficient exposure, causation, and
privity is therefore DENIED. 
 
EIDP also challenges the action under sophisticated/intermediate
user doctrines. The court reviews the standard. “In
general, a manufacturer or supplier has a duty to warn consumers about the
dangers and risks inherent in the use of its product. (Citations.)
The sophisticated user defense is
an exception to the general duty to warn. (Citation.) The defense
concerns warnings and does not apply to a cause of action for design defect. (Citation.) ...
[¶] Under the sophisticated user defense, a manufacturer is not liable to a
sophisticated user of its product for failure to warn about the product's
dangers if the sophisticated user knew or should have known of the dangers. (Citation.)
The ‘should have known’ portion of the formulation is an objective standard. (Citation.) ...
The rationale supporting the defense is that the failure to warn about risks
already known to a sophisticated user usually is not a proximate cause of the
user's injuries. (Citation.)” (Collin v. CalPortland Co. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 601–602.)
 
The “obvious danger” standard within the sophisticated user
defense: “The obvious danger rule is an objective test, and the
courts do not inquire into the user's subjective knowledge in such a case. In
other words, even if a user was truly unaware of a product's hazards, that fact
is irrelevant if the danger was objectively obvious. ...  Thus, under the sophisticated user defense,
the inquiry focuses on whether the plaintiff knew, or should have known, of the
particular risk of harm from the product giving rise to the injury.” (Johnson v. American Standard, Inc. (2008) 43 Cal.4th 56, 71.) 
 
While the danger of silica dust
finds medical support (See Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman), EIDP relies on
Decedent’s “experience” as a fabricator to comprehend the medical dangers of
silica dust caused by the cutting of artificial stone. The argument provides no
evidentiary support establishing the obvious nature of such an injury. The
court declines to find as a matter of law that such a danger exists for
purposes of ruling on the motion. The court therefore finds EIDP, again, fails
to shift the burden. (See McGonnell v. Kaiser Gypsum Co.,
Inc., supra, 98 Cal.App.4th at pp.
1103-1104; Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const.
Co., supra, 69 Cal.App.4th at p. 81.)
 
As to the sophisticated intermediary defense, EIDP relies on
an apparent denial of any necessity to warn based on OSHA/Cal OSHA regulations
regarding employer responsibility to provide safety equipment, due to an
admittedly known hazard of silica particulate matter from stone fabrication.
Other than an admission to the hazards of silica dust, the motion lacks legal
support actually addressing the standard for warning or evidence of the
sufficiency of its warning, and instead offers deflection. The court finds no
legal or evidentiary support based on reliance and deflection under OSHA and
Cal OSHA standards with insufficient legal address. (Webb v. Special
Electric Co., Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th 167, 187-188.) Further, the
sophisticated intermediary defense requires the producer to provide adequate
warnings to the intermediary, and then allows the producer to rely on the
intermediary to pass along those warnings. (Id. at 185-186.) It
is the producer’s burden to show it warned the intermediary. (Ibid.) EIDP
provide no evidence it adequately warned a sophisticated intermediary thus this
argument fails.   
 
The court therefore DENIES the motion for summary judgment and
summary adjudication on the failure to establish insufficient evidence or a
complete defense on this basis. Plaintiff additionally establishes triable
issues of material fact on the known hazards of silica particulate matter
resulting from fabrication, the warning to Decedent’s alleged employer,
Decedent’s alleged employers’ sophistication, and the employment relationship.
[Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman; Declaration of Brian
P. Barrow: Deposition of Bernardino Sanchez, 50:3-16, 145:9-22, 159:8-16, 159:
25-160:10.]
 
On the fraudulent concealment
cause of action, EIDP additionally challenges the lack of any basis of
duty to disclose any specific potential harms from the failure to warn. EIDP
relies on the lack of any duty to disclose due to the absence of any fiduciary
duty, a lack of causation evidence that Decedent would have acted differently,
and Decedent ever spoke with anyone from EIDP. “[T]he elements of a cause of
action for fraud based on concealment are: ‘(1) the defendant must have
concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under
a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have
intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the
plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not
have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and
(5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff
must have sustained damage. [Citation.]’” (Kaldenbach v. Mutual of Omaha Life
Ins. Co. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 830, 850 (internal quotation marks
omitted.) 
 
“There are ‘four
circumstances in which nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts. [Citation.]’” (LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 336.) “Each of the other three circumstances in which
nondisclosure may be actionable presupposes the existence of some other
relationship between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose
can arise. … As a matter of common sense, such a relationship can only come
into being as a result of some sort of transaction between the parties.” (Id. at pp. 336–337.) 
 
“The
requirement's purpose is to inform consumers about a product's hazards and
faults of which they are unaware, so that they can refrain from using the
product altogether or evade the danger by careful use.” (Jones v.
ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1198.) Users include
persons responsible for processing materials not privy to information regarding
necessary safety protocols. The withholding of said information subjects a
defendant to potential fraudulent concealment liability. (Id. at pp.
1199-1200.)
 
The operative complaint presents allegations
regarding knowledge of the allegedly toxic substance, crystalline silica,
dangers to workers engaged in the cutting, grinding, fabrication, polishing,
etc. with the product, and failure to disclose potential toxicity upon working
with said products. Decedent was specifically exposed and harmed as a result of
the non-disclosed hazards and continued work with the supplied product. The
allegations meet the standard for fraudulent concealment. (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78-79.)
 
Under the consideration for product liability summary judgment,
the court finds insufficient address of this standard by EIDP for purposes of
shifting the burden, and a general lack of argument other than conclusory contentions.
EIDP’s citation to Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th
276 is misplaced as it is not a toxic tort case and hence does not
grapple with the unique public policies at play in such cases. Jones v.
ConocoPhillips Co., supra, a toxic tort case involving parties with
a similar relationship to the parties at present, is controlling. (See Jones,
supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at 1198-2000; LiMandri, supra, 52
Cal.App.4th at 336; Hoffman
v. 162 North Wolfe LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 1178, 1192.)  The court therefore denies the motion for summary
adjudication on both the failure to shift the burden, and triable issues of
material fact regarding failure to warn on allegedly known hazards caused by fabrication
of products containing silica. [Declaration of Kenneth Rosenman; Declaration of
Brian P. Barrow: Deposition of Barbara Hannah; EIDP Appendix of Evidence: Exh.
M.]
 
As to punitive damages, EIDP offers a conclusive challenge
regarding the lack of evidence to support the claim. On punitive damages, Civil Code section
3294, subdivision (c) authorizes punitive damages upon a showing of malice,
oppression, or fraud, which are defined
as follows:
 
(1) “Malice” means
conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.
(2) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.
(3) “Fraud” means an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.
 
“‘[M]alice does not require actual
intent to harm. [Citation.] Conscious disregard for the safety of another may
be sufficient where the defendant is aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his or her conduct and he or she willfully fails to avoid such
consequences. [Citation.] Malice may be proved either expressly through direct
evidence or by implication through indirect evidence from which the jury draws
inferences.’ [Citations.]”  (Pfeifer
v. John Crane, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.) 
 
Consistent with the prior part of the order, the
court again finds the motion insufficiently addresses the evidence presented by
Plaintiff regarding the knowing distribution of the silica containing product,
including corporate knowledge and direction for the manufacture and
distribution of an allegedly harmful product. [See Declaration of
Deanne L. Miller, Appendix of Evidence: Responses to Special Interrogatories
and Request for Production.] (White v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563,
576–577; Cruz
v. HomeBase (2000)
83 Cal.App.4th 160, 168.) Such conduct establishes the right to seek punitive
damages under the malice standard. Further, the court again finds that The motion for
summary adjudication is therefore denied in its entirety. 
 
Consistent with the prior part of the order, the
court again finds the motion insufficiently addresses the evidence presented by
Plaintiffs regarding the knowing distribution of the silica containing product,
including corporate knowledge and direction for the manufacture and
distribution of an allegedly harmful product. [See Declaration of
Deanne L. Miller, Appendix of Evidence: Responses to Special Interrogatories
and Request for Production.] EIDP presents insufficient
evidence in support of its contentions, generally points to an absence of
evidence without much address, and relies on its previous arguments which fail
as discussed above. The court additionally finds there are triable issues of
material fact on the basis of knowledge, ratification, and malice. [Declaration
of Brian P. Barrow: Deposition of Barbara Hannah; EIDP Appendix of Evidence:
Exh. M.] (White
v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563, 576–577; Cruz v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th
160, 168.) The
motion for summary adjudication is therefore denied in its entirety. 
 
In summary, the court denies the motion for summary judgment
and summary adjudication.
 
EIDP to give notice to all parties.
