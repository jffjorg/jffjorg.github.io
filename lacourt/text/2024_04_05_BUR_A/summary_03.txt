Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to deem matters in the plaintiff's Request for Admissions (RFA) admitted. The plaintiff, Erik Sords, seeks to deem the RFA matters admitted due to the defendant's failure to respond. The defendant, LA Sun Partners, Inc., has failed to respond to the RFA despite repeated requests. The Judge notes that the defendant's failure to respond may be due to a lack of notice, as the defendant's new counsel was not aware of the outstanding discovery issues. The Judge is concerned about the adequacy of service on the defendant and orders the parties to meet and confer regarding discovery issues. The motion to deem RFA matters admitted is continued to May 17, 2024, at 9:00 AM.
