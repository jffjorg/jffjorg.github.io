Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the City of Los Angeles's motion to challenge the good faith of a settlement between Pacific Bell Telephone Company dba AT&T (PacBell) and Plaintiff Cathy Feindel. The settlement is for $20,000 and was reached in a personal injury action arising from Plaintiff's fall on a sidewalk. The City argues that the settlement does not meet the criteria for determining good faith under California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) ยง 877.6 and Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985).

The court finds that PacBell has shown substantial evidence supporting its application, including evidence that the City received and responded to sidewalk repair requests and performed a small asphalt repair prior to the incident. However, the court notes that the City has shown that insufficient evidence is before the Court to determine Plaintiff's damages, and as such, the court is unable to determine if a $20,000 settlement by a partial tortfeasor is appropriate.

The court grants the City's motion to challenge the good faith of the settlement and denies PacBell's application for determination of good faith settlement without prejudice.
