And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Janis Hoffman (Plaintiff) and The Regents of the University of California (Defendant). The case involves allegations of medical malpractice and fraud related to the transport of two minors when they were five days old. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant is liable for the harm caused to the minors and for her own injury. The Defendant has filed a demurrer, arguing that the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations, and a motion to strike, arguing that certain portions of the Plaintiff's complaint are irrelevant or improper.

The Court has ruled that the Plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations and that the Defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The Court has also denied the Defendant's motion to strike as moot.

The Court's ruling is based on its analysis of the Plaintiff's complaint and the applicable laws and case citations. The Court has rejected the Plaintiff's arguments that her claims are not barred by the statute of limitations and that she has a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. The Court has also rejected the Plaintiff's allegations of fraud, finding that they are not adequately pled and do not meet the required standards for a fraud claim.
