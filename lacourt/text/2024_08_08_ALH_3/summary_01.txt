And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to set aside default and vacate the entry of default filed by Allied Pacific IPA (Defendant) against Taichandra Fyeldees (Plaintiff). The Defendant claims that it did not provide the complaint to its counsel until after the Plaintiff requested the entry of default due to "inadvertence and excusable neglect". The Court has reviewed the motion and determined that the Defendant's declaration lacks personal knowledge and is based on inadmissible hearsay. Therefore, the Defendant fails to show by a preponderance of the evidence that there was any inadvertence or excusable mistake that would justify setting aside the default. The motion is denied without prejudice.
