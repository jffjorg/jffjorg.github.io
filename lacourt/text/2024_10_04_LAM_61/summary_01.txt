And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied ICAA LLC's motion for relief from default. ICAA LLC argues that the service of process was improper and that it was the victim of excusable neglect. However, the judge finds that ICAA LLC's evidence in support of relief is thin and that the declaration of Ibrahim Aboud, the defendant's agent for service, is contradicted by the declaration of Scott Braybrooke, the plaintiff's counsel. The judge concludes that ICAA LLC had timely knowledge of the lawsuit and the means to contact its insurer, but failed to do so for reasons that it does not explain. The judge also finds that ICAA LLC's argument that it should not be held accountable for its insurer's delay in responding to the plaintiff's email is inapposite to the present case, as the evidence suggests that ICAA LLC itself neglected the complaint.
