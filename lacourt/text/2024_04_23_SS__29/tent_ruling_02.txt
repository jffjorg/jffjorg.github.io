Background 
 
Two consolidated cases arise out of a
multi-vehicle automobile accident on July 6, 2019, near the Adams Exit on the
101 North Freeway in Los Angeles.
In Case No. 21STCV23847 (the “Marinero Action”), Plaintiffs
Luis Felix Marinero, Ana Rodriguez, and Nathaly Rodriguez filed a complaint on
June 28, 2021, asserting causes of action for negligence and negligence per se
against Defendant Angelica Bianca Diaz (“Diaz”) and Does 1 through
25.  Diaz filed her answer on August 20, 2021.
In Case No. 21STCV24492 (the “Smith Action”), Plaintiff
Lloyd Smith filed a complaint on July 1, 2021, asserting a cause of action for
negligence against Defendants Diaz, Luis Rodriguez, and Does 1 through 50.  On February 1, 2023, Diaz and Luis Rodriguez
each filed their answers.  Diaz and Luis Rodriguez filed
Cross-Complaints against each other as well.
On March 15, 2023, the Court determined that the
Marinero Action and the Smith Action are related cases.  On February 23, 2024, the Court consolidated the
Marinero Action and the Smith Action, with the Marinero Action as the lead
case.
Luis Rodriguez has on three occasions filed a
motion for a determination that his settlement with Smith is a good faith
settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.  Diaz has opposed each motion.  The Court denied the first two motions for
lack of sufficient evidence to support the requested relief.  The third motion was fully briefed but was
taken off calendar when moving party failed to appear at the hearing on April
3, 2024.
On March 29 and April 4, 2024, Diaz and Luis
Rodriguez filed requests for dismissals of the claims in their cross-complaints
against each other.  The dismissals were
entered on April 2 and 5, 2024. 
On calendar for April 22, 2024, are three
discovery motions filed more than a year ago, in March 2023, in the Smith
Action, prior to consolidation.
As is relevant to the motions, Luis Rodriguez
served Smith with discovery on February 1, 2023, including Form Interrogatories
(Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set
One).  (Mahlstedt Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs.
A.)  Smith did not respond.  (Id., ¶ 3.)  
Luis Rodriguez filed these three motions on March
29, 2023.  All three were set for hearing
on January 30, 2024.  On January 30, the
Court continued the hearing on all three motions to February 23.  On February 23, the Court consolidated the
two cases and continued these three discovery motions to April 23.
Smith has not filed any opposition to the motions.
Legal
Standard 
 
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely
response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to
the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion],
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.030 provides that the court may impose
sanctions “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
 
Discussion            
 
Luis Rodriguez served Smith with Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, Judicial Council Form Interrogatories, Set One, on
February 1, 2023. (Mahlstedt Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.) Smith has not
responded to the discovery. (Id., ¶ 3.) 
 
Luis Rodriguez need not show any thing more.  The motions to compel responses to the
discovery requests are granted.
 
The requests for sanctions are denied.  
 
Luis Rodriguez seeks sanctions
under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, 2031.300, and 2023.030.  Sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and
2031.300, subdivision (c), authorize an award of sanctions against a party or
attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion to compel initial
responses; here, no opposition was filed. 
And section 2023.030 does “not independently authorize the trial court to
impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.”  (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers,
LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)  (The Court is aware
that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the City of Los
Angeles case, but the Court notes that the order granting review, filed on
January 25, 2023, states that pending review, the appellate opinion “may be
cited,” including “for its persuasive value.”  The Court finds the
reasoning of Justice Moor in the City of Los Angeles case to be
persuasive.)
