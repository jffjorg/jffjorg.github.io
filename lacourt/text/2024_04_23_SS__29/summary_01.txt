And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of allowing Defendants to issue and serve two subpoenas: one subpoena to Precise Imaging for the records of the lumbar MRI of Ms. Tellez on November 17, 2023; and one subpoena to Dr. Alen A. Nourian for records of treatment of Plaintiffs from October 11, 2023, to the present. The judge finds that although some factors favor Defendants and some favor Plaintiffs, on balance, Defendants have shown good cause for the reopening of discovery.
