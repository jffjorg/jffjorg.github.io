Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants Uber's motion to compel arbitration, ordering Uber and Plaintiff Mari Goto to arbitrate their dispute according to the terms of their agreement. The motion was unopposed, and Uber met its initial burden of showing that an agreement to arbitrate exists. The Court orders the parties to arbitrate their dispute, staying litigation of Plaintiff's claim against Uber pending the outcome of the arbitration. The Court sets a date for the parties to dismiss the litigation after completion of the arbitration.
