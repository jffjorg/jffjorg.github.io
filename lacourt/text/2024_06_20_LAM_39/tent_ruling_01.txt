MOTION
Defendants Huge
USA, Inc. and Jin Ser Park (“Defendants”) move to compel further responses from
Plaintiff Nam Suk Park (“Plaintiff”) to Requests for Production of Documents,
set two (“RPD”) and Special Interrogatories, set two (“SROG”).  Plaintiff opposes the motions.  
In its order of
March 20, 2024, the court ordered the parties to meet and confer on each
outstanding discovery request on or before March 29, 2024, and to file a joint
statement regarding any issues the parties could not resolve on or before April
24, 2024.  The parties filed their joint
statement and indicated that they resolved all issues with respect to the RPD
and SROG.  Accordingly, the Court places
the motion off calendar as moot.
Defendants argue
in the joint statement Defendants believe Plaintiff may have failed to preserve
evidence pertinent to this case.  That
issue is not developed by way of a noticed motion.  Therefore, it is not properly before the court,
and the court will not consider it unless and until Defendants notice and serve
a motion concerning it.
Defendants are ordered
to give notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
