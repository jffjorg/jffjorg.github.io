And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The defendant sought to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims based on an arbitration agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff's union, United Steelworkers Local 1945. The agreement provides for arbitration of disputes arising out of the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and other matters. However, the judge found that the agreement is permissive, not mandatory, and that the plaintiff's union may elect not to participate in arbitration. The judge also found that the defendant failed to meet its burden to show that an arbitration agreement exists that applies to the plaintiff's claims. The judge's ruling is based on the language of the collective bargaining agreement, which uses the word "may" to describe the process of resolving disputes, and the lack of extrinsic evidence to support the defendant's argument that the parties intended a contrary meaning.
