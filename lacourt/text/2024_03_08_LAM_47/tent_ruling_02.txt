 Case Number:  22STCV28831    Hearing Date:   March 8, 2024    Dept:  47 Tentative Ruling   Judge Theresa M. Traber, Department 47     HEARING DATE:     March 8, 2024                        TRIAL  DATE: May 28, 2024                                                             CASE:                         Deborah Gollette, et al. v. Deborah  Ketcham, et al.    CASE NO.:                 22STCV28831               MOTION  FOR ORDER SETTING DEPOSITION FEES OF PLAINTIFFS’ RETAINED EXPERTS    MOVING PARTY:               Defendant Chris Ketcham.   RESPONDING PARTY(S): Plaintiffs Deborah  Gollette and Rachel Gollette   STATEMENT  OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:                          This is a landlord-tenant action that was filed on September 2, 2022.  Plaintiffs, who are tenants in apartments owned by Defendants, allege that  Defendants refused to repair numerous serious habitability defects on the  subject premises. Plaintiffs further allege that, following Plaintiffs’  complaints and an alleged citation by the City of Bellflower, Defendants retaliated  against Plaintiffs by serving an eviction notice.   Defendant Chris Ketcham moves for  an order specially setting the deposition fees of Plaintiffs’ retained experts.                TENTATIVE RULING:   Defendant Chris Ketcham moves for  an order specially setting the deposition fees of Plaintiffs’ retained experts.     Code of Civil Procedure section  2034.470 authorizes a party seeking to depose an expert witness to move for an  order setting the compensation of that expert if the party “deems that the  hourly or daily fee of that expert for providing deposition testimony is  unreasonable.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2034.470(a).) “Notice of this motion shall  also be given to the expert.” (Id [emphasis added].)    Although Defendant’s amended proof  of service filed March 1, 2024 states that this motion was served on  Plaintiffs’ counsel via email on February 1, 2024, none of Defendant’s papers  provide any indication that notice was served on the experts whose rates are  challenged. Tellingly, despite Plaintiffs objecting to the motion on this basis  in their opposition, Defendant also wholly fails to address this notice  requirement in the reply papers. As Defendant has made no showing that he has  complied with the notice requirements of the statute under which the motion is  brought, Defendant is not entitled to an order specially setting the deposition  fees of Plaintiff’s experts.   Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion for  Order Specially Setting Deposition Fees of Plaintiffs’ Retained Experts is  DENIED.    Moving Party to give notice.   IT IS SO ORDERED.   Dated: March 8, 2024.                                    ___________________________________                                                                                     Theresa  M.
