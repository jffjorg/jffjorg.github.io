And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Attorney Gary S. Saunders' motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Raquel Ohnona. The motion was supported by evidence that Saunders and Ohnona have irreconcilable differences. The judge found that the risk of prejudice to Ohnona is low due to the distance of trial and absence of substantive motion hearings in the intervening period. The judge exercised its discretion reasonably and granted the motion, but only after written notice of the order is served on all parties and proof of service is filed with the court.
