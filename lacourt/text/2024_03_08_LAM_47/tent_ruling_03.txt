STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a breach of contract action that was filed on January 30, 2023.
Plaintiffs allege that they were hired by Defendant to perform construction and
renovation services on an apartment building owned by Defendant. Plaintiffs
allege that Defendant failed to pay in full for the work performed. 
 
            Attorney Byron
B. Mauss moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Gerald Yates.
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Byron B. Mauss moves to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Gerald Yates.
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) separately and included a proof of service as required by
California Rules of Court rule 3.1362(d).  Moving
counsel’s declaration states that he served Plaintiff by mail and confirmed the
address was current by telephone and by an overnight letter with return receipt
requested. (MC-052 ¶ 3.) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, trial in this matter is not yet set.
(MC-052 ¶ 6.) There is a Case Management Conference scheduled at the same time
as this motion. (Id. ¶ 5.) The risk of prejudice to Plaintiff is
therefore low due to the early stage of the litigation. Moving Counsel’s
declaration states that Plaintiff has breached a material term of his
engagement agreement with counsel, such that withdrawal is warranted under Rule
of Professional Conduct Rule 1.16(b)(5). (MC-052 ¶ 2.) Given the evidence presented
and the low risk of prejudice at this juncture, the Court finds that these
circumstances warrant withdrawal.
 
Accordingly, Attorney Byron B. Mauss’s Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Gerald Yates is GRANTED. 
 
            This
ruling is conditioned on Moving Counsel serving written notice of this order on
all parties and filing proof of service with the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
