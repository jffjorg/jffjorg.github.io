And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Attorney Byron B. Mauss's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Gerald Yates. The motion was filed due to a breach of a material term of the engagement agreement between counsel and client. Since the trial date has not been set and the Case Management Conference is scheduled at the same time as the motion, the risk of prejudice to the client is low. The court finds that the circumstances warrant withdrawal, and the motion is granted.
