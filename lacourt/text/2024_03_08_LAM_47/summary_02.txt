And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Deborah Gollette, et al. v. Deborah Ketcham, et al. (Case No. 22STCV28831). The case is a landlord-tenant action, and the Defendant, Chris Ketcham, moved for an order setting the deposition fees of the Plaintiffs' retained experts. The Judge has denied the motion, citing the Defendant's failure to provide notice to the experts as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.470. The Judge notes that the Defendant's amended proof of service shows that the motion was served on Plaintiffs' counsel via email on February 1, 2024, but does not indicate that notice was served on the experts. The Judge concludes that the Defendant has not made a showing that it has complied with the notice requirements of the statute and therefore is not entitled to an order setting the deposition fees.
