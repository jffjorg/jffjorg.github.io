And here is the English text summarizing the tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and a request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Andre Leroux, propounded form interrogatories to the defendant, Sunny Hills Palladium, on February 22, 2023, and was granted an extension to respond until May 30, 2023. However, the defendant served duplicate responses that were nothing but boilerplate objections. The judge finds that the objections are preserved and the defendant did not waive them. Therefore, the motion to compel responses is denied as moot. Additionally, the plaintiff's request for sanctions is denied because the motion was not unsuccessfully opposed. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is denied, citing a previous court decision that does not authorize monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.
