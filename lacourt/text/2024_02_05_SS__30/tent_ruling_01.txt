  Case Number:  20STCV00727    Hearing Date:   February 5, 2024    Dept:  30 ANDRE LEROUX vs SUNNY HILLS PALLADIUM SUNNY HILLS PALLADIUMTENTATIVEPlaintiff’s motion to compel responses to form interrogatories is DENIED as moot.Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.Moving party is ordered to give notice.DiscussionPlaintiff propounded Form Interrogatories, Set Two, on Defendant on February 22, 2023. (Mesaros Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Plaintiff granted an extension to respond until May 30, 2023. On May 29, 2023, Defendant served its responses to several sets of discovery, but on review, Plaintiff discovered that the document labeled “Responses to Plaintiffs Form Interrogatories, Set Two" was merely a duplicate of Defendant's responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two. (Id., Ex.C.) The discovery responses were nothing but boilerplate objections. (Id., Exh. D.)In opposition, Defendant argues it served responses on May 30, 2023, and it has now supplemented those responses.Defendant served objection only responses within the time agreed upon by the parties. Thus, the objections are preserved and Defendant did not waive objections. (Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 657.) Further, responses that only contain objections need not be verified by the party and the attorney’s signature is sufficient. (Id.) As timely responses were provided, the motion to compel a response is moot. If Plaintiff believed the objections were without merit, Plaintiff would have had to file a motion to compel further within the time allowed.Monday, February 5, 2024Plaintiff also requests sanctions. Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(c) requires sanctions when the motion is unsuccessfully opposed. Here, as the motion was not unsuccessfully opposed, and thus, the request for sanctions is denied.Plaintiff’s request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)
