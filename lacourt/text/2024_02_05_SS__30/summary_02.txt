Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the defendants' motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) and has denied the motion. The defendants had argued that the SAC does not allege specific facts showing that they acted with malice, oppression, or fraud, which is required for a claim for punitive damages. However, the court finds that the SAC sufficiently alleges facts to show that the defendants acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. Specifically, the SAC alleges that the defendants instructed Martinez to violate the felony hit and run statute, attempted to deceive the police and plaintiff about Martinez's responsibility for the crash, and concealed Martinez's involvement in the crash. The court also notes that the defendants failed to challenge paragraph 18 of the SAC in their first motion to strike, and therefore cannot raise this issue now. The court grants the defendants' motion to strike in part, but denies their request to strike paragraph 18 of the SAC.
