And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Stacey Joel Hunt, Jr. v. Tesla Motors, Inc., et al. The plaintiff, Stacey Joel Hunt, Jr., has moved to quash subpoenas issued by the defendants for his employment records, arguing that the subpoenas are overbroad and violate his right to privacy. The defendants argue that the subpoenas are necessary to investigate the plaintiff's claims.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas, limiting the scope of the subpoenas to only requests 2 and 3. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions, ordering the defendants to pay a total of $511.65 in sanctions to the plaintiff within 30 days.

The judge's decision is based on the principle that an employee's personnel records are protected by the right to privacy, and that the plaintiff has an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances. The judge also found that the defendants failed to articulate any important countervailing interest that disclosure of the records would serve, other than speculation as to where the plaintiff's stressors stem from.

The judge's ruling is in line with previous case law, including Hill v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994), Britt v. Superior Court (1978), Life Technologies Corp. v. Superior Court (2011), Brown v. Superior Court (1977), and Davis v. Superior Court (1992).
