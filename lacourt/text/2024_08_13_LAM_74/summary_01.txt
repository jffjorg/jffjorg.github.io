And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, Richard Conell, brought a lawsuit against the defendants, Transdev Services, Inc., et al., alleging race discrimination, racial harassment, retaliation, and failure to prevent harassment.

The judge denies summary adjudication of the first cause of action, race discrimination, because the plaintiff has presented evidence showing triable issues of fact, including evidence that the defendants' safety policies and procedures were not applied consistently.

The judge also denies summary adjudication of the second cause of action, racial harassment, because the plaintiff has presented evidence showing triable issues of fact, including evidence that the defendants' supervisor, General Manager William Jackson, made racial slurs and that no disciplinary action was taken against employees who made similar comments.

The judge denies summary adjudication of the third and fifth causes of action, retaliation, because the plaintiff has presented evidence showing triable issues of fact, including evidence that the defendants' actions were motivated by the plaintiff's assistance to other Black employees.

The judge denies summary adjudication of the fourth cause of action, failure to prevent harassment, because the plaintiff has presented evidence showing triable issues of fact, including evidence that the defendants failed to prevent racial harassment.

The judge denies summary adjudication of the sixth and seventh causes of action, wrongful termination and violations of Civil Code section 43, because the plaintiff has presented evidence showing triable issues of fact, including evidence that the defendants' actions were motivated by racial bias.

Finally, the judge denies summary adjudication of the eighth cause of action, intentional infliction of emotional distress, because the plaintiff has presented evidence showing triable issues of fact, including evidence that the defendants' actions were extreme or outrageous.

Overall, the judge has found that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create triable issues of fact in all of the causes of action, and therefore denies summary adjudication of all of the causes of action.
