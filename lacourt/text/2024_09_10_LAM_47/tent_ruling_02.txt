STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed on April 12, 2022. Plaintiffs entered
into a Retail Installment Sales Contract for a 2017 BMW i3 which developed
electrical system defects. Plaintiffs sued the manufacturer, BMW of North America,
LLC, for breach of warranty under the Song Beverly Act. A jury verdict was
rendered on July 3, 2024 in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant. 
 
Plaintiffs move for an award of
prejudgment interest.
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiffs’
Motion for Prejudgment Interest is GRANTED in the amount of $4,830.14.
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiffs seek an award of prejudgment interest as the
prevailing parties after a jury trial.
 
//
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
            Plaintiffs,
in their reply papers, request that the Court take judicial notice of (1)
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Arbitration in this action; and (2) the
Declaration of Scott D. Sharp in support of that motion. Neither document is
material to the Court’s ruling. Plaintiffs’ request is therefore DENIED.  (Gbur v. Cohen (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d
296, 301 [“[J]udicial notice . . . is always confined to those matters which
are relevant to the issue at hand.”].) 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiffs seek an award of prejudgment interest pursuant
to Civil Code section 3287(a), or, alternatively, in a reduced amount pursuant
to section 3287(b).
 
            Civil Code section 3287 provides, in
relevant part:
 
(a) Every
person who is entitled to recover damages certain, or capable of being made
certain by calculation, and the right to recover which is vested in him
upon a particular day, is entitled also to recover interest thereon from
that day, except during such time as the debtor is prevented by law, or by the
act of the creditor from paying the debt. This section is applicable to
recovery of damages and interest from any such debtor, including the state or
any county, city, city and county, municipal corporation, public district,
public agency, or any political subdivision of the state. 
 
(b) Every person who is entitled
under any judgment to receive damages based upon a cause of action in
contract where the claim was unliquidated, may also recover interest
thereon from a date prior to the entry of judgment as the court may, in
its discretion, fix, but in no event earlier than the date the action was
filed.
 
(Civ. Code § 3287(a)-(b), bold emphasis added.) 
 
The case
law interpreting Civil Code section 3287 provides some guidance to its
application . . . . As discussed above, "[t]he policy underlying
authorization of an award of prejudgment interest is to compensate the injured
party--to make that party whole for the accrual of wealth which could have been
produced during the period of loss. [Citations.]" (Citation
omitted.)  
 
The court
in Cassinos also said: "The test for recovery of prejudgment
interest under [Civil Code] section 3287, subdivision (a) is whether
defendant actually know[s] the amount owed or from reasonably available
information could the defendant have computed that amount.
[Citation.]" (Citations omitted.) "The statute [Civil Code section
3287] does not authorize prejudgment interest where the amount of damage,
as opposed to the determination¿of liability, 'depends upon a judicial
determination based upon conflicting evidence and is not ascertainable from
truthful data supplied by the claimant to his debtor.'
[Citations.]" ( Citation omitted.) Thus, where the amount of damages
cannot be resolved except by verdict or judgment, prejudgment interest is not
appropriate. (Citation omitted.)  
 
(Wisper Corp. v. Cal. Commerce Bank (1996) 49
Cal.App.4th 948, 960, bold emphasis and underlining added.) 
 
Entitlement to Interest Under Section 3287(a)
 
            Plaintiffs
specifically seek an award of prejudgment interest in the amount of $7,681.11
under subdivision (a), or, alternatively, in the amount of $6,315.58 under
subdivision (b), based purely on the purchase price of the subject vehicle of $28,319.60,
including a sale price of $24,191.00, finance charges of $1,822.09, and $2,306.51
in taxes and fees, all of which were set forth in the sales contract. (See
Declaration of Jeffrey Mukai ISO Mot. Exh. A.)  Plaintiffs do not seek prejudgment interest on
other damages, as Plaintiffs concede that those amounts were neither known nor
could they be calculated in advance. Plaintiffs argue the amount of damages was
capable of being made certain because the underlying purchase contract for the
vehicle set the price of the vehicle at $28,319.60, and thus, Defendant was
capable of calculating interest on that price if Plaintiffs were successful in
pursuing restitution under the Song-Beverly Act. Plaintiffs
calculate the total amount of prejudgment interest at $7,681.11. This calculation is derived from an assessed interest rate on the purchase
price of $28,319.60 of 10% per annum, pursuant to Civil
Code section 3829, divided by 365 days per year. Thus, at a corresponding daily
interest rate of $7.7587 per day, multiplied by 990 days between the date of
breach on October 18, 2021 and the date of the verdict on July 3, 2024, the
total amount owed, according to Plaintiffs, is $7,681.11.
Alternatively, if the award is calculated based on the date that the Complaint
was filed on April 12, 2022, the total amount of interest applying the same
calculation would be $6,315.58.
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs are not
entitled to prejudgment interest because Plaintiffs’ damages were not certain
or capable of being made certain until a judicial determination was made based
on conflicting evidence. In support of this contention, Defendant cites Duale
v. Mercedes Benz USA, LLC, a 2007 Song-Beverly case in which the Court of
Appeal concluded that the determination of damage to the plaintiff from the
alleged defects in the vehicle at issue were in dispute and could not be
resolved except by verdict. (Duale v. Mercedes Benz USA, LLC (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 718, 729; see also Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018)
30 Cal.App.5th 24, 43-45.) Defendant contends that, because there were similar
disputed issues of nonconformity, damages (including offsets for mileage on the
vehicle), and the application of civil penalties, Duale and its progeny
are on all fours with this case. 
 
            Plaintiffs, anticipating this line
of attack, argue that Defendant overextends the reach of Duale to claim
that whenever the amount of damages is in dispute for any reason, a plaintiff
is not entitled to prejudgment interest. As Plaintiffs state, the Court of
Appeal concluded in Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. that Duale’s
holding that prejudgment interest was unavailable turned entirely on the facts
of that case, and was not a general rule that prejudgment interest is not
available under the Song-Beverly Act. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009)
174 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1010.) Defendant, in response, argues that Doppes concerned
only whether a trial court has jurisdiction to award prejudgment interest in a
Song-Beverly action, and therefore did not limit the effect of Duale. The
Court does not share Defendant’s view because, if that were true, Defendant’s
reading of Duale would effectively render Doppes a dead letter
whenever liability or damages are in dispute—which is to say, whenever a
Song-Beverly action is brought. Defendant’s reliance on Duale is not
entirely misplaced, however. In that case, the Duale court concluded
that determination of the award required the jury to make numerous factual
determinations involving the existence of any defects and whether they impaired
the use, value, or safety of the vehicle at issue. (Duale, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 729.) Moreover, the Court of Appeal in Warren found that,
even if damages under the sale contract of the vehicle could have been
calculated, incidental or consequential damages required factual determinations
at trial. (Warren, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at 44-45.) Similar disputes
existed in this case. Nevertheless, well-established precedent holds that
“[t]he existence of a bona fide dispute between the parties as to the amount
owing under an express contract does not render that sum unliquidated.” (See,
e.g., Rabinowitch v. California Western Gas Co. (1967) 257 Cal.App.2d
150, 161.) Further still, the Court of Appeal has repeatedly upheld awards of
prejudgment interest in Song-Beverly actions even where liability was disputed.
(See, e.g., Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at 1009-1010; Lukather v.
General Motors, LLC (2010 181 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1053.) 
 
Considering the rule that “certainty”
regarding prejudgment interest is broadly construed, (see Chesapeake
Industries Inc. v. Togoya Enterprises, Inc. (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 901,
907), the Court concludes, based on the fixed value of the contract, that the
potential damages were certain insofar as they could be computed under the
contract based on the state of the vehicle. The Court therefore finds that
Defendant is entitled to prejudgment interest under section 3287(a). The Court
thus declines to address the issue of whether interest should be awarded under
section 3287(b).
 
Effect
of Offset
 
            Defendant argues that, even if
Plaintiffs are entitled to interest, Plaintiff’s calculation neglects to
include the jury’s calculated mileage offset. Plaintiffs do not address
this argument in opposition. As the mileage offset is part of the proper
measure of actual damages, the Court is persuaded by the logic of Defendant’s
argument. The Court will therefore apply the mileage offset for value of use of
$2,951.46, for an offset purchase price of $25,440.14.
 
Interest Rate
 
            Defendant
also argues that Plaintiffs are improperly seeking interest at a rate of 10%,
rather than 7%. Under Civil Code section 3289, interest on a breach of a
contract that does not specify an interest rate is fixed by statute at 10%.
(Civ. Code § 3289.) Article XV, section 1 of the California Constitution also
provides: 
 
The rate of interest
upon a judgment rendered in any court of this State shall be set by the
Legislature at not more than 10 percent per annum. Such rate may be variable
and based upon interest rates charged by federal agencies or economic
indicators, or both.
 
In the absence of the
setting of such rate by the Legislature, the rate of interest on any judgment
rendered in any court of the State shall be 7 percent per annum.
 
(Cal. Const. art. XV § 1.) Defendant
contends that section 3289 is inapplicable because this is a Song-Beverly
action, not an action in contract. Plaintiffs, in reply, argue that a rate of
10% is available for actions that “arise out of a contract” under the statute,
or, alternatively, for claims involving goods used primarily for personal
purposes under article XV section 1. The Court disagrees with Plaintiffs’
interpretation of the law. Article XV section 1 permits deviation from the
default interest rate only when set by the Legislature or when set forth in a
written contract. (Cal. Const. Art. XV § 1.) Plaintiffs point to no term in any
contract with Defendant that sets forth a 10% interest rate. Further, the Court
is not persuaded that Bishop v. Hyundai stands for the proposition that
a Song-Beverly claim is a claim based upon a contract, as Plaintiffs argue in the
context of interest under Civil Code section 3287(b), which the Court otherwise
does not address. (Bishop v. Hyundai (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 750.) In that
case, the Court of Appeal, in determining the availability of emotional
distress damages, examined the language of the Song-Beverly Act, concluding
that the statutory remedies under the Act were expressly limited to remedies
available under the Uniform Commercial Code. (Bishop, supra, 44
Cal.App.4th at 757-58.) The Court of Appeal did not hold, however, that a
Song-Beverly claim is, in fact, a claim arising from contract. Plaintiffs’
argument thus exceeds the limits of the Bishop ruling. The Court
therefore finds that the correct interest rate is not 10%, as claimed by
Plaintiffs, but rather 7%, pursuant to Article XV section 1 of the California
Constitution.
 
            Thus,
applying the formula described above, the Court calculates that the correct
amount of prejudgment interest is $4,830.14 derived from an annual
interest of $1,780.81, divided by 365 days, for a daily interest of $4.88
accruing for a total of 990 days.
 
CONCLUSION: 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Prejudgment Interest is GRANTED in the
amount of $4,830.14.
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
