And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7. The defendants sought sanctions because they believe the plaintiff's complaint is being presented for an improper purpose and is not warranted by existing law or a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's complaint is barred by res judicata, collateral estoppel, and comity, and that the filing of the complaint is an attempt to evade the Nevada District Court's order compelling arbitration. The judge rejects these arguments and finds that the filing of the complaint is not objectively unreasonable. The judge notes that the Arbitration Agreement requires the arbitration to take place in Los Angeles and that the plaintiff may have a valid reason for re-filing the action in Los Angeles. The judge also rejects the notion that the filing of the complaint constitutes an attempt to evade the Nevada District Court's order.
