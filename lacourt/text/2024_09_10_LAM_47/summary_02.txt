And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiffs' motion for prejudgment interest in the amount of $4,830.14. The court finds that the potential damages were certain insofar as they could be computed under the contract based on the state of the vehicle. The court declines to address the issue of whether interest should be awarded under section 3287(b). The court also applies a mileage offset for value of use of $2,951.46, and calculates the correct interest rate as 7% per annum, pursuant to Article XV, section 1 of the California Constitution. The court concludes that the defendant is not entitled to prejudgment interest because the defendant's damages were not certain or capable of being made certain until a judicial determination was made.
