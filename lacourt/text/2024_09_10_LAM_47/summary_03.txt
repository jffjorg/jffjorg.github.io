And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Judge Theresa M. Traber, is considering a motion by Attorney John F. Mansour to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Julian Parra. The motion is based on allegations of fraud, including the establishment of a trust without the plaintiff's knowledge or consent and the recording of a false death certificate in Illinois. However, the judge notes that the moving party has failed to provide proof of service on the plaintiff, including dates for the time service by mail was made. The judge rules that the motion will be continued to permit the moving party to demonstrate proper service on the plaintiff. The hearing is set for October 10, 2024, at 9:00 AM.
