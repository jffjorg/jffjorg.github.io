And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Bronson 2231 LLC's motion to intervene in the case. Bronson claims title to the Bronson property, which is at issue in the lawsuit between Cedric Price and Jarrell Davis. The property was transferred to a trust, and Bronson believes its interest in the property would be injured if Price succeeds in cancelling the instrument by which the property was sold. The judge found that Bronson has an interest related to the property and that its intervention will not enlarge the issues in the case. The judge also noted that no opposition to the motion has been filed, and therefore granted the motion to intervene.
