The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 20STCV42444, denying Plaintiff Gergis Ghobrial's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Admission from Defendant Lynette Scherer. The motion was defective because Plaintiff did not attempt to communicate with Defendant about the lack of verification in the supplemental responses, which were served a week before the motion was filed. The Judge also awarded sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $500, as Defendant had sought.
