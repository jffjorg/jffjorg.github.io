```

And here is a brief summary of the ruling in English:

The court has tentatively ruled on the motion for summary judgment. The motion is GRANTED as to the second cause of action for battery alleged against Nguyen, as the evidence shows that Nguyen intentionally and without consent inserted an IV into the plaintiff's hand, causing harm. The motion is otherwise DENIED, as triable issues of fact exist as to the plaintiff's medical negligence claim, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, false promise, and concealment claims. The court has also ruled that the plaintiff's claims for medical battery and fraud are not barred by the statute of limitations, and that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to establish triable issues of fact as to whether the defendants complied with the standard of care during the procedure.
