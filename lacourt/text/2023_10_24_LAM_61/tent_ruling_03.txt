 Case Number:  20STCV42444    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  61 Plaintiff
Gergis Ghobrial, M.D.’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for
Admission from Defendant Lynette A. Scherer, M.D. is DENIED. Sanctions are
awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $500.
 
I.      
MOTION TO
COMPEL FURTHER
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for admissions may be made on the grounds that an answer
is incomplete or evasive, or an objection is without merit. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.290, subd. (a)(1)–(2).) A motion to compel further must “be accompanied by
a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.290, subd. (b)(1).)
Plaintiff Gergis Ghobrial
(Plaintiff) seeks further responses to Requests for Admission No. 8, 9, 11,
13–16, 19, and 20, from Defendant Lynette Scherer (Defendant), on the grounds
that Defendant’s responses to the requests consisted of objections and (in
response to Request No. 9) a statement that Defendant was unable to admit or
deny the request. (Separate Statement.) Plaintiff acknowledges that
supplemental responses were served on August 7, 2023, a week before this motion
was filed, but contends that they were unverified. (Ghobrial Decl. at p. 4.)
The motion is defective.
Plaintiff takes no issue in this motion with the content of the supplemental
responses, save for the fact that they were unverified when served. But
Plaintiff made no inquiries concerning the supplemental response before filing
this motion, and the verification — executed on August 8, before the motion was
filed — was served upon Plaintiff the very day he filed the present motion.
(Weatherup Decl. Exh. C.) Defendant’s counsel states that the original failure
to provide the verification was inadvertent. (Weatherup Decl. ¶ 4.) Any attempt
to communicate with Defendant could have obviated the present motion.
The motion to compel further is
DENIED. 
II.   
SANCTIONS
Statute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon
a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response
to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for
admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
 
Defendant seeks $1,340.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff,
representing five hours of attorney work. (Heatherup Decl. ¶ 7.) Sanctions are
awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $500.
 
Defendant to give notice.
