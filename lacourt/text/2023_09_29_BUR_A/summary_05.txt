And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike certain portions of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by the plaintiffs. The defendants, Julie Lynn McIntire dba Golden Bear Management, are seeking to strike the plaintiffs' request for punitive damages and allegations that the defendants' conduct was willful, oppressive, and malicious.

The judge has found that the allegations in the FAC are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court notes that the holding in Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, which allows for punitive damages in cases involving constructive eviction, is not applicable in this case. The court finds that the facts alleged only speak to three separate incidents of mold intrusion, and the FAC states that the defendants called plumbers to fix the problems, but the remediation was inadequate. The court concludes that the provision of remediation which failed to address the issue does not speak to despicable conduct.

The judge has granted the motion to strike the request for punitive damages without leave to amend. The court finds that the defects in the plaintiffs' allegations cannot be reasonably cured by the addition of factual allegations because the allegations must necessarily contain the defendants' attempts to repair and remediate.
