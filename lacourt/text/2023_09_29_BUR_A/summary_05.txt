And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike certain portions of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by the plaintiffs. The defendants, Julie Lynn McIntire dba Golden Bear Management, are seeking to strike the plaintiffs' request for punitive damages and allegations that the defendants' conduct was willful, oppressive, and malicious.

The judge has found that the allegations in the FAC are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court notes that the holding in Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, which allows for punitive damages in cases involving constructive eviction, is not applicable in this case. The court finds that the facts alleged only speak to three separate incidents of mold intrusion, and the FAC states that the defendants called plumbers to fix the problems, but the remediation was inadequate. The court concludes that the provision of remediation which failed to address the issue does not speak to despicable conduct.

The judge has granted the motion to strike the request for punitive damages without leave to amend. The court finds that the defects in the plaintiffs' allegations cannot be reasonably cured by the addition of factual allegations because the allegations must necessarily contain the defendants' attempts to repair and remediate.

**English Summary:**


The judge has tentatively ruled to strike the plaintiffs' request for punitive damages from their complaint. The plaintiffs, Zachary Kamen and Appel Appelusa, are suing their landlord, Julie Lynn McIntire dba Golden Bear Management, for alleged mold problems in their former apartment.  

The judge found that while the plaintiffs allege the landlord was negligent in addressing the mold issue, they have not provided enough evidence to show that the landlord acted with the level of "despicable conduct" required to warrant punitive damages.  


The judge specifically noted that the plaintiffs' allegations focused on repeated instances of mold and the landlord's attempts to repair the problem, rather than a complete refusal to address the issue as seen in previous cases that have allowed for punitive damages.  

The judge denied the plaintiffs' request to amend their complaint, finding that the facts they alleged could not reasonably be changed to support a claim for punitive damages.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to strike various portions of the First Amended Complaint filed by the defendant, Julie Lynn McIntire dba Golden Bear Management. The defendant seeks to strike the request for punitive damages and certain allegations made by the plaintiffs, Zachary Kamen and Appel Appelusa.

The judge notes that a motion to strike is used to reach defects or objections to pleadings that are not challengeable by demurrer. The court has reviewed the pleadings and finds that the allegations made by the plaintiffs are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

Specifically, the judge finds that the allegations of despicable conduct are not supported by the facts alleged in the pleadings. The court notes that the allegations of mold intrusion and inadequate remediation are not similar to those in prior cases where punitive damages were awarded. The court also finds that the provision of remediation that failed to address the issue does not speak to despicable conduct.

Accordingly, the judge grants the motion to strike the request for punitive damages without leave to amend. The judge finds that the defects in the pleadings cannot be reasonably cured by the addition of factual allegations because the allegations must necessarily contain the defendant's attempts to repair and remediate.
