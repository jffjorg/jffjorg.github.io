## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion by Plaintiff Mikayel Israyelyan to strike Defendant Krikor Bardakjian's answer and cross-complaint due to Bardakjian's failure to comply with discovery requests.

The judge finds that Bardakjian initially refused to produce certain documents, but ultimately granted access to relevant information on an iCloud account. While the judge acknowledges that Bardakjian's actions were inappropriate, they do not warrant terminating sanctions at this time. 

Instead, the judge awards $4,561.65 in monetary sanctions against Bardakjian. The judge also urges the parties to consider an Informal Discovery Conference to resolve any remaining discovery issues promptly.

significant\_statements:

* terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's orders
* discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information
* plaintiff is entitled to receive responses to the discovery that he has propounded, and defendant is subject to appropriate (and potentially escalating) sanctions for the failure to comply with his obligations under the Civil Discovery Act and court orders
* defendant should be aware that escalating sanctions will be imposed for future noncompliance, including evidentiary preclusion, issue sanctions and potentially terminating sanctions

summary:
This tentative ruling is about a motion for terminating sanctions brought by the plaintiff, Mikayel Israyelyan, against the defendant, Krikor Bardakjian. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant has willingly refused to comply with the court's order by not producing responsive documents to certain requests for production. The defendant claims that he was not in possession of the documents plaintiff sought. The court has discretion to impose terminating sanctions, but these sanctions should be appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery. The court notes that plaintiff is entitled to receive responses to the discovery that he has propounded, and defendant is subject to appropriate (and potentially escalating) sanctions for the failure to comply with his obligations under the Civil Discovery Act and court orders. However, at this time, the court does not decide that the defendant's initial failures to comply justify terminating sanctions. Instead, the court awards sanctions to defendant in the amount of $4,561.65.
