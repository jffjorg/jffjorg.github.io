The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The defendant had moved for terminating sanctions due to the plaintiffs' failure to comply with discovery orders. The court denied the motion, finding that the plaintiffs' failure to comply was not willful, but rather the result of neglect. The court suggested that less severe sanctions may be appropriate and noted that the plaintiffs are still subject to sanctions for their failure to comply with discovery obligations.
