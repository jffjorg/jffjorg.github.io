  - "A court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his discovery obligations." (Deyo v. Kilbourne)
  - "Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information." (Midwife v. Bernal)
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion for terminating sanctions brought by the defendant, Frank Johnny Moreno, against the plaintiffs, Cesar Hilario Prado and Daniel Morales. The plaintiffs were previously represented by counsel, but a motion to be relieved was granted on May 19, 2023. The defendant's motion to compel discovery responses was granted on August 4, 2023, and the plaintiffs have failed to comply with the order.

The court has considered the legal standard for terminating sanctions, which requires a showing that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the order is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance. The court has also considered the totality of the circumstances, including the conduct of the parties, the detriment to the propounding party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.

The court has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, finding that the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the order is not willful, but rather the result of neglect. The court has also found that the defendant has not shown that the plaintiffs' failure to comply has produced a detriment that cannot be offset by less severe sanctions. The court has ordered the parties to submit on this tentative ruling and has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions.
