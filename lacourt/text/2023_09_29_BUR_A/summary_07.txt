## English Summary

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of granting Yahya Tahbaz's motion for trial preference. 

Tahbaz, who is 89 years old, argues that his age and health condition, including a traumatic brain injury allegedly sustained in a fall, necessitate a faster trial date. While the defendant disputes the cause of Tahbaz's injuries and argues that his pre-existing health conditions are not severe enough to warrant a preference, the judge finds Tahbaz's showing sufficient under California Code of Civil Procedure §36.

As a result, the trial date is set for January 22, 2024, and a final status conference will be held on January 18, 2024.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Yahya Tahbaz's motion for trial preference due to his age and health condition. The court found that Tahbaz's showings satisfied the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) § 36(a), which allows parties over 70 years old to seek a preference in scheduling a trial if their health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing their interest in the litigation. The court rejected the defendants' argument that Tahbaz's showings were insufficient and that granting the motion would prejudice their ability to prepare for trial. The court set the trial for January 22, 2024, and a final status conference for January 18, 2024.

  Case Number: 23BBCV01458
  Hearing Date: September 29, 2023
  Dept: A Los Angeles Superior Court, North Central District - Burbank

  Parties:
    Plaintiff: Yahya Tahbaz
    Defendants: Coldwater Care Center, LLC dba Sherman Village Health Care Center and Longwood Management Corp.

  Events:
    - Yahya Tahbaz suffered injuries from a fall on November 13, 2022, at Defendants' premises.
    - Tahbaz moves for trial preference pursuant to C.C.P. § 36 and Defendants oppose.

  Analysis:
    - Tahbaz is 89 years old and suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI) from the fall.
    - Tahbaz's physician, Darius Gharib, MD, expressed uncertainty about Tahbaz's survival beyond six months due to age, injuries, and health condition.
    - Defendants argue that Tahbaz's showings fail to meet the "clear and convincing standard" for granting trial preference, but the court finds they conflate mandatory and discretionary relief standards.
    - Defendants also argue that Tahbaz's physician's note is insufficient and purely conclusory, but the court disagrees, stating that the standard for a motion for trial preference is lower than for a motion to strike.
    - Defendants acknowledge Tahbaz's poor health, but argue he did not sustain a TBI from the fall. The court finds this argument inconsistent with Defendants' assertion that Tahbaz suffered from a serious health condition before the incident.

  Ruling:
    - The court grants Tahbaz's motion for trial preference, setting the trial for January 22, 2024, at 10:30 a.m., and a final status conference for January 18, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.
