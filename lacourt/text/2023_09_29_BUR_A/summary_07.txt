Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Yahya Tahbaz's motion for trial preference under CCP §36, which allows a party over 70 years old to request a preference for a trial date due to their age and health condition. The Judge found that Yahya Tahbaz has shown that his health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. The Judge also rejected the defendant's arguments that Yahya Tahbaz's showings were insufficient and that they would be prejudiced by the granting of trial preference. The trial is set for January 22, 2024, and a final status conference is set for January 18, 2024.
