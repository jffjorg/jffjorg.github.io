And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer hearing and has issued a tentative ruling. The court has sustained the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend as to the first, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action. The court has overruled the demurrer as to the second and third causes of action. The court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the fourth cause of action.

The court has analyzed each cause of action and has found the following:

* The first cause of action for breach of contract is sustained with leave to amend because the allegations are insufficient to plead an alter ego theory.
* The second and third causes of action for quantum meruit and unjust enrichment are overruled because the allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action.
* The fourth cause of action for quantum meruit is sustained without leave to amend because it is duplicative of the second cause of action.
* The fifth cause of action for open book account is sustained with leave to amend because the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action.
* The sixth cause of action for foreclosure of mechanic's lien is sustained with leave to amend because the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action.
* The seventh and eighth causes of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation are sustained with leave to amend because the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action.

The court has also granted judicial notice of certain documents and has denied the request for judicial notice of others.
