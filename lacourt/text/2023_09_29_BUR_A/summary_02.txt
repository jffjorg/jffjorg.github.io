And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before today's hearing. The case is about a dispute between Mercury Casualty Insurance Company (Defendant) and Alpha Steam Pro, Natalex Enterprise Inc. dba Jumpin' Java, and Healthy Bites Inc. (Plaintiffs) regarding the payment of insurance benefits. The Plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unfair business practices, unjust enrichment, negligent misrepresentation, and declaratory relief. The Court previously sustained a demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend, except for the cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. The Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, but the Court finds that the allegations remain insufficient to support a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation. The Court sustains the demurrer to the cause of action for negligent misrepresentation without leave to amend, and the motion to strike is moot.
