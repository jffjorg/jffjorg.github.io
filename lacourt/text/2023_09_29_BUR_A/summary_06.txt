And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies JK Residential Services, Inc.'s motion to quash service of summons. JK Residential claims that service was not rendered in compliance with California Code of Civil Procedure § 416.10, as the process server served Jane Doe, a receptionist, who is unknown to JK Residential and not an authorized agent. However, JK Residential's receptionist, Noel Salas, Jr., submitted a declaration attesting to actual notice of the lawsuit, and the Court finds that JK Residential substantially complied with the service requirements, providing actual notice of the action. The Court rules that the motion to quash is denied, and JK Residential is ordered to give notice unless all parties waive notice.
