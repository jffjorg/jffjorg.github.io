The Judge's tentative ruling denies JK Residential Services, Inc.'s motion to quash service of summons. JK Residential claims that service was not rendered in compliance with California Code of Civil Procedure § 416.10, as the process server served Jane Doe, a receptionist, who is unknown to JK Residential and not an authorized agent. However, JK Residential's receptionist, Noel Salas, Jr., submitted a declaration attesting to actual notice of the lawsuit, and the Court finds that JK Residential substantially complied with the service requirements, providing actual notice of the action. The Court rules that the motion to quash is denied, and JK Residential is ordered to give notice unless all parties waive notice.

## English Summary

The judge is tentatively denying the motion by J.K. Residential Services, Inc. to quash service of process. 

J.K. Residential argued that service was improper because it was allegedly given to a receptionist who is not authorized to receive service. However, the judge found that although service may not have been technically perfect, J.K. Residential received actual notice of the lawsuit and was able to timely file a motion to quash. The judge cited the principle that courts should liberally construe service of process requirements to ensure that defendants receive notice of lawsuits.
