MOTION
TO QUASH SERVICE OF PROCESS

Los Angeles Superior Court
Case # 23BBCV00600

 



MP:  


J.K. Residential Services, Inc. (Defendant)
  




RP:  


None



 
ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Brittney Dixon (“Plaintiff”) brings this action against
Excel Residential (“Excel”) and J.K. Residential Services, Inc. (“JK
Residential”) (collectively “Defendants”). Plaintiff alleges, among other things,
Defendants were negligent with respect to remediation of mold and failing to
repair the heater in Plaintiff’s apartment. 
 
JK Residential now moves to quash service of the summons and
complaint on grounds that service was not rendered in compliance with
California Code of Civil Procedure (“C.C.P”) § 416.10. Plaintiff has filed no
opposition. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“‘Service
of process, under longstanding tradition in our system of justice, is
fundamental to any procedural imposition on a named defendant.’
[Citation.]”  (AO Alfa-Bank v. Yakovlev (2018) 21¿Cal.App.5th 189,
202.)  “To establish personal jurisdiction, compliance with statutory
procedures for service of process is essential.”  (Kremerman v. White (2021)
71 Cal.App.5th 358, 371.)  Defendant’s knowledge of the action does not
dispense with statutory requirements for service of summons.  (Kappel
v. Bartlett (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466.) 
 
“A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow” may move “to quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him
or her” that results from lack of proper service.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §
418.10(a)(1).  A defendant has 30 days after the service of the summons to
file a responsive pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
412.20(a)(3).)  
 
“When a
defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’” (Summers v. McClanahan¿(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413.) 
 
“Evidence
Code section 647 provides that a registered process server’s declaration of
service establishes a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of
the facts stated in the declaration.  [Citation.]”  (American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199¿Cal.App.4th 383, 390; Evid. Code
§ 647.) 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
JK
Residential argues service upon them was insufficient because it was allegedly
rendered upon their receptionist. The proof of service reflects that service
was made upon the following person on May 17, 2023: 
 
Jane Doe, Reception (Hispanic, Female, 30’s,
5’6, 130lbs, black hair, brown eyes)
 
JK
Residential states this person is unknown to them and is not a receptionist for
the company. JK Residential submits the declaration of Noel Salas, Jr., their
receptionist, who attests that on May 17, 2023, they were working in the JK
Residential offices when a process server entered the building and left paperwork
on the counter before leaving. (Salas Decl. ¶ 1.) Salas states he does not
match the physical description on the proof of service. (Salas Decl. ¶ 2.)  Salas also states that he is not a registered
agent of service for JK residential. (Salas Decl. ¶ 3.) 
 
“It is
axiomatic that strict compliance with the code's provisions for service of
process is not required. (Ramos v. Homeward Residential, Inc., 223 Cal.
App. 4th 1434, 1443.) “[I]n deciding whether service was valid, the statutory
provisions regarding service of process should be liberally construed to
effectuate service and uphold the jurisdiction of the court if actual notice
has been received by the defendant.” (Gibble v. Car-Lene Research, Inc.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 295, 313.) In essence, substantial compliance with the
code’s requirements for service of process is sufficient. (Id.)  
 
Here, JK
Residential has submitted declarations attesting that they have received actual
notice of the lawsuit. Salas states that the process server entered the offices
of JK Residential and left the paperwork on the counter. The Court understands
JK Residential’s argument that this is not actual service on an authorized
agent. However, the Court also acknowledges the common-sense conclusion that
this service was sufficient to provide actual notice given that JK Residential
was able to timely file a motion to quash, and no default has been entered. Service
was affected on May 17, 2023 and JK Residential filed its motion to quash on
June 21, 2023. In accordance with the liberal construction rule, the Court
finds Plaintiff substantially complied with the service requirements such as to
give JK Residential actual notice of this action.
