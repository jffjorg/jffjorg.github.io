 Case Number:  20STCV09650    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of a default judgment, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
March 10, 2020, Plaintiff Michelle Lyons
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Baby Geniuses Early Learning
Center (“Defendant”), Doe Employees 1-4, and Does 5-25 for battery, assault,
negligence, negligent hiring, supervision, and retention of employee,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional
distress, and false imprisonment. 
On
June 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing service by personal
hand delivery of a statement of damages on Defendant on February 3, 2021. 
On
October 13, 2021, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On
November 29, 2021, the Court dismissed the Doe Employee defendants and Doe
defendants with prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
June 23, 2022, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice. On October 12,
2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal. On November
7, 2022, the Court again dismissed the action without prejudice. On March 8,
2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to
vacate the dismissal. 
On
March 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed a statement of damages with the
previously-filed proof of service showing service on Defendant on February 3,
2021.  The statement of damages listed (1) $2,500,000.00 for pain, suffering, and inconvenience, (2) $2,500,000.00 for
emotional distress, (3) past medical expenses “according to proof,” and (4) $5,000,000.00 in punitive damages. 
On
August 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a revised statement of damages that requested
$15,046.48 for past medical expenses (as well as
the amounts listed in the previous statement of damages). A proof of service
was attached showing service of the revised statement of damages on Defendant’s
“Employee/Authorized Person to Accept” on August 4, 2023. 
On September
15, 2023, the Court vacated Defendant’s October 13, 2021 default based on Plaintiff's post-default service on Defendant of a revised statement of damages.
On
October 13, 2023, the clerk again entered Defendant’s default. 
On
January 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment to be heard on
February 14, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
Michelle Lyons asks the Court enter a default judgment against Defendant Baby
Geniuses Early Learning Center and award Plaintiff $5,016,869.52, consisting of
$5,000,000.00 in general damages and $15,046.48 in special damages. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum
of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.   Damages 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint,
plaintiff merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case
for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson
v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying
preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's
default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal
injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount
listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585,
subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff’s CIV-100 form requests damages of
$5,016,869.52, including $5,000,000.00 in general damages and $15,046.48 in
special damages.  However, the general
and special damages figures add up to $5,015,046.48, not $5,016,869.52.  Plaintiff should revise the figures or
explain the discrepancy. 
In contrast to Plaintiff’s CIV-100 form, Plaintiff’s
JUD-100 form requests $10,015,046.48, including $5,000,000.00 in punitive
damages and $5,015,046.48 in damages.  Plaintiff should revise either the CIV-100 form, the JUD-100 form, or both to make them consistent with each other. 
Plaintiff has not provided evidence supporting an
award of $5,000,000.00 in general damages. 
Likewise, Plaintiff has not provided evidence
supporting an award of $5,000,000.00 in punitive damages.  Plaintiff has submitted no evidence of
Defendant's financial condition, which is a prerequisite to an award of
punitive damages on which Plaintiffs bear the burden of proof.  (See Del Junco v. Hufnagel (2007) 150
Cal.App.4th 789, 791 [reversing default judgment's punitive damage award
because record contained no proof of defendant's financial condition].)  The Court cannot grant the request for
punitive damages on this record. 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s application. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Michelle Lyons’s application
for default judgment filed on January 19, 2024. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
