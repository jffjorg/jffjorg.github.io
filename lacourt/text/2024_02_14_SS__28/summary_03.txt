The motion was opposed by Califa Investment LLC. The Court previously granted Califa's request for a protective order, limiting the deposition to Varsha's knowledge of the purchase and installation of the gate at the premises.

The Court continues the hearing and orders the parties to meet and confer on setting a new date and time for the deposition, and to file supplemental declarations if the deposition does not take place. The hearing is rescheduled for April 9, 2024.
