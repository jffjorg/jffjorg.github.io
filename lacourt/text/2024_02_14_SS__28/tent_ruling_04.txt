considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 29, 2021, Plaintiffs Pascual Velasquez and Ramon Velasquez filed this
action against Defendants Jerron D. Tatum and Does 1-100 for negligence
(automobile). 
On
May 5, 2023, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure sections 581, subdivision
(g), 583.401, 583.420, subdivision (a)(1), and California Rules of Court, rule
3.110(f). 
On
November 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the dismissal to be heard
on February 14, 2024. 
No trial date is currently scheduled. 
PARTIES’ REQUEST 
Plaintiffs
ask the Court to vacate the dismissal. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), provides
in part: 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve
a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the
judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. . . . Notwithstanding any
other requirements of this section, the court shall, whenever an application
for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is
in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting
to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting
default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which will result
in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment or dismissal
entered against his or her client, unless the court finds that the default or
dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect. The court shall, whenever relief is granted based on an
attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay reasonable
compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties. However, this
section shall not lengthen the time within which an action shall be brought to
trial pursuant to Section 583.310.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b), emphasis added.) 
DISCUSSION 
Citing
attorney fault, Plaintiffs seek an order vacating the May 5, 2023 dismissal under
the mandatory relief provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b).  In the alternative, Plaintiffs
ask the Court to vacate the dismissal under the statute’s discretionary relief
provision.  Plaintiffs assert that they
filed the motion within six months of the May 5, 2023 dismissal. 
For
purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, “six months” means 182
days.  (See Davis v. Thayer (1980)
113 Cal.App.3d 892, 903 (Davis) [“We therefore conclude that as employed
in section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure six months is the equivalent of
half a year and, under section 6803 of the Government Code, is the equivalent
of 182 days”]; see Gonzales v. County of Los Angeles (1988) 199
Cal.App.3d 601, 604-605; National Diversified Services, Inc. v. Bernstein
(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 410, 416.) 
The
Court dismissed the case on May 5, 2023. 
Plaintiff had 182 days – until November 3, 2023, a Friday – to file a
motion to vacate the dismissal. 
Plaintiffs filed the motion the following Monday, on November 6, 2023. 
The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the motion to vacate the May 5, 2023 dismissal filed by Plaintiffs
Pascual Velasquez and Ramon Velasquez. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
