 Case Number:  21STCV13224    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposing and reply papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 7, 2021, Plaintiff Yolanda Aguilar Murillo (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants Califa Investment LLC (“Califa”) and Does 1-50 for
general negligence and premises liability. 
On
October 4, 2022, Califa filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Moore
Family Trust, f/k/a Moore & Ellestad GST, LLC (“Trust”) and Roes 1-20 for
total indemnity, declaratory relief – implied partial indemnity, and express
indemnity. On January 6, 2023, Trust filed an answer. On June 7, 2023, the
Court struck the express indemnity claim against Trust from Califa’s cross-complaint
based on a stipulation by Califa and Trust. 
On
November 1, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant Trust as
Doe 1.  On December 4, 2023, Trust filed
an answer and a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Califa and Moes 1-20
for implied equitable indemnity, comparative contribution, and declaratory
relief. 
On
January 19, 2024, Trust filed a motion to compel the deposition of Alon Varsha (“Varsha”)
to be heard on February 14, 2024.  On
January 31, 2024, Califa filed an opposition.  On February 5, 2024, Trust filed a reply. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for August 21, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Trust
asks the Court to compel Varsha to appear for a deposition. 
Califa
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
DISCUSSION 
On
January 30, 2024, the Court granted Califa's request for a protective order and
ruled that Trust may take Varsha’s deposition subject to certain terms and
conditions.  The Court limited the deposition to Varsha’s
knowledge of the purchase and installation of the gate at the premises. 
Trust
has moved to compel Varsha’s deposition. 
In opposition, Califa asserts that Trust’s motion to compel Varsha’s deposition
is premature because Trust has not yet served a deposition notice on Varsha that
complies with the Court’s January 30, 2024 order and Califa has not refused to
produce Varsha for a deposition. 
Trust
responds that it served an amended deposition notice on Varsha on January 31,
2024, setting the deposition for February 12, 2024. 
The parties have not informed the Court if the deposition took place. 
The
Court continues the hearing and orders the parties to meet and confer on setting
a date and time for Varsha’s deposition if it has not yet taken place.  The parties will file supplemental
declarations if Varsha’s deposition does not take place before the continued
hearing date explaining the reasons for the delay and the parties’ efforts to
schedule the deposition.  If the deposition
takes place before the continued hearing date, Trust is ordered to take the matter
off calendar. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court CONTINUES Cross-Defendant Moore Family Trust, f/k/a Moore & Ellestad
GST, LLC’s motion to compel Alon Varsha’s deposition to April 9, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28 of the
Spring Street Courthouse.  If Alon Varsha’s
deposition has not taken place by April 5, 2024, the parties are ordered to
file declarations explaining the delay and their efforts to schedule the deposition.  If the deposition takes place before April 9,
2024, Cross-Defendant Moore Family Trust, f/k/a Moore & Ellestad GST, LLC
is ordered to take the April 9, 2024 hearing off calendar. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
