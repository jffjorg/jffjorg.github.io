 Case Number:  22STCV29641    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
reviewed the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
September 12, 2022, Plaintiff Kevin Desett (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Matt Construction Corporation (“Matt”), Window Installation
Specialists, Inc. (“Specialist”), Douglas Emmett 1995, LLC (“Emmett”), and Does
1-100 for general negligence and premises liability. 
On
November 14, 2022, Matt, Specialist, and Emmett filed an answer. 
Also
on November 14, 2022, Matt, Specialist, and Emmett filed separate cross-complaints
against Cross-Defendants Roes 1-50 for equitable indemnity, apportionment,
contribution, implied indemnity, and declaratory relief. 
On
January 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Matt’s further responses
to special interrogatories, set one, and for sanctions.  Matt has not filed an opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for February 18, 2025. 
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
A.      Informal Discovery Conference 
The
Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts
Effective October 10, 2022 (filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub
Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery
until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Discovery.” 
Plaintiff
scheduled and appeared for an IDC on November 22, 2023.  Defendant did not appear.  The Court took the IDC off calendar and ruled
that Plaintiff had satisfied his IDC obligation. 
B.       Timeliness
of motion 
A
notice of motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of
the service of the responses, or any supplemental responses, or on or before
any specific later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.290, subd, (c).) Failure to file a motion within this time period
constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses to requests for
admission. 
On January
10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Matt’s further responses to special
interrogatories, set one.  Matt has not
filed an opposition or disputed the timeliness of the motion. 
C.   Meet and
confer 
“A
motion to compel must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd.
(b)(2).)  “A meet and confer declaration
must state facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an informal resolution
of each issue presented by the motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
Plaintiff
has provided a meet and confer declaration. 
Matt has not filed an opposition or disputed the adequacy of Plaintiff’s
meet and confer efforts. 
D.      Separate statement 
With
exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is
warranted.  
Plaintiff
has filed a separate statement. 
APPLICABLE LAW 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides: 
“(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: 
“(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete. 
“(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate. 
“(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general. 
“(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. 
“(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter
7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. 
“(e) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
further response to interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.220 provides: 
“(a) Each answer in a response to interrogatories
shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably
available to the responding party permits. 
“(b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered
completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible. 
“(c) If the responding party does not have personal
knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so
state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith
effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations,
except where the information is equally available to the propounding party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220.)
