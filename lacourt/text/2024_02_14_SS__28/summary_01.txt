And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by Trucking, Inc. and Percy Maximo Rojas Huaraca. The motions were to continue or reopen discovery, to compel an independent medical examination of the plaintiff, and to impose sanctions.

The judge rules that the motion to continue or reopen discovery is moot because the trial date has been continued to August 30, 2024, and all trial-related deadlines have been extended to correspond to the new trial date.

The judge grants Trucking's motion to compel an independent medical examination of the plaintiff, Jessica Darlene Navarro, with Dr. Steven Dennis. The plaintiff had previously attended an independent medical examination with Dr. Nitin Bhatia, but the judge finds that the plaintiff did not cooperate during that examination and that the examination was incomplete. The judge also finds that the plaintiff waived any objections to the independent medical examination with Dr. Dennis by failing to object in a timely manner.

The judge orders the plaintiff to appear for an independent medical examination with Dr. Dennis within 30 days of the hearing on this motion, on a date to be set by Trucking, Inc. after consulting with counsel for the plaintiff.
