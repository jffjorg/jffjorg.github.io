English-text summary:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on a motion to quash deposition subpoenas served on City of Glendale—Glendale Fire Department, Glendale Adventist Emergency Physicians, and Health Net of California. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Jennifer Lynn Remenchik, who argues that the subpoenas violate her right to privacy and seek information that is not relevant to the case. The defendant argues that the subpoenas are necessary for discovery and that the court should balance the need for discovery against the plaintiff's privacy rights. The court concludes that the subpoenas are not overbroad and do not violate the plaintiff's privacy rights because they are limited in time to the date of the accident and afterward. The court therefore denies the motion to quash the subpoenas.
