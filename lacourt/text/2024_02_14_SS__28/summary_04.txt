And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to vacate the dismissal of the action filed by Pascual Velasquez and Ramon Velasquez. The action was initially filed on April 29, 2021, and was dismissed on May 5, 2023, without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the dismissal on November 6, 2023, citing attorney fault. The court finds that the plaintiffs did not file the motion within the six-month time limit, as they filed it on November 6, 2023, and the dismissal was on May 5, 2023, which would have given them until November 3, 2023, to file the motion. Therefore, the motion is denied.
