Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff FC Marketplace, LLC’s Application for
Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action arising from a loan agreement. In June 2022, Plaintiff
FC Marketplace, LLC (FC Marketplace) entered into a written loan agreement with
Defendant Glassman & Associates, Incorporated (Glassman & Associates)
in which FC Marketplace extended credit to Glassman & Associates. In
support of the agreement, Defendant Clifford Glassman executed a continuing
guaranty. In February 2023, FC Marketplace alleges Glassman & Associates
and Glassman (collectively, Glassman Defendants) defaulted on their payment
obligations and owe an outstanding principal sum of $39,770.01.
On September
12, 2023, FC Marketplace filed a complaint against the Glassman Defendants and
Does 1-100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of written
agreement, (2) breach of written guaranty, (3) foreclosure of commercial
security agreement, (4) money lent, (5) account stated, and (6) indebtedness.
On September 19, FC Marketplace’s process server served Glassman &
Associates with substitute service in Glendora. On September 21, FC
Marketplace’s process server personally served Glassman at the same address.
On November
13, 2023, default was entered against the Glassman Defendants. On November 29, FC
Marketplace submitted the present application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for February 14, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
FC
Marketplace seeks default judgment against the Glassman Defendants in the total
amount of $44,870.11, including $39,770.01 in damages, $2,931 in interest, $1,583.10
in attorney fees, and $586 in costs. Because the court finds FC Marketplace has
submitted sufficient evidence, the court GRANTS their application for
default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, FC
Marketplace’s application for default judgment is GRANTED.
