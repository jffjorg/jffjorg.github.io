LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Yamaha
seeks default judgment against Romero in the total amount of $29,716.54,
including $27,001.34 in damages, $910.20 in interest, $1,275 in attorney fees,
and $530 in costs. Because the court finds Yamaha has submitted sufficient
evidence, the court GRANTS their application for default judgment with
the following modification.
While
Yamaha requests $1,275 in attorney fees, the court finds reasonable attorney
fees are $1,200.04 pursuant to Local Rule 3.214. Accordingly, the court reduces
the awarded damages to $29,641.58.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Yamaha’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $29,641.58.
