A Hearing on the Motion for Preliminary Approval
of Class Action Settlement and Order to Show Cause Re: Complex Determination are
set for August 7, 2024.
Discussion

Plaintiff moves for an order granting preliminary approval
of the “Joint Stipulation of Class Action and PAGA Settlement” (“SA”).[2]
Preliminary Approval
Standard
California Rules of Court, rule 3.769 sets forth the
procedures for settlement of class actions in California. Approval occurs in
two steps: (1) an early “preliminary” review by the trial court; and (2) a
subsequent “final” review after notice of the settlement has been distributed
to class members for their comments and objections. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.769(c)-(g); Cellphone
Termination Fee Cases (2010) 180 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1118.)
“Any party to a settlement agreement may serve and file a
written notice of motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. The
settlement agreement and proposed notice to class members must be filed with
the motion, and the proposed order must be lodged with the motion.” (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.769(c).)
If the court grants preliminary approval of a settlement,
“its order must include the time, date, and place of the final approval
hearing; the notice to be given to the class; and any other matters deemed
necessary for the proper conduct of a settlement hearing. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.769(e).) “If the court has certified the action as a class action,
notice of the final approval hearing must be given to the class members in the
manner specified by the court. The notice must contain an explanation of the
proposed settlement and procedures for class members to follow in filing
written objections to it and in arranging to appear at the settlement hearing
and state any objections to the proposed settlement.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.769(f).)
The Settlement
Plaintiff filed the SA, which attaches proposed notice
documents as Exhibits A-C thereto. Plaintiff has also submitted a proposed
order.
The “Class” is defined as “all non-exempt employees of
Defendant at any time from April 9, 2016, through September 25, 2023.” (SA, ¶
1.4). “Class Member” is defined as “an individual who falls within the
definition of the Class.” (Id., ¶ 1.5). The “Class Period” is defined as
“the period from April 9, 2016 through September 25, 2023.” (Id., ¶
1.8).
The terms of the Settlement Agreement provide for
“Settlement Fund—Maximum” (“SF”) of $1,300,000.00 (not including the employer’s
share of payroll taxes). (Id., ¶ 1.34). The parties have agreed to the
following allocations to be paid from the SF:
1.              
A Net Settlement Payment (“NSP”), which is the SF, less
the Service Payment, 
Attorneys’ Fees, Litigation
Expenses, PAGA Payment and Settlement Administration Costs (Id., ¶
1.18). The estimated NSP is approximately $750,000.00. (Perlman Decl., ¶ 21).
2.              
A Service Payment of $10,000.00 to Raul Maldonado (“Maldonado”)
(SA, ¶¶ 1.31, 6.4);
3.              
Attorneys’ Fees of up to 35% of the SF (i.e.,
$455,000.00) (Id., ¶¶ 1.3, 7.1);
4.              
Litigation Expenses of up to $30,000.00 (Id., ¶¶
1.17, 7.1);
5.              
A PAGA payment of $50,000.00 (75% of which will be paid
to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency [“LWDA”] and 25% of
which will be paid to the “PAGA Group Members” [defined below][3]) (Id.,
¶¶ 1.25, 7.1);
6.              
Settlement Administration Costs of up to $15,000.00 (Id.,
¶ 1.32).
The SA calls for automatic payment to class members (i.e.,
no claim forms used, no reversion to Defendant). Each Class Member’s settlement
payment is calculated by dividing the NSP by the total number of Workweeks[4] worked
by all Participating Class Members (i.e., Class Members who do not opt out)
during the Class Period and multiplying the result by each Participating Class
Member’s Workweeks. (SA, ¶ 6.2(a).) The payment to each Class Member will be
apportioned as 33 1/3% wages for which each Class Member will be issued an IRS
Form W-2 and 66 2/3% penalties, interest and other non-wage payments for which
each Class Member will be issued an IRS Form 1099. (Id., ¶ 6.2(b).) Phoenix
Settlement Administrators (“Phoenix”) will deduct applicable taxes from the
wage portion of the settlement payment. (Id.)
Defendant has represented that, as of September 25, 2023,
there were 1,305 potential Class Members having a total of 76,919 Workweeks. (Id.,
¶ 8.12). If the final figures exceed 1,305 and/or 76,919 by more than 5%,
Defendant must either proportionately increase the SF or amend the class period
end date so as to align with the SF of $1,300,000.00. (Id.)
If 5% or more of the Class Members opt out of the
settlement, Defendant has the sole right to withdraw from and void this
settlement. (Id., ¶ 8.11).
Any Class Member who does not opt out is deemed to have
released Defendant of any and all federal and state law claims, whether known
or unknown, arising during the Class Period based on the allegations that were
asserted or could have been asserted in the operative complaint based on the
factual allegations contained therein. (Id., ¶ 10.1.) Maldonado makes an
additional general release. (Id., ¶ 10.2).
Class Members who wish to exclude themselves from the class
have the right to opt out from the settlement by mailing, faxing, or emailing a
written exclusion (containing specified information) from the settlement to
Phoenix no later than 45 calendar days after Phoenix mails the Notice [see
below] or by completing and timely returning the Request for Exclusion form
provided with the Class Notice. (Id., ¶¶ 8.4 and 8.6). Class Members who
do not opt out of the settlement may object to the settlement by mailing a
signed and dated written objection containing specified information to Phoenix
postmarked no later than 45 calendar days after Phoenix mails the Notice. (Id.,
¶ 8.4). Class Members may also appear at the Final Approval Hearing, either in
person or through a lawyer they retain at their own expense. (Id.) Any
checks issued will remain negotiable for 180 days from the date of mailing. (Id.,
¶ 9.4). If any checks are not cashed within 180 days they will be void and a
stop payment order may be placed on the check. (Id.) The funds
represented by all uncashed checks will be disbursed to the Legal Aid
Foundation of Los Angeles. (Id.)
Fairness, Adequacy and
Reasonableness
To prevent fraud, collusion or unfairness, a settlement or
dismissal of a class action, or of a cause of action in a class action, or as
to a party, requires court approval after hearing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rules 3.769(a),
3.770(a).)
A trial court must determine that the settlement is fair,
adequate and reasonable. (In re Microsoft
I-V Cases (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 706, 723.) “It is vested with a broad
discretion in making this determination. . . [t]he trial court operates under a
presumption of fairness when the settlement is the result of arm’s-length
negotiation, investigation and discovery that are sufficient to permit counsel
and the court to act intelligently, counsel are experienced in similar
litigation, and the percentage of objectors is small.” (Id.)
Here, the presumption of fairness applies. Plaintiff filed
the original complaint on April 9, 2020, the First Amended Complaint on July
16, 2020 and the Second Amended Complaint on January 25, 2021. (Perlman Decl.,
¶ 2)[5].
On July 14, 2021, following an exchange of employee data and
analysis thereof by Plaintiff’s expert, the parties participated in a mediation
session with Retired Judge Richard Stone (“Judge Stone”). (Id.). On
January 12, 2022, the parties participated in a second mediation session with
Judge Stone. (Id.). Judge Stone thereafter continued working with the
parties and eventually an agreement was reached, resulting in the SA. (Id.)
The SA was executed in March 2024. (Id.)
The terms of the SA also appear to be reasonable. The
settlement terms are set forth above.
Plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint filed on January 24, 2024
contains causes of action for:
(1)       Failure to provide meal periods and pay meal period premiums at
correct rates (Labor §§ 226.7, 512, 558); 
(2)       Failure to provide rest periods and pay rest period premiums at
correct rates (Labor Code §§ 226.7, 516); 
(3)       Failure to pay all wages due during employment, including
minimum wage and straight time (Labor Code §§ 1194, 1194.2, 1197); 
(4)       Failure to Pay Overtime (Labor Code §§ 204, 510, 558, 1194,
1198); 
(5)       Failure to pay all wages due upon separation from employment
(Labor Code §§ 201-203); 
(6)       Failure to provide accurate wage statements and maintain
accurate payroll records (Labor Code § 226 et seq.); 
(7)       Failure to Reimburse Necessary Business Expenses (Labor Code §§
2800 and 2802); 
(8)       Unfair and unlawful business practices (California Business
& Professions Code, § 17200 et seq.); and, 
(9)       Civil Penalties pursuant to the Labor Code Private Attorneys
General Act of 2004 (Cal. Labor Code, § 2698 et seq.). 
Plaintiff asserts that since at least April 9, 2016, Defendant
failed to (1) provide meal and rest periods, (2) pay all wages due during
employment, including minimum, straight time, and overtime wages, (3) pay all
wages due at separation from employment, (4) provide accurate wage statements
and maintain accurate payroll records and to (5) reimburse necessary business
expenses and committed unfair and unlawful business practices.
Defendant produced a 15% sample of class member time and
payroll data, as well as relevant policy documents for the class. (Id.,
¶ 8). Raosoft Sample Size Calculator (www.raosoft.com) indicates that a 15%
sample would provide a confidence level of 86% with a 5.43% margin of error. (Id.)
Plaintiff’s expert, Aaron Woolfson (“Woolfson”), summarized the relevant data
as follows:
Class Member
and Shift Data
(Extrapolated
from Sample)
 



Class Members:


1,305




Average hourly rate of pay:


$18.00

(Extrapolated

Total potential meal period violations:


206,016



 
Based on the above data of 206,016 violations x $18.00
(average hourly rate), Plaintiff’s counsel Douglas Perlman (“Perlman”)
represents that Plaintiff’s maximum potential damages on the meal period claims
is $3,708,288.00. (Id., ¶ 9). Perlman represents that Plaintiff’s
maximum potential damages on the rest period claims is $4,636,278.00. (Id.,
¶ 10). 
Perlman represents that Plaintiff’s Labor Code § 226 claim
is derivative of the other claims and that, based on the 76,919 workweeks
during the class period, which equates to approximately 38,459 paychecks, the
value would be approximately $3,845,900.00 (i.e., 38,459 x $100.00/paycheck),
subject to a reduction based upon the section 226 limitation to $4,000.00 per
employee. (Id., ¶ 13).
Perlman represents that Plaintiff’s Labor Code § 203 claim
is valued at $3,875,040.00 (i.e., 897 former employees[6] x 8
hours x $18.00/hour x 30 days). (Id, ¶ 14). He calculates Plaintiff’s
claim for failure to reimburse for necessary business expenses at $316,975.00
(i.e., 409 x $100.00 x 7.75 years). (Id., ¶ 15). He calculates maximum
potential PAGA penalties at $4,662,600.00, which figures assumes one violation
per pay period (i.e., 57 months in PAGA Period x 818 employee pay periods per
month x $100.00). (Id., ¶ 17).
Perlman represents that he has discounted the above maximum
estimated potential damages and penalties significantly, however, because of
Defendant’s defenses, the significant risks of proceeding and the discretionary
nature of the penalties. (Id., ¶ 17). Perlman represents that Defendant
has an enforceable arbitration agreement, which “mak[es] class certification
impossible without Defendant’s waiver of the agreement,” and that if the case
did not resolve as a class action but went to trial on the PAGA claims alone,
there would be numerous substantive issues present regarding the likelihood of
proving the merits of the various claims, including that Defendant does not
have a non-compliant meal and rest break policy (Id., ¶¶ 22-23).
Perlman represents that Defendant will argue that under Brinker
Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1004 (“Brinker”),
a Plaintiff must show that Defendant impeded, discouraged, or prohibited
employees from taking a proper break or otherwise failed to release them of all
control and that this involves an individualized inquiry. (Id., ¶ 23).
He also represents that there are substantial risks with Plaintiff’s rest break
claims, because while an employer must “authorize and permit” rest breaks, it
need not ensure they are taken, that there is no requirement that such breaks
be taken and that this likewise involves an individualized inquiry and reliance
on anecdotal evidence. (Id., ¶ 24).
Perlman represents that the “off the clock” claim is
partially based on the “donning and doffing” of uniforms, as well as rounding
and encouragement to work off the clock, and is based almost entirely on
anecdoctal evidence. (Id., ¶ 11). Perlman represents that the maximum
potential recovery for same would be essentially identical to the rest break
claim; however, he ascribes negligible value to both, based on obstacles of
certification and proof. (Id.) Perlman represents that damages analysis
for Plaintiff’s overtime claims is “extremely speculative” since such work is,
by definition, unrecorded, and that liability and damages would depend on
anecdotal evidence (and the possibility of expert analysis based on a survey).
(Id., ¶ 12). He ascribes minimal value to these claims. (Id.) Perlman
represents that Defendant will likely argue that off the clock and business
expense claims are problematic in the context of a class action or PAGA trial. (Id.,
¶¶ 25 and 26).
Perlman points out that Plaintiffs sections 203 and 226
claims are derivative of the meal and rest break claims and will thus fail if
the underlying claims fail. (Id., ¶ 27). He notes that, even if
Plaintiff is successful on the underlying claims, the derivative claims have
additional elements (i.e., “knowing and intentional” failure to comply for
section 226 and “willful” failure for section 203). (Id., ¶ 27). He notes
that Plaintiff’s PAGA claims are also derivative of the underlying claims and
present the above risks, plus the risk that a court has discretion to award
lesser amounts than the maximum penalty per section 2699. (Id., ¶ 28).
The gross settlement amount is approximately $995.00 per
class member, regardless of duration of employment (i.e., $1,300,000.00 divided
by 1,306 class members); the estimated net settlement amount is approximately
$574.00 per class member (i.e., $750,000.00 divided by 1,306 class members). (Id.,
¶ 21).
Notice
“If the court has certified the action as a class action,
notice of the final approval hearing must be given to the class members in the
manner specified by the court. The notice must contain an explanation of the
proposed settlement and procedures for class members to follow in filing
written objections to it and in arranging to appear at the settlement hearing
and state any objections to the proposed settlement.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.769(f); Litwin v. iRenew
Bio Energy Solutions, LLC (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 877, 883-884 [notice may
not require objectors to attend final approval hearing in order to have their
objections considered].) The form and content of the notice and the method used
to notify the class are within the trial court’s discretion. (Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001)
91 Cal.App.4th 224, disapproved of on other grounds by Hernandez v. Restoration Hardware, Inc. (2018) 4 Cal.5th
260.)
Class members are entitled to the best practical notice
under the circumstances. (Kass v. Young
(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 100, 106.) The purpose of the notice is to give class
members sufficient information to decide whether they should accept the
benefits offered, opt out and pursue their own remedies, or object to the
settlement. (Trotsky v. Los Angeles Fed.
Savings & Loan Assn. (1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 143, 151-152, disapproved of
on other grounds by Hernandez, supra,
4 Cal.5th 260.) The notice must advise class members “that they may be excluded
from the class if they so request and that they will be bound by the judgment,
whether favorable or not, if they do not request exclusion.” (Kass, supra, 67 Cal.App.3d at 106.) In a
case such as this involving a significant number of class members, California
authorities generally require service of the class notice by mail or similar
reliable means. (Chance v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 275, 290; Cartt v.
Superior Court (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 960, 972.)
The class notice is attached to the SA as Exhibit A (“Class
Notice”). The Class Notice contains a definition of the class as “All
individuals who were employed by FS Hotels LA, Inc., as non-exempt employees in
California at any time during the period from April 9, 2016, through
_________.” This definition must be amended to include the September 25,
2023 end date identified previously. (See SA, ¶ 1.4). The Class Notice
must also be amended to reflect Judge Peter A. Hernandez as the judicial
officer presiding over this case. The Class Notice contains all necessary
information, including a discussion of the litigation and the terms of the
settlement, the different options for responding to the notice, and a space
containing information about when and where the fairness hearing will be held.[7] Class
members are also informed about the attorneys’ fees and other deductions that
will be requested from the fund, and provided with the names and contact
information for Plaintiff’s counsel.
Defendants will provide Phoenix, within thirty (30) calendar
days following Preliminary Approval, all of the following information about
each Class Member: name, last known address (and email address, if available),
social security number and the number of workweeks worked during the Class
Period. (SA, ¶ 8.1).
Not later than fifteen (15) calendar days after Defendant
provides Phoenix with this information, Phoenix will send each Class Member the
Notice via U.S. Mail to the last known address of each Class Member and via
email to those Class Members for whom Defendant has an email address. (SA, ¶
8.2). Prior to mailing the Notice, Phoenix will run the last known addresses
and social security numbers of Class Members through the United States Postal
Service’s (“USPS”) National Change of Address database to verify a Class
Member’s address. (SA, ¶¶ 1.29 and 8.3). Phoenix will re-mail any Notices
returned by the USPS to Phoenix with a forwarding address for the recipient to
that updated address no later than the last day of the Notice Period. (Id.,
¶ 8.10). Phoenix will conduct a “skip trace” search for any Notice returned by
the USPS to Phoenix without a forwarding address; if a more current address is
found, Phoenix will promptly re-send the notice no later than the last day of
the Notice Period. (Id.) For those Class Members who are re-sent the
Notice, the Notice Period will be extended another twenty (20) calendar days
beyond the initial Notice Period. (Id.) Within five (5) business days
following the end of the extended twenty (20) calendar day period, Phoenix will
provide a final report of the number of Class Members who have objected to, or
requested to Opt Out of, the Settlement. (Id.).[8]
The court finds that both the method of disseminating the
notice packet and the content of the Class Notice are sufficient.
PAGA Settlement
Labor Code section 2699(l)(2) states, “[t]he superior
court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action filed
pursuant to this part. The proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency
at the same time that it is submitted to the court.” The court has
discretion to approve any penalty amount, even $0 (See Nordstrom Commission Cases (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 576, 589.)
A PAGA claim is a form of a qui tam action. (Iskanian v. CLS Transportation Los Angeles
LLC (2014) 59 Cal.4th 348, 382.) As such, the court looks to the standards
in evaluating a qui tam settlement in evaluating this settlement, i.e., that
the settlement is “fair, adequate, and reasonable.” (See Gov’t Code § 12652€(2)(B)
[In a qui tam action “[t]he state or political subdivision may settle the
action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the qui tam
plaintiff if the court determines, after a hearing providing the qui tam
plaintiff an opportunity to present evidence, that the proposed settlement is fair,
adequate, and reasonable under all of the circumstances”].) While PAGA actions
are distinct from class actions, the class action standard (fair, reasonable
and adequate settlement) is adopted for these reasons.
“[C]ivil penalties
recovered by aggrieved employees shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to
the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws,
including the administration of this part, and for education of employers and
employees about their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be
continuously appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the
agency for those purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees.” (Lab.
Code § 2699, subd. (i).)
The SA defines the term “PAGA Payment” as meaning:
            [T]he
payment in settlement of claims for civil penalties under the
Private Attorneys General Act
(‘PAGA’, Lab. Code,§ 2698, et seq.) in the 
amount of $50,000 from the
Settlement Fund - Maximum, subject to the 
approval. Pursuant to the PAGA, 75
percent of the PAGA payment will be 
paid to the California Labor and
Workforce Development Agency, and 25 
percent of the PAGA payment will be
paid to the PAGA Group Members. 
 
(SA, ¶ 1.25.)
As previously noted, this number was reached after
good-faith negotiation. (Perlman Decl., ¶ 2.)
The amount to be paid to the LWDA here, i.e., $37,500.00, is
2.8% of the gross settlement amount. (Id., ¶ 29).
The court finds this settlement amount for PAGA is
substantial and fair. Further, the PAGA penalties as a percentage of the
settlement range is consistent with other hybrid class/PAGA settlements
approved by California courts. (Nordstrom
Commission Cases, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th at 579 [“trial court did not abuse
its discretion in approving a settlement which does not allocate any damages to
the PAGA claims”].)
Enhancements
Enhancement payments “are fairly typical in class action
cases.” (Cellphone Termination Fee Cases,
supra, 186 Cal.App.4th at 1393 [affirming incentive awards of $10,000]; Rodriguez v. West Publishing Corp. (9th
Cir. 2009) 563 F.3d 948, 958.) Enhancement payments “are intended to compensate
class representatives for work done on behalf of the class, to make up for
financial or reputational risk undertaken in bringing the action, and,
sometimes, to recognize their willingness to act as a private attorney
general.” (Id. at 958-959.)
“[T]he rationale for making enhancement or incentive awards
to named plaintiffs is that he or she should be compensated for the expense or
risk he has incurred in conferring a benefit on other members of the class.” (Clark v. American Residential Services LLC
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 785, 806.)
Here, Plaintiff requests $10,000.00 for his service in the
action and in exchange for his general release of all claims. (Perlman Decl., ¶¶
32-33; SA, ¶ 6.4; see Maldonado Decl.) Maldonado represents that he has spent
in excess of 100 hours participating in this case, including speaking with and
meeting with his attorneys, searching for and reviewing documents, preparing
for and appearing at two sessions of his deposition, helping his attorneys
prepare for mediation, making himself available for both sessions of mediation,
and discussing the settlement with his attorneys. (Maldonado Decl., ¶ 9).
Maldonado also believes he took on a significant professional risk by agreeing
to be the Named Plaintiff in this case, as knowledge learned by subsequent
employers of the litigation could jeopardize his prospective employment. (Id.,
¶ 10).
The court believes that this payment is fair and reasonable
compensation for Maldonado’s efforts.
Attorneys’ Fees
California Rules of Court, rule 3.769(b) provides: “Any
agreement, express or implied, that has been entered into with respect to the
payment of attorney’s fees or the submission of an application for the approval
of attorney’s fees must be set forth in full in any application for approval of
the dismissal or settlement of an action that has been certified as a class
action.” An award of attorney’s fees is made by the court at the fairness
hearing. (Lafitte v. Robert Half Intern.,
Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480.) Despite any agreement by the parties
to the contrary, “the court ha[s] an independent right and responsibility to
review the attorney fee provision of the settlement agreement and award only so
much as it determine[s] reasonable.” (Garabedian
v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 123, 128.)
Accordingly, the question of whether class counsel is
entitled to fees will be addressed at the fairness hearing when class counsel
brings a noticed motion for attorney fees. With the motion, counsel must
provide an overall summary of the time spent by each attorney or paralegal who
worked on this matter. (Lafitte, supra, 1 Cal.5th at 505 [“[t]he trial
court in the present case exercised its discretion in this matter, performing
the cross-check using counsel declarations summarizing overall time spent,
rather than demanding and scrutinizing daily time sheets in which the work performed
was broken down by individual task”].)
Furthermore, any agreement about how attorney fees will be
paid, including fee splitting and whether the client has given written
approval, should be provided. (Mark v.
Spencer (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 219; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.769.)
Counsel should also be prepared to justify any costs sought
by detailing how such costs were incurred.
Certification
A precertification settlement may stipulate that a defined
class be conditionally certified for settlement purposes. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.769(d); Weil & Brown, CAL. PRAC. GUIDE: CIV. PRO. BEFORE TRIAL (The
Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 14:139.1.)
Before the court may approve the settlement, the settlement
class must satisfy the normal prerequisites for a class action. (Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor (1997)
521 U.S. 591, 625-627.) “The party advocating class treatment must demonstrate
the existence of an ascertainable and sufficiently numerous class, a
well-defined community of interest, and substantial benefits from certification
that render proceeding as a class superior to the alternatives.” (Brinker Restaurant Corp., supra, 53 Cal.4th at 1021; see Code
Civ. Proc. § 382.)
A class is ascertainable when members “may be readily
identified without unreasonable expense or time by reference to official [or
business] records.” (Sevidal v. Target
Corp. (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 905, 919.) Based on this proposed settlement
class definition, the proposed class can be ascertained from Defendant’s
personnel and employment records, which reveal a class size of approximately 1,306
members. (Perlman Decl., ¶ 19). Thus, the ascertainable and numerosity
requirements are satisfied.
“[T]he community of interest requirement embodies three
factors: (1) predominant common questions of law or fact; (2) class
representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class; and (3) class
representatives who can adequately represent the class.” (Brinker Restaurant Corp., supra, 53 Cal.4th at 1021.) Where the
defendant systematically engages in policies and practices that allegedly
violate the Labor Code and thereby subjects all of its employees to the same
unlawful conduct, common questions of law and fact will predominate over
individualized issues. (Id. at
1032-1034 [“[t]he theory of liability—that Brinker has a uniform policy, and
that that policy, measured against wage order requirements, allegedly violates
the law—is by its nature a common question eminently suited for class
treatment”].)
This case is a typical wage and hour violation suit with a
clearly identified class through Defendant’s records. The statutes relating to Maldonado’s
claims apply with equal force and effect to all Class Members. Maldonado contends
that Defendants’ policies and practices apply class-wide Defendant’s liability
can be determined by facts common to all members of the class. Maldonado is a
former employee of Defendant and was employed in California as a non-exempt
employee during part of the relevant time period. (Maldonado Decl., ¶ 2).
Maldonado has the same claims as those that the members of the Settlement Class
would reasonably be expected to bring based on the course of conduct alleged
herein. (Id., ¶¶ 5-7). Accordingly, certification for the class as
defined in the settlement agreement is appropriate.
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval of the SA is
granted. A final approval hearing is scheduled for
