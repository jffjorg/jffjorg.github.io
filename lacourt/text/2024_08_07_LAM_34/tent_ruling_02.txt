[1]              The motion was filed (and
electronically served) on March 25, 2024 and originally set for hearing on May
13, 2024. On April 25, 2024, the court continued the May 13, 2024 scheduled
hearing to June 12, 2024; notice was provided to counsel. On May 30, 2024, the
court continued the June 12, 2024 scheduled hearing to July 9, 2024; notice was
provided to counsel. On July 2, 2024, the court continued the July 9, 2024
scheduled hearing to August 2, 2024; notice was provided to counsel. On July
12, 2024, the court continued the August 2, 2024 scheduled hearing to August 7,
2024; notice was provided to counsel.
[2]              The notice of motion is somewhat
defective, in that it merely asks the court to grant preliminary approval of
the “Joint Stipulation of Class Action [and PAGA] Settlement” (Joint Stipulation).
The proposed order submitted concurrently therewith reflects that Plaintiff
also seeks: (1) conditional certification of the following settlement class for
settlement purposes only: “All non-exempt employees of FS Hotels LA, Inc., in
California at any time from April 9, 2016, through September 25, 2023,” (2) an
appointment of Raul Maldonado as Class Representative, (3) an appointment of
Rastegar Law Group, APC, as Class Counsel, (4) an appointment of Phoenix
Settlement Administrators as Settlement Administrator, (5) approval of the
proposed notice to be provided, (6) approval of the proposed deadlines for the
notice and settlement administration process and (7) the scheduling of a final
fairness and approval hearing. These provisions are addressed in the Joint
Stipulation.


[3]              The SA was filed March 25, 2024.
Labor Code § 2699 was subsequently amended, effective July 1, 2024, to include,
inter alia, a 65/35 split of civil penalties between the LWDA and
aggrieved employees; however, subsection (v)(1) expressly provides that “. . .
the amendments made to this section by the act adding this subdivision shall
apply to a civil action brought on or after June 19, 2024.” The court’s
references to Labor Code § 2699 herein, then, pertains to that version
effective June 27, 2016. 


[4]              The term “Workweek” is defined as
“any week during which a Class or PAGA Group Member worked for Defendant for at
least one day during the Class or PAGA Period.” (SA, ¶ 1.37).


[5]              The SA provides for the filing of
the Third Amended Complaint, including class action allegations, and was filed
on January 24, 2024. (Id.)


[6]              This is calculated by taking the
1,306 number of Class Members subtracting 409, which is the approximation of
persons employed by Defendant at any given time. (Id.)


[7]              The Class Notice must be amended,
of course, to include the date, time and location of the fairness hearing once
set by the court.


[8]              Members of the PAGA group may not
opt out of the PAGA settlement and will receive their proportionate shares of
the PAGA settlement regardless of whether they Opt-Out or object to the Class
Settlement. (Id.)
