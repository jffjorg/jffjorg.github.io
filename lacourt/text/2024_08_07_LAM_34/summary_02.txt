And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has been considering a motion for preliminary approval of a class action settlement agreement. The motion was filed on March 25, 2024, and has been continued several times. The proposed settlement agreement includes requests for conditional certification of a class of non-exempt employees, appointment of a class representative and class counsel, and approval of a notice to be provided to class members. The court notes that the notice of motion is somewhat defective, as it only requests preliminary approval of the settlement agreement, but the proposed order reflects additional requests by the plaintiff. The court will provide further guidance on the Class Notice, which must be amended to include the date, time, and location of the fairness hearing once set by the court. The court will also consider the impact of recent amendments to Labor Code ยง 2699 on the settlement agreement.
