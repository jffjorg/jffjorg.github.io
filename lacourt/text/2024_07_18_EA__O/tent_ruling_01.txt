MOTION TO
COMPEL NON-PARTY COMPLIANCE WITH SUBPOENA AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS; MEMORANDUM
OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES is GRANTED, but attorney fees are reduced

Background
 
This case
arises from a joint venture. Plaintiff Jose Medina alleges the following
against Defendants JOSE BONILLA (“Bonilla”), an individual; JJMG, INC., a
California Corporation; MEXICO LINDO RESTAURANT, a business organization, form
unknown; and GLORIA BONILLA (“Gloria”): In 2017, Plaintiff and Bonilla entered
into a joint venture for the operation of a restaurant. Plaintiff contributed
$80,000.00 towards the restaurant and Bonilla borrowed $10,000.00 from
Plaintiff for the same. In 2022, four years after the restaurant began its
operation, Bonilla sought to remove Plaintiff from the partnership. 
 
On September
1, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants asserting the following causes
of action (COAs): 1.     Accounting 2.     Damages For Breach Of Fiduciary Duty 3.     Damages For Intentional
Misrepresentation 4.     Damages For Breach Of Contract 5.     Damages For Promissory Estoppel 6.     Dissolution Of Partnership
 
On November
29, 2022, Bonilla, Gloria, and JJMG Inc. dba Mexico Lindo Restaurant (collectively,
“Defendants”) filed their answer. That same day, Defendants filed a
cross-complaint and a first amended cross complaint (1ACC) against Plaintiff
for:
 
1.     Interference with Economic Advantage 
2.     Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress
 
On December
29, 2022, Plaintiff filed his answer to the 1ACC.
 
On April 29,
2022, the court held a ‘Status Conference Re: Mandatory Settlement
Conference/Trial Setting.’ The minute order indicates that the matter did not
settle during mediation and that “Parties inform the Court that discovery is
not yet completed.”
 
On May 8,
2024, Plaintiff filed an IDC statement. Note: the docket indicates that the
‘court allowed the date of 7/18/24 for 1 motion to compel to be heard.’
 
On May 22,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion.
 
Legal
Standard
 
The scope of
discovery is set by the pleadings, in that for information to be discoverable,
it must be relevant to the subject matter, and reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of relevant, admissible information. (Code of Civ. Proc.
2017.010.) “The scope of discovery is one of reason, logic, and common
sense.” (Lipton v. Sup. Ct. (1996) 48 Cal. App. 4th 1599, 1612,
quoting Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before
Trial, supra, at ¶ 8:67, p. 8C–2, italics in original.) Pursuant
to CCP section 1987.1 and C.C.P. § 2025.480, the court, upon a proper showing,
is authorized to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena and order the
witness to produce the documents requested in the deposition subpoena. (Motion
p. 4.)[1]
A subpoena for the production of business
records need not be accompanied by an affidavit
or declaration showing good cause for production of the records. (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2020.410, subd. (c).)   
 
Like other
type of discovery, if objections are not timely made, the responding party
waives such objections. (Monarch Health Care v. Superior Court (2000) 78
Cal. App. 4th 1282, 1288 [The protection of information from discovery on the
ground that it is privileged ... is waived unless a specific objection to its
disclosure is timely made . . .”]; See also C.C.P. § 2025.460.) 
 
Lastly, as
for attorney fees, monetary sanctions (as well
as contempt) are available against nonparties who “flout the discovery
process.” (Temple Community Hospital v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th
464, 476.) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff
seeks to conduct discovery on the financial issues presented by the parties’
dispute. 
 
On February
29, 2024, non-party Enrrique Paiz operating as and custodian of records of APG
Accounting & Bookkeeping (“Deponent”) was served with a subpoena for
production of business records. Documents pursuant to the subpoena were
required to be served no later than April 1, 2024. However, Deponent did not
contact Counsel regarding this matter; did not request an extension to comply;
did not provide a custodian of records affidavit attesting that no documents
existed; did not respond to Counsel’s attempt on April 5, 2024 to gain
compliance; nor responded to April 23, 2023 efforts to resolve the matter. 
 
To the extent
there are defects in form or content of the
subpoena, defects in service of
the subpoena, or defects with the scope of discovery, the burden is usually on the person seeking to prevent
disclosure to show grounds to quash or for a protective order, but no such
objection has been made. 
 
Attorney Fees
 
As for attorney fees, Counsel seeks $1,600 (1.5 hours drafting motion
and seeking resolution with Deponent; 2.5 hours anticipated in attending
hearing at $400/hour). Utilizing
a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the
court reduces the anticipated hours attending the hearing from 2.5 hours to .5
hours for total fees and costs of $800 which are properly ordered to be paid by
Enrrique Paiz operating as and custodian of records of APG Accounting &
Bookkeeping [calculated as follows: 2 hours (1.5 hours (motion and meet and
confer efforts) + .5 hours (attending hearing) at $400/hour]. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the motion is granted, and attorney fees are awarded in a reduced
amount.[2]
