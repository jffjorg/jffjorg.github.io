[1] Where the witness whose deposition is sought
is not a party (or a “party-affiliated” witness),
a subpoena must
be served to compel the witness' attendance and testimony (“testimony only”
subpoena), production of business records for copying (“business records”
subpoena); or attendance and testimony of the deponent, and the production of business records (“records and testimony” subpoena”). (Code of Civ. Proc.,
sections 2020.010(b), 2025.280(b); Terry v. SLICO (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th
352, 357.) At issue here, is the business records subpoena.
