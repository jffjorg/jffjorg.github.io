  Case Number:  22STCV18567    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling:
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Jerry Davidson’s Motion for an Order Terminating the Stay Order Imposed in Related
Unlawful Detainer Action
            Defendant/cross-complainant
Jerry Davidson moves to lift the stay in the related unlawful detainer
action, Jerry Davidson v. Wesley
Fisher, et al., case No.
22CHUD00349.  On August 22, 2022, the
court issued an order finding this civil action related to the unlawful
detainer action and staying the unlawful detainer action so that the issue of
title to the subject property could be tried in the civil action.  The civil action was tried in October 2024.  In its statement of decision issued November
22, 2024, the court decided the issue of title, ruling David Abbasi is the
legal owner of the subject property.  The
stay of the unlawful detainer action has ended. 
Jerry Davidson’s motion to lift the stay of the unlawful detainer action
is therefore moot.
