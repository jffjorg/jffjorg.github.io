And here is the summary in English text:

The Honorable Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 23STCV23291, where Plaintiff Fernando A. Silva Quintana moves for discovery sanctions against Defendant Guardian Eagle Security, Inc. (Guardian). The Judge finds that Guardian disobeyed the court's orders compelling discovery responses and failed to pay monetary sanctions. The Judge concludes that terminating sanctions are appropriate, as Guardian's misuse of the discovery process has prevented the Plaintiff from conducting any discovery and has led to a trial by surprise. The Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion and strikes Guardian's answer, entering its default.
