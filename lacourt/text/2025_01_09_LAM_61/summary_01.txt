And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to approve a proposed PAGA (Private Attorney General Act) settlement is granted. The settlement is between plaintiff Keith Luper and defendants Dr. Horton, Inc. and Diane Simmons. The settlement amount is $45,000, with $10,000 going towards attorney fees and costs, and the remaining $28,500 to be distributed between the California Labor Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and aggrieved employees. The judge finds that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate in view of PAGA's purposes, and that the attorney fees are reasonable given the strength and complexity of the claims. The judge notes that the settlement amount furthers the purposes of PAGA, which is to remediate present labor law violations, deter future ones, and maximize enforcement of state labor laws.
