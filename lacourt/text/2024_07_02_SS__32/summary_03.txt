And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Frankie Lane's motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, set two, and form interrogatories, set two, as moot since responses have been served. The Court finds that Defendant Raman Dlamini's counsel received the discovery requests, but they went to her spam folder. Although Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions, the Court declines to award them due to the uncertainty surrounding whether Defendant's counsel received actual notice of the underlying discovery.
