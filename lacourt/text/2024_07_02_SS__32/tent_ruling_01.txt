TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


July
  2, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


20STCV49330




MOTIONS:  


Compel
  Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Ruslana Kozmech   




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  Hughes Markets, Inc.    



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Ruslana Kozmech (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel further responses
to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One from Defendant Hughes Markets,
Inc. dba Ralphs (“Defendant”). Defendant opposes. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(a) provides that
on receipt of a response to a request for production of documents, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further responses if:¿ 
¿ 
(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.¿ 
(2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive.¿ 
(3) An objection in the response is without merit or too
general.¿¿  
 
“Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the demand.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(c).)¿¿The Court lacks jurisdiction if the motion is filed after this
time period. ¿(Sexton v. Superior Court¿(1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403,
1410.) 
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310 (h).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Plaintiff served Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One on Defendant on September 1, 2023. (McElfish Decl., Exh. A.) On
November 27, 2023, Defendant served initial responses. (McElfish Decl., Exh.
B.) On January 26, 2024, Defendant served further responses. (McElfish Decl.,
Exh D.) On February 7, 2024, Defendant served verifications to the further
responses via email. (McElfish Decl., Exh. F.)
 
Plaintiff
now moves to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One.
 
 If a discovery set has a mix of responses and
objections, the 45 days for a motion to compel further begins running once the
verifications are served (even if the discovery at issue are purely
objections). (See Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022)
84 Cal.App.5th 127, 136 [discussing the 45-day time period for motions to
compel further interrogatories under section 2030.300].) If served
electronically, the deadline is increased by two court days. (See Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 2016.050.)
 
Therefore,
this motion needed to be filed by March 26, 2024 (45 days after the
verification on February 7, 2024, plus two court days). Because the motion was
filed on March 26, 2024, it is timely.[1] 
 
In
Defendant’s opposition, it appears that the parties have subsequently met and
conferred and possibly resolved the issues. To the extent that the issues are
not resolved, the parties are ordered to prepare a joint status report,
indicating which specific discovery requests remain in dispute, and the
parties’ respective positions regarding the request. The joint status report
must be filed with the Court 5 days in advance of a continued IDC, with a courtesy
copy delivered to the Court by 4:00 p.m. Plaintiff, as the moving party, is to
file the joint status report.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
The hearing on the motion to compel further discovery responses is
continued to August 12, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.
 
The matter is set for an informal discovery conference on July 29,
2024 at 11:00 a.m. in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse. All
counsel are ordered to appear personally. 
 
Plaintiff
to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
