Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel compliance with deposition subpoenas issued by the defendants to Kaiser Foundation Hospitals/Southern California Permanente Medical Group (Kaiser) seeking medical and billing records related to the plaintiff, Daniel Mariscal, who was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The defendants argue that the subpoenas must be limited by body part to prevent them from being overbroad and subject to the plaintiff's objection. Kaiser, however, contends that it is incapable of producing the documents by body part and suggests alternative methods, such as sorting by date range, department type, or medical provider. The Judge grants the motion in part, ordering Kaiser to produce all records relating to the plaintiff to counsel for both parties, limited by date range. The Judge also declines to award sanctions, finding that the motion was opposed in good faith.
