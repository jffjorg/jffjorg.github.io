And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendants' motion to disapprove Prashant-appointed counsel (Mr. Liu) and to appoint Hari S. Lal as counsel for the Govind parties. The judge finds that the defendants' papers are largely indecipherable and that they are attempting to undo the court's prior ruling granting the Prashant defendants' motion to enforce settlement. The judge notes that the Prashant parties have the power to appoint counsel for the Govind parties under the settlement agreement and that there is no indication that they intend to appoint Mr. Lal as counsel.
