filed a complaint against Adrian Banuelos; Imperial Xtreme, Inc. (aka Imperial
Xtreme Builders); Imperial Xtreme Builders, Inc.; Elizabeth Banuelos; Gd
Construction Group, Inc., A California Corporation; Dillon Reggie; and Does
1-50 (collectively, “Defendants”) for a defective construction job. Plaintiffs

(9) Unjust Enrichment; (10) Statutory Violation Of Business & Professions
Code §§7025-7034; and (11) Unfair Business Practices. (Complaint p.1)
 
            On August 24, 2023, the
Court scheduled the OSC re: entry of default judgment to December 15, 2023 at
8:30 am. On October 30, 2023, the case was reassigned from Judge Salkin to
Judge Harmon. On December 4, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the default judgment
application. 
 
Analysis:
 
The governing rule is CRC Rule 3.1800 which lays
out the requirements for default judgments. In pertinent part, the rule
dictates that a party must use form CIV-100 and file the following documents
with the clerk: (1) Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the
case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's claim; (2)
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested;
(3) Interest computations as necessary; (4) A memorandum of costs and
disbursements; (5) A declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant
against whom judgment is sought; (6) A proposed form of judgment;
(7) A dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) Exhibits as necessary; and
(9) A request for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties.
 
                         
(1) Except in unlawful detainer cases, a brief
summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of plaintiff's
claim; 
 
Here, Plaintiffs did not include a separate
statement with a brief summary identifying the parties and nature of the
plaintiffs’ claims. However, they did provide information in the Declarations.
(Dec. Fair ¶1-24; Dec. Lake ¶1-24.)
 
(2) Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; 
 
Here, Plaintiffs provided David Lake’s
Declaration and Kelly Fair’s Declaration in support of the request for entry
for default judgment. Thus, this requirement is satisfied. 
 
(3) Interest computations as necessary; 
 
“A person who is entitled to recover damages
certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation, and the right to
recover which is vested in the person upon a particular day, is entitled also
to recover interest thereon from that day, except when the debtor is prevented
by law, or by the act of the creditor from paying the debt.” (Civ. Code, §
3287, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs seek $103,094.18 in judgment in
the CIV-100 form, Declarations, and JUD-100 form. (CIV-100 form Item 2(f);
JUD-100 form Item 6; Dec. Fair ¶27; Dec. Lake ¶27.) 
 
“If a contract entered into after January 1,
1986, does not stipulate a legal rate of interest, the obligation shall bear
interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum after a breach. [¶] 
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ attorney provided interest
computations of 10%. (Dec. Lake ¶23.)
 
“Damages are certain or capable of being made
certain by calculation, or ascertainable, for purposes of the statute if the
defendant actually knows the amount of damages or could calculate that amount
from information reasonably available to the defendant.” (Collins v. City of
Los Angeles (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 140, 150–151.)
 
Here, the accrual date that Plaintiff relies upon
is the anticipated date of judgment, December 1, 2023. (Dec. Fair ¶23.) 
 
The test for determining certainty under section
3287(a) is whether the defendant knew the amount of damages owed to the
claimant or could have computed that amount from reasonably available
information. (Code of Civil Procedure 3287 (a).) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs calculate their principal based
on the $72,747.87 they paid Defendants. (Dec. Lake ¶22-23; Exhibit E
Spreadsheet.) Plaintiffs argue that Defendants violated Business
& Professions Code sections 7025-7034, 7114, and 7125.2. (Dec. Lake ¶22.)
Thus, Defendants must disgorge all of the compensation they received from
Plaintiffs ($72,747.87) pursuant to Business & Professions Code sections
7025-7034, 7114, and 7125.2 (the “Disgorgement Sum”). The total interest amount
so far amounts to $6,754.11. (Id.) For a total of $79,501.98. (Dec. Lake ¶22-23; Exhibit E Spreadsheet.)

(4) A memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
 
Here, Plaintiffs provided a Memorandum of Costs
in the CIV-100 form. (CIV-100 Item 7.)
(5) A declaration of nonmilitary status for
each defendant against whom judgment is sought; 
 
Here, Plaintiffs provided a declaration in
CIV-100. (CIV-100 Item 8(a).)
 
(6) A proposed form of judgment;
 
Here, Plaintiff provided a JUD-100. 
 
(7) A dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against
specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a
showing of grounds for each judgment; 
 
Here, Plaintiff dismissed DOES on December 4,
2023. 
 
(8) Exhibits as necessary; 
 
Here, Plaintiff included exhibits. 
 
(9) A request for attorney fees if allowed
by statute or by the agreement of the parties.
 
                        Attorney Fees
are only available if allowed by statute or agreement.  (CRC
3.1800(a)(9).)  A request for attorney fees must be accompanied by a
declaration stating that the fees were calculated in accordance with the fee
schedule as per Local Rule 3.214. Where a request for attorney fees is
based on a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited. 
(Local Rule 3.207.) 
            Code of Civil Procedure
section 1029.8 states that “[a]ny unlicensed person who causes injury or damage
to another person as a result of providing goods or performing services for
which a license is required under … Division 3 (commencing with Section 5000) …
of the Business and Professions Code … shall be liable to the injured person
for treble the amount of damages assessed in a civil action in any court having
proper jurisdiction. … The additional damages provided for in subdivision (a)
shall not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000).” 
 
            Here, Plaintiff seeks
attorneys’ fees in the amount of $1,890 against Defendants. Additionally,
pursuant to 102.98, request $10,000.00, which is the limit imposed by Code of
Civil Procedure section 1029.8 as to treble damages. (Dec. Lake ¶26-27.)

judgment application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
