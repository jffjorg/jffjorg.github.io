And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' default judgment application, which was filed on December 4, 2023. The Judge found that the application was valid in all respects except that the Plaintiffs failed to file a brief summary of the case as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800(a)(1). The Judge has denied the application without prejudice, meaning that the Plaintiffs can re-file the application with a brief summary of the case. The Judge's ruling does not affect the merits of the case, and the Plaintiffs will need to re-file the application to seek a default judgment.
