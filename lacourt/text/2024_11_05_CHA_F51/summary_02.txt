And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to file the amended complaint to clarify the factual basis of her claims, which involve a contract dispute related to a promissory note. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the plaintiff has unreasonably delayed and that the proposed amendments will cause prejudice. However, the judge finds that the defendant will not be prejudiced by the proposed amendments, and that the claims relate back to those made in the original complaint. The judge is granting the motion because the plaintiff has provided sufficient justification for the amendment and because the court has a liberal policy on granting leave to amend.
