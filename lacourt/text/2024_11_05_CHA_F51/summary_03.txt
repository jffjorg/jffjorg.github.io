And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to enforce a stipulated settlement between the parties. The motion was filed on August 22, 2024, and the plaintiff filed an opposition on October 22, 2024. The defendants failed to file a reply to the opposition. The judge found that no enforceable settlement agreement was entered into, as the parties continued their settlement negotiations for months after the alleged agreement. The judge cited California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, which requires a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court. The judge concluded that no such writing exists, and therefore denied the motion to enforce the settlement as premature. The judge also reminded the plaintiff to review the court's rules regarding electronic filing, as the plaintiff had failed to comply with these rules in the past.
