Plaintiff is reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended
General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing
documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set
forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First
Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly bookmarking
declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply with these
requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected, matters being
placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be resubmitted in
compliance with these requirements, documents not being considered and/or the
imposition of sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is
wrongful eviction action in which Plaintiff alleges that she, “her two minor
children, and one adult child have resided at 28700 Newhall Ranch Rd., Room
103, Santa Clarita, CA 91355 (hereinafter, ‘the unit’) for more than eighteen
(18) months.” (Compl. ¶ 8.) Defendant Prince Hospitality LLC owns and operates
the subject property, and defendant Lawrence Barr is employed by Prince
Hospitality. (Id. at ¶¶ 3–4, 7.) Plaintiff alleges that on 6/16/23 and
6/22/23, she was unlawfully locked out of her unit, with her personal property
removed therefrom. (Id. at ¶¶ 9–17.)
 
On 7/13/23,
Plaintiff filed her complaint against Defendants, alleging the following causes
of action: (1) Landlord Self Help; (2) Breach of Implied Covenant of Quiet
Enjoyment; (3) Wrongful/Constructive Eviction; (4) Conversion; (5) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress; and (6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress.
 
On 8/22/24,
Defendants filed the instant motion. On 10/22/24, Plaintiff filed her
opposition. No reply has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6, subd. (a).) 
 
In determining a motion to enforce a settlement under
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, the court seeks to determine whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement of all or part of the case.
(In re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 905.) “To do so it may receive oral testimony in addition to
declarations. If the same judge presides over both the settlement and the
section 664.6 hearing, he may avail himself of the benefit of his own
recollection.” (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530,
1533.)
 
Here, Defendants argue that “on March 12, 2024, Plaintiff authorized a dismissal with prejudice
through her attorney, Isaiah Feldman-Schwartz, Esq., in exchange for waiving
costs and the over $30,000 in unpaid room charges that Plaintiff owes to the
hotel. … On March 20, 2024, Defendants accepted Plaintiff’s settlement offer,
and Plaintiff’s counsel, Feldman-Schwartz, Esq., responded affirmatively.”
(Defs.’ Mot. 1:4–7, citing Ex. 1 to Defs.’ RJN.)
 
Plaintiff argues in opposition that no enforceable settlement
agreement was entered into, because the parties continued their settlement
negotiations for months following the above email exchange. (Pl.’s Opp. 3:2–5
[“The parties were in settlement negotiations for many months, but they never
reached a final mutually agreed upon settlement agreement. No enforceable or
formal agreement was ever formed or signed by Ms. Johnson.”]; Exs. A–J to Pl.’s
Opp.) The Court notes that Defendants have failed to file any reply to
Plaintiff’s opposition.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that no “writing
signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the
court” exists over which the Court has jurisdiction to enforce the terms
therein. (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6, subd. (a).) Accordingly, the Court denies
the instant motion to enforce settlement as premature.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion
is denied.
