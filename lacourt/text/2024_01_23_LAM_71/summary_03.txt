English-text summary:

The Judge grants plaintiff Daisy Segura-Campos' motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. The motion is granted because the Court has the discretion to allow amendments to pleadings in furtherance of justice, and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the defendants. The plaintiff seeks to add new claims and allegations to the complaint, including claims of sexual harassment, failure to prevent harassment, retaliation, and wrongful termination. The deposition of HR Manager Daysi Bellamy has revealed new information that the plaintiff seeks to include in the amended complaint. The defendants argue that the motion will prejudice them and require extensive discovery and delay, but the Court finds that the policy favoring amendment is strong and that denial of leave to amend can rarely be justified.
