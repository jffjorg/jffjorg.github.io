Defendants HDR Washington,
LLC’s, Creative Properties, LLC’s, and Bob Halavi’s motion for summary judgment
is granted.  
 
Defendants HDR Washington, LLC (“HDR”), Creative
Properties, LLC (“Creative”), and Bob Halavi (“Halavi”) (collectively,
“Defendants”) move for summary judgment against Plaintiffs Alfa Enterprise,
Inc. dba Van’s Liquor (“Alfa”) and Manjit Singh (“Singh”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)

In the alternative, Defendants move for summary
adjudication on the 1st (breach of quiet enjoyment) [Issue 1], 2nd (breach
of contract) [Issue 2], 3rd (breach of implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing) [Issue 3], 4th (fraud and deceit- intentional

concealment) [Issues 6 & 11], 6th (negligent misrepresentation) [Issues
7, 8, & 11], 7th (preliminary injunction and permanent injunction) [Issue
9], and 10th (declaratory judgment) [Issue 10] causes of
action.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-3.)
 
Evidentiary Objections
Defendants’ 1/18/24 evidentiary
objections to the Declaration of Singh are overruled as to Nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, and 10, and sustained as to Nos. 1 and 4 (as to “I was so advised by both
the previous Landlord and the Seller of the Business.”).
 
Procedural Background
On December 22, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their initial
complaint in the instant action against Defendants.  On July 31, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the
operative FAC against Defendants alleging eight causes of action for (1) breach
of quiet enjoyment; (2) breach of contract; (3) breach of implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing; (4) fraud and deceit- intentional
misrepresentation; (5) fraud and deceit- concealment; (6) negligent
misrepresentation; (7) preliminary injunction and permanent injunction; and (8)
declaratory relief.  (See FAC.)  
On November 9, 2023, Defendants filed the instant motion
for summary judgment, or alternatively summary adjudication of issues.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-3.)  Plaintiffs filed their opposition on January
9, 2024.  Defendants filed their reply on
January 18, 2024.
 
Summary of Allegations
Plaintiffs allege this complaint arises from the malicious
actions of Defendants concerning the lease of commercial real property located
at 12707 Washington Place, Los Angeles 90066 with APN: 4236-020-021
(“Premises”), wherein Plaintiffs’ business is located.  (FAC ¶11.) 
Plaintiffs allege in or about October 2018, Plaintiffs purchased Van’s
Liquor, a small retail convenience business from the previous tenant at the
Premises and has been operating the business up to this date.  (FAC ¶12.) 

Plaintiffs allege at the time of the purchase of the
business, Plaintiffs obtained an assignment of the certain written Lease
Agreement, which was entered into and made by and between Daryl Curtis,
Successor Trustee of the Sheltered Trust created under the Glen and Eva Curtis
Revocable Family Trust dated May 21, 1998, as landlord (“Original Landlord”)
and Mario Kassis and Marsil Kassis, as Tenants (“Original Tenants”), dated
11/1/2015 (“Lease”).  (FAC ¶13.)  Plaintiffs allege on or about October 19,
2018, the Original Tenants assigned the Lease to Plaintiffs with the written
consent of the Original Landlord.  (FAC
¶14.)
Plaintiffs allege the original initial lease term was for
the period of seven (7) years two (2) months, commencing 11/1/2015 and expiring
12/31/2022, with one (1) option to renew the Lease for the period of additional
five (5) years, commencing 1/1/2023 and expiring 12/31/2027.  (FAC ¶15.) 
Plaintiffs allege according to the terms of the Lease, at the “Addendum
One to Standard Commercial-Single Tenant Lease-Gross,” it expressly and
specifically states in Section 51, in regard to monthly rent as follows:
Section 51.
Adjustments to Base Rent During Lease Term: The Base Rent to be paid by Lessee
to Lessor during the term shall be as set forth below:
(1) 11/01/2015
through 12/31/2015: $3,575.00 per month
(2) 01/01/2016
through 12/31/2016: $3,675.00 per month
(3) 01/01/2017
through 12/31/2017: $3,775.00 per month
(4) 01/01/2018
through 12/31/2018: $3,875.00 per month
(5) 01/01/2019
through 12/31/2019: $3,975.00 per month
(6) 01/01/2020
through 12/31/2020: $4,075.00 per month
(7) 01/01/2021
through 12/31/2021: $4,175.00 per month
(8) 01/01/2022
through 12/31/2022: $4,275.00 per month
(FAC ¶16.) 
Plaintiffs allege according to the terms of the Lease,
especially at the “Addendum One to Standard Commercial-Single Tenant
Lease-Gross” as stated above, there shall be no other additional rent,
notwithstanding any additional property taxes, at all.  (FAC ¶17.)  Plaintiff alleges Caldwell admitted that
these issues are the result of years of neglect.  (FAC ¶17.)  
Plaintiffs allege on or about March 5, 2019, Defendants, Creative and HDR
purchased the Premises and became a successor-in-interest to the Original
Landlord for the Lease, and there exists a privity of contract between Plaintiffs
as Current Tenant and Defendants Creative and HDR as Current Landlord of the
Premises.  (FAC ¶18.)  Plaintiffs allege during
the entire period of Lease Term, there had never been any demand for additional
rent or property taxes by the original landlord of the Premises.  (FAC ¶19.) 

Plaintiffs allege at all relevant times herein, even after
Defendants Creative and HDR became a landlord as a successor in interest to the
Original Landlord of the Premises on or about 3/5/2019, they did not demand
Plaintiff pay any additional rent or property taxes at all, since the Monthly
Rent was based on Single Tenant Lease-Gross, as stated above.  (FAC ¶20.) 
Plaintiffs allege in or about March 2022, for the first time, Defendants
Creative and HDR, by and through Defendant Halavi, sent a letter demanding to
pay for the property taxes for the period of between: (1) 7/2018 and 6/2019 in
the sum of $4,452.36; (2) 7/2019 and 6/2020 in the sum of $13,669.54; (3)
7/2020 and 6/2021 in the sum of $10,357.36; and (4) 7/2021 to 12/2022 in the
sum of $4,959.96, alleging that the aggregate total in the sum of $33,439.23 is
past due as of 3/29/2022, which Plaintiffs expressly disputed.  (FAC ¶21.) 

Plaintiffs allege it is quite a surprise to Plaintiffs to
receive such notice from the landlord, since the monthly rent is based on the
Gross monthly rent, especially according to the Addendum of the Lease, at
Section 51, and there have never been any notice or demand about the additional
property taxes at all by the landlord over the last 7 years, including the
Defendants.  (FAC ¶22.)  
Plaintiffs allege Since March 29, 2022 and thereafter,
Defendants, each of them, and by their agent Aspen Management, threatened
Plaintiffs that they would not consent to the Exercise of Option to Extend the
Lease and/or terminate the Lease unless Plaintiffs agreed to pay the aforesaid
Property taxes in the sum of $33,439.23, even though there is no legal basis to
charge the additional property taxes to the Plaintiffs.  (FAC ¶23.) 
Plaintiffs allege it became obvious now that Defendants Creative
Properties and HDR, by and through Defendant Halavi, sent such a notice with an
ulterior motive to increase the monthly rent and/or to charge the additional
property taxes, and/or prevent or interfere with the Plaintiffs’ right to
“Option to Extend the Lease” and/or to threaten to terminate the Lease before
the expiration date of the Lease in December 2027.  (FAC ¶24.) 

Plaintiffs allege due to the threatening of Defendants,
each of them, and under extreme duress, Plaintiff Singh, without waiving any
rights, agreed to pay for the alleged property taxes between the period from
7/2018 to 12/2022, in the aggregate sum of $33,439.23 and summarized in writing
as follows:
(1)  
That Tenant agrees to
pay $33,439.23 as an additional property tax in 24 equal amount installment
payments over 24 months.
(2)  
That the installment
payment is in the sum of $1,394.00 per month, commencing June 1, 2022, until
paid in full.
(3)  
That these installment
payments will be sent in a separate check to maintain proper documentation of
the balance paid and balance remaining.
(4)  
That upon tenant’s
agreement to pay property taxes, the landlord will consent and accept the
Tenant’s Exercise of Option to Extend the Lease until 12/31/2027.
 
(FAC ¶25.)  
Plaintiffs allege under duress and relying on Defendants promises and
representation as stated above, on or about June 3, 2022, Plaintiff Singh sent
the first installment payment for property taxes in the sum of $1,394.00
together with the letter summarizing the agreement as above and the monthly
rent in the sum of $4,275.00, all of which was received and accepted and deposited
by Defendants.  (FAC ¶26.)  
Plaintiffs allege on or about 6/3/2022, pursuant to terms
of the lease, at Section 39 and Section 52, “Option to Extend,” Plaintiffs have
properly exercised the Option to extend the lease for additional five (5) years
commencing January 1, 2023, until December 31, 2028, by giving a written notice
to the Landlord.  (FAC ¶27.)  
Plaintiffs allege according to the terms of the Lease, the
Option to Extend the Lease should be exercised by giving a written notice to
the landlord no earlier than nine (9) months but no later than six (6) months
prior to the expiration of the Lease, of which the lease term is between 11/1/2015
and 12/31/2022, therefore, the tenant is required to give a written notice of
Exercising the Option to Extend the Lease between 4/1/2022 and 6/30/2022.  (FAC ¶28.)
Plaintiffs allege they have performed any and all obligations
under the Lease, including but not limited to, the payment of rent and
installment of property taxes as promised and agreed on or about 5/23/2022.  (FAC ¶29.) 
Plaintiffs allege on or about 6/3/2022, pursuant to terms of the lease,
at Section 39 and Section 52, “Option to Extend,” Plaintiffs have properly
exercised the Option to extend the lease for additional five (5) years
commencing January 1, 2023, until December 31, 2028, by giving a written notice
to the Landlord.  (FAC ¶30.)  Plaintiffs allege pursuant to terms of the
lease at Section 39 and Section 52, “Option to Extend”, and proper written
notice of exercise of the Option to the landlord, the Lease term was extended commencing
1/1/2023 until 12/31/2027.  (FAC
¶31.)  
Plaintiffs allege on or about June 20, 2022, after they
received the Plaintiff’s agreement to pay for the property taxes as additional
payment for the last 3 years, and received the first installment payment for
property taxes, Defendants, each of them, by and through Halavi, and in
conspiracy with each other, sent Plaintiffs a letter, requesting the full
payment of the property taxes in lump sum or to agree on early termination of
the Lease, and unilaterally changing the material terms of the lease, without
any legal basis, in breach of the Lease and Oral Agreement.  (FAC ¶32.) 
Plaintiffs allege further that Defendants threatened to evict the
Plaintiffs, alleging that the Lease term would terminate on 12/31/2022, and
that Plaintiff must vacate the Premises.  (FAC ¶33.) 

Plaintiffs allege on or about 6/27/2022, Plaintiffs, by and
through their counsel, sent a responsive letter stating that the Option to
Extend the Lease has already been exercised and the Lease term has been
extended until 12/31/2027, and that the installment payment in the sum of
$1,394.00 per month has been received and accepted by the Defendants pursuant
to the agreement which had been summarized in writing on or about 6/3/2022, and
therefore, it may not be rescinded or revoked unilaterally.  (FAC ¶34.) 

Plaintiffs allege commencing July 2022 and continuing
thereafter, Defendants, each of them, and by and through their agent Aspen
Management, alleged that the Lease will be terminated because the Option to
Extend the Lease was not exercised, and demanded that the total amount of
property taxes be paid immediately.  (FAC
¶35.)  Plaintiffs allege it became
obvious that Defendants, each of them, sent such a notice with an ulterior
motive to increase the monthly rent and/or to charge the additional property
taxes, and/or to prevent or interfere with the Plaintiffs’ right to “Option to
Extend the Lease” and/or to threaten to terminate the lease before the
expiration date of the Option in December 2027, in breach of the Covenant of Quiet
Enjoyment of the Lease, and in breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing, and in Breach of Oral Agreement. 
(FAC ¶36.)  
Plaintiffs allege Defendants, each of them and in
conspiracy with other Defendants, repeatedly harassed Singh by threatening
eviction or termination of lease without any legal basis, and also unreasonably
trespassed Plaintiffs’ leased Premises without proper notice in advance, with
ulterior motives to harass Plaintiffs in breach of the Lease.  (FAC ¶38.) 
Plaintiffs allege since 2018 and up to this date, the Premises was
leaking on the roof during the rainy season, and each time it was reported to
Defendants, but it continued leaking, and caused the loss of use of the leased
premises, and nuisance to Plaintiffs, notwithstanding the business sales loss.  (FAC ¶39.) 

Plaintiffs allege they have performed any and all obligations
under the Lease, including but not limited to, the payment of rent and
installment of property taxes as promised and agreed on or about 5/23/2022.  (FAC ¶40.) 

 
Legal Standard
A motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers
submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  (C.C.P.
§437c(c).) 
A motion for summary adjudication may be made by itself or as an
alternative to a motion for summary judgment and shall proceed in all
procedural respects as a motion for summary judgment.  (C.C.P. §437c(f)(2).)  A party may move
for summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action within an action if
that party contends that the cause of action has no merit.  A motion for summary adjudication shall be
granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative
defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.  (C.C.P.
§437c(f)(1).) 
 

Breach of Quiet Enjoyment (1st COA) [Against Creative and
HDR]
In the absence of language to
the contrary, every lease contains an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment,
whereby the landlord impliedly covenants that the tenant shall have quiet
enjoyment and possession of the premises.  (Andrews v. Mobile Aire Estates (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 578, 588,
citing Petroleum
Collections Inc. v. Swords (1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 841, 846, and Guntert v. City of Stockton (1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 131, 138.)
 The covenant of quiet enjoyment
insulates the tenant against any act or omission on the part of the landlord,
or anyone claiming under him, which interferes with a tenant’s right to use and
enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the tenancy.  (Id., internal citations omitted.)
The implied covenant of quiet
enjoyment is partially codified in Civil Code §1927, which provides: “An
agreement to let upon hire binds the letter to secure to the hirer the quiet
possession of the thing hired during the term of the hiring, against all
persons lawfully claiming the same.” 
(Civ. Code §1927.)  The statutory
covenant “guarantees the tenant against rightful assertion of a paramount
title.”  (Guntert, 55 Cal.App.3d at pg. 138.)  Beyond
the statutory covenant, the landlord is bound to refrain from action which
interrupts the tenant’s beneficial enjoyment. (Id.)
The implied covenant of quiet
enjoyment is breached when there is an eviction, actual or constructive, of the
tenant.  (Marchese v. Standard Realty & Development
Co. (1977) 74
Cal.App.3d 142, 148.)  Actual eviction
occurs when there is an expulsion or ouster of the tenant by the landlord.  (Giraud v. Milovich (1938) 29 Cal.App.2d 543.)  Constructive
eviction occurs when there is a substantial and material interference with the
tenant’s beneficial use and enjoyment of the premises, causing the tenant to
vacate.  (Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903.)  An interference by the landlord amounts to a
constructive eviction if the tenant so elects and surrenders possession, and
the tenant will not be liable for rentals following his eviction. Upon
surrendering possession of the premises, the tenant is relieved of the
obligation to pay rent and may sue for damages or may plead damages by way of
offset in an action brought by the landlord to recover any unpaid rent that
accrued prior to surrender.  (Andrews, 125 Cal.App.4th at pg. 590.)  
Alternatively, a tenant may
elect to stand upon the lease, remain in possession and sue for breach of
contract damages as well as for injunctive relief.  (Id.)  Minor inconveniences and
annoyances are not actionable.  (Id. at pgs. 589-590.)
Plaintiffs allege at the time of
the Purchase of the business, Plaintiffs obtained an assignment of the certain
written Lease Agreement, which was entered into and made by and between
Original Landlord and Original Tenants, dated 11/1/2015.  (FAC ¶44.) 
Plaintiffs allege on or about October 19, 2018, the Original Tenants assigned
the Lease to Plaintiffs with the written consent of the Original Landlord.  (FAC ¶45.) 
Plaintiffs allege the original initial lease term was for the period of
seven (7) years two (2) months, commencing 11/1/2015 and expiring 12/31/2022,
with one (1) option to renew the Lease for the period of additional five (5)
years, commencing 1/1/2023 and expiring 12/31/2027.  (FAC ¶46.) 

Plaintiffs allege according to
the terms of the Lease, at the “Addendum One to Standard Commercial-Single
Tenant Lease-Gross,” it expressly and specifically states in Section 51, in
regard to monthly rent as follows:
Section 51. Adjustments to Base Rent During Lease Term: The Base Rent
to be paid by Lessee to Lessor during the term shall be as set forth below:
(1) 11/01/2015 through
12/31/2015: $3,575.00 per month
(2) 01/01/2016 through
12/31/2016: $3,675.00 per month
(3) 01/01/2017 through
12/31/2017: $3,775.00 per month
(4) 01/01/2018 through 12/31/2018:
$3,875.00 per month
(5) 01/01/2019 through
12/31/2019: $3,975.00 per month
(6) 01/01/2020 through
12/31/2020: $4,075.00 per month
(7) 01/01/2021 through
12/31/2021: $4,175.00 per month
(8) 01/01/2022 through
12/31/2022: $4,275.00 per month
(FAC ¶47.)  Plaintiffs allege according to the terms of
the Lease, especially at the “Addendum One to Standard Commercial-Single Tenant
Lease-Gross,” there shall be no other additional rent, notwithstanding any
additional property taxes, at all.”  (FAC
¶48.)
          Plaintiffs
allege thereafter, on or about March 5, 2019, Defendants Creative 
and HDR purchased the subject
Premises and became a successor-in-interest to the Original Landlord for the
subject Lease, and there exists a privity of contract between Plaintiffs as
Current Tenant and Defendants Creative and HDR as Current Landlord of the
subject Premises.  (FAC ¶49.)
          Plaintiffs
allege Defendants each of them, and in conspiracy with other, breached the
covenant of quiet enjoyment of the Lease, by unilaterally attempting to change
the material terms of the Lease, and by demanding to pay additional property
taxes without any legal basis, further by repeatedly harassing Plaintiffs by
threatening eviction or
termination of lease without any legal basis, and also by unreasonably trespassing
Plaintiffs’ leased Premises without proper notice in advance, with ulterior
motives to harass Plaintiffs in breach of quiet enjoyment of Lease.  (FAC ¶72.)
          Plaintiffs
allege Halavi, as an individual and as officer and agents of Creative and HDR,
in concert and conspiracy with each other and with DOE Defendants, have
conducted such conducts and fraudulent activities, such that activities of one
are attributable to all other defendants. Plaintiffs are informed and believe,
and thereon allege, that each corporate defendant agreed to, approved,
authorized and ratified the conduct alleged herein.  (FAC ¶74.)
          Defendants
argue there is no triable issue of material fact as to this cause of action
because §10.2(a) the Lease states, “lessee shall pay to Lessor the amount, if
any, by which real property taxes applicable to the premises increase
over the fiscal year during which
the commencement date occurs.”  (Defendants’
Disputed Separate Statement of Material Fact [“D-DSSF”] 5; D-COE Exh. D at
§10.2; Exh. B at 44:4-10, 53:10-54:6.)  Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ allegation that
the parties entered into an agreement to pay the taxes in monthly installments
is without merit or supporting evidence as Singh admitted in his deposition that
Sean Rehbar told him that he needed to confer with his partner to agree on
installment payments and later notified Singh that they did not agree to the
installment payment plan.  (D-DSSF 12-13,
20; D-COE Exh. B at 32:17-21, 34:14-23, 76:8-25, 78:12-17, 82:16-83:2,
94:17-95:1; 109:23-111:12.)  
Defendants argue they did not
accept Plaintiffs’ attempt to make installment payments and per §39.4(a) of the
Lease, Plaintiffs were in default and lost the right to exercise the Option.  (Defendants’ Undisputed Separate Statement of
Fact [“D-USSF”] 7) (D-DSSF 16-18; D-COE Exh. D at §39.4; Exh. I; Exh. B at
84:19-85:16, 96:7-13, 98:3-14, 106:5-11, 105:24-106:4, 109:9-22.)
Even if there had been such an
agreement, the agreement was required to be in writing per Civil Code
§1624(a)(1), as it was not to be performed within one year and would,
therefore, be invalid.
Further, Plaintiffs have
admitted that it has been business as usual and that there has been no disruption
to their business or income by Defendants or because of their disagreement
relating to property tax or exercise of the option. (D-DSSF 19; D-COE Exh. B at
112:12-114:5.)   Defendants met their
burden to demonstrate there is no issue of material fact as to the 1st cause of
action, shifting the burden to Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material
issue.
Plaintiffs fail to meet their
burden to raise a triable issue of material fact.  A party may not create a triable issue of
fact to defeat summary judgment merely by means of a self-serving declaration
that contradicts his own deposition testimony. (D’Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 21-22.)  “Where there is a clear and unequivocal
admission by a plaintiff, himself in a deposition and the plaintiff contradicts
that admission in a subsequent declaration, the court is forced to conclude there
is no substantial evidence of the existence of a triable issue of fact.”  (Id.)  
Here, Plaintiffs’ evidence proffered
in support of their separate statement in opposition is a declaration by Singh
and exhibits in support that contradict his earlier deposition testimony.  (See Plaintiff’s Disputed Separate Statement [“P-DSSF”] 5, 12; Decl. of
Singh ¶¶3-4, 8-17, Exhs. 2, 5, 6.) 
Singh’s earlier deposition testimony contradicts his declaration, and
therefore cannot serve as evidence of a triable issue of material fact.
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion
for summary adjudication of the 1st cause of action is granted.
 
Breach of
Contract (2nd COA) [Against Creative and HDR]

“To prevail on a cause of action
for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) resulting damage to the plaintiff.”   (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182,
1186.)
“When a party’s failure to
perform a contractual obligation constitutes a material breach of the contract,
the other party may be discharged from its duty to perform under the contract.
Normally the question of whether a breach of an obligation is a material breach
excusing performance by the other party is a question of fact. Whether a
partial breach of a contract is material depends on ‘the importance or
seriousness thereof and the probability of the injured party getting
substantial performance.’ ‘A material breach of one aspect of a contract
generally constitutes a material breach of the whole contract.’”  (Brown v. Grimes (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th at pgs. 277-278, internal citations omitted.)
Defendants argue Plaintiffs not
only failed to perform the obligations required under the lease, but by the
default gave up their right to exercise the option to extend the lease.
Defendants submitted evidence, as
stated with regard to the 1st cause of action, that in §10.2(a) of the Lease
Agreement, Plaintiffs were obligated to “pay the Real Property Taxes applicable
to the Premises provided, however, that lessee shall pay to Lessor the amount,
if any, by which real property taxes applicable to the premises increase over
the fiscal year during which the commencement date occurs (“Tax Increase”).  (D-DSSF 5.)  Defendants submitted evidence that the Lease
states payment of any such Tax Increase shall be made by Lessee to Lessor
within 30 days after receipt of Lessor’s written statement setting forth the
amount due and computation thereof.”  (D-DSSF
5.)
Defendants submitted evidence
that Plaintiffs did not pay the amount requested and were in default thirty
days after the written statement and computation were delivered to Plaintiffs.  (D-USSF 9) (D-DSSF 18; D-COE Exh. B at
105:24-106:4, 109:9-22.)  Defendants
submitted evidence that Singh testified in his deposition that Sean Rehbar
would have to check with his partner before agreeing to accept installment
payments.  (D-DSSF 12; D-COE Exh. B at 32:17-21,
34:14-23, 76:8-25, 78:12-17, 82:16-83:2, 94:17-95:1.)   Defendants submitted evidence that Sean later
informed Plaintiffs that his partner did not agree to accept installment
payments.  (D-DSSF 13; D-COE Exh. B at 32:17-33:4,
34:14-35:6, 78:18-24, 82:16-83:2.)  Defendants met their burden to demonstrate
there is no issue of material fact as to the 2nd cause of action, shifting the
burden to Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact.
Plaintiffs fail to meet their
burden to raise a triable issue of material fact.  First, Plaintiffs’ opposition admits that the
agreement regarding installment payments was oral.  (See Opposition, pg. 7.)  A written
modification is required, or this type of agreement is invalid.  (See Civ. Code §1624(a).)  Second, Singh’s
sworn deposition testimony admits that he was informed by Defendants that they
did not agree to any installment payments for outstanding property taxes and
that they would not accept Plaintiffs’ attempted option to extend the lease
term until their account was current.  (See D-DSSF 16-18.)  Further, Plaintiffs fail to dispute by any
competent, admissible evidence that all monies sent by Plaintiffs as attempted
installment payments for property tax were not accepted by Defendants. Therefore,
Plaintiffs’ argument that Defendants waived enforcement of the written
modification of the Lease by receiving a check for installment payment of
property taxes in unavailing.
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion
for summary adjudication of Issue 2 of the 2nd cause of action is granted.
 
Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair
Dealing (3rd COA) [Against Creative and HDR]
“The implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing rests upon the existence of some specific contractual
obligation. ‘The covenant of good faith is read into contracts in order to
protect the express covenants or promises of the contract, not to protect some
general public policy interest not directly tied to the contract’s purpose.’ .
. . ‘In essence, the covenant is implied as a supplement to the express
contractual covenants, to prevent a contracting party from engaging in conduct
which (while not technically transgressing the express covenants) frustrates
the other party’s rights to the benefits of the contract.’”  (Racine & Laramie, Ltd. v. Department of Parks &
Recreation (1992) 11
Cal.App.4th 1026, 1031-1032, internal citations omitted.)
Plaintiffs allege that the
Option to Extend the Lease had been duly exercised.  (FAC ¶105.) 
However, Plaintiffs were in default of the Lease by failing to pay their
allocated share of the increase in property taxes.  (D-DSSF 5, 16-18) (D-USSF 7.)  By failing to pay such amount within 30 days
of being presented with the amount and computation, Plaintiffs were in default,
and pursuant to the Lease, had lost the right to exercise the Option.  Defendants met their burden to demonstrate
there is no issue of material fact as to the 3rd cause of action, shifting the
burden to Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact.
Plaintiffs fail to meet their
burden to raise a triable issue of material fact for the same reasons stated
regarding the 2nd cause of action.  
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion
for summary adjudication of Issue 3 of the 3rd cause of action is granted.
 
Fraud- Intentional Misrepresentation (4th COA) [Against all
Defendants]
“The elements of fraud that will give rise to a tort action
for deceit are: ‘(a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or
nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to
defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting
damage.’”  (Engalla v. Permanente
Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 974, internal quotation marks
omitted.)  “[A] cause of action for
misrepresentation requires an affirmative statement, not an implied assertion.”
 (RSB Vineyards, LLC v. Orsi
(2017) 15 Cal.App.5th 1089, 1102.)
Fraud actions are subject to strict requirements of
particularity in pleading.  (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
216.)  Fraud must be pleaded with
specificity rather than with general and conclusory allegations.  (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003)
30 Cal.4th 167, 184.)  The specificity
requirement means a plaintiff must allege facts showing how, when, where, to
whom, and by what means the representations were made, and, in the case of a
corporate defendant, the plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who
made the representations, their authority to speak on behalf of the
corporation, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when the
representation was made.  (Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645; West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.)
Plaintiffs allege on or about 5/23/2022, Defendants
Creative and HDR, by and through Halavi, told Plaintiff Singh as follows:
(1)  
that the additional
Property taxes in the sum of $33,439.23 for the period from 7/2018 until
12/2022 is past due;
(2)  
that Plaintiff is
responsible for the additional property taxes;
(3)  
that they would not
consent to the Exercise of Option to Extend the Lease and terminate the Lease,
unless Plaintiffs agree to pay the additional Property taxes in the sum of
$33,439.23;
(4)  
that they would accept
the additional property taxes in the aggregate sum of $33,439.23 in 24
installment payment over 24 months;
(5)  
that the installment
payment is in the sum of $1,394.00 per month, commencing June 1, 2022, until
paid in full.
(6)  
That these installment
payments will be sent in a separate check to maintain proper documentation of
the balance paid and balance remaining.
(7)  
That upon tenant’s
agreement to pay property taxes, the landlord will consent and accept the
Tenant’s Exercise of Option to Extend the Lease until 12/31/2027.
 
(FAC ¶113.)
          Plaintiffs
allege thereafter, under duress and relying on Defendants’ promises and
representation as stated above, on or about June 3, 2022, Singh sent the first
installment payment for property taxes in the sum of $1,394.00 together with
the letter summarizing the agreement as above and the monthly rent in the sum
of $4,275.00, all of which was received and accepted and deposited by
Defendants.  (FAC ¶114.)
          Plaintiffs
allege these representations by Creative and HDR, by and through Halavi, were
false, and made with the intent to induce the Plaintiffs to rely on them and to
act in reliance to agree to pay for the additional property taxes, and to pay
the installment payment in the sum of $1,394.00, Plaintiffs reasonably relied
upon
this promise.  (FAC
¶115.)
          Plaintiffs
allege the representations by Creative and HDR, by and through Halavi, were
false in that:
(1)  
that the additional
Property taxes in the sum of $33,439.23 for the period from 7/2018 until
12/2022 is NOT past due; 
(2)  
that Plaintiff is NOT
responsible for the additional property taxes;
(3)  
that they did NOT have
any intention to consent to the Exercise of Option to Extend the Lease and
would terminate the Lease, even though Plaintiffs agree to pay the additional
Property taxes in the sum of $33,439.23;
(4)  
that they would NOT
accept the additional property taxes in the aggregate sum of $33,439.23 in 24
installment payment over 24 months;
(5)  
That upon tenant’s
agreement to pay property taxes, the landlord will NOT consent and NOT accept
the Tenant’s Exercise of Option to Extend the Lease until 12/31/2027.
 
(FAC ¶116.)
          Plaintiffs
allege Defendants made these promises without any intention to perform from the
beginning with the intent to induce the Plaintiffs to rely on them and to act
in reliance by agreeing to pay for the additional property taxes in the sum of
$33,439.23 in 24 installment payment over 24 months, even though plaintiff is
not responsible for the additional property taxes.  (FAC ¶117.)
          Plaintiffs
allege at the time Defendants made these representations, they knew them to be
false and not true, and Plaintiffs had no reasonable grounds for not believing
them to be true.  (FAC ¶118.)
          Plaintiffs
allege relying on these representations and promises of Defendants, on or about
5/23/2022, Plaintiffs entered into an agreement to pay for the additional
property taxes in the sum of $33,439.23 in 24 installment payment over 24
months, and in fact sent the first installment payment in the sum of $1,394.00
on 6/3/2022.  (FAC ¶119.)
          Plaintiffs
allege as a proximate result of Defendants’ fraudulent conduct, Plaintiffs have
been damaged in excess of $33,439.23 according to proof at the time of trial.  (FAC ¶120.)
Defendants submitted evidence
that Singh testified in his deposition that he never spoke or communicated with
Halavi and he did not know who he was. 
(D-DSSF 22; D-COE Exh. B at 30:11-12, 31:14-32:2, 35:13-22, 69:14-18, 115:19-24,
121:4-21; Exh. J.)  Defendants submitted
evidence that no agreement on an installment payment was reached per Singh’s
deposition testimony.   (D-DSSF 12, 13,
20; D-COE Exh. B at 32:17-33:4, 34:14-35:6, 60:10-61:3, 76:8-25, 78:12-24, 82:16-83:2,
94:17-95:1, 109:23-111:12.)  Defendants
submitted evidence that they did not misrepresent any material facts to
Plaintiffs regarding the real property taxes or the exercise of the option
pursuant to the Lease.  (D-DSSF 23, 24;
D-COE Exh. D; Exh. E at Addendum One ¶52; Exh. F; Exh. B at 31:19-32:2,
35:13-22, 69:14-18, 115:19-24, 70:5-13, 72:5- 12, 91:15-92:2, 73:16-22,
74:12-22, 77:25- 78:11, 93:8-13, 121:22-25, 32:17-21, 34:14-23, 76:8-25,
78:12-17, 82:16-83:2, 94:17-95:1, 32:17-33:4, 34:14-35:6, 78:18-24, 82:16-83:2,
84:19-85:16, 96:7-13, 98:3-14, 106:5-11, 109:23-111:12, 116:13-117:19.)  Defendants met their burden to demonstrate
there is no issue of material fact as to the 4th cause of action, shifting the
burden to Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact.
Plaintiffs fail to meet their
burden to raise a triable issue of material fact.  A party may not create a triable issue of
fact to defeat summary judgment merely by means of a self-serving declaration
that contradicts his own deposition testimony. (D’Amico, 11 Cal.3d at pgs. 21-22.) 
Here, Plaintiffs’ evidence proffered in support of their separate
statement in opposition is a declaration by Singh and exhibits in support that
contradict his earlier deposition testimony. 
Singh’s earlier deposition testimony contradicts his declaration, and
therefore cannot serve as evidence of a triable issue of material fact.
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion
for summary adjudication of the 4th cause of action is granted.
 
Fraud- Concealment (5th COA) [Against all Defendants]
“[T]he elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on
a concealment are: (1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a
material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the
fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or
suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff
must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had
known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the
concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage.”  (Boschma v. Home Loan
Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.)
Defendants submitted the same evidence as presented in the
4th cause of action, thereby meeting their burden, and shifted their burden to
Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact as to the 5th cause of
action.  For the same reasons stated with
regard to the 4th cause of action, Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden to
demonstrate a triable issue of material fact as to the 5th cause of action.
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion
for summary adjudication of 5th cause of action is granted.
 
Negligent
Misrepresentation (6th COA) [Against all Defendants]
“Negligent misrepresentation requires an assertion of fact,
falsity of that assertion, and the tortfeasor’s lack of reasonable grounds for
believing the assertion to be true. It also requires the tortfeasor’s intent to
induce reliance, justifiable reliance by the person to whom the false assertion
of fact was made, and damages to that person. An implied assertion of fact is
‘not enough’ to support liability.”  (SI
59 LLC v. Variel Warner Ventures, LLC (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 146, 154,
internal citation omitted.) 
Defendants submitted the same evidence as presented in the
4th cause of action, thereby meeting their burden, and shifted their burden to
Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact as to the 6th cause of
action.  For the same reasons stated with
regard to the 4th cause of action, Plaintiffs fail to meet their burden to
demonstrate a triable issue of material fact as to the 6th cause of action.
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion
for summary adjudication of 6th cause of action is granted.
 
Preliminary
Injunction and Permanent Injunction (7th COA)
“[A] ‘cause of action’ is
comprised of a ‘primary right’ of the plaintiff, a ‘primary duty’ of the
defendant, and a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of that
duty.” A “cause of action” must be distinguished from the remedy sought: “‘The
violation of one primary right constitutes a single cause of action, though it
may entitle the injured party to many forms of relief, and the relief is not to
be confounded with the cause of action, one not being determinative of the
other.’”  An injunction is a remedy, not
a cause of action.  (Marlin v. Aimco
Venezia, LLC (2007) 154
Cal.App.4th 154, 162, internal citations omitted.)
There is not a cognizable cause
of action for preliminary injunction and permanent injunction.  (See id.)  Further, Plaintiffs’ causes of action based on
breach of contract, fraud and deceit, and negligent misrepresentation all fail
as a matter of law.  Therefore, there is
no basis on which injunctive relief can be granted as a remedy.
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion
for summary adjudication as the 7th cause of action is granted.
 
Declaratory
Relief (8th COA)
          Any person
claiming rights with respect to property, a contract, or a written instrument
(other than a will or trust) may bring an action for a declaration of the
party’s rights or duties with respect to another. The action may be brought
before any breach occurs of the obligation regarding which the declaration of
rights is sought.  (C.C.P. §1060; Market
Lofts Community Association v. 9th Street Market Lofts, LLC (2014) 222
Cal.App.4th 924, 931.)  However, such
declaratory relief requires the existence of an actual, present controversy
between the parties over a proper subject.  (City of Cotati v. Cashman (2002) 29
Cal.4th 69, 79; Jenkins v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 216
Cal.App.4th 497, 513-514.)
          Plaintiffs
allege an actual, legal controversy exists between Plaintiffs and Defendants
concerning the exercise of the Option and the terms of the Lease.
 (FAC ¶149.)  Plaintiffs allege they seek a Declaration as
follows: (1) that Plaintiffs properly exercised the Option to Extend the Lease
with the agreement and acceptance by Defendants, for five (5) more years from
1/1/2023 until 12/31/2027, and (2) That Defendant is not entitled to charge the
property taxes in the sum of
$33,429.22, as an additional rent to the tenant pursuant to
terms of the Lease.  (FAC ¶148.)
          Defendants
met their burden to demonstrate no present controversy exists based on the
Lease, which states, in §10.2(a), “Lessor shall pay the Real Property Taxes
applicable to the Premises provided, however, that lessee shall pay to Lessor
the amount, if any, by which real property taxes applicable to the premises
increase over the fiscal year during which the commencement date occurs (“Tax Increase”).
Payment of any such Tax Increase shall be made by Lessee to Lessor within 30
days after receipt of Lessor’s written statement setting
forth the amount due and
computation thereof,” and in §39.4(a), “Lessee shall have
no right to exercise an Option:  . . .
(ii) during the period of time any Rent is unpaid (without regard to whether
notice thereof is given to Lessee).”  (D-USSF
4, 6, 7) (D-DSSF 5, 20).  Defendants met
their burden to demonstrate there is no triable issue of material fact,
shifting the burden to Plaintiffs to demonstrate a triable issue of material
fact.
          Plaintiffs
failed to meet their burden to demonstrate a triable issue of material fact by
failing to present admissible evidence.
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion
for summary adjudication of the 7th cause of action is granted.
 
 
Conclusion
Defendants’
motion for summary judgment is granted.
