 Case Number:  23STUD11101    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  71 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles   DEPARTMENT  71   TENTATIVE RULING      THE    WOMAN’S CLUB OF HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA,             vs.   SARA    VAN HORN, et al.    Case No.:  23STUD11101          Hearing    Date:  January 23, 2024      Defendants Sara Van Horn’s and Patrick Van Horn’s unopposed  motion to deem admitted Plaintiff The Woman’s Club of Hollywood, California’s responses  to their Request for Admission (Set One) is granted.  Responses are due within 20 days. Defendants’  request for monetary sanctions on the motion to deem Requests for Admission  Admitted is granted in the reduced amount of $1,000.00 against Plaintiff.  Sanctions are payable within 20 days.             Defendants Sara Van Horn (“Sara”) and  Patrick Van Horn (“Patrick”) (collectively, “Defendants”) move unopposed  for an order deeming admitted Plaintiff The Woman’s Club of Hollywood,  California’s (“TWCH”) (“Plaintiff”) responses to  Defendants’ Request for Admissions (Set One) (“RFA”).  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §2033.280(b).)  Defendants  also request an award of sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $5,585.25.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §2033.280(b).)  Having reviewed Defendant’s unopposed Motion to Deem Requests for  Admission Admitted, the Court rules as follows.           On September 22, 2023,  Defendants served RFA (Set One) on Plaintiff, via electronic service.  Responses were due October 2, 2023.  Defendants’ counsel declares on September 29,  2023, Plaintiff served deficient, unverified responses.  (Decl. of Holliday ¶3, Exh. B.)  Defendants’ counsel declares she spoke with  Plaintiff’s counsel on October 4, 2023, when the parties discussed the absence  of a verification to all of Plaintiff’s discovery responses.  (Decl. of Holliday ¶6.)   Defendants’ counsel declares Plaintiff’s  counsel sent updated responses with a purported verification signed by Susan  Landay (“Landay”), but the “verification” did not contain the required language.   (Decl. of Holliday ¶6.)   Defendants’ counsel declares Landay did not  attest that the information was within her personal knowledge or that the  statements were true and correct, and Landay did not disclose her relationship  to Plaintiff, claiming only to have been authorized to sign the self-styled  “verification” on its behalf.  (Decl. of  Holliday ¶6, Exh. D.)  Plaintiff has  failed to provide timely, verified responses.   Defendants now move the Court to deem the requests for admission  admitted.             The Court grants the  motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.280 and deems the requests to be admitted. Defendants request monetary sanctions totaling $5,585.25.  The Court finds this request to be  exceptionally high for an unopposed motion to deem admitted requests for  admission, and should not take 10.25 hours to prepare and file.  Such a motion does not require a separate  statement (a motion to compel further responses requires a separate statement),  and counsel is not entitled to attorneys’ fees for time spent meeting and  conferring.            The Court awards  sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.280(c) in the amount of $1,000.00, calculated as  follows: 1.5 hours to prepare instant motion + 0.5 hours to appear at hearing = 2  hours   ($500 per hour x 2 hours) = $1,000.00 The sanctions are payable by Plaintiff within 20 days of this order.             Conclusion Defendants’ unopposed motion to deem admitted Plaintiff’s  responses to their RFAs is granted. Plaintiff is to provide responses within 20  days. Defendants’ request for monetary sanctions is granted in the reduced  total amount of $1,000.00 against Plaintiff.   Sanctions are payable within 20 days.              Moving Party is to give notice of this  ruling.Dated:  January _____, 2024
