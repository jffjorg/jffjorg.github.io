Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this case. The plaintiff, Vivian Ortiz, worked for the defendant, MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as a Customer Service Specialist. Ortiz alleged that the defendant retaliated against her for complaining about the bank's refusal to reimburse her for wifi and phone expenses while working remotely. The defendant argued that Ortiz did not engage in protected activity under Labor Code section 1102.5, which prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who disclose wrongdoing to authorities.

The judge found that Ortiz did not present any evidence to create a triable issue that her conduct was a "protected activity" under Labor Code section 1102.5. The judge also granted the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action, which alleged failure to indemnify, unfair competition, failure to provide employment records, and failure to provide personnel records, respectively. Additionally, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to support her claims.

The judge's ruling means that the plaintiff's claims are dismissed, and the defendant is entitled to summary judgment. The plaintiff may still have the option to appeal the ruling to a higher court.
