And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the special motion to strike the cross-complaint brought by Bank of America, N.A. against Walter Y. Kim. Kim's cross-complaint alleges that Bank of America, N.A. violated the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by not setting aside an involuntary lien recorded against Kim in the Norwalk Action. Bank of America, N.A. argued that the cross-complaint is a SLAPP suit and should be stricken. The judge found that the cross-complaint arises from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute and that Bank of America, N.A. has not established a probability of prevailing on its motion to strike. The judge also found that Kim has established a probability of prevailing on his cross-complaint and that Bank of America, N.A.'s procedures for serving process are not adequate to avoid violating the statute.
