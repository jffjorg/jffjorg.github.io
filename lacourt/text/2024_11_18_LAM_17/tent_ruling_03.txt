         vs.
 
JENNIFER
  JONES PHILLIPS, et al. 
 
 


 Case No.: 
  24STCV20259
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  November 18, 2024



 
Specially
appearing Defendants’ motion to quash is GRANTED. 
 
            On
8/12/2024, pro per Plaintiff Amphilous Jackson (Plaintiff) initiated
this action against Jennifer Jones Philips, Toni Rainey, and Melissa Owens. 
            
            On
10/7/2024, specially appearing Defendants Jennifer Jones-Phillips and Melissa
Owens moved to quash service of Plaintiff’s Complaint. Defendant Rainey filed a
joinder to this motion.  
 
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion  
 
Defendants
contend that the purported proofs of service submitted by Plaintiff are
defective. 
 
As for
service of Owens and Rainey, those proofs of service are signed and verified by
Plaintiff. (Exh. 1 and 3.) As a party, Plaintiff may not serve process in her
own case. “A summons may be served by any person who is at least 18 years of
age and not a party to the action.” (CCP § 414.10.)
 
As for
service of Jones-Phillips, the purported proof of service is signed by Kiara
Williams but is not verified. (Exh. 2, p 2.) 
The purported service was at 1933 South Broadway, Los Angeles CA 90007
on August 20, 2024. However, Defendant Jones-Phillips submitted a declaration
stating that she has never been personally served and was not served on 8/20/2024.
(Jones-Phillip Decl. ¶4.) There are also inconsistencies in the dates. As
noted, the unverified declaration was signed on 8/20/2024, but also states that
Kiara Williams served the defendant by mail on 9/6/2024.
 
Plaintiff did
not oppose this motion, and thus is considered to have conceded to Defendants’
motion on the merits.
 
Based on the
foregoing, specially appearing Defendants’ motion to quash is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
