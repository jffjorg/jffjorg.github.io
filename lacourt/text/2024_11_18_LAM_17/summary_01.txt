And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the Trustee's motion to intervene in the case. The Trustee, Michelle Kim, is the Successor Trustee of the Annie Shin Living Trust and seeks to protect the Trust's interest in a Hanmi Bank account that Plaintiff Tae Sung Shin claims ownership of. The judge finds that the Trustee has a significant interest in the Trust Bank Account and that the Trustee's intervention will not enlarge the issues in the litigation. The judge also finds that the reasons for the Trustee's intervention outweigh any opposition by the original parties to the action. As a result, the Trustee's motion to intervene is granted.
