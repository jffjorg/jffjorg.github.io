And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the specially appearing defendants' motion to quash the service of complaint. The plaintiff, Amphilous Jackson, initiated the action against Jennifer Jones Phillips, Toni Rainey, and Melissa Owens on August 12, 2024. The defendants moved to quash the service of complaint on October 7, 2024, arguing that the proofs of service are defective. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and the judge found that the purported proofs of service are defective. Specifically, the judge found that the plaintiff may not serve process in her own case, and that the purported service of Jones-Phillips is defective. As a result, the judge granted the defendants' motion to quash the service of complaint.
