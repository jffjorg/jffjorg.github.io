And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a dispute over an arbitration provision that states the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applies. The plaintiff does not dispute the applicability of the FAA. The defendant's motion to compel arbitration argues that it may enforce the arbitration provision as a third-party beneficiary. The judge notes that the defendant's motion does not explicitly seek to compel arbitration on a third-party beneficiary theory, but the defendant's arguments in the motion suggest that it may be pursuing this theory. The judge rules on this argument, leaving it unclear whether the defendant has abandoned this theory or it is a typo.
