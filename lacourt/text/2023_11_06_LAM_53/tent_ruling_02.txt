The Arbitration Provision at issue here states that any arbitration arising
thereunder “shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et.
seq.) and not by any state law concerning arbitration.”  (Maugeri Decl., Ex. 5, Arbitration
Provision.)  Plaintiff does not dispute
the applicability of the FAA in their opposition.

The court notes that, in reply, Defendant has stated that its “motion does not
seek to compel arbitration on a third party beneficiary theory.  Plaintiff’s argument on this issue is
therefore immaterial.”  (Reply, p. 1, n.
3.)  However, Defendant’s motion does
argue that it may enforce the Arbitration Provision against Plaintiff pursuant
to this theory.  (Mot., pp. 11:20-21
[“Nissan Can Compel Arbitration as a Third-Party Beneficiary to the Arbitration
Provision”], 11:22-13:4 [arguing that Defendant is a third-party
beneficiary].)  Because it is unclear if
this is a typo or if Defendant has abandoned this theory in reply, the court
rules on this argument.
