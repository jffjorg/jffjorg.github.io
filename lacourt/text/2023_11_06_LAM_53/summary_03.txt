And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrers filed by defendants Sang Do Kim, M.D. and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to the plaintiff's second cause of action for failure to obtain informed consent. The court has found that defendant Dr. Kim's demurrer is without merit and has overruled it. However, the court has sustained defendant Cedars-Sinai's demurrer, finding that the second cause of action does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The court has ordered the plaintiff to file a First Amended Complaint within 20 days to cure the deficiencies with the second cause of action. The court has also ordered defendant Cedars-Sinai to give notice of this ruling.

The court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 430.10 and relevant case law, including Flores v. Liu and Peredia v. HR Mobile Services, Inc.
