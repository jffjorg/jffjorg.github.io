And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The defendant, Nissan North America, Inc., had sought to compel arbitration of plaintiff Jessica Ramirez's claims based on an arbitration provision in the sales contract between Ramirez and Nissan of Bakersfield. The judge found that the defendant had not met its burden to show that it could enforce the arbitration provision against Ramirez, either through the doctrine of equitable estoppel or as a third-party beneficiary of the sales contract. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims were not based on the sales contract and therefore were not covered by the arbitration provision. As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
