  Case Number:  23AHCV00658    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEFENDANT’S
DEMURRER TO THE COMPLAINT WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND 
I.         INTRODUCTION
This dispute arises from an alleged
oral agreement concerning the use of warehouse space and a dispute over joint
ownership of property. Plaintiff Catherine V. Burnham (“Plaintiff”) asserts
claims against Defendant Jonathan L. Blackley (“Defendant”) for (1) Quiet
Title, (2) Fraud, (3) Breach of Contract regarding an agreement, (4) Declaratory
Relief, (5) Breach of Contract concerning personal property, (6) Breach of Oral
Contract, and (7) Declaratory Relief.
On June 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) asserting these causes of action. On August
15, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer to the TAC. Plaintiff filed an opposition
on December 31, 2024, and Defendant submitted a reply on January 7, 2025.
Meet and Confer
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and
confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the
responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video
conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.
Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing
the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to
meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer
or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.
(a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).)
Here, Defendant’s counsel, Loren
Cohen, declared that on July 30, 2024, he spoke with Plaintiff’s counsel, Dan
Hogue, regarding the Third Amended Complaint. (Cohen Decl., ¶ 3.) Thus, the
meet and confer requirement is satisfied. 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations
must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”
they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be
accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.) 
Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.)
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible
a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
III.      ANALYSIS
Defendant demurs to the second
cause of action for Fraud and the sixth cause of action for Breach of Oral
Contract, arguing that both causes of action are insufficiently pled and fail
to state valid claims.
Second cause of action: Fraud
The elements of fraud are: “(a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) In California, fraud, including
negligent misrepresentation, must be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz
Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) “The particularity demands
that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014)
224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)
 Defendant demurs to the fraud
cause of action on the grounds that it lacks specificity and fails to establish
the required elements of fraud. Defendant also contends the claim is barred by
the statute of limitations under Code of Civil Procedure section 338(d) because
Plaintiff previously admitted in her pleadings that she was aware in 2014 that
she was not on title to the Palm Avenue property, which bars the fraud claim
brought in 2023. Defendant further argues that any promissory fraud based on the
2007 Agreement is untimely. (Demurrer, p. 11)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that the fraud claim is adequately pled and satisfies the heightened pleading
standard. Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s execution of the Joint Tenancy
Grant Deed in 2005 and his subsequent representations through the 2007
Agreement are sufficient to demonstrate misrepresentation, reliance, and
resulting damage. Plaintiff further asserts that the statute of limitations did
not begin to run until October 2022, when Defendant expressed his intent to
sell the property and allegedly revealed his fraudulent intent for the first
time. Plaintiff argues that this recent discovery of fraud should toll the
limitations period. (Opposition, pp. 2–5.)
In the TAC, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant made promises in the 2007 Agreement and misrepresented their joint
ownership of the Palm Avenue property. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant
executed a Joint Tenancy Grant Deed in 2005, affirming joint ownership, but
later asserted sole ownership and intended to sell the property in violation of
their agreement. (TAC ¶¶ 33, 38–39.) Plaintiff also alleges that in 2014,
Defendant assured her that any title discrepancies were an error and would be
corrected. (TAC ¶37.) Further, Plaintiff claims that in 2022, Defendant’s
conduct, including his intent to sell the property and request for Plaintiff to
vacate, revealed that Defendant "did not intend to honor the legal effect
of the Joint Tenancy Grant Deed or their Agreement.” (TAC ¶39.) 
Fraud claims must be pled with
specificity. Here, the TAC fails to sufficiently detail the alleged
misrepresentations. While Plaintiff references the 2005 Joint Tenancy Grant
Deed and the 2007 Agreement, the exact statements, the context of their delivery,
and how Defendant's assurances were knowingly false at the time are not
described. Without this specificity, the fraud claim is inadequately pled. (Cansino,
supra, 224 Cal.App.4th at 1469.) Additionally, the element of intent to
defraud, which makes fraud actionable, requires allegations of Defendant's
specific intent to deceive at the time of the alleged misrepresentation. (Lacher
v. Superior Court (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1038, 1046.) Plaintiff does not
allege facts sufficient to show Defendant's intent to defraud at the time of
the representations.
As to the statute of limitations,
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s assurances in 2014 that the title
discrepancy would be corrected delayed her discovery of fraud. While Defendant
argues the limitations period began in 2014, when Plaintiff knew she was not on
title, Plaintiff alleges that it was not until 2022, when Defendant expressed
his intent to sell the property, that she discovered his fraudulent intent.
(TAC ¶¶ 38–39.) At this stage, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s allegations
regarding delayed discovery are sufficient to avoid a determination that the
fraud claim is time-barred as a matter of law.
Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS
Defendants demur as to this cause of action with leave to amend.
Sixth cause of action: Breach of Oral Contract
Defendant demurs to the Sixth Cause
of Action, asserting that Plaintiff has not alleged facts showing a breach of
the oral contract. Defendant contends that the term for using the warehouse
extended until October 2023, and Plaintiff fails to allege she was denied
access or forced to remove her items before that date. (Demurrer, p. 17.)
Further, Defendant argues that any oral agreement for a lease exceeding
one-year falls within the Statute of Frauds, rendering it invalid and
unenforceable as a matter of law.
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that Defendant’s demurrer ignores the alleged breach of the oral contract,
which occurred on or about March 6, 2023, when Defendant requested that
Plaintiff vacate the warehouse. Plaintiff asserts that this demand violated the
agreement, as it occurred with less than one year remaining on their
arrangement. Plaintiff further contends that the Statute of Frauds does not
apply because the breach occurred within the final months of the oral
agreement’s term. (Opposition, pp. 6–7.)
            The Court
finds that the Sixth Cause of Action for breach of oral contract is
insufficiently pled. While the TAC alleges that the parties agreed Plaintiff
could use the warehouse until October 2023 and that Defendant requested she
vacate on or about March 6, 2023, it fails to specify whether Plaintiff
complied with the request or whether Defendant’s conduct interfered with her
ability to use the warehouse. Additionally, the TAC does not allege specific
damages resulting from the alleged breach. 
The Court SUSTAINS Defendant’s
demurrer as to the sixth cause of action with leave to amend.
 
IV.       ORDER
            The Court SUSTAINS
the demurrer as to the second and sixth causes of action with 20 days leave to
amend.
            Defendant is
to give notice.
