This is an employment action.  Plaintiff Victoria White seeks to deem admitted her requests for admission propounded on Defendants Service All-Stars Energy, Inc. and Faisal Lodhi.  Plaintiff contends that Defendants never served responses.Defendants contend that they were surprised by the Motions because the parties had agreed to engage in settlement discussions and meanwhile pause discovery.  Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s counsel was supposed to reach out to them, but never did.Plaintiff contends there was no such agreement and that it was Defendants that failed to engage in settlement discussions.It seems that there was an agreement to pause discovery and have Plaintiff’s counsel initiate discussions.  Defense counsel stated: “Should we try Resolve LA before a lot of discovery? I feel like the financial resources are limited, and may be better directed toward settlement.”  Plaintiff’s counsel, Rami Kayyali, responded as follows: “It makes sense to first attempt settlement. Mr. Edwin Pairavi will engage you in settlement discussions. Thank you.”The Court, in the exercise of its discretion, denies the Motions, and will instead compel responses within 30 days.The Court declines to award sanctions at this time.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
