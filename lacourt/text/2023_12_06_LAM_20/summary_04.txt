And here is the English summary:

This is a tentative ruling in an employment action. Plaintiff Victoria White seeks to have her requests for admission deemed admitted against Defendants Service All-Stars Energy, Inc. and Faisal Lodhi. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendants never served responses to her requests for admission. The Defendants, on the other hand, argue that they were surprised by the motions because the parties had agreed to engage in settlement discussions and pause discovery. The Defendants claim that the Plaintiff's counsel was supposed to reach out to them, but did not. The Court finds that there was an agreement to pause discovery and engage in settlement discussions, but denies the Plaintiff's motions and instead compels the Defendants to respond to the requests for admission within 30 days. The Court declines to award sanctions at this time.
