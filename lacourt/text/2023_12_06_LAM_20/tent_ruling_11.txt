Ruling:   The Demurrer is sustained.  Twenty days leave to amend is granted only as to the second cause of action; leave to amend is otherwise denied.   Moving parties to give notice.   If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
