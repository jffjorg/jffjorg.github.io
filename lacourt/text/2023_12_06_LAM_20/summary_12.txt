And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Defendants California Physicians Service, Arshad Haqib, and Sandra Griffin to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Durant McLeod. The FAC alleges FEHA discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and wrongful termination. The Court has reviewed the allegations and determined that the demurrer is sustained as to all causes of action except for the second cause of action, which is the harassment claim. The Court grants twenty days leave to amend the complaint as to this claim. The harassment claim must be pled against the company, not the individual defendants, and the Court will not sustain the demurrer without leave to amend.
