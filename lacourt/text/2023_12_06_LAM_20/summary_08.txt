And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, Bruce D. Wasserman, alleges that the defendants, including Steven Teitelbaum, engaged in various fraudulent activities, including the sale of rare coins and palladium, and the misappropriation of assets. The defendants argue that the complaint is uncertain, fails to state sufficient facts, and is barred by the statute of limitations and the doctrine of laches. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint adequately pleads the facts and that the statute of limitations and laches do not bar the action. The defendants are ordered to file an answer within 20 days.
