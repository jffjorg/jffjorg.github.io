  Case Number:  21STCV47443    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER
DENYING PLAINTIFF’S EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR AN ORDER CONTINUING THE TRIAL AND DENYING
PLAINTIFF’S APPLICATION FOR AN ORDER SHORTENING TIME.
 The Court has read
and considered the moving papers filed by Plaintiff.  The bases for this ex parte application are:
1. The parties have scheduled a ten-hour mediation session in January 2025; and
2. The current trial date of 10/1/24 runs up against Rosh Hashana and Plaintiff’s
counsel, Mr. Levin, will be unavailable from October 2, 2024 to October 4, 2024,
inclusive. 
  The Court rules as
follows: Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Application for an Order Continuing the Trial
Date, Final Status Conference Date, and All Statutory Associated Dates, or, Alternatively,
for an Order Shortening Time to Hear a Noticed Motion is Denied. The court
finds that Plaintiff has not satisfied the requirement of California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1202(c), that an applicant for ex parte relief “must make an affirmative
factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on
personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other
statutory basis for granting relief ex parte.”
 The Court notes
that this case was filed on December 29, 2021, almost three years ago.  The Court further notes that there have been
three previous trial continuances: 1. 6/28/23 to 11/7/23; 2. 11/7/23 to 6/4/24;
and 3. 6/4/24 to 10/1/24.
 As to the first
basis for the application, the January 2025 mediation date, given the age of
the case it is not unreasonable to expect litigants to schedule mediation prior
to a fourth trial date.  As to the
second basis for the application, this Court respects Mr. Levin’s need to be unavailable
on October 2, 3 and 4 and, while keeping the October 1 trial date, will resume
trial on October 5.
