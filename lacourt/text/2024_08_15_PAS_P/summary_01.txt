And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for a trial continuance and order shortening time. The plaintiff cited two reasons for the request: a scheduled mediation session in January 2025 and the unavailability of their counsel, Mr. Levin, from October 2-4, 2024. The court ruled that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to support their request, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c). The court also noted that the case is over three years old and that there have been three previous trial continuances. Although the court sympathized with Mr. Levin's need to be unavailable, it denied the request and instead allowed the trial to proceed on October 1, 2024, with a resumption of trial on October 5, 2024.
