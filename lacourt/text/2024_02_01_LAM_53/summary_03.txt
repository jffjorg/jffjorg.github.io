And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial, separating the issues of liability from those of punitive damages. The court finds that the plaintiffs have not shown that the defendants' financial information is relevant to the calculation of compensatory damages. The court orders that the trial will be bifurcated into two phases: the first phase will determine whether the defendants are liable for compensatory damages and whether they are guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud, and the second phase will determine the amount of punitive damages, if any, against the defendants. The court also orders that evidence of the defendants' profits or financial condition will be excluded from the liability phase and will only be admitted after a verdict has been reached in favor of the plaintiffs and the defendants have been found guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud.
