MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff LA Potosina Meats,
Inc.       
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Vacate Dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure Section 664.6
and Enter Judgment
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff LA Potosina Meats, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order (1) vacating the dismissal of this action against defendants Eduardo Loza
and Edith Gonzalez Lozano, individually and as partners of East LA Tacos
(“Defendants”), ordered by the court on October 6, 2023, and (2) entering
judgment in its favor and against Defendants pursuant to the parties’
stipulation.
The court grants Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal and enter
judgment.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 664.6.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides, in relevant part, the following:¿
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.”¿ This statute “provides a summary procedure to
enforce a settlement agreement by entering judgment pursuant to the terms of
the settlement.”¿ (Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.)¿
“If the court determines that the parties entered into an enforceable
settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a formal judgment pursuant to
the terms of the settlement.”¿ (Ibid.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
In support
of its motion, Plaintiff has filed a copy of the “Stipulation for Entry of
Judgment and Installment Payments & Dismissal of Action with Consent to
Court Retaining Jurisdiction Pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6” (the “Stipulation”) entered
into by Plaintiff, on the one hand, and Defendants, on the other hand, in July
2023.  (Blanda Decl., Ex. 1,
Stipulation.)  
The
Stipulation states that (1) Defendants agree to enter judgment in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendants in the amount of $49,800, plus costs, and 10
percent interest from the date of default; (2) no judgment shall be entered if
Defendants pay the total amount of $49,000 by paying $500 on each consecutive
week from July 14, 2023 through May 6, 2025; and (3) the parties agree that the
court may retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the Stipulation pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. 
(Blanda Decl., Ex. 1, Stipulation, ¶¶ 1-2, 4.)  The Stipulation further provides that, in the
event of Defendants’ default, “Plaintiff shall be entitled to enter this
Judgment in this matter” subject to Plaintiff providing Defendants notice of
its intent to request that the court enter judgment.  (Blanda Decl., Ex. 1, Stipulation, ¶ 9.)
 
Further, Plaintiff
has presented evidence showing that (1) Defendants made payments in the total
amount of $4,500 to Plaintiff; (2) Defendants have not made any further
payments as of the date of September 19, 2023; (3) Plaintiff provided
Defendants an opportunity to cure their default; and (4) Defendants did not
cure their default.  (Blanda Decl.,
¶¶ 3-4.)  
Thus, the
court finds that Plaintiff has presented evidence establishing that the parties
stipulated, in a writing signed by both Plaintiff and Defendants outside of the
presence of the court, for the settlement of this action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6; Blanda Decl.,
Ex. 1, Stipulation.)  The court also
finds that Defendants have defaulted under the terms of the Stipulation.  (Blanda Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)  The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s
request to enter judgment in its favor and against Defendants pursuant to the
terms of the Stipulation, less the amounts already paid by Defendants and
including $402.33 in interest.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6; Hines, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p.
1182; Blanda Decl., ¶¶ 4-6; Blanda Decl., Ex. 3.) 
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff LA
Potosina Meats, Inc.’s motion to vacate dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6 and enter judgment. 
            The court orders that the court’s
October 6, 2023 order dismissing this action is vacated. 
            The court orders that judgment shall
be entered in favor of plaintiff LA Potosina Meats, Inc. and against defendants
Eduardo Loza and Edith Gonzalez Lozano, individually and as partners of East LA
Tacos, in the total amount of $44,902.33, consisting of (1) the amount of
$49,000 provided by the “Stipulation for Entry of Judgment and Installment Payments &
Dismissal of Action with Consent to Court Retaining Jurisdiction Pursuant to
C.C.P. § 664.6” less the $4,500 already paid, and (2) $402.33 in interest.  
            The court will sign and file the proposed Judgment lodged
by plaintiff LA Potosina Meats, Inc.
The court orders plaintiff LA Potosina Meats, Inc. to give notice of
this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
