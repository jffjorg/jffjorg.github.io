[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion for summary judgment or,
  in the alternative, summary adjudication
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Defendant Beverly Hills
Rehabilitation Centre, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Plaintiff Mansoureh Aghayan 
Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication
Defendant Beverly Hills
Rehabilitation Centre, LLC (“Defendant”) filed the pending motion for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication against plaintiff
Mansoureh Aghayan on August 28, 2023. 
Also on August 28, 2023,
Defendant filed a “Notice of Lodging Exhibits in Support of Motion for Summary
Judgment or, in the Alternative, for Summary Adjudication,” stating that
Defendant lodged, in support of its motion, exhibits A through G with the
court.  However, Defendant has not filed
those exhibits with the court.  (Overstock.com,
Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 487, n. 8
[“‘A “lodged” record is a record that is temporarily placed or deposited with
the court but not filed.’ 
[Citation.]  ‘Filing a document
makes it a part of the permanent court file, whereas lodging a document makes
it only temporarily a court record’”] [internal citation omitted].)  Thus, because Defendant has not filed
exhibits A through G with the court, those exhibits are not part of the court
record for purposes of this motion and on appeal.  (Ibid.; Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b) [“all moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed”
with the court] [emphasis added]; Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods,
Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 444, n. 3 [“normally ‘when reviewing the
correctness of a trial court’s judgment, an appellate court will consider only
matters which were part of the record at the time the judgment was entered’”].)

The court therefore exercises
its discretion to continue the hearing on Defendant’s motion in order to give
Defendant an opportunity to file its supporting evidence with the court. 
The court orders that the
hearing on defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre, LLC’s motion for
summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication is continued to March
6, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders defendant
Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre, LLC to electronically file a complete copy
of the “Notice of Lodging Exhibits in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment
or, in the alternative, for Summary Adjudication,” with copies of exhibits A
through G attached, no later than February 20, 2024.  If any party intends to file a motion to seal
any of those exhibits, the parties shall comply with the requirements of
California Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551. 
The court orders defendant Beverly Hills Rehabilitation
Centre, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  February 1, 2024
