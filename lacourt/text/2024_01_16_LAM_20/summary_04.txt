And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thinking before the court hearing. The case is an unlawful detainer action, where 3775 Broadway, LLC (the plaintiff) is seeking summary judgment against Bruce Hutchison (the third-party claimant). Since there is no opposition, the judge thinks it would be appropriate to grant the summary judgment motion. However, the motion is unclear about the relief being sought against Hutchison, specifically the amount of damages, if any. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide a proposed judgment within 10 days and sets a motion hearing. The judge also encourages counsel to appear remotely via LACourtConnect instead of in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
