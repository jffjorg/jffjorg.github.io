Motion Type Demurrer without Motion to Strike
 
The court has
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.  
The demurrer is sustained with leave to
amend. Plaintiff has thirty days to file an amended complaint. Defendant to
give notice. 
Background
            On
August 8, 2023, Plaintiff Jeffrey Sawn (Plaintiff) filed suit against Defendant
the State of California (Defendant). Plaintiff then filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (FAC). 
            Plaintiff
alleges that he is an inmate house at a California State Prison located in
Lancaster. In January 2023, Plaintiff “complained of  severe and unrelenting leg pain for which
medical care was urgently necessary, but he was ignored and refused, and no
medical attention was summoned. . .”(FAC, ¶6.) Due to the lack of timely
medical attention, Plaintiff’s leg was amputated. 
 
Plaintiff
alleges one cause of action for failure to summon medical attention pursuant to
Government Code section 845.6. Defendant demurrers on two grounds (i) that the
claim is insufficiently plead, and (ii) that Defendant is immune from liability
under Government Code section 856.4 (Section 856.4).
Legal Standard 
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against them. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal.App.3d 714, 721.)  When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (See Schultz
v. Harney (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1622, as modified on denial of reh’g
(Sept. 29, 1994).) The court “take[s] as true all properly pleaded material
facts, but not conclusions of fact or law asserted in the complaint.” (Sheen
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 916.) “The allegations of
the pleading demurred to must be regarded as true.” (South Shore Land Co. v.
Peterson (1964) 266 Cal.App.2d 725, 732.) A “demurrer does not, however,
admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the
pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in
law.” (Ibid. [internal citations omitted].)
Discussion
             Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the moving party
must meet and confer in person, by video conference, or by telephone with the
party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would
resolve the objections to the pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41.) “Any
determination by the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient
shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a)(4).)
Here, counsel for Defendant, Gurpreet
Sandhu (Counsel), declares that on October 26, 2023, Defendant sent Plaintiff a
letter outlining the issues for demurrer. (Sandhu Decl., ¶2). The letter
includes an invitation to provide Defendant with times for a meet and confer
phone call. Counsel declares Plaintiff did not respond. This is sufficient
under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision b which states the
declaration may included that the non-moving party “failed to respond to the
meet and confer request of the demurring part. . .”
Sufficiency of the Allegations
            Government Code section 845.6
(Section 845.6) provides that “a public employee, and the public entity where
the employee is acting within the scope of his employment, is liable if the
employee knows or has reason to know the prisoner is in need of immediate
medical care and he fails to take reasonable action to summon such medical
care.” (Gov. Code, §845.6.)
            California courts have construed the
provision to create limited liability “when: (1) the public employee knows or
has reason to know of the need, (2) of immediate medical care, and (3) fails to
take reasonable action to summon such medical care.” (Castaneda v. Dep’t of
Corr. & Rehab. (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1070 [internal quotations,
brackets and emphasis omitted].)
            Here, Plaintiff has alleged legal
conclusions without sufficient foundational facts to support the claim.
Plaintiff alleges he complained of severe and unrelenting pain, that medical
care was urgently necessary, and that no medical attention was timely given. This
allegation alone, does not demonstrate how it was clear that he required
immediate medical care. In other words, Plaintiff has not alleged how the
public employees knew or had reason to know that he needed immediate
medical care based on his single complaint of severe and unrelenting pain. A
claim under Section 845.6 hinges on the need for immediate medical care which
was “serious and obvious”. (Watson. v. State of California (1993) 212
Cal.App.4th 836, 845 [“Liability under section 845.6 is limited to serious and
obvious medical conditions requiring immediate care]; see also Kinney v.
County of Contra Costa (1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 761 [deciding after trial that a
“jail prisoner’s request of an attendant for something for a headache cannot
reasonably be deemed notice ‘that the prisoner is in need of immediate medical
care.’ ”].) The FAC requires further details to sufficiently appraise Defendant
of the basis of the claim. 
            Defendant also argues that the claim
is insufficiently alleged because it is akin to a claim for negligent provision
of care. (See e.g., Castaneda, supra, 212 Cal.App.4th at p. 1070
[stating that Section 845.6 does not provide liability for “certain employee’s
malpractice in providing that care.”]; Nelson v. State of California
(1982) 139 Cal.App.3d 72, [affirming sustaining demurrer to Section 845.6 claim
for failure to properly treat diabetes].) 
However, the court does not find the claim, as presently alleged, one of
negligent treatment. Plaintiff alleges that he experienced an acute event which
required immediate medical attention; he does not allege that Defendant failed
to properly treat his leg once he received medical attention. The demurrer is
not sustained on this ground. 
Nevertheless, the demurrer is sustained
with leave to amend for failure to allege sufficient facts to support a claim
under Section 845.6.
Government Immunity
            Finally, Defendant argues
Plaintiff’s claim is barred under Section 856.4. Section 856.4 provides that
“neither a public entity nor a public employee acting in the scope of his
employment is liable for an injury resulting from the failure to admit a person
to a public medical facility.” 
This section is inapplicable to the
present complaint where Plaintiff has not based his claim on the failure to
admit him to a hospital but on the decision to deny him immediate necessary medical
attention. Defendant relies in part on Plaintiff’s Government Claim form in
which he states, “[t]he state prison did not adequately diagnose or send
claimant out of its facility for proper and timely treatment urgently
required.” (FAC, Exh 1. at p. 1.) First, in the referenced language, Plaintiff
is still basing the claim on a failure to furnish immediate care. Second, while
the claim form may have alleged some conduct for which Defendant would not be
liable under Nelson (i.e., negligence in providing care), Plaintiff’s
theory which derived from the facts alleged in the claim form and the complaint
is still valid against Defendant. Section 856.4 is inapplicable. 
The demurrer is not sustained on this
ground. 
Conclusions
            Given the liberal standards in
permitting amendment, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. Plaintiff
has thirty days to file an amended complaint. Defendant to give notice.
