The judge granted the defendant's motion for leave to conduct an orthopedic evaluation of the plaintiff, finding that the defendant had shown sufficient cause for the examination. The judge continued the motion for leave to conduct a psychological evaluation of the plaintiff, finding that the parties had not sufficiently met and conferred regarding the scope of the examination. The judge ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding the scope of the psychological examination and to file a declaration with the court confirming compliance with the order or explaining why no meaningful meet and confer occurred.
