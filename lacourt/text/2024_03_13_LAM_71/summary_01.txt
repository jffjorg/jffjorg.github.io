And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Junhua Chen's ex parte application for release of the bond posted by Jimmy Wang in the matter. The bond was required as a condition to filing an appeal of a Labor Commissioner's award, which ordered Jimmy Wang to pay Junhua Chen $49,109.40. The appeal was dismissed on November 21, 2023, and the award has not been paid. The judge finds that Jimmy Wang's bond is forfeited to Junhua Chen under Labor Code 98.2, and orders the bond released. The ruling is based on the plain language of the statute and the case of Tabarrejo v. Superior Court.
