  J. SHRENGER,  
  
         vs.
 
EMMANUEL
  J. DELACRUZ.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV10214
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  March 13, 2024



 
The Court discharges
the Order to Show Cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or
Plaintiff’s counsel sanctioned $250 for failing t to enter default against the
defendant.  
The Court denies Plaintiff’s default judgment packet.  
The Court sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the complaint
should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel sanctioned $250 for failing
to enter default judgment (California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(h)) on April 15,
2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following
reasons:
1.     No
Request for Court Judgment filed on CIV-100 form.
a.      Memorandum
of Costs in included on incorrect form and should be noted on the CIV-100
Request for Court Judgment.
 
2.     No
DOE Dismissal filed.
 
3.     The
request for court judgment does not properly seek an amount that is equal to or
less than the amount sought in the complaint or C.C.P. §425.11 statement of
damages.  (See, e.g., Falahati
v. Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831 [stating court acts in
excess of its jurisdiction and the resulting default judgment is void if the
court awards default judgment in an amount greater than that demanded in the
complaint, including if the complaint does not specify the amount demanded].)  
 
The statement of
damages reserves the right to seek $50,000.00 in punitive damages, but the
request for judgment indicates judgment is for $64,339.62.
