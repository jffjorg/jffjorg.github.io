(Laird v. Blacker (1992) 2 Cal. 4th 606)
```

Summary:

The judge has denied both the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' motion does not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, and that the defendants have not met their burden on summary judgment. The judge concludes that the dispute over whether the plaintiffs' claims are time-barred requires a trial to resolve the factual issues, and that the plaintiffs have not yet suffered an actual injury that would trigger the statute of limitations. The judge also finds that the arbitration award was not a confirmed award and that the plaintiffs' alleged injury did not occur when the arbitrator issued his award.

```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied both the Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend and the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.

The Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend seeks to file a second amended complaint to address the Defendant's statute of limitations defense. However, the Court finds that the Motion does not sufficiently comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's delay in seeking to amend the complaint is inexcusable and would prejudice the Defendant.

The Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment seeks to dismiss the Plaintiff's claims as time-barred. The Court finds that the evidence submitted by the Defendant does not establish when the Plaintiff was injured. The Court also finds that the issue of whether the Plaintiff's injury occurred when the arbitration award was issued is disputed, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.

The Judge notes that the case involves disputed facts, including when the Plaintiff learned of their injury, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied. The Judge also notes that the case involves complex legal issues, including the application of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.6, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.

**Plaintiffs: Kevin Korosh Shahin and Azadeh Tadayon
**Defendant: Fischbach & Fischbach and Joseph S. Fischbach
**Hearing Date: September 21, 2023

**Plaintiffs' Motion: Leave to amend complaint
**Defendant's Motion: Summary judgment
**Court Decision: Both motions denied.

**Summary:**

This case concerns a legal malpractice lawsuit alleging breach of contract, legal malpractice, and breach of fiduciary duty. Plaintiffs allege they suffered damages due to negligence by Defendants, their former lawyers. 
Defendants argue the lawsuit is time-barred.  Plaintiffs argued they needed to amend their complaint to reflect new evidence about Plaintiff Shahin's alleged disability.  
The court found Plaintiffs did not provide a sufficient reason for the delay in seeking the amendment. The court also found there was a dispute of fact about when Plaintiff Shahin discovered his actual injury.  Therefore, summary judgment was denied.

The summary displayed below was created by an LLM named:  "llama3-8b-8192":
Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in Markdown format:

**Case Number:** 21STCV24925
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023
**Department:** 72

**Plaintiffs:** Kevin Korosh Shahin and Azadeh Tadayon
**Defendants:** Fischbach & Fischbach and Joseph S. Fischbach

**Background:**

* Plaintiffs initiated a legal malpractice action against Defendants on July 7, 2021
* The operative First Amended Complaint (FAC) was filed on December 3, 2021, alleging breach of contract, professional negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty
* Defendants filed a cross-complaint on January 3, 2022, alleging quantum meruit, reasonable value of services rendered, and account stated
* Plaintiffs seek leave to file a second amended complaint to address Defendants' statute of limitations defense

**Motion for Leave to Amend:**

* Plaintiffs' motion does not sufficiently comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324
* Plaintiffs' counsel's supporting declaration does not adequately explain why the amendment was not made earlier
* The proposed amendment would not cause prejudice to Defendants, but would require further discovery on Plaintiff Shahin's alleged disability
* Motion is denied

**Motion for Summary Judgment:**

* Defendants move for summary judgment on the grounds that all of Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred by the one-year statute of limitations imposed by Code of Civil Procedure ยง 340.6
* The accrual period began on November 22, 2019, when Defendants were relieved as counsel in the underlying action
* The motion is denied as Defendants have not met their burden on summary judgment
* There are disputed facts about when Plaintiff learned of his injury, and the date of an unconfirmed arbitration award is not necessarily the date of injury

**Significant Statements:**

* "If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend..." (Morgan v. Super. Ct. (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527)
* "Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and 'all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence' and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119)
