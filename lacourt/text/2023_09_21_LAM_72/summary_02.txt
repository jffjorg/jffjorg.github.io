```

Summary:

The judge has denied both the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' motion does not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, and that the defendants have not met their burden on summary judgment. The judge concludes that the dispute over whether the plaintiffs' claims are time-barred requires a trial to resolve the factual issues, and that the plaintiffs have not yet suffered an actual injury that would trigger the statute of limitations. The judge also finds that the arbitration award was not a confirmed award and that the plaintiffs' alleged injury did not occur when the arbitrator issued his award.

```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied both the Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend and the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.

The Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend seeks to file a second amended complaint to address the Defendant's statute of limitations defense. However, the Court finds that the Motion does not sufficiently comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's delay in seeking to amend the complaint is inexcusable and would prejudice the Defendant.

The Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment seeks to dismiss the Plaintiff's claims as time-barred. The Court finds that the evidence submitted by the Defendant does not establish when the Plaintiff was injured. The Court also finds that the issue of whether the Plaintiff's injury occurred when the arbitration award was issued is disputed, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.

The Judge notes that the case involves disputed facts, including when the Plaintiff learned of their injury, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied. The Judge also notes that the case involves complex legal issues, including the application of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.6, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.
