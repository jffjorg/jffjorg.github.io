Summary:

The judge has denied both the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' motion does not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, and that the defendants have not met their burden on summary judgment. The judge concludes that the dispute over whether the plaintiffs' claims are time-barred requires a trial to resolve the factual issues, and that the plaintiffs have not yet suffered an actual injury that would trigger the statute of limitations. The judge also finds that the arbitration award was not a confirmed award and that the plaintiffs' alleged injury did not occur when the arbitrator issued his award.
