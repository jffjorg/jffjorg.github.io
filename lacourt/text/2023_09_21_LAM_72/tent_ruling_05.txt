ROBERT SENG, as Trustee of
  the Mary Lou Walbergh Qualified Personal Residence Trust,
 
                                  Cross-Complainant,
  
         v.
 
 
SONNY ASTANI, an individual;
  BONSALL PROPERTIES LLC, a California Limited Liability Company, and ROES 1
  through 10, 
 
                                  Cross-Defendants.
 


 



 
 
            Defendant Robert Seng demurs to Plaintiff Bonsall
Properties LLC’s complaint on the grounds that each cause of action fails to
state a claim and is uncertain.
 
          The court sustains Defendant’s
demurrer with leave to amend.  Plaintiff
shall amend the complaint within 20 days. 

 
Background
 
          This action arises out of a real
property dispute. Plaintiff Bonsall Properties LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges that
it entered into a written agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Defendant
Robert Seng, as Trustee of the Mary Lou Walbergh Qualified Personal Residence
Trust (“Defendant”) regarding the purchase of real property located at 5838
Bonsall Dr., Malibu, CA 90265 (the “Property”). Plaintiff alleges that it made
a deposit towards the purchase of the Property and that after execution of the Purchase
Agreement, Plaintiff discovered numerous issues with the Property that would
prohibit Plaintiff’s intended development plans for it. Plaintiff also alleges
that the Purchase Agreement provided the Property would be vacant, but that
Plaintiff recently discovered persons occupying the Property with Defendant’s
knowledge and that they occupied the Property at the time of the original
closing and there is no current binding agreement for them to vacate the
Property.
 
          Plaintiff filed this action on
December 29, 2022, alleging causes of action against Defendant for reformation
of contract based on mistake and misrepresentation, and for specific
performance. Defendant filed a cross-complaint on February 1, 2023, alleging
causes of action against Plaintiff and Sonny Astani for breach of contract,
quiet title, declaratory relief, and slander of title.
 
          On February 1, 2023, Defendant
demurred to Plaintiff’s complaint, on the grounds that each cause of action
fails to state a claim and is uncertain. On June 2, 2023, Plaintiff opposed the
demurrer. On June 7, 2023, Defendant replied.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other
pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or
content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Pro., §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function
of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for
purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at
p. 994.) 
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face
of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are
judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,
supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].) 
 
A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is
incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian
North Bay, Inc. v. Super. Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963,
971-72.) The “face of the complaint” includes material contained in
attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s
Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as
true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s
allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]). 
 
A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of
action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,119;
Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
 
Discussion
 
          Preliminarily, the parties met the meet and confer requirements. (Decl.
Fok ¶¶ 3-9.) (Code Civ. Pro. § 430.41, subd. (a).) 
 
          First Cause of Action – Reformation of
Contract – Mistake
 
“A complaint
for reformation based
on mutual mistake
must allege facts showing
how the mistake
was made, whose mistake
it was,
and what brought it
about, so that the mutuality
may appear…
If the mistake was unilateral, which the other
at the time knew or suspected… the complaint must allege supporting facts, and
the plaintiff may not rely on conclusory allegations.” (Komorsky v. Farmers Ins. Exch. (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th
960, 974-975). “A mistake of fact may be the basis for reformation of a written
agreement only if the mistake is material to the agreement.” (Cottle v. Gibbon (1962) 200 Cal.App.2d
1, 8) 
 
The complaint lacks
allegations detailing how the alleged mistake was made, whose mistake it was,
and what brought it about. (Komorsky, supra, at pp. 974-975.) The extent
of the allegations regarding the alleged mistake are simply that Plaintiff
discovered problems with developing the Property after executing the Purchase
Agreement. (Compl., ¶¶ 11-12.) These allegations are insufficient because they
do not satisfy the criteria set forth in Komorsky for mutual mistake. (Komorsky,
supra, at pp. 974-975.) The court finds that the Complaint fails to allege
sufficient facts to state a cause of action for reformation of contract by
mistake.
 
The court sustains
the demurrer as to this cause of action with leave to amend.
 
          “[D]emurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a
defendant cannot reasonably respond.”  (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848, fn. 3, citing Lickiss
v. Fin. Indus. Regulatory Auth. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.)  In addition, even where a complaint is in
some respects uncertain, courts strictly construe a demurrer for uncertainty
“because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  
 
          Here, the pleading is not so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond. 
 
Thus, the court
overrules the demurrer as to this cause of action on this ground. 
 
          Second Cause of Action – Reformation
of Contract – Misrepresentation
 
The elements of an action for fraud and
deceit based on a concealment are:
(1) the defendant must have concealed or
suppressed a material fact, (2) the
defendant must have been under a duty to
disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3)
the defendant must have intentionally
concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the
plaintiff must have been unaware of the
fact and would not have acted as he did
if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) because of the
concealment or suppression of the fact,
the plaintiff must have sustained
damage.” (Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc.
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248)
 
The complaint lacks
allegations that Defendant had the duty to disclose that Plaintiff could
lawfully occupy and further develop the improvements. It also lacks allegations
that Defendant intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent
to defraud the plaintiff. The complaint further lacks allegations that Plaintiff
was unaware and would not have acted as it did had it known of the concealed or
suppressed fact and that because of the concealment or suppression of the fact,
the plaintiff must have sustained damage. 
 
The court sustains
the demurrer as to this cause of action with leave to amend.
 
          As discussed above, demurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored and are granted only if the pleading is so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.  (Mahan
v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency, Inc., supra, 14 Cal.App.5th 841 at p. 848,
fn. 3.)  In addition, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, courts strictly construe a demurrer
for uncertainty “because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc., supra, 14 Cal.App.4th 612 at p. 616.)  
 
          Here, the pleading is not so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond. 
 
Thus, the court
overrules the demurrer as to this cause of action on this ground. 
 
          Third Cause of Action – Specific
Performance
 
“To obtain specific
performance after a breach
of contract, a plaintiff must generally show: ‘(1)
contract breach; (2) the inadequacy of legal remedy; (3) an underlying contract
that is both reasonable and supported
by adequate consideration;
(4) the existence
of a mutuality
of remedies; (5) contractual terms
which are sufficiently
definite to enable
the court to know
what it is to enforce; and (6) a substantial similarity
of the requested performance to that promised in the contract.’” (Real Est. Analytics, LLC v. Vallas (2008) 160
Cal.App.4th 463, 472.) The buyer in a suit for specific performance must show
that he or she paid, offered to pay, or is willing and able to pay the purchase
price if specific performance is awarded. (Buckmaster v. Bertram (1921)
186 Cal. 673, 677.)
 
The court finds that
the complaint fails to allege facts to state a claim for specific performance
because Plaintiff has not alleged a breach of contract. 
 
The court sustains
the demurrer as to this cause of action with leave to amend.
 
          As discussed above, demurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored and are granted only if the pleading is so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond.  (Mahan
v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency, Inc., supra, 14 Cal.App.5th 841 at p. 848,
fn. 3.)  In addition, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, courts strictly construe a demurrer
for uncertainty “because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc., supra, 14 Cal.App.4th 612 at p. 616.)  
 
          Here, the pleading is not so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond. 
 
Thus, the court
overrules the demurrer as to this cause of action on this ground.

                                  Cross-Defendants.
 


 



 
            Cross-Defendants demur to the breach of contract and
quiet title causes of action on the grounds that that they do not state facts
sufficient to constitute causes of action and they are uncertain.
 
          The court overrules cross-defendants’
demurrer to both causes of action.
 
Background
 
          This action arises out of a real
property dispute. Plaintiff Bonsall Properties LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges that
it entered into a written agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Defendant
Robert Seng, as Trustee of the Mary Lou Walbergh Qualified Personal Residence
Trust (“Defendant”) regarding the purchase of real property located at 5838
Bonsall Dr., Malibu, CA 90265 (the “Property”). Plaintiff alleges that it made
a deposit towards the purchase of the Property and that after execution of the
Purchase Agreement, Plaintiff discovered numerous issues with the Property that
would prohibit Plaintiff’s intended development plans for it. Plaintiff also
alleges that the Purchase Agreement provided the Property would be vacant, but
that Plaintiff recently discovered persons occupying the Property with
Defendant’s knowledge and that they occupied the Property at the time of the
original closing and there is no current binding agreement for them to vacate
the Property.
 
          Plaintiff filed this action on
December 29, 2022, alleging causes of action against Defendant for reformation
of contract based on mistake and misrepresentation, and for specific
performance. Defendant filed a cross-complaint on February 1, 2023, alleging
causes of action against Plaintiff and Sonny Astani for breach of contract,
quiet title, declaratory relief, and slander of title.
 
          On March 9, 2023, Cross-Defendants
Bonsall Properties LLC and Sonny Astani demurred to the breach of contract and
quiet title cause of action in the cross-complaint. On June 22, 2023,
Cross-Complainant Robert Seng opposed. On September 14, 2023, Cross-Defendants
replied.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other
pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or
content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or
cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Pro., §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function
of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for
purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are
assumed to be true. (Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at
p. 994.) 
 
A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face
of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are
judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,
supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be
considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting
demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal
v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider
contents of release not part of court record].)  Where written documents are the
foundation of an action and are attached to the complaint and incorporated
therein by reference, they become a part of the complaint and may be considered
on demurrer. (Byrne v.
Harvey (1962) 211
Cal.App.2d 92, 103.) The complaint must be construed liberally by drawing
reasonable inferences from the facts pleaded. (Flynn v. Higham (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 677, 679.)
 
A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is
incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian
North Bay, Inc. v. Super. Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963,
971-72.) The “face of the complaint” includes material contained in
attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s
Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as
true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s
allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”]). 
 
A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of
action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,119;
Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
 
Discussion
 
          Preliminarily, the parties did not meet the meet and confer
requirements because they did not meet by telephone or in person. (Decl. Hooks
¶¶ 2-4.) (Code Civ. Pro. § 430.41, subd. (a).) 
 
          First Cause of Action – Breach of
Contract
 
               To state a cause of action for breach of contract,
Plaintiff must be able to establish (1) the existence of the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach,
and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff. (Oasis West Realty, LLC v.
Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) The facts alleging a
breach must be pleaded with specificity. (Levy v. State Farm Mutual Auto
Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1, 5.) General allegations of due
performance may not suffice if the facts as alleged do not constitute due
performance. (Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990)
222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1389-1390.) 
 
If a breach of contract
claim “is based on alleged breach of a written contract, the terms must be set
out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written agreement
must be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman
& Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances, a
plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its
precise language.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty
Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199.) 
 
          Here, Cross-Defendant argues that Cross-Complainant
did not adequately plead the second element, plaintiff’s performance or excuse
for nonperformance, because Cross-Defendant does not address whether the issue
of a tenant on the property has been resolved. Cross-Defendant further argues
that the issue of a tenant on the property is a material breach of the parties’
agreement and relevant to the question of Cross-Complainant’s performance of
the terms of the agreement. 
 
          Nowhere does Cross-Complaint allege
the presence of a tenant on the property. As discussed above, a demurrer
can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading
under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co., supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No
other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson,
supra, 110 Cal.App.3d at p. 881.)
 
          In its reply, Cross-Complainant argues
that the court can and should take judicial notice of the existence of a tenant
on the property, but Cross-Complaint has not requested judicial notice of this
or any matter. 
 
          Thus, the court overrules
Cross-Defendant’s demurrer as to breach of contract on this ground. 
 
            “[D]emurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and are
granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot
reasonably respond.”  (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848, fn. 3, citing Lickiss
v. Fin. Indus. Regulatory Auth. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.)  In addition, even where a complaint is in
some respects uncertain, courts strictly construe a demurrer for uncertainty
“because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  
 
          Here, the pleading is not so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond. 
 
          Thus, the court overrules the
Cross-Defendant’s demurrer to breach of contract on this ground too. 
 
          Second Cause of Action – Quiet Title 
 
In an action for quiet title, Plaintiff must plead (1)
“[a] description of the property that is the subject of the action,”
specifically the location of tangible personal property and the legal
description and street address or common designation of real property, (2)
“[t]he title of the plaintiff as to which a determination under this chapter is
sought and the basis of the title,” (3) “[t]he adverse claims to the title of
the plaintiff against which a determination is sought,” (4) “[t]he date as of
which the determination is sought,” and (5) “[a] prayer for the determination
of the title of the plaintiff against the adverse claims.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
761.020.) 
 
Here, Cross-Defendant argues that Cross-Complainant
has only named Sonny Astani and Bonsall Properties, LLC as cross-defendants and
not the tenant occupying the property. For the same reasons discussed above, the
demurrer as to quiet title is overruled. 
 
          Additionally,
like the above, the pleading is
not so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond. 
 
Thus, the court overrules the Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer to quiet title on this ground too.

The
Court continues the Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens to December 21, 2023 and sets
a Case Management Conference for the same day. 

 
Background

 
          This action arises out of a real
property dispute. Plaintiff Bonsall Properties LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges that
it entered into a written agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Defendant
Robert Seng, as Trustee of the Mary Lou Walbergh Qualified Personal Residence
Trust (“Defendant”) regarding the purchase of real property located at 5838
Bonsall Dr., Malibu, CA 90265 (the “Property”). Plaintiff alleges that it made
a deposit towards the purchase of the Property and that after execution of the Purchase
Agreement, Plaintiff discovered numerous issues with the Property that would
prohibit Plaintiff’s intended development plans for it. Plaintiff also alleges
that the Purchase Agreement provided the Property would be vacant, but that
Plaintiff recently discovered persons occupying the Property with Defendant’s
knowledge and that they occupied the Property at the time of the original
closing and there is no current binding agreement for them to vacate the
Property.
 
          Plaintiff filed this action on
December 29, 2022, alleging causes of action against Defendant for reformation
of contract based on mistake and misrepresentation, and for specific
performance. Defendant filed a cross-complaint on February 1, 2023, alleging
causes of action against Plaintiff and Sonny Astani for breach of contract,
quiet title, declaratory relief, and slander of title.
 
          On March 24, 2023, Defendant filed a
motion to expunge lis pendens and for an award of attorney’s fees and costs of
$3,054.43. On June 2, 2023, Plaintiff opposed the Motion. On June 7, 2023,
Defendant replied.
 
Legal
Standard
 
“A lis pendens is a recorded document giving
constructive notice that an action has been filed affecting title or right to
possession of the real property described in the notice.¿A lis pendens may be
filed by any party in an action who asserts a ‘real property claim.’”¿(Kirkeby
v. Super. Ct. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 642, 647.) Real property claim’ means the cause or
causes of action in a pleading which would, if meritorious, affect (a) title
to, or the right to possession of, specific real property or (b) the use of an
easement identified in the pleading, other than an easement obtained pursuant
to statute by any regulated public utility. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.4.) 
 
With exceptions not applicable here, “[a]t any time
after notice of pendency of action has been recorded, any party, or any
nonparty with an interest in the real property affected thereby, may apply to
the court in which the action is pending to expunge the notice.”¿(Code Civ.
Proc., § 405.30.) “[T]he court shall order that the notice be expunged if the
court finds that the claimant has not established by a preponderance of the
evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., §
405.32.) “Unlike most other motions, when a motion to expunge is brought, the
burden is on the party opposing the motion to show the existence of a real
property claim.”¿(Kirkeby, supra, 33 Cal.4th at 647.) 
 
“The
expungement statutes provide that a lis pendens may be expunged on three
grounds: (1) ‘the pleading on which the notice is based does not contain a real
property claim’ (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.31); (2) ‘the claimant has not
established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the
real property claim’ (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.32); or (3) ‘adequate relief can
be secured to the claimant by the giving of an undertaking’ (Code Civ. Proc., §
405.33).” (Carr v. Rosien (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 845, 857.) Probable
validity is met when the Plaintiff establishes his claim by a preponderance of
the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.32.) 
 
The party prevailing on
an expungement motion must be awarded
reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in making or opposing the motion unless the court finds the other party acted with
“substantial justification” or that other circumstances make the imposition of
attorney fees and costs “unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.38.) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant
filed this Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens based on Code of Civil Procedure
sections 405.32 and 405.33, which seek to expunge Plaintiff’s lis pendens
recorded against the property based on Plaintiff’s purported inability to prove
claims in the complaint. However, considering that the court has sustained
Defendant’s demurrer with leave to amend as to each cause of action, there is
presently no cause of action to assess the Motion against.  The Court will be in a better position to
assess the parties’ arguments and counterarguments when the pleadings are set.
 
Accordingly,
the Court continues this motion to December 21, 2023.  The Court also sets a case management
conference for the same day.
