```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is requesting the parties to argue their positions on three grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings raised by CalPERS. The three grounds are: 1) the court lacks jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief because the action against CalPERS is barred by collateral estoppel, 2) the court lacks jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief because the plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and 3) the Fourth Cause of Action fails because the First and Second Causes of Action have been dismissed against the City of Beverly Hills, not CalPERS. The judge asks CalPERS to address the nature of this argument, as the First and Second Causes of Action appear to have been dismissed only against the City of Beverly Hills, not against CalPERS. The judge does not agree with the plaintiffs that a motion for judgment on the pleadings is not the correct forum for the arguments presented here. The judge will hear arguments from CalPERS and then from the plaintiffs separately on each of the three arguments.

## English Text Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Beverly Hills Police Officers’ Association v. City of Beverly Hills. 

The judge does not agree with the plaintiffs that a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is inappropriate. The judge believes that CalPERS can raise its arguments in this manner.  

The judge requests that both parties argue their positions on three specific grounds raised by CalPERS in its motion for judgment on the pleadings. These grounds include:

1.  Whether the court lacks jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief against CalPERS due to collateral estoppel
2.  Whether the court lacks jurisdiction because plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies.
3.  Whether the Fourth Cause of Action fails because the First and Second Causes of Action were dismissed against the City of Beverly Hills.

The judge will hear arguments from CalPERS first, followed by the plaintiffs, on each of these three points.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court does not agree with the Plaintiffs that a Motion For Judgment on the Pleadings is not the correct forum for the arguments presented. The Court believes that Defendant CalPERS can raise its arguments through a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Court requests the parties to argue their positions on three grounds raised by CalPERS, which are:

1. Lack of jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief due to collateral estoppel.
2. Lack of jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief due to failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
3. Failure of the Fourth Cause of Action due to the dismissal of the First and Second Causes of Action against the City of Beverly Hills, not against CalPERS.

The Court asks CalPERS to address the nature of this argument, as the dismissals appear to be only against the City of Beverly Hills, not against CalPERS. The Court will hear argument first from CalPERS and then from Plaintiffs separately on each of these three arguments.
