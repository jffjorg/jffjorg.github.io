And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is requesting the parties to argue their positions on three grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings raised by CalPERS. The three grounds are: 1) the court lacks jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief because the action against CalPERS is barred by collateral estoppel, 2) the court lacks jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief because the plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and 3) the Fourth Cause of Action fails because the First and Second Causes of Action have been dismissed against the City of Beverly Hills, not CalPERS. The judge asks CalPERS to address the nature of this argument, as the First and Second Causes of Action appear to have been dismissed only against the City of Beverly Hills, not against CalPERS. The judge does not agree with the plaintiffs that a motion for judgment on the pleadings is not the correct forum for the arguments presented here. The judge will hear arguments from CalPERS and then from the plaintiffs separately on each of the three arguments.
