MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL FOR SIMS 
 
          In connection with the motion to be relieved as counsel for Sims,
Kazandjian declares that: (1) his office was notified by Defendants of another
lawsuit already filed on behalf of Plaintiffs against Defendant Irene Terrell;
(2) the other case was filed on August 31, 2022 in LASC Case No. 22STCV28503;
(3) since then, his office has made several attempts to contact Plaintiffs and
their other counsel representing them in LASC Case No. 22STCV28503; (4)
Plaintiffs have failed to respond at all; and (5) Plaintiffs’ other counsel has
failed to respond to his office since March 20, 2023 despite several attempts
via e-mail and phone.  Kazandjian further
declares that his office and Plaintiff have experienced a breakdown in
communications. 
 
          The
Court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the
client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
 
          In
light of the above facts, the Court GRANTS Kazandjian’s motion to be relieved
as counsel for Sims. 
 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL FOR FIKES

Kazandjian’s declaration in support of the motion to be relieved as counsel as
to Sims and incorporates it herein.  The
declaration of Kazandjian in support of the motions are substantively identical.

light of the above facts, the Court GRANTS Kazandjian’s motion to be relieved
as counsel for Fikes pursuant to Ramirez v. Sturdevant, supra, 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.
 
          Kazandjian
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
