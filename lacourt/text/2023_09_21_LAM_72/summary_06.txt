## English Summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling denying the Law Offices of Early Sullivan Wright Gizer and McRae's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, MAZAKODA, INC. The denial is without prejudice, meaning the law firm can refile the motion if they correct the deficiencies.

The court found the motion deficient because it did not include the required documents: a declaration on form MC-052 explaining the reasons for the withdrawal and a proposed order on form MC-053. Additionally, the proof of service showed that Plaintiff was not properly served with the motion.  

Therefore, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, urging the law firm to refile with the necessary documents and proper service.
