No tentative.  The Court requests arguments from the parties
in accordance with the guidance below.
 
The Court does not
agree with Plaintiffs that a Motion For Judgment on the Pleadings is not the
correct forum for the arguments presented here. 
The Court believes that Defendant CalPERS can raise the arguments that
they have raised by means of a motion for judgment on the pleadings.
 
The Court therefore
asks the parties to argue as cogently and succinctly as possible their
positions on the three grounds for motion for judgment on the pleadings raised
by CalPers.  The Court will hear argument
first from Defendant CalPERS and then from Plaintiffs separately on each of
these three arguments (i.e., switching back and forth between CalPERS and Plaintiffs
on each of the arguments):
 
1.    
 CalPERS’ argument that the Court
lacks jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief because Plaintiffs’ action
against CALPERS is barred by collateral estoppel.
2.    
CalPERS’ argument that the Court lacks jurisdiction to grant declaratory
relief because Plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies.
3.    
CalPERS’ argument that the Fourth Cause of Action fails because the First
and Second Causes of Action have been dismissed against CalPERS.  The Court asks CalPERS to address, among
other things, the nature of this argument, as the First and Second Causes of
Action appear to have been dismissed only against the City of Beverly Hills,
not against CalPERS.
