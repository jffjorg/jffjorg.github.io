TENTATIVE RULING
 



MAZAKODA, INC., 
 
                                  Plaintiff,
  
         v.
 
SHAWN SHARON MELAMED, et al.,
 
                                  Defendants.
 
 


 Case No:  BC707954
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 21, 2023
 Calendar
  Number:  6



 
 
 
The Law Offices of Early Sullivan Wright Gizer
and McRae (“Moving Party”) filed a motion (the “Motion”) to be relieved as counsel
for Plaintiff.   
 
The Court DENIES the Motion without prejudice.
 
 
Background 
 
          On July 18, 2023, Moving Party filed the Motion.  In support of the Motion, Moving Party has
only provided the Court with an MC-051 form and a copy of a Notice of Motion
for Leave to Withdraw as Counsel filed in United States Bankruptcy Court. 
 
Discussion
 
          California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(c) provides that “[t]he motion to be
relieved as counsel must be accompanied by a declaration” set forth on form
MC-052.  A declaration in support of a
motion to be relieved as counsel must state in general terms why a motion under
Code Civ. Proc. § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent pursuant to Code
Civ. Proc. § 284(1).  (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362(c).)  In support of a
motion to be relieved as counsel, the moving party must prepare a proposed
order on form MC-053 and lodge such form with the court with the moving papers
pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(e).  “The notice of motion and motion, the
declaration, and the proposed order must be served on the client and all other
parties who have appeared in the case.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362(d).) 

 
          Here,
the Motion is deficient as it does not comply with California Rules of Court,
Rules 3.1362(c) and 3.1362(e).  Moving
Party failed to file and serve a form MC-052 and form MC-053 in support of the
Motion. Additionally, upon review of the proof of service as to the Motion,
there is no indication that Plaintiff was served in accordance with California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1362(d). 
 
          The
Court therefore DENIES the Motion without prejudice. 
           
Moving Party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
