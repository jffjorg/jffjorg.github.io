And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions to be relieved as counsel for two plaintiffs, Nickiah Sims and Danny Fikes, who are represented by Attorney Haig B. Kazandjian. The motions are granted. The judge notes that Kazandjian's office has attempted to contact the plaintiffs and their other counsel regarding a separate lawsuit filed against Defendant Irene Terrell, but the plaintiffs and their other counsel have failed to respond. The judge cites California law and a previous court decision to justify granting the motions, stating that an attorney can withdraw from representation if there is a breakdown in communication and withdrawal would not prejudice the client. The judge orders Kazandjian to give notice of this ruling.
