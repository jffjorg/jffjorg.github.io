This tentative ruling addresses two motions filed by attorney Haig B. Kazandjian to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Nickiah Sims and Danny Fikes in case number 22STCV38834.  

The Judge grants both motions. Kazandjian explains in his declarations that his office has been unable to effectively communicate with Plaintiffs and their other counsel representing them in a separate lawsuit against Defendant Irene Terrell.  Despite multiple attempts to contact them, Plaintiffs and their other counsel have not responded.  

The Judge notes that while a court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, a motion to withdraw will not be granted if it would prejudice the client. However, based on the facts presented, the Court finds that granting Kazandjian's motions will not prejudice the clients.
