And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery, ordering the defendant to produce all responsive documents in accordance with its prior statement of compliance. The court also awards the plaintiff reasonable monetary sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $1,050.00.

The court finds that the defendant failed to produce all responsive documents, despite its prior agreement to do so. The court further finds that the defendant's objections to discovery were unfounded and that the plaintiff had diligently pursued discovery in order to prepare its opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment.

The court concludes that the defendant shall provide documents responsive to the plaintiff's request for production, Nos. 9-12, and that the plaintiff shall be awarded monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,050.00.
