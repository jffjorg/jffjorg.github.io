   [1]In  24STCP01502, in a unitary pleading, since Reeser has filed both a Petition and  a Complaint, he is proceeding both as a Petitioner and Plaintiff. However,  since this special motion to strike is only directed to portions of the Complaint,  Reeser will be referred to as Plaintiff. Similarly, Tyrnauer is proceeding both  as Respondent and Defendants, but will only be referred to as Defendant in this  ruling. Â
