```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the complaint with 20 days' leave to amend. The court found that the plaintiff's complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and was uncertain, making it difficult for the defendant to respond. The court also noted that the plaintiff's opposition brief was oversized and declined to consider it. The court further noted that the plaintiff's complaint did not specify whether the contract at issue was written, oral, or implied, and that the plaintiff's claims were not supported by any facts. The court granted the defendant's demurrer and allowed the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.
