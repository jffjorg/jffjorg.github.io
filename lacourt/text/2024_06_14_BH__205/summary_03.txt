And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories and requests for production in a case arising from alleged fraud surrounding the sale of a home. The Plaintiff, Mark Lange, entered into a written purchase agreement with the Defendants, Sandra Hanover Ebner and Steven Ebner, individually and as trustees of the Ebner and Hanover Trust, for a home located in Malibu, California. The Defendants failed to disclose defects in the home's septic tank system. The Court denied the Defendants' motion to compel arbitration and the Defendants appealed. The Court concludes that the stay of discovery should be lifted to allow the Plaintiff to take the deposition of Russell Mosser, a key witness in the case. The stay of discovery remains in place as to other discovery requests. The Court grants in part and denies in part the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses.
