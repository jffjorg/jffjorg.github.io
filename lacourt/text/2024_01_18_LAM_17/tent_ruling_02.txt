KRISTOPHER
  MALTES, et al. 
                           
         vs.
 
GENERAL
  MOTORS, LLC  
 
 


 Case No.: 
  21STCV10865 
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  January 18, 2024



 
Defendant’s
motion to tax costs is DENIED. 
 
On 3/19/2021,
Kristopher Maltes and Carrie Maltes (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed suit
against General Motors, LLC, alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act.
 
Now, Defendant
moves to tax Plaintiff’s costs.
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
claims $1,841.40 in costs. Defendant contends that $681.35 of these costs
should be taxed.
 
            After
review, the Court disagrees. 
 
            There
is no dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing party, and thus is entitled to
recover costs. (Civ. Code § 1794(d).)
 
            However,
Defendant objects to the following costs: 
 
(1)  $150.00
for “Jury Fees.”
(2)  $83.70
for “Witness List; Jury Instructions.”
(3)  $147.65
for “Preparation for Trial Binders”
(4)  $272.50
for costs associated with Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further Discovery
Responses and Reply in Support of MTC ($162.90) and their Motions in Limine
($109.60)
(5)  $27.50
in “Email re Settlement” costs for remote hearings.
 
 
As for Nos.
1-3, Defendant contends that the case did not go to trial, and thus these costs
were unnecessary. However, Defendant made its 998 Offer on the day of trial. As
such, if Plaintiffs did not pay the jury fees, they would have waived right to
a jury trial. Similarly, they were obligated to prepare a witness list, jury
instructions, and trial binders, in light of the timing.
 
As for No. 4,
Defendant contends that these motion fees were optional costs. However, the
Court partially granted Plaintiffs’ motion to compel, and given the timing of
the 998 Offer, it was not unreasonable for Plaintiffs to file motions in
limine. 
 
As for No. 5,
Defendant contends that “[h]earing attendance is a cost of doing business as an
attorney and properly treated as overhead, and such a cost is not properly
billable to Plaintiffs and therefore should not be billed to GM.” (7, 13-15.)
However, Defendant does not adequately explain why this email from mediation
explaining the settlement is overhead and was not necessary to the litigation.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s motion to tax costs is denied. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
