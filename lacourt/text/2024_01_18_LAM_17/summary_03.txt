And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Defendant Santa Cerritos, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment. The case involves a breach of contract dispute between Icon Identity Solutions, Inc. (Plaintiff) and Santa Cerritos, Inc. et al. (Defendant) regarding construction work performed on a project in Santa Cerritos, California.

The Judge finds that Defendant's evidence raises a triable issue of material fact as to whether Plaintiff was properly licensed with the California Contractors State License Board (CSLB) at all times that they allegedly performed work on the project. The Judge also finds that Defendant's evidence raises a triable issue of material fact as to whether the subcontractors hired by Plaintiff were properly licensed.

The Judge notes that Plaintiff's evidence supports a reasonable inference that Mr. Rymarcsuk, the alleged Responsible Managing Employee (RME) of Icon, was employed by Icon and was a qualified RME. However, the Judge also notes that Defendant's evidence raises a triable issue of material fact as to whether Mr. Rymarcsuk was a sham RME.

The Judge also finds that Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied due to the triable issues of material fact raised by the parties' evidence. The case will proceed to trial.
