TENTATIVE RULING
 



VERNON FIFTY TWO, LLC 
 
        
  vs.
 
VERNON
  PROPERTIES, INC., et al.
 


 Case
  No.:  BC424856
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: January 18, 2024



 
 
Barani’s
Claim of Exemption is CONTINUED, to allow her to file supplemental materials
consistent with the ruling set forth below. 
 
On
10/27/2009, Plaintiff Vernon Fifty-Two, LLC (Plaintiff) filed suit against
Vernon Properties, Inc. and Azar Barani, alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2)
fraud; (3) conversion; and (4) alter ego liability.
 
Now, the parties
move for a consideration of Defendant’s Claim of Exemption. 
 
Legal Standard
 
At a hearing on a claim of exemption, “the
[judgment debtor] has the burden of proof” in demonstrating that the property
claimed exempt is indeed exempt. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 703.520, subd. (b),
703.580, subds. (b), (c).) In meeting this burden, the judgment debtor must
establish the right by evidence or facts; an affidavit which merely follows the
language of the statute and states nothing more than conclusions of law is
insufficient.¿(Le Font v.¿Rankin¿(1959)¿167¿Cal.App.2d 433, 435.) Generally, "common necessaries of
life" means essentials commonly required by all persons for the sustenance
of life, whatever their employment status and includes medical care. (J. J.
MacIntyre Co. v. Duren (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d Supp. 16, 18-19.) 
 
“Within 10 days
after service of the notice of claim of exemption, a judgment creditor who
opposes the claim of exemption shall file with the court a notice of opposition
to the claim of exemption and a notice of motion for an order determining the
claim of exemption and shall file with the levying officer a copy of the notice
of opposition and a copy of the notice of motion. Upon the filing of the copies
of the notice of opposition and notice of motion, the levying officer shall
promptly file the claim of exemption with the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
703.550.)¿ 
 
Discussion 
 
            Here,
Defendant claims:
 
I hereby
declare that the funds withdrawn in the amount $249,295.20 from my personal
accounts with Wells Fargo Bank under acct #1839543293, #1244841423, and
#1244767446 are exempt pursuant to 704.220, 704.225, and 704.050
 
All funds
within the Wells Fargo Bank under acct #1839543293, #1244841423, #1244767446,
are exempted subject to standard of adequate care for myself and my disabled
mother of 92 years of age living with me. Those funds are used to pay for food,
housing, utilities clothing, for myself and my disabled 92 year old dependent,
Maryam Barani. Those funds also provide for the medical care for my disabled
mother. My mother is subject to a wheelchair and walker and suffers from high
blood pressure. I am her sole caretaker. My mother makes no income other than
her social security. In addition, I am currently unemployed. I require all
funds to provide for her and my care.
 
            (Barani
Decl., ¶¶ 2, 3.) 
 
            Defendant
further claims:
 
Defendant
further states that the funds withdrawn in the amount of $281,296.35 from Chase
Bank under acct #000000407698369 are funds held for the benefit of a third
party.
            
            (Barani
Decl., ¶ 2.)
 
            However,
first, Defendant’s Notice is not accompanied by any supporting documentation.
Such documentation is especially necessary to corroborate monthly expenses such
as $875.00 on utilities and telephone, $450 on clothing, and $650 on
entertainment. Moreover, Plaintiff contends that “[Barani’s] elderly mother
received her own income from SSI and also has almost $15,000 in other
accounts.” (Opp., 3:10-11.)  As such,
Barani must specifically explain why the income and funds her mother has are
insufficient to cover her care. 
 
Second, as
for the CCP section 704.220 exemption, the money in Barani’s account far
exceeds the Region 1 Standard, which is $560 for 2 eligible needy persons and
$341 for 1. 
 
The CCP
704.220 exemption covers:
 
(a)  
Money in the judgment debtor’s deposit
account in an amount equal to or less than the minimum basic standard of adequate
care for a family of four for Region 1, established by Section 11452 of the
Welfare and Institutions Code and as annually adjusted by the State Department
of Social Services pursuant to Section 11453 of the Welfare and Institutions
Code, is exempt without making a claim.
 
Third, the
exemption under CCP section 704.050 cover health aids, and Barani’s Claim
provides no indication as to what medical devices are needed and why funds
already available or insurance cannot cover these items.  
 
The Court
will provide Barani one final opportunity to establish an entitlement to an
exemption. In particular, Barani must set forth documentation to corroborate
her claimed expenses, must detail and support the expenses she incurs on
behalf of her mother, and must show that her months SSI income and funds are
insufficient to provide her care. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Barani’s Claim of Exemption is continued. 
 
It is so ordered.
