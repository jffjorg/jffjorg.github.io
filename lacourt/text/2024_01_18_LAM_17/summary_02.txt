And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies Defendant General Motors, LLC's motion to tax costs of $681.35, which was objected to by the Defendant. The Plaintiff, Kristopher Maltes and Carrie Maltes, are the prevailing party in this case and are entitled to recover costs. The Court disagrees with the Defendant's objections to certain costs, including jury fees, witness list costs, preparation for trial binder costs, motion fees, and email costs. The Court finds that these costs were necessary due to the timing of the case and the Defendant's 998 Offer on the day of trial. The Defendant's motion to tax costs is denied, and the Plaintiff is entitled to recover their total costs of $1,841.40.
