And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Vernon Fifty-Two, LLC vs. Vernon Properties, Inc. and Azar Barani. The case involves a claim of exemption by Barani, who claims that funds withdrawn from her personal accounts are exempt from being used to pay off a judgment debt. The judge has continued Barani's Claim of Exemption to allow her to provide additional documentation to support her claimed expenses. Specifically, the judge is requiring Barani to provide documentation to corroborate her claimed expenses, to detail and support the expenses she incurs on behalf of her disabled mother, and to show that her mother's income and funds are insufficient to cover her care. The judge has also indicated that Barani's Claim of Exemption must be supported by evidence or facts, and that an affidavit that merely follows the language of the statute and states nothing more than conclusions of law is insufficient. The judge has given Barani one final opportunity to establish an entitlement to an exemption, and has indicated that if all parties submit on the tentative, the court will adopt it as the final order.
