The tentative ruling denies the Petition to Confirm Minor's Compromise. The Court notes that the Defendant is in default status and default has not been vacated. No motion to set aside default has been filed. Additionally, the case is over five years old, which is a basis for dismissal under CCP 583.310. The Court also denies the petition because the Plaintiff has not corrected the deficiencies noted in previous hearings. The Court has calendared an OSC for dismissal for delay and an OSC for failure to enter default judgment in 35 days. The Clerk is directed to give notice.
