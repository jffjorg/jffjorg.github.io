Here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Tamara Bitner in a case between TAMARA BITNER (plaintiff) and CITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al (defendants). The defendants, Jeffrey R. Houze and Rachel A. Deutsch, have moved for summary judgment, arguing that they do not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff because they did not own or control the sidewalk area where the plaintiff fell. The court has granted the motion for summary judgment.

The court has found that the defendants presented sufficient evidence to show that they did not create the uplift in the sidewalk where the plaintiff tripped, and they did not own or control the sidewalk. The burden has shifted to the plaintiff to present triable issues of fact, but the plaintiff has failed to do so.

The court has also considered the Los Angeles Municipal Code, section 62.104, which imposes a duty on the owners or occupants of abutting land to repair or reconstruct sidewalks. However, the court has found that this section does not impose liability on the defendants in clear and unambiguous language, and therefore, the plaintiff has failed to present any evidence to create triable issues of fact as to whether the defendants owed a duty to the plaintiff.
