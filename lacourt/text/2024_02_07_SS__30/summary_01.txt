And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion to substitute successors in interest. The motion was filed by Martha, the sister of the deceased plaintiff Miguel, who passed away since the filing of the complaint. Martha wants to substitute as the successor in interest to Miguel's causes of action. The judge granted the motion because Martha filed a declaration that satisfies the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32(a), and attached a certified copy of Miguel's death certificate as required by section 377.32(c). The judge orders the moving party to give notice.
