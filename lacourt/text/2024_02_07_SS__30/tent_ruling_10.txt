To date, no motion to set aside the default has been filed. Thus, no petition to confirm settlement can be granted. Notwithstanding the above, the petition would be denied because Plaintiff has filed no paperwork that corrects the deficiencies noted by the Court in the last few hearings. Further, the case is over five years old.  CCP 583.310.
