And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's unopposed motion to file a cross-complaint for express and implied indemnity against the codefendants. The cross-complaint arises out of the same occurrence as the main action, a trip-and-fall incident. The court finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence. The defendant argues that discovery and investigation have shown that the codefendants exercised custody and control over the plaza, and therefore, they are liable for the incident. Since no party has opposed the motion, the court grants the motion without requiring any evidence of bad faith. The court orders the defendant to file and serve the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days of the hearing date. The trial setting conference is continued to the hearing date of the last summary judgment motion.
