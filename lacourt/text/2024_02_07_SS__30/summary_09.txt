And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to strike portions of the complaint. The defendant, Sun Hee Suh dba Top Learning Center and Kyung Joon Min, moved to strike the complaint on the grounds that it fails to state a claim for punitive damages. However, the judge finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges conduct that would allow for punitive damages. The complaint alleges that the defendant's tutor, Min, physically abused a 13-year-old boy, Serrano, by grabbing and pulling him by the arm, striking him in the head, and poking his forehead with his finger. The judge concludes that this conduct was carried on with willful and conscious disregard of the rights of the child and is sufficient to show that the defendant was guilty of malice. Therefore, the motion to strike is denied.
