 Case Number:  22STCV33127    Hearing Date:   February 7, 2024    Dept:  30 ISRRAEL RESENDEZ MARQUEZ, et al. vs RAYMOND GARCIATENTATIVEPlaintiffs Isrrael Resendez Marquez and Ricardo Camacho’s motion to deem admissions admitted is GRANTED. The truth of the matters in the request for admissions, set one, served on Defendant Raymond Garcia are admitted.Plaintiffs’ request for sanctions is GRANTED. The Court orders Defendant Raymond Garcia to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $336.65, within 20 days of this order.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.DiscussionOn April 17, 2023, Plaintiffs served Request for Admissions, Set One, on Defendant. (Juhn Decl., ¶ 4; Exh. 2.) Responses were due on or before October 27, 2023 after extensions were granted to Defendant. (Id., ¶ 6.) To date, responses have not been provided. (Id., ¶ 9.)Because Plaintiff properly served the requests for discovery, and Defendant has failed to provide verified responses, the Court finds Plaintiff is entitled to an order establishing the truth of the matters in the request for admissions served on Defendant. Therefore, the motion is granted.Plaintiff also requests sanctions. Sanctions are mandatory in connection with a motion to deem the truth of the matter in the requests for admissions admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) Thus, the request for sanctions in connection with this motion is granted. However, the amount awarded is reduced due to the simplicity of this motion and lack of opposition. As such, the Court imposes sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $336.65 ($275 per hour for one hour, plus $61.65 filing fee), to be paid within 20 days of this order.
