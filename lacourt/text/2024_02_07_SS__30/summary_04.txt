And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Jose Ramirez's unopposed motion for an order granting relief from waiver of jury trial. The Plaintiff failed to timely pay the nonrefundable jury fee of $150, which resulted in a waiver of jury trial. However, the Plaintiff's counsel asserts that the waiver was inadvertent due to an office mistake, and the Court finds good cause to permit relief from waiver in this case. There will be no prejudice to the Defendant, as it also seeks a jury trial and has already posted the jury fees. The Court will proceed with a jury trial, as the Plaintiff's failure to timely pay the jury fee was an inadvertent mistake rather than a deliberate waiver.
