And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendant Los Angeles Unified School District with 20 days leave to amend. The demurrer argues that the complaint is barred because the plaintiff, Terri Milner, is a pro se plaintiff who lacks a license to practice law and is attempting to represent her minor daughter, Taya Lynn Jones, in court proceedings. The court finds that Terri Milner is engaging in the unauthorized practice of law and lacks the legal capacity to sue on behalf of her daughter. The court declines to consider the merits of the defendant's other arguments and instead recommends that the plaintiff appoint a guardian ad litem on behalf of her daughter and the minor be represented by counsel.
