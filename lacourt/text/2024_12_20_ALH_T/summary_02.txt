And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling in a premises liability dispute where the plaintiff, Zenya Dennis, allegedly went into a store intending to purchase an item and was stabbed by the defendant's employee. The defendant, Green Cosmos Inc., served the plaintiff with discovery requests, and the plaintiff responded to some but not all of them. The defendant then filed a motion to compel further responses, seeking sanctions for the fees and costs of preparing and filing the motion.

The judge finds that the defendant has made sufficient good faith efforts to meet and confer with the plaintiff regarding the discovery requests, and that the plaintiff's responses to the requests were insufficient. The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses as to Form Interrogatory No. 10.2, which seeks information about the plaintiff's physical, mental, and emotional disabilities prior to the incident. The judge also grants the motion as to Special Interrogatory No. 11, which seeks information about the plaintiff's medical treatment, but limits the period to five years before the incident to the current date.

The judge declines to grant sanctions against either party, finding that the plaintiff had substantial justification to object to the defendant's motion. The judge orders the plaintiff to serve supplemental responses to the discovery requests within 30 days.
