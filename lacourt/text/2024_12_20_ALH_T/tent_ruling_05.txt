 Case Number:  24NNCV03704    Hearing Date:   December 20, 2024    Dept:  T Motion To Deem RFAs AdmittedBruce Wasserman v. Erez Karni, et al.Moving Party: Plaintiff Bruce WassermanResponding Party: N/ATentative Ruling: GRANTBACKGROUNDPlaintiff filed this case against Defendant Erez Kami (“Defendant”) on August 20, 2024. There is no answer filed to Plaintiff’s complaint. On October 1, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with Requests for Admission (alternatively, “RFAs”) via U.S. mail, and has yet to receive responses. (Declaration of Robert M. Ross, Exhibit A.)  On November 6, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a letter to Defendant inquiring into Defendant’s lack of discovery responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission. (Id. at Exhibit B.) Plaintiff received no response to this letter, nor any response to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission. (Declaration of Robert M. Ross, ¶ 5.)  MOVING PARTY POSITIONPlaintiff argues the requested discovery is relevant to issues raised in Plaintiff's complaint. (Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions as Admitted, p. 3.) Plaintiff additionally requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,460.00 based on 2 hours of attorney work at a $700.00 hourly rate, in addition to a $60.00 filing fee. (Id. at 5.)OPPOSITIONNo opposition has been filed.ANALYSISI. Motion to Deem Truth of Matters in RFAs as Admitted If a party to whom requests for admission have been directed fails to serve a timely response, the requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b)). The court shall make the requested order for deemed admissions, unless it finds that before the hearing on the motion the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with CCP §§ 2033.210–2033.230. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)Here, Plaintiff propounded RFAs on October 1, 2024. (Declaration of Robert M. Ross, Exhibit A.)   Plaintiff’s responses were due 30 days after service, plus an additional 5 days because service was via U.S. mail; Plaintiff’s responses were accordingly due on November 4, 2024. (California Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.250; California Code of Civil Procedure § 1013.) Defendant, in turn, failed to provide timely responses, and has yet to provide any responses to Plaintiff’s RFAs or otherwise contact Plaintiff to request an extension. Thus, it is appropriate to grant Plaintiff’s motion to deem the truth of the matters specified in Plaintiff’s RFAs to Defendant as admitted.II. SanctionsCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.280 allows a party moving for an order that the truth of any matters specified in requests for admission be deemed admitted to also seek monetary sanctions commencing with California Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.010. The court must impose a CCP § 2023.030 monetary sanction on the party whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated the motion for deemed admissions. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) California Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030 permits the court to “impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process…pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” “Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery[]” is a misuse of the discovery process. (California Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.010.)Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,460.00 based on 2 hours of attorney work at a $700.00 hourly rate, in addition to a $60.00 filing fee. (Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions as Admitted, p. 5; Declaration of Robert M. Ross, ¶ 6.) The Court finds Plaintiff’s number of hours worked on the instant motion is reasonable, and that Plaintiff may also recover for the $60.00 filing fee. However, the Court here finds Plaintiff’s hourly rate is excessive in this instance, particularly in light of the simple nature of the instant, unopposed motion. Accordingly, the Court reduces Plaintiff’s hourly rate to $400.00 in calculating sanctions for this motion. The Court thus finds Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions in the amount of $860.00 for the total costs arising from the instant motion.RULINGPlaintiff’s motion Deeming Facts Admitted as to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set One, is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $860.00.  Sanctions are payable within 30 days of Plaintiff giving notice of this order.
