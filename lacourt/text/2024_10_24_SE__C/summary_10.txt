And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on Defendant Heidi Sue DeLeon's Motion to Set Aside Default. The motion was previously denied ex parte, and a special hearing was set for October 24, 2024. Due to a clerical error, two separate minute orders were issued, causing confusion. The court has deemed the Ex Parte Application filed on August 14, 2024 as the moving papers, and set a new hearing date for November 7, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. The court has given notice to the parties and set deadlines for the filing of opposition and reply briefs.
