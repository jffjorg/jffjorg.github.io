And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff DORIS WALTERS' motion to compel Defendant OSI STAFFING, INC.'s further responses to special interrogatories (set two). The Court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.

The Court orders Defendant to produce further responses to special interrogatories Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 by no later than 30 days from the date of the Court's issuance of this Order. These interrogatories are related to Defendant's insurance coverage and the Court finds that evidence concerning the sources from which a party might be indemnified is discoverable under CCP §2017.210.

The Court denies the motion as to special interrogatories Nos. 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12, as Plaintiff has made no showing of how "all" insurance coverage policies merely "offered" to Defendant, but not necessarily purchased by Defendant, is relevant to this action.

Sanctions are denied, and the Court notes that no reply has been filed as of October 21, 2024.
