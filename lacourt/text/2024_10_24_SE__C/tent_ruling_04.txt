CASE
NO.:  22NWCV01535
HEARING: 
10/24/24
 
#7
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Defendant OSI STAFFING, INC.’s Further responses to Special
Interrogatories (set two) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. 
 
 
Opposing
Party to give notice. 
 
This
personal injury action stemming from a vehicular collision was filed by
Plaintiff DORIS WALTERS (“Plaintiff”) against Defendants OSI STAFFING, INC. and
DENISSE VAZQUEZ on December 8, 2022. Plaintiff alleges that she sustained
injuries in an automobile collision on December 29, 2020, after being hit by
Defendant Vazquez while she was working for Defendant OSI. 
 
Plaintiff
now moves to compel Defendant OSI Staffing, Inc.’s further responses to Special
Interrogatories (set two) Nos. 1-12 and 14-16. The interrogatories at issue are
related to Defendant’s insurance coverage. 
 
In
Opposition, Defendant argues that the information sought is not relevant nor
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and
outside the scope of discovery regarding insurance coverage. 
 
“If the propounding party, on receipt of a
response to interrogatories, deems that (1) an answer to a particular
interrogatory is…incomplete…or (3) an objection to an interrogatory is without
merit or too general, that party may move for an order compelling further
response.” (CCP §2030.300(a).)
 
“[P]arties
may conduct discovery ‘regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant
to the subject matter involved in the pending action… if the matter either is
itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.’”  (Perlan
Therapeutics, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1351 (fn. 12.) 
 
“A party
may obtain discovery of the existence and contents of any agreement under which
any insurance carrier may be liable to satisfy in whole or in part a judgment
that may be entered in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments
made to satisfy the judgment. This discovery may include the identity of the
carrier and the nature and limits of the coverage.” (CCP §2017.210.) “Section
2017.210…creates a statutory exception” to the general rule that “[e]vidence of
a tort defendant’s liability insurance is generally unrelated to a party’s
claims or defenses at trial,” but it allows only “limited discovery of a
defendant’s liability insurance coverage.” (Catholic Mut. Relief Soc. v. Sup.
Ct. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 358, 366.) 
 
The Motion
is GRANTED as to SI Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9. Evidence concerning the sources
from which a party might be indemnified is discoverable under CCP §2017.210. Plaintiff
may properly discovery the basic insurance policies that Defendant actually
purchased and which actually covered Defendant during the relevant time period.
Defendant is ORDERED to produce further responses to SI Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and
9 by no later than 30 days from the date of the Court’s issuance of this Order 
 
The Motion
is DENIED as to SI Nos. 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12. Plaintiff makes no showing of
how “all” insurance coverage policies merely “offered” to Defendant, but not
necessarily purchased by Defendant, is relevant to this action. 
 
Given the
mixed ruling, sanctions are DENIED. 
 
The Court
notes that no Reply has been filed as of October 21, 2024.
