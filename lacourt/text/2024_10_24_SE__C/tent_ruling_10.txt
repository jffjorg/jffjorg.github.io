#5
 
Defendant HEIDI DELEON’s Motion to Set Aside Default is CONTINUED
to Thursday, November 7, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
Court Clerk to give notice. 
 
This action was filed by Plaintiff LANGSTON BALL (in pro
per) (“Plaintiff”) against Defendant HEIDI SUE DELEON (“Defendant”) on May 14,
2024. 
 
Default was entered against Defendant on July 1, 2024. 
 
On August 15, 2024, Defendant moved ex parte for relief from
default under CCP §473(c). The ex parte application was DENIED, and in the
alternative, this Court specially set a hearing for Defendant’s Motion to be
heard on [Thursday], October 24, 2024. Due to the Court’s clerical error, two
separate Minute Orders were issued after the ex parte hearing on August 15,
2024. One Minute Order deemed the ex parte application as the moving papers,
and a separate Minute Order issued on the same date did not deem the ex parte
application to be the moving papers. 
 
In light of the confusion caused by this Court’s clerical
error, this matter is CONTINUED as indicated above. The Ex Parte Application
filed on August 14, 2024 is DEEMED the Moving Papers. Opposition to be filed
and served by October 30, 2024, and Reply to be filed and served by November 1,
2024.
