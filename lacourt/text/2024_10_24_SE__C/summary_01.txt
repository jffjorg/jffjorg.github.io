And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication filed by the defendants until a date agreed upon by the court and counsel. The motions were filed by the defendants CITY OF MAYWOOD, EDDIE DE LA RIVA, REYNA MENDEZ, HEBER MARQUEZ, RICARDO LARA, and CARMEN PEREZ, and the judge finds that the information to be derived from the deposition/declaration of David Mango is important to the plaintiffs' oppositions. The judge is continuing the motions in the interests of justice and to allow for further discovery and the deposition of key witness David Mango, who is involved in a corruption probe and has a potential self-incrimination issue. The parties are not foreclosed from seeking a continuance of the trial date, which is currently scheduled for December 3, 2024.
