And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike brought by Cross-Defendants RACK LEE, LLC; XIANGMEI LI; and ZHANG CHENG GUANG. The court has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for goods and services rendered, but has overruled the demurrer as to Xiangmei Li and Zhang Cheng Guang on the alter ego theory of liability. The court has also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for conversion, as Cross-Complainant does not allege a claim for conversion based on a specific identifiable sum of money. The motion to strike portions of the first amended cross-complaint is denied in part and rendered moot in part. The court notes that Cross-Defendant Shandong Shengxiang Smart Warehouse Technology Company Limited is not a moving party and declines to address any arguments on its behalf.
