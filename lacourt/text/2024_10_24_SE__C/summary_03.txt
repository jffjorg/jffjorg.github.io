And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Motion to Vacate Order Submitting Action to Arbitration and has denied the ex parte application to advance the hearing date. The action was stayed pending binding arbitration, but the defendant failed to pay timely fees, resulting in the plaintiff's election to withdraw from arbitration and proceed in court. The Court notes that it lacks jurisdiction to grant the requested relief, as it is only authorized to perform certain limited actions while exercising its vestigial jurisdiction over the arbitration. The Court is not asked to appoint arbitrators, grant provisional relief, or confirm, correct, or vacate the arbitration award. Therefore, the Application is denied without prejudice. The Court also notes that there is no indication or evidence that JAMS has administratively closed the arbitration due to non-payment of fees, or that either party has withdrawn the claims from arbitration.
