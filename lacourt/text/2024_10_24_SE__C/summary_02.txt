Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel the deposition of Defendant's Person(s) Most Qualified. The Plaintiff had sought to compel the deposition of the Defendant's Person(s) Most Qualified to testify as to specific topics, including complaints, investigations, and investigations of Paul Fanning's sexual misconduct. The Defendant had objected to the Notice of Deposition, citing procedural defects and the validity of their objections. The judge found that the Motion was premature, as it was filed before an objection was served, and that the Defendant's objections were valid. The judge also noted that a Second Amended Notice of Deposition was served on October 9, 2024, and that it is unclear whether the Defendant will or will not appear/produce a PMQ to testify as to the requested topics. The Plaintiff is not foreclosed from filing a Motion to Compel deposition as to the Second Amended Notice of Deposition if necessary.
