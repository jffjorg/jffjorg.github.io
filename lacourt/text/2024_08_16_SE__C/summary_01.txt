And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Ford Motor Company's ex parte application to advance the hearing date for their motions to compel plaintiff Erik Clarke's deposition and further responses to special interrogatories. The defendant argued that they would be harmed if their discovery motions were not heard before the summary judgment cutoff date, which is around October 17, 2024. The judge determined that they are unable to accommodate the defendant's request and set the discovery motions to be heard on December 3, 2024. The defendant is not precluded from seeking to continue the trial date of January 30, 2025.
