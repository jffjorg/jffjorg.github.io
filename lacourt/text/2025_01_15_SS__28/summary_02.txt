And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Jennifer Llerenas's claims and has denied it without prejudice. The petition states that the gross settlement is $5,000.00, with total medical expenses of $1,915.00, of which $347.49 has been paid. However, the court finds that the figures listed in the petition are inconsistent, and that the net balance is not accurately calculated. The court orders the petitioner to determine whether the medical provider(s) that charged $1,915.00 reduced or waived more than $66.62 of those expenses, and to provide an address for an appropriate financial institution in California to deposit the settlement funds.
