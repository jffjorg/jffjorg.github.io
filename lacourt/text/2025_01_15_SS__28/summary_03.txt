```

And here is a summary of the ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Defendant's motion for sanctions against Plaintiff's counsel, Luis Carrillo. The judge found that Carrillo's behavior during two depositions was improper and unethical, including accusing Defendant's counsel of lying and misleading the jury. The judge ordered Carrillo to comply with the California Rules of Professional Conduct and the Los Angeles Superior Court's Guidelines for Civility in Litigation. The judge also ordered Carrillo to abstain from attempting to dissuade witnesses from cooperating with the defense. The motion was opposed by Plaintiff, who argued that the sanctions were not specified and did not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040. However, the judge found that the Defendant was appealing to the court's "inherent equity, supervisory and administrative powers" and did not need to specify the sanctions. The judge granted the motion and ordered Carrillo to comply with the court's orders.
