BACKGROUND 
On
August 31, 2022, Plaintiffs Joanna Navarro (“Navarro”) and Jennifer Llerenas (“Llerenas”),
a minor, by and through her guardian ad litem Jaonna [sic] Navarro, filed this action
against Defendants Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, City of Los
Angeles, and Does 1-100 for general negligence, premises liability, and
dangerous condition of public property. 
On
September 6, 2022, the Court appointed Joanna Navarro to serve as Llerenas’s
guardian ad litem. 
On
April 14 ,2023, Defendants City of Los Angeles and City of Los Angeles acting
by and through the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (“Defendants”) filed
an answer. 
On
August 13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On
November 15, 2024, Petitioner Joanna Navarro (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to
approve the compromise of Llerenas’s claims. 
The petition was set for hearing on December 9, 2024. The Court
continued the hearing to January 15, 2025. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor Plaintiff
Jennifer Llerenas. 
DISCUSSION 
          The petition states the following: 
Gross settlement:                                            $5,000.00
Total medical expenses:                                 $1,915.00
Medical expenses paid:                                  $347.49
(Medi-Cal)
Reductions:                                                    $66.62
To be paid/reimbursed from proceeds:           $280.87 (to DHCS)
Liens:                                                             $280.87
(DHCS)
Attorney’s fees:                                             $1,250.00
Costs:                                                             $32.60
Net balance:                                                   $3,426.53
  Section 12a(1) of the petition states that total
medical expenses were $1,915.00.  Section
12a(3) of the petition states that this amount was reduced by $66.62.  This should mean that the remaining medical
expenses ($1,848.38) will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  However, Section 12a(4) of the
petition states that only $280.87 will be paid or reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds.  As a result,
$1,567.51 of the medical expenses are unaccounted for.  The Court cannot approve a petition unless it
shows that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be
paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
Petitioner should determine whether the medical
provider(s) that charged $1,915.00 reduced or waived more than $66.62 of those
expenses.  For example, an attachment to
the petition states that the total bill from Providence Holy Cross was $1,915.00
and Medi-Cal “paid $374.49 in full payment of those services.”  If Providence Holy Cross reduced its charges
from $1,915.00 to $374.49 as the attachment suggests, then the difference between these figures
($1,540.51) should be included in the reduction amount listed in Section 12a(3)
of the petition. 
The same attachment states that Medi-Cal “agreed to a
$93.62 reduction in the amount it paid.” 
However, Section 12a(3) of the petition lists the reduction amount as $66.62.  The figures should be consistent. 
Petitioner has asked that the net settlement funds be
deposited in a financial institution in Arizona.  However, the funds must be deposited in a
financial institution in California.  Petitioner
should provide an address for an appropriate financial institution in California. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve
the compromise of minor Plaintiff Jennifer Llerenas’s claims filed by Petitioner Joanna
Navarro on November 15, 2024. 
 Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner is ordered to file the proof of service of
this ruling with the Court within five days.
