  20STCV13063 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 29, 2023




 
Wang’s motion to quash is GRANTED. The claim against Wang is
ordered dismissed, without prejudice.
 
On 4/2/2020, Plaintiff Miawa Investment, Inc. and
Maggie-Dawson, Inc. (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed suit against Zhou Cai, and
Vista Selection, Inc., alleging: (1) breach of contract; and (2) fraud. 
 
            On 5/26/2020, Zhou Cai and Vita
Selection, Inc. filed a cross-complaint against Miawa Investment,
Maggie-Dawson, Inc., Juan Li, and Seven Bubble, Inc., alleging: (1) breach of
contract; (2) common counts; (3) fraud; (4) intentional tort; and (5) general
negligence. 
 
            On 3/1/2022, Vista Selection, Inc.
filed a cross-complaint against MKM Trading, LLC and Christie Ly (collectively,
MKM Defendants), alleging: (1) breach of contract; and (2) fraud.
 
            Now, specially appearing Defendant
Xiaoliang Wang (Wang) moves to quash Plaintiff’s service of summons and
Complaint.
 
            The motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion

 
Wang argues that the proof of service filed to show service
of him is a sham. The proof of services states that Wang was personally served
at 3263 Ridgefield Way, Dublin, CA 94568, on 07/01/2022, at 04:00 p.m.  However, Wang submitted a declaration stating
that this is impossible because at the time he was working as a manager in a
company located at 1849 El Camino Real, Burlingame, CA 94010. In support, Wang
provided declarations from several of his colleagues, all of whom corroborate
Wang’s working status and location at the time of the alleged service of
process.
 
After review, the Court finds that Wang’s evidence is
sufficient to overcome the presumption of proper service, and indicate that the
proof of service is falsified. This is especially true given that the motion is
unopposed by Plaintiff. 
Moreover, Wang argues
that the claim should be dismissed against him for a failure to prosecute.
Here, this action was commenced on 4/2/2020. The proof of service here was
filed on 7/1/2022. Thus, even assuming the proof of service was real, it would
still have constituted service more than two years after the commencement of
the action. CCPs section 583.420(a) provides that the Court may dismiss an
action for delay in prosecution where service is not
made within two years after the action is commenced against the defendant. (CCP
§583.420(a) (1.) Plaintiff did not oppose this request and thus is
considered to have conceded to it on the merits. 
Thus, on either basis,
the Court finds the motion should be granted. Based on the foregoing, Wang’s
motion to quash is granted. The claim against Wang is ordered dismissed,
without prejudice. 
 
 
It is so
ordered.
