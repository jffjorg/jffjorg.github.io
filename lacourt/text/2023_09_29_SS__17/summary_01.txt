**English Summary:**

The judge is tentatively ruling to grant Xiaoliang Wang's motion to quash the service of the complaint against him. The judge found the proof of service presented by the Plaintiffs to be likely a fabrication, given Wang's declaration and supporting declarations from his colleagues stating he was working elsewhere at the time of the alleged service.

Additionally, the judge notes that even if the service was valid, it occurred over two years after the lawsuit was filed, violating California law regarding timely service.  

The judge concludes that the claim against Wang should be dismissed without prejudice. This means that the Plaintiffs can re-file the claim against Wang in the future, but they will need to properly serve him with the complaint.
