And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting Wang's motion to quash the claim against him. The court finds that the proof of service filed to show service of Wang is a sham and that Wang's evidence is sufficient to overcome the presumption of proper service. Additionally, the court notes that even if the proof of service was real, it would have constituted service more than two years after the commencement of the action, which is grounds for dismissal under CCP ยง583.420(a). As a result, the court orders the claim against Wang dismissed, without prejudice.
