And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the defendant's motion to deny arbitration is granted. The plaintiff, Compremed Medical Group, Inc., and its co-plaintiffs, Marvin Pietruszka, M.D., and Bridgetone Holdings, LLC, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Koruon Daldalyan, M.D., and Del Carmen Medical Center, alleging breach of the Asset Purchase Agreement and other claims. The defendant argued that the plaintiff has waived its right to arbitrate and that arbitration should be denied under CCP section 1281.2(c) due to the risk of conflicting rulings on common issues of law and fact. The court found that the plaintiff has not waived its right to arbitrate and declined to order arbitration of the cause of action for breach of contract based on the Asset Purchase Agreement. The court exercised its discretion under section 1281.2(c) to avoid the possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues of law and fact.
