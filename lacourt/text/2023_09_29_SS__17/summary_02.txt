```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of the Defendant's motion to deny arbitration under CCP section 1281.2(c). The Court found that the Plaintiff, Compremed, has not waived its right to arbitrate and that arbitration should be denied due to the risk of conflicting rulings on common issues of law and fact. The Court noted that the Plaintiff's allegations of breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty are directly related to the same transactions and that the arbitrator could interpret the Asset Purchase Agreement in a way that conflicts with the Court's findings. The Court also rejected the Plaintiff's argument that the Court has no authority to deny arbitration because there is no petition to compel arbitration. The Court's decision is based on its discretionary power under CCP section 1281.2(c) to decline to order arbitration of the breach of contract claim.

English summary:
The tentative ruling by Judge Jon R. Takasugi of the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, grants Defendant’s motion to deny arbitration pursuant to CCP section 1281.2(c). Plaintiffs Marvin Pietruszka M.D., Compremed Medical Group, Inc., and Brigeton Holdings, LLC filed a complaint against Defendants Koruon Daldalyan M.D. and Del Carmen Medical Center, alleging various causes of action, including breach of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Defendant moves to deny arbitration, arguing that Plaintiff Compremed has waived its right to arbitration or, alternatively, that arbitration should be denied under CCP section 1281.2(c) due to the possibility of conflicting rulings. The court finds insufficient evidence to conclude that Plaintiffs have acted inconsistently with an intention to arbitrate or have so substantially invoked the litigation machinery that they have waived their right to arbitrate. However, the court exercises its discretion under section 1281.2 (c) to avoid the possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues of law and fact. The claim for the alleged breach of the Asset Purchase Agreement arises out of the same series of related transactions at issue in this action, and there is a strong likelihood for conflicting rulings if Plaintiff is permitted to proceed with its Demand for Arbitration and this case is also litigated.
