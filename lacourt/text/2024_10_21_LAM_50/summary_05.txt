**Summary of Tentative Ruling**

The Court grants SPS's motion to expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action recorded by Plaintiff on or about March 11, 2022 as Instrument No. 20220288017. The Court also grants SPS's request for attorney's fees in the amount of $897.00. The Notice of Pendency of Action is expunged because Plaintiff's claims were dismissed and there is no longer any pending action affecting title to or the right to possession of the Subject Property.
