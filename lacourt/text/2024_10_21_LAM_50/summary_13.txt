And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is for the case 24STCV13657, between Plaintiff Min Wong and Defendant Teddy Chang. The case involves a dispute over the removal of a 50-foot California Live Oak tree from Plaintiff's property. Defendant demurred to the second, third, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action, which Plaintiff opposed.

The Court sustained Defendant's demurrer to the seventh cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, with leave to amend. The Court also sustained Defendant's demurrer to the eighth cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, without leave to amend.

The Court overruled Defendant's demurrer to the second, third, and sixth causes of action. The second cause of action involves a violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code Sec. 46.02, which prohibits the removal of protected trees without a permit. The third cause of action alleges "wrongful tree removal under California Civil Code." The sixth cause of action alleges private nuisance.

Defendant also moved to strike various paragraphs of the Complaint, but the Court denied the motion in its entirety. The Court ordered Plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the date of the order.
