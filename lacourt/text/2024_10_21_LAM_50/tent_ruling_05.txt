[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
MOTION TO EXPUNGE NOTICE OF PENDENCY OF
  ACTION AND FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES IN THE AMOUNT OF $897.00.00



 
Background
Plaintiff Judith Baldwin
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action on March 2, 2022 against Defendants Select
Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (“SPS”) and U.S. Bank N.A., Successor Trustee to Bank
of America, N.A., Successor in Interest to Lasalle Bank, N.A., as Trustee, on
Behalf of the Holders of WAMU Series Mortgage Pass Through Certificates 2005
AR17 (jointly, “Defendants”). 
On December 27, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), alleging
fourteen causes of action. In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges, inter alia, that
she was the owner of residential real property located at 12518 Addison St.,
Valley Village, California 91607-2925 (the “Subject Property”). (SAC, ¶ 8.)
Plaintiff appears to allege that on or about October 5, 2005, she obtained a
loan from Washington Mutual Bank, FA in the sum of $664,000.00, secured by a
Deed of Trust recorded against her property on October 13, 2005. (SAC, ¶
11(a).) On April 6, 2010, a notice of default was recorded against the Subject
Property. (SAC, ¶ 11(b).) On January 15, 2019, a notice of trustee sale was
recorded against the Subject Property. (SAC, ¶ 11(c).) On August 22, 2019, a
trustee’s deed upon sale was recorded, indicating that the Subject Property was
sold at an auction on August 13, 2019, to U.S. Bank. (SAC, ¶ 11(d).) The
premise of Plaintiff’s SAC is that the foreclosure sale of the Subject Property
was wrongful.
SPS indicates that on
March 11, 2022, Plaintiff recorded a Notice of Pendency of Action pertaining to
the Subject Property located at the address 12518 Addison St., Valley Village,
CA 91607-2925. (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 1, Ex. 1.) 
SPS now moves to “to
expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action recorded by [Plaintiff] on or about
March 11, 2022 as Instrument No. 20220288017 and for attorney’s fees in the
amount of $897.00.00.”[1]
The motion is unopposed. 
            Request for Judicial Notice 
            The Court grants Defendants’ request
for judicial notice.  
Legal Standard
The authorization to
file a notice of lis pendens is found in section
405.20 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That statute provides in part: “A
party to an action who asserts a real property claim may record a notice of
pendency of action in which that real property claim is alleged. The
notice may be recorded in the office of the recorder of each county
in which all or part of the real property is situated.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 405.20.) “The whole idea of a notice of lis pendens is to
give constructive notice of the legal proceeding affecting title to a specific
piece of property.” ((Gale v. Superior Court (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1396.)
“A court shall order a notice of lis pendens expunged if it
determines (1) that the pleading on which the notice is based does not contain
a real property claim (§ 405.31); (2) that the
claimant has not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, the probable
validity of a real property claim (§ 405.32); or
(3) that adequate relief can be secured by an undertaking. (§ 405.33.)…Unlike most motions, the party opposing a motion to expunge bears the
burden to show the existence of a real property claim….In considering whether
the burden has been met, the court engages in a demurrer-like analysis.”
((Shoker v. Superior Court (2022)
81 Cal.App.5th 271, 277 [internal quotations omitted].)
            Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 405.30, “[a]t any time
after notice of pendency of action has been recorded, any party, or any
nonparty with an interest in the real property affected thereby, may apply to
the court in which the action is pending to expunge the notice. However, a
person who is not a party to the action shall obtain leave to intervene from
the court at or before the time the party brings the motion to expunge the
notice. Evidence or declarations may be filed with the motion to expunge the
notice. The court may permit evidence to be received in the form of oral
testimony, and may make any orders it deems just to provide for discovery by
any party affected by a motion to expunge the notice. The claimant shall have
the burden of proof under Sections
405.31 and 405.32.” 
Discussion
In the motion, SPS
asserts that “[i]n connection with her action, Plaintiff caused the Lis Pendens
to be recorded against the Property on March 11, 2022.” (Mot. at p. 3:11-12.) As
discussed above, Defendants filed a request for judicial notice of Plaintiff’s Notice
of Pendency of Action pertaining to the Subject Property located at 12518
Addison St., Valley Village, CA 91607-2925. (Defendants’ RJN, ¶ 1, Ex. 1.)
SPS asserts that “[t]he
entire action was dismissed on March 24, 2024. As such, there is no longer any
pending action which affects title to or the right to possession of the
Property. For this reason, alone, the Lis Pendens must be expunged.” (Mot. at
p. 4:7-9.) On May 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of the
Complaint, without prejudice. Dismissal was entered on May 24, 2024. As set
forth above, “[a] court shall order a notice of lis pendens expunged
if it determines…that the pleading on which the notice is based does not
contain a real property claim (§ 405.31)…” ((Ibid.) 
SPS also asserts that “Plaintiff
cannot satisfy her burden to show the probable validity of any of her claims
either. Afterall, each such claim was dismissed on March 24, 2024. Thus, the
Lis Pendens must be expunged.” (Mot. at p. 4:10-12.) As set forth above, a court shall
also “order a notice of lis pendens expunged if it determines…that the claimant
has not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, the probable validity
of a real property claim (§ 405.32)…” 
((Id. at p. 277.) Here, Plaintiff does
not oppose the motion. Thus, Plaintiff does not assert that a preponderance of
the evidence demonstrates the probable validity of any real property claim. 
Based on the foregoing,
and in light of the lack of any opposition, the Court grants SPS’s motion to
expunge notice of pendency of action.
Lastly, SPS asserts that it is “entitled to
its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs for the preparation of this Motion to
Expunge.” (Mot. at p. 4:12-14.) SPS cites to Code of Civil Procedure section 405.38, which provides that “[t]he court shall direct that the
party prevailing on any motion under this chapter be awarded the reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs of making or opposing the motion unless the court
finds that the other party acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of attorney’s fees and costs unjust.” Here, Plaintiff did not oppose the instant motion. Thus,
the Court does not find that Plaintiff has demonstrated any circumstances
make the imposition of attorney’s fees and costs unjust. 
SPS’s counsel indicates that “[SPS] has
incurred attorney’s fees and costs associated with this motion…which consists
of 2.6 hours of preparation time at $345.00 per hour. Said fees were incurred
in the course of attempting to negotiate a voluntary release of the lis
pendens; and drafting and revising the Motion to Expunge, the declaration in
support thereof, and a Proposed Order of Expungement.” (Ramos Decl., ¶ 3.) The
Court finds that the requested attorney’s fees in the amount of $897.00 is
reasonable.

Conclusion
Based on the
foregoing, the Court grants SPS’s motion to expunge the Notice of
Pendency of Action recorded by Plaintiff on or about March 11, 2022 as
Instrument No. 20220288017.
The Court grants
SPS’s request for attorney’s fees in the amount of $897.00. 
SPS is ordered to
provide notice of this ruling.
