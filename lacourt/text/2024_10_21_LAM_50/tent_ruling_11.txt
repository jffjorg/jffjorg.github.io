[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFFS’
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 



 
Plaintiffs
Northland THEA LLC, Northland THEA Portfolio LLC, Northland THEA Portfolio II
LLC, Northland THEA Portfolio III LLC, and Northland THEA IV LLC (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) appear to seek entry of default judgment against Defendant Tori
Riley. Plaintiffs submitted a proposed judgment on August 29, 2024, indicating
that Plaintiffs seek judgment in the total amount of $48,200.00, comprising
$47,000.00 in damages and $1,200.00 in attorney’s fees.
The Court
notes a few defects with the submitted default judgment package. 
First,
Plaintiffs did not file a Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100). “A party seeking a default judgment on declarations
must use mandatory Request for Entry of Default
(Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100)…” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd.
(a).)
Second,
Plaintiffs have not submitted sufficient evidence to prove up the requested
damages. Plaintiffs solely submit the declaration of their counsel in support
of the request (the Declaration of Nadia Zivkov). Ms. Zivkov states, for
example, that “Defendants entered into the Lease, attached hereto as Exhibit A,
whereby pursuant to Section 6 of the Lease they
agreed to pay $3,099.00 per month for rent.” (Zivkov Decl., ¶ 1, p. 3.) Ms.
Zivkov also states that “[a]s depicted in the Resident Ledger for Defendants, a
true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B, Defendants owe
Plaintiffs $52,931.52 in past-due rent and related fees and charges that
accrued until they vacated the premises on September 27, 2023…” (Zivkov Decl.,
¶ 9, p. 3.) The Court does not find that Plaintiffs’ counsel has demonstrated a
foundation of personal knowledge to make such statements.  
Lastly, the Court notes that on July 15, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a request for entry of default. This request includes a
“Declaration of nonmilitary status” providing, inter alia, that “[w]e do
not know Defendant Tori Riley’s full birthday, which is required to run a
search at: https://scra.dmdc.osd.mil/. We were therefore unable to confirm if
Defendant is not in the U.S. military service.” (Plaintiffs’ July 15, 2024
Request for Default, Item 8(f).) Pursuant to California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(5), a party seeking a default
judgment must file “[a] declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant
against whom judgment is sought.” Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 5:198 provides, inter alia,
that “federal law prohibits entry of a default judgment against any individual
defendant without a declaration showing that the defendant is not in
military service. [50 USC § 3931(b)(1)]…If unable to
determine whether defendant is in military service, the court may require
plaintiff to post a bond to indemnify defendant against any loss if the
judgment is later set aside. [See 50 USC § 3931(b)(3)].”
(Emphasis in original.) 
Specifically,
pursuant to 50 U.S.C. section 3931, subdivision
(b)(1), “[i]n any action or proceeding covered by this section, the court,
before entering judgment for the plaintiff, shall require the plaintiff to file
with the court an affidavit—(A) stating whether or not the defendant is in
military service and showing necessary facts to support the affidavit; or (B) if
the plaintiff is unable to determine whether or not the defendant is in
military service, stating that the plaintiff is unable to determine whether or
not the defendant is in military service.” In addition, 50
U.S.C. section 3931, subdivision (b)(3) provides as follows: 
 
“If based upon the affidavits filed in such an action, the court is
unable to determine whether the defendant is in military service, the court,
before entering judgment, may require the plaintiff to file a bond in an amount
approved by the court. If the defendant is later found to be in military
service, the bond shall be available to indemnify the defendant against any
loss or damage the defendant may suffer by reason of any judgment for the
plaintiff against the defendant, should the judgment be set aside in whole or
in part. The bond shall remain in effect until expiration of the time for
appeal and setting aside of a judgment under applicable Federal or State law or
regulation or under any applicable ordinance of a political subdivision of a
State. The court may issue such orders or enter such judgments as the court
determines necessary to protect the rights of the defendant under this Act [50 USCS §§ 3901 et seq.].” 
As
set forth herein, Plaintiffs’ apparent request for default judgment is denied
without prejudice. However, if any future request for default judgment by
Plaintiffs is granted, and “based upon the affidavits filed in [this] action,
the court is unable to determine whether the defendant is in military service,
the court, before entering judgment, may require [Plaintiffs] to file a bond in
an amount approved by the court.” (50 U.S.C. § 3931,
subd. (b)(3).) 
Based on the foregoing, the
Court denies the request for default judgment without prejudice. The
Court will discuss with Plaintiffs a schedule for resubmission of the default
judgment package.
