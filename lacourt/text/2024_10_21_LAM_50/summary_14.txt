And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a plaintiff. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims are duplicative and do not provide any additional facts that distinguish them from a different type of claim called "trespass to timber." The judge notes that the plaintiff's complaint does not even allege a claim for "trespass to timber." The defendant also cites a previous court decision, Holcomb v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which held that similar allegations were insufficient to support a separate cause of action. The judge will consider these arguments and decide whether to dismiss the plaintiff's claims at a future court hearing.
