[1]The Court notes
that Antonio Ramos Vazquez refers to
himself as “Plaintiff” in the motion. (Mot. at p. 2:2.) This appears to be in
error. As discussed, the Plaintiff in this action is Armando Vazquez-Ramos, as Successor
Trustee of the Lourdes R. Vazquez Family Living Trust of 2004. Antonio Ramos
Vazquez is a defendant named in Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint. In
addition, Antonio Ramos Vazquez, in his individual capacity and
as co-trustee of the Vazquez Brothers Living Trust of 2006 is a
Cross-Complainant in this action.
