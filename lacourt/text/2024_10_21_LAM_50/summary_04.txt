And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge notes that the plaintiffs withdrew their evidentiary objections and that for the first time in their reply, they appear to seek a multiplier. However, the court declines to consider this request because it was raised for the first time in the reply, which would deprive the defendant of an opportunity to respond. The court also notes that the plaintiffs' billing entries incorrectly reference the year 2021, when in fact they are from the year 2022. Additionally, the court grants the defendant's motion to strike the complaint's claim for punitive damages. The hearing on the motion for attorney fees has been continued to October 21, 2024.
