[1]The Court notes
that on August 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed evidentiary objections with their
reply. On September 25, 2024, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter
alia, that “[a]t the hearing, Plaintiff withdrew the objections…Hearing on
Motion for Attorney Fees is continued to 10/21/24…” The Court also notes that
for the first time in the reply, Plaintiffs appear to seek a multiplier. The
Court notes that “[p]oints raised for the first time in a reply brief will
ordinarily not be considered, because such consideration would deprive the
respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument.¿” (American
Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992)
10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453¿.) Thus, the Court declines to consider
Plaintiffs’ request in the reply for a multiplier. 


[2]The Court notes that as to
the motion to strike, the Court found that “[b]ecause the demurrer to the
fraudulent inducement-concealment cause of action is sustained, and because no
other cause of action in the Complaint can support a claim for punitive
damages, the Court grants GM’s motion to strike.” (February 14, 2022 Order at
p. 5:20-22.)
 


[3]The Court notes
that the billing entries GM references from 1/21/2021, 1/27/2021, 1/28/2021, 2/11/2021, 2/14/2021, and
2/15/2021 appear to incorrectly reference the year 2021.These billing entries are
from the year 2022. 


[4]The Court notes
that a total of 1.8 hours was billed, not 1.8 hours as to each timekeeper. (Barry Decl., ¶ 26, Ex. 7, pp. 75-76.)
