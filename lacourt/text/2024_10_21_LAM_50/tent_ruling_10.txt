[1]LAHD also asserts
that “[Plaintiff] subsequently filed a claim nearly a year after he already
filed this lawsuit; that claim was returned without further action because it
was untimely.” (Demurrer at p. 5:5-7, citing Declaration of Peter Walford, Ex.
A.) In any event, as discussed, Plaintiff’s FAC does
not appear to allege facts demonstrating compliance with the claim presentation
requirement.


[2]LAHD also appears
to request in the motion to strike that it be “dismissed from the lawsuit.”
(Mot. at p. 3:15.) However, LAHD did not file any motion to dismiss, and LAHD’s
notice of motion does not state that LAHD requests that it be dismissed from
the action. (See Notice of Mot. at p. 2.) Rather, LAHD states that it
moves for an order striking certain allegations from the FAC. (Ibid.) Thus, The Court denies any purported
motion to dismiss by LAHD.
