And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Lawrence Adams, the Plaintiff, and the motion to strike portions of the complaint filed by the Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD), the Defendant. The Court has determined that the Plaintiff's First and Fourth causes of action fail to state a claim against LAHD.

The Plaintiff alleges that he is entitled to receive REAP funds collected during his ownership of the Normandie Property, but the Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to allege compliance with the California Tort Claims Act, which requires a timely presentation of a claim to the public entity. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's common counts-account stated cause of action fails because there is no agreement between the Plaintiff and LAHD demonstrating that LAHD owes the Plaintiff any amount of debt.

The Court has also sustained LAHD's demurrer to the Plaintiff's declaratory relief cause of action, finding that declaratory relief is not an appropriate vehicle for reviewing the administrative actions that the Plaintiff challenges.

The Court orders the Plaintiff to file and serve an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the date of this Order. If no amended complaint is filed, the Court orders LAHD to file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal within 30 days of the date of this order.
