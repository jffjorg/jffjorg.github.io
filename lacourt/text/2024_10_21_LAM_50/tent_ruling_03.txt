[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFFS’
  MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS PURSUANT TO CIVIL
  CODE SECTION 1794(d)
 



            
Background
Plaintiffs William Burns
and Terri Burns (jointly, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendant
General Motors, LLC (“GM”) on August 23, 2021. The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) breach of
implied warranty of merchantability under the Song-Beverly Act, (2) breach of
express warranty under the Song-Beverly Act, and (3) fraudulent inducement -
concealment. On February
14, 2022, the Court issued an Order sustaining GM’s demurrer to the 
third cause of action (fraudulent
inducement – concealment), without leave to amend. 
            On
January 10, 2024, the Court issued a minute order in this matter providing, inter
alia, that “[a] Notice of Settlement was filed January 9, 2024…” In his declaration in support of the
instant motion, Plaintiffs’ counsel states that “[p]ursuant to the Offer
to Compromise signed by Plaintiffs on December 8, 2023, GM agreed (1) to pay
Plaintiff $95,000.00, inclusive of a Two-Times Civil Penalty and additional
damages; (2) that Plaintiffs are the prevailing party; (3) to pay Plaintiffs
pre-judgement interest pursuant to Civil Code §§
3287(b) and 3289(b); and (4) that GM would pay Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees,
costs, and expenses pursuant to Civil Code § 1794(d)
by way of motion.” (Barry Decl., ¶ 19, emphasis omitted.) 
            Plaintiffs now move for an order
awarding their attorney fees, costs, and expenses. GM opposes. 
On July 31, 2024, the Court issued an Order continuing the hearing on
the instant motion to September 25, 2024, in light of certain procedural issues
with GM’s opposition papers. The Court’s July 31, 2024 Order provides, inter
alia, that “[o]n or before 8/9, 2024, GM is to file amended opposition papers that
comply with the applicable page number, spacing, and other relevant
requirements set forth in California Rules of Court,
rules 3.1113 and 2.108…No new evidence
or new argument is to be submitted in GM’s amended opposition papers. On or
before 8/30, 2024, Plaintiffs may file a new reply brief that will supersede the previously filed reply
papers.”

            On
August 9, 2024, GM filed an opposition to the motion. On August 30, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a reply.[1] 
Discussion  
The
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act grants car buyers the right to sue a
manufacturer or retail seller for failure to comply with implied or express
warranties. (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (a).)
“If the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be
allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the
aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on
actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred
by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such
action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) 
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. … The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for
similar work. The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration
of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market
value for the legal services provided.” (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal
citations omitted); see
Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 818 (applying
the lodestar method to determine attorneys’ fees in Song-Beverly action).)
The
Hourly Rate of Counsel
In
his supporting declaration, Plaintiffs’ counsel David N. Barry indicates that
he seeks an hourly rate of $625.00 per hour. (Barry Decl., ¶ 29.) Mr. Barry’s
background and experience is discussed in his supporting declaration. (Barry
Decl., ¶¶ 30-32.)
In
addition, attorneys Carrie A. Shumake, Logan Pascal, Otis R. Hayes, III, Brian
J. Kim, Jeramy D. Templin, and Richard Lara worked on this matter. (Barry Decl., ¶ 24; Kim Decl., ¶
2; Templin Dec., ¶ 2; Lara Decl., ¶ 2.) Ms. Shumake’s requested hourly rate is
$250 and $300 per hour. (Barry Decl., ¶ 24(a).) Mr. Pascal’s requested hourly
rate is $350 per hour. (Barry Decl., ¶ 24(b).) Mr. Hayes III’s requested hourly
rate is $450 per hour. (Barry Decl., ¶ 24(c).) Mr. Kim’s requested hourly rate
is $250 and $300 per hour. (Kim Decl., ¶ 9.) Mr. Templin’s requested hourly
rate is $300.00 per hour. (Templin Decl., ¶ 7.) Mr. Lara’s requested hourly
rate is $285.00 per hour. (Lara Decl., ¶ 6.) 
The
background and experience of Ms. Shumake, Mr. Pascal Mr. Hayes III, Mr. Kim,
Mr. Templin, and Mr. Lara are set forth in their respective supporting
declarations. (Shumake Decl., ¶¶ 3-6; Pascal Decl., ¶¶ 3-5; Hayes III Decl., ¶¶
3-4; Kim Decl., ¶¶ 3-9; Templin Decl., ¶¶ 3-7; Lara Decl., ¶¶ 3-6.)  
In
the opposition, GM asserts that “Counsel’s declarations and its own billing
records from its other cases suggest that Counsel has deliberately and
retroactively increased its historic hourly rates…” (Opp’n at p. 14:17-18.) But
GM does not appear to cite to any evidence to support such proposition. The
Court finds that the hourly rates requested by Plaintiffs’ counsel are
reasonable and commensurate with rates charged by attorneys with comparable
skill and experience.
Reasonableness
of the Requested Fees
“[T]he
court’s discretion in awarding attorney fees is … to be exercised so as to
fully compensate counsel for the prevailing party for services reasonably
provided to his or her client.” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State
University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 395.) The trial court may reduce the award
where the fee request appears unreasonably inflated, such as where the
attorneys’ efforts are unorganized or duplicative. (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635, footnote 21.) “[T]he verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of
the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the
records are erroneous.” (Horsford v. Bd.
of Trustees of California State Univ., supra,
at p. 396.)
Plaintiffs’
counsel David N. Barry attaches as Exhibit 7 to his supporting declaration a “copy
of [his] firm’s time entries.” (Barry Decl., ¶ 26, Ex. 7.) The time entries
show that Plaintiffs seek $72,191.00 in attorney’s fees for a total of 199.6
hours billed. (Barry Decl., ¶ 26, Ex. 7.)
In
the opposition, GM first asserts that “counsel should not be compensated for
work related to the ‘fraud’ claim.” (Opp’n at p. 5:22-23.) The parties
cite to Santana v. FCA US, LLC (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 334, 349, where the Court of Appeal
noted that “[w]hen
a cause of action for which attorney fees are provided by statute is joined
with other causes of action for which attorney fees are not permitted, the
prevailing party may recover only on the statutory cause of action. However,
[s]uch fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an
issue common to both causes of action in which fees are proper and those in
which they are not. Moreover, [a]pportionment is not required when the claims
for relief are so intertwined that it would be impracticable, if not
impossible, to separate the attorney’s time into compensable and noncompensable
units.” (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) The Court of Appeal in Santana noted that “[t]he trial court found the latter exception applied,
describing the two causes of action—fraud and Song-Beverly Act—as encompassing
‘one set of facts.’ We agree.” (Ibid.)

            The Santana Court also noted that “[b]eyond the estoppel argument, Chrysler has not proposed any practical
method of apportioning fees in this case. It has not, for example, identified
any discrete portion of the litigation that was solely focused on fraud. Moreover, Chrysler’s only
proposals for how to apportion fees are unpersuasive: a 50
percent reduction in fees, calculated simply attributing half of the fees
to each of two causes of action; or a 92 percent reduction in fees to reflect
the fact that 92 percent of the damages were attributable to fraud.
Unsurprisingly, Chrysler does not cite any authority for those approaches, both
of which are completely out of keeping with the principle of ensuring the
prevailing party receives a full recovery of attorney fees on the fee-shifting
cause of action. Consequently, the court did not err in refusing
to apportion fees.” (Santana v. FCA US, LLC,
supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p. 350 [internal citation omitted].) 
As set forth
above, on February
14, 2022, the Court issued an Order sustaining GM’s demurrer to the third cause of action (fraudulent
inducement – concealment), without leave to amend. The Court also granted GM’s
motion to strike punitive damages. (February 14, 2022 Order.) In the
opposition, GM states that it “seeks to strike compensation of 10.5 hours
($3,395.00) related to the fraud claim and the fraud claim alone.” (Opp’n at pp.
6:5-6.) GM seeks to strike time billed by Plaintiffs’
counsel in connection with work related to GM’s demurrer and motion to strike. (See
Opp’n at pp. 6:8-7:13.)
            In the motion, Plaintiffs argue that
they are “entitled to fees and costs expended opposing GM’s demurrer and motion
to strike pursuant to Santana v. FCA.” (Mot. at p. 10:4-5.) Plaintiffs
argue that “the fraud
issues arose out of the same set of facts as all of Plaintiff’s [sic] other
causes of action.” (Mot. at p. 10:18-19.) However, Plaintiffs do not provide
any further analysis on this point. In the reply, Plaintiffs do not appear to respond
to GM’s argument in the opposition that “GM seeks to strike compensation of
10.5 hours ($3,395.00) related to the fraud claim and the fraud claim alone.”
(Opp’n at p. 6:5-6.) The Court does not find that Plaintiffs have shown that here,
it is “impracticable…to separate the attorney’s time into compensable and
noncompensable units.” (Santana v. FCA US, LLC, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at p. 349.)
As discussed, GM only seeks to strike Plaintiffs’ fees incurred in connection
with GM’s demurrer to the fraudulent inducement-concealment cause of action and
GM’s motion to strike punitive damages.[2]
In Santana v. FCA US, LLC, supra, 56 Cal.App.5th at page 350,
the Court of Appeal noted that “Chrysler has not proposed any practical method
of apportioning fees in this case. It has not, for example, identified any
discrete portion of the litigation that was solely focused on fraud.” Here, by
contrast, GM has identified a discrete portion of the litigation solely focused
on fraud – the demurrer and motion to strike. 
            Accordingly, the Court deducts the fees
requested for the billing entries identified on pages 6:8-7:13 of GM’s
opposition to the instant motion, which total $3,395.00.[3]

            Next,
GM asserts that “Mr. Barry ‘billed’ 2.9 hours ($1,812.50) for ‘telephonic
conference with potential clients to discuss case,’ ‘review repair orders and
research technical service bulletins and recalls,’ ‘further telephonic
conference with potential clients to discuss case,’ and ‘draft Representation
Agreement.’…It is evident from the entries that no client relationship existed
at the time of these entries.” (Opp’n at p. 8:6-9.) However, as
noted by Plaintiffs, GM
does not appear to cite any legal authority demonstrating that “pre-engagement
work” is not recoverable. The Court finds that the
foregoing time was “reasonably
incurred by [Plaintiffs] in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
such action” and declines to strike it. (Civ.
Code, § 1794, subd. (d).) 
            GM also objects to the asserted use
of “templated discovery requests [and] deposition notices to GM…” (See
Opp’n at p. 8:12-22.) In addition, GM objects to the asserted preparation of
“templated discovery responses – December 14 & 15, 2021.” (Opp’n at p. 9:3,
citing Barry Decl., Ex. 7, pp. 7-9.) GM also objects that “Mr. Kim billed 1.2
hours ($360.00) to read GM’s deposition objections and draft a templated meet
and confer letter.” (Opp’n at p. 9:18-19, citing (Barry Decl. Ex. 7, p. 13.) In
addition, GM contends that “[c]ounsel should not recover 2.2 hours ($660.00) to
‘review’ or ‘draft’ recycled meet-and-confer letters.” (Opp’n at p. 9:25-26,
citing Barry Decl., Ex. 7, pp. 12, 14.) Similarly, GM objects to an asserted
“templated motion to compel PMQ deposition” and asserted “templated motions to
compel.” (See Opp’n at pp. 10:17-11:10.) GM also contends that “Mr. Kim
should not recover for the 0.3 hours (90.00) he says he spent to ‘[r]eview: and
execute GM’s Proposed Stipulation and Protective Order…This is the same
protective order GM offers in all its cases with Counsel…” (Opp’n at p.
11:11-14, citing Barry
Decl., Ex. 7, p. 32.) 
Similarly,
GM argues that “Mr. Kim billed 6.5 hours ($1,950.00) to ‘review’ GM’s Motion to
Compel Vehicle Inspection and Motion to Compel Plaintiffs’ Deposition, conduct
legal research, and draft oppositions thereto. (Barry Dec., Ex. 7, pp. 34,
38-41). However, GM is frequently forced to file motions to compel vehicle
inspections and motions to compel depositions in matters against Counsel. As
such, this was by no means the first time that Counsel had seen and opposed
these motions. As with every other aspect of this case, Counsel’s oppositions
are templated and with only minor modifications from case to case.” (Opp’n at
p. 12:12-17.) GM also contends that “[c]ounsel is asking to recover a total of
20.2 hours ($6,060.00) that Mr. Kim ‘billed’ preparing and revising trial
documents including proposed jury instructions, a joint statement of the case,
an exhibit list, stipulated facts, and trial brief…Many of these documents,
such as jury instructions, do not vary from case to case…It should not
reasonably have taken Counsel more than 3.0 hours to prepare these templated
documents…” (Opp’n at p. 13:8-12.) 
The Court does not find that GM has shown that
the time spent on all of the foregoing tasks is unreasonable. The Court notes that although the use
of forms and templates help with efficiency, counsel is still expected to
review and modify each document for each individual case, and time spent to
ensure that each document is appropriately modified is reasonable. Plaintiffs
also assert that “[t]he fact that Plaintiffs’ counsel did not draft every
discovery and related correspondences ‘from scratch’ does not support the
contention that Plaintiffs are not entitled to recover fees incurred in such
efforts.” (Reply at p. 1:21-23.) Indeed, GM does not appear to cite any legal
authority supporting the contention that Plaintiffs must draft pleadings and
other documents from scratch in order to be entitled to attorney’s fees.       
In
the opposition, GM also asserts that “Mr. Kim should not be permitted to bill
3.0 hours ($900.00) just to read GM’s discovery requests.” (Opp’n at p.
8:24-25, citing Barry Decl., Ex. 7, pp. 5-7.) The Court does not agree that the
requested 3 hours is excessive and declines to reduce this amount. The Court
notes that the referenced billing entries from November 22, 2021 and November
23, 2021 concern multiple discovery requests. GM also objects that “Mr. Kim
billed 3.0 hours ($900.00) to read GM’s written discovery responses” on January
24, 2022. (Opp’n at p. 9:11-13, citing Barry Decl. Ex. 7, pp. 11-12.) The Court
does not agree that the requested 3 hours is excessive and declines to reduce
this amount.
            In addition, GM argues that “[c]ounsel
should not recover for the 9.4 hours ($5,485.00) that Counsel, mainly Mr.
Barry, ‘billed’ in total to telephonically provide updates to their ‘client re
case status,’ ‘draft email correspondence to client,’ or ‘review email
correspondence from client re case status.’” (Opp’n at p. 10:6-9.) In
the motion, Plaintiffs note that “[u]pdating a client is a fundamental
responsibility of an attorney.” (Mot. at p. 8:9-10, citing California Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3-500.) The Court notes that California Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.4, “[f]ormerly cited as CA ST RPC Rule 3-500,” provides, inter alia, that “(a) A lawyer shall:…(3) keep the client reasonably…informed about significant
developments relating to the representation, including promptly complying with
reasonable…requests for information and copies of significant documents when
necessary to keep the client so informed…” (Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.4, subd. (a)(3).) The Court does
not find that the referenced time for these communications is unreasonable, and
declines to reduce the amount requested. 
            Next, GM objects that certain
entries to “review file” are excessive. (See Opp’n at p. 11:17-26.) GM
contends that “[i]t is unreasonable for Counsel to spend so much time on file
review, such as 1.8 hours to prepare for an ‘informal discovery response’
followed by a 1.3 hour review a week later to, again, prepare for ‘informal
discovery conference’ or four separate entries totaling 5.8 hours to prepare
for the final status conference.” (Opp’n at p. 11:20-23.) The Court disagrees
that the foregoing time spent on such tasks is unreasonable. Moreover, GM does
not appear to identify what particular “review file” entries it is objecting to.
Rather, GM refers to certain page numbers of Mr. Barry’s supporting
declaration. (Opp’n at p. 11:19-20.) The Court declines to reduce the “review
file” entries as requested by GM.            
GM
also argues that “[c]ounsel billed 33.8 hours ($10,140.00) towards drafting and
reviewing motions in limine and reply briefs…Counsel filed virtually identical
motions in limine three times, yet billed each occurrence as if it were the
first time. Worse, Counsel relies on templated motions in limine that are
unchanging from case to case…the minor modifications on the repeat filings
should not have taken Counsel more than half an hour each time…” (Opp’n at pp.
11:28-12:9, referencing February 22-23, 2023, September 5, 11, 12, 15, and 18,
2023, October 20 and 23, 2023, November 1 and 8, 2023 billing entries.) The
Court does not find that the time spent on the tasks specified in the foregoing
billing entries is excessive. Moreover, the Court does not see how the billing
entries show that “[c]ounsel filed virtually identical motions in limine three
times…” (Opp’n at p. 12:2.) The challenged billing entries include, inter
alia, entries pertaining to Plaintiffs’ counsel drafting motions in limine
and Plaintiffs’ counsel revising Plaintiffs’ initial drafts of the motions in
limine. (Barry Decl., ¶ 26, Ex. 7, pp. 45-47; 63-64.) Thus, the Court declines
to reduce the hours as requested by GM. 
            Next, GM argues that “Mr. Pascal
billed 6.0 hours ($2,100) towards Plaintiffs’ deposition, including 2.0 hours
($700.00) of travel time…There is no reason why Mr. Pascal and not Mr. Kim
attended this deposition. Mr.
Kim is the primary attorney on the matter… Any time incurred by Mr. Pascal should be at Mr. Kim’s hourly rate of
$300/hr.” (Opp’n at p. 12:21-25.) GM does not cite any legal authority
supporting this proposition. The Court does not find that it is unreasonable
for Mr. Pascal to attend Plaintiffs’ deposition. In addition, the Court does
not find that the time spent was unreasonable for the foregoing tasks.             
GM
also argues that “[c]ounsel traveling is part of the cost of doing business and
involves none of the special skill or knowledge purportedly supporting
Counsel’s hourly rates. Travel time is rarely charged to one’s client and fees
not properly charged to one’s client may not be imputed to GM.” (Opp’n at p.
12:25-28.) The Court notes that GM does not cite any legal authority to
support the proposition that Plaintiffs may not recover fees incurred for an
attorney’s travel time. Thus, the Court declines to deduct the travel time.  
            GM also
asserts that “Mr. Pascal has an erroneous entry, preparing for a deposition
dated August 1, 2022, for 1.3 hours ($455.00) which must be stricken.” (Opp’n
at p. 13:4-6.) The Court notes that the challenged time entry is dated August
1, 2022. However, GM does not provide any explanation or argument as to why
this entry is erroneous. Thus, the Court declines to strike it. 
            GM also asserts that “Mr. Kim ‘billed’
6.4 hours ($1,920.00) to ‘review file’ and ‘draft’ Counsel’s Motion to Exclude
GM’s Expert and Ex Parte Application, notice, and the proposed Order and Mr.
Barry billed 1.4 hours ($875.00) to review the file and attend the hearing on
Counsel’s ex parte application…These amounts are facially unreasonable. (Opp’n
at p. 13:15-19.) The Court disagrees that these amounts are unreasonable and
declines to reduce the requested hours. 
            Lastly, GM argues that “Counsel should
recover for the 11.9 hours ($5,080.50) that Counsel claims it spent or will
spend on its fee motion.” (Opp’n at p. 13:26-27, emphasis added.) In light of
the arguments following this statement, it appears this is a typo. GM argues
that “this total includes 1.8 hours[4]
for six of the seven timekeepers to ‘[r]eview and revise’ their personal
declarations as to their experience and hourly rate, which are not
case-specific and do not change from case to case except for the caption…Second,
Counsel’s fee motion is virtually identical to fee motions Counsel has filed in
other Song-Beverly cases against GM, just like the declarations from the
involved attorneys…Third, there is no reason for Mr. Hayes III to have prepared
this motion, when he did not previously participate in the matter and there is
no reason for Mr. Barry to attend the hearing on the motions when he did not
draft the motion and Mr. Kim will be drafting the reply.” (Opp’n at pp. 13:27-14:6,
emphasis omitted.) 
The
Court does not find that any of the entries related to the fee motion reflect
excessive or unreasonable amounts of time for the particular tasks specified. And
as discussed, although the use of forms and templates help with efficiency,
counsel is still expected to review and modify each document for each
individual case, and time spent to ensure that each document is appropriately
modified is reasonable. Thus, the Court declines to reduce the hours as
requested by GM. 
Costs

Lastly,
Plaintiffs indicates that their counsel incurred $3,761.03 in costs in prosecuting
this matter. (Barry Decl., ¶ 28, Ex. 9 (Memorandum of Costs).) 
In the opposition, GM asserts that Plaintiffs’ memorandum of
costs includes “expenses not actually or reasonably incurred.” (Opp’n at
p. 14:24-25.) 
As an initial matter, in the reply, Plaintiffs
cite to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700,
which provides in part that “[a]ny notice of motion
to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the
cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is
extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section
1013. If the cost memorandum was served electronically, the period is
extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section
1010.6 (a)(4).” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).) Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subdivision (b)(4),
“[a]fter the time has passed for
a motion to strike or tax costs or for determination of that motion, the clerk
must immediately enter the costs on the judgment.” Plaintiffs assert that “Rule
3.1700(b) provides that a ‘notice of motion to strike or tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum.’…GM did not do
this. Pursuant to Rule 3.1700(b)(4), the Court
should award all costs and expenses sought in Plaintiffs’ Motion.” (Reply at p.
10:1-4.) 
However, Plaintiffs seek both attorney’s fees
and costs in connection with the instant motion. Plaintiffs do not appear to
cite any legal authority demonstrating that GM must challenge Plaintiffs’
requested costs in a motion to strike and/or tax costs as opposed to in an
opposition to the instant motion. The Court notes that in Gorman v.
Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 68, the Court of Appeal noted that “[o]n appeal, plaintiffs renew their contention that
contractor has forfeited any objections to plaintiffs’ claim for costs by
failing to file a motion to tax costs.” The Gorman Court noted that “[t]here
is no statute requiring the filing of a motion to tax costs.” (Id. at p.
69.) The Gorman
Court found that “[w]hile contractor’s opposition to plaintiffs’
motion was alternatively entitled a motion to tax costs, contractor did not
specify objectionable line items in the cost memo, but then again, $ 76,954.76
of plaintiffs’ claimed costs (22 percent) were not itemized in this memo, so no
such objection could be made to them. We consider it clear enough from
contractor’s opposition what cost claims contractor objected to. We perceive no
prejudice to plaintiffs, or even a claim of prejudice, from the absence of a
more formal motion to tax costs.” (Ibid.) Here too, Plaintiffs
do not claim any prejudice from GM’s failure to file a more formal motion to
tax costs. 
Moreover, the
subject Offer to Compromise in this matter provides, inter alia, that “Plaintiffs’
attorney’s fees, expenses and costs that have been reasonably incurred pursuant
to California Civil Code § 1794(d) may be
determined by the Court via noticed motion. For purposes of any such motion, GM
will agree that Plaintiffs are the prevailing party.” (Barry Decl., ¶ 19, Ex.
6, ¶ 2.)
In
Gorman, the Court of Appeal found that “Section 1032, subdivision (c) states in part: ‘Nothing in this section shall
prohibit parties from stipulating to alternative procedures for awarding costs
… .’…The wording of the settlement agreement and the subsequent conduct of the
parties provided substantial evidence for the trial court to conclude that the
parties had stipulated to an alternative procedure for awarding costs,
dispensing with the usual formalities of a complete cost memo and a motion to
tax costs. The trial court was justified in considering the merits of contractor’s
objections to plaintiffs’ cost claims. We conclude there was neither error nor
prejudice in the omission of a formal motion to tax costs.” (Id. at p. 70.) 
In light of the foregoing, the Court will consider the
objections in GM’s opposition to Plaintiffs’ cost claims.  
Plaintiffs claim $795.00 for filing and motion fees. (Barry
Decl., ¶ 28, Ex. 9, ¶ 1.) GM argues that “[c]ounsel should not be permitted to
recover the $120.00 in filing fees…for their unnecessary Ex Parte Application and
Motion to Exclude GM’s Expert Witness. As discusses [sic], supra, this
motion and application was denied. Counsel should not be rewarded costs for their
[sic] frivolous filings.” (Opp’n at pp. 14:26-15:2, citing Plaintiffs’
Memorandum of Costs (Worksheet), p. 1.) GM does not provide any further
analysis or argument as to why the foregoing application and motion were
purportedly “frivolous,” nor does GM cite to any legal authority to support the
proposition that these filing fees may not be recovered. Thus, the Court
declines to strike $120.00 in filing fees. 
 Plaintiffs
also claim $550.00 for “[c]ourt reporter fees as established by statute.” (Barry
Decl., ¶ 28, Ex. 9, ¶ 11.) Plaintiffs’ attached “Memorandum of Costs (Worksheet)” at page 5
references $550.00 in court reporter fees for “Motion for Attorneys’ Fees.” (Barry
Decl., ¶ 28, Ex. 9.)
GM asserts that “costs are only allowed if actually incurred; Counsel
has spent nothing for future services. $550 seems to be an estimate, not an
actual charge incurred.” (Opp’n at p. 15:5-6.) Plaintiffs do not appear to address
or dispute this point in the reply. Thus, the Court deducts $550.00 from the
total amount of costs requested. 
In addition, Plaintiffs claim $539.36 for
“[f]ees for electronic filing or service.” (Barry Decl., ¶ 28, Ex. 9, ¶ 14.) GM contends that “[c]ounsel
improperly seeks $539.36 in ‘[f]ees for electronic filing or service’ because
Counsel provides no support for these alleged costs.” (Opp’n at p. 15:8-9.) But
it is unclear what additional explanation GM seeks, and GM does not appear to
assert that electronic filing fees are not recoverable. Thus, the Court
declines to strike the $539.36 in costs. 
Further, Plaintiffs claim $258.67 in “Other” costs. (Barry
Decl., ¶ 28, Ex. 9, ¶ 16.) Plaintiffs’ attached “Memorandum of Costs (Worksheet)” indicates
that Plaintiffs seek, inter alia, costs for “parking” and “mileage.” (Barry
Decl., ¶ 28, Ex. 9, Memorandum of Costs (Worksheet), p. 4.) GM contends that “[t]he
Court should disallow these expenses since travel is a cost of doing business.”
(Opp’n at p. 15:14.) GM does not cite to any legal authority to support its
assertion that costs for parking and mileage are not recoverable. Thus, the
Court declines to deduct these costs from the total amount. 
Plaintiffs’ attached “Memorandum of Costs (Worksheet)” also
indicates that Plaintiffs’ “Other” costs include $121.89 in costs for “Courtesy
Copy/Messenger Service - for Trial Binders to Court.” (Barry Decl., ¶ 28, Ex. 9, Memorandum of Costs
(Worksheet), p. 4.) GM
contends that “[c]ounsel seeks $121.89 in messenger service costs. A messenger
service is a luxury not a necessity and GM should not bear the burden of this
expense.” (Opp’n at p. 15:15-17.) The Court does not find that these
costs are unreasonable or excessive. Thus, the Court declines to strike the $121.89
in costs.
In light of the foregoing, the Court deducts $550.00
from the total amount of costs requested. Thus, the Court awards Plaintiffs
$3,211.03 in costs. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’
fees and costs is granted in the total amount of $72,007.03 ($68,796.00 in attorneys’ fees + $3,211.03
in costs.)

Plaintiffs are ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
