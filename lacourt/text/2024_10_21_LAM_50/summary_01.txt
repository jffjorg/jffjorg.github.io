```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Antonio Ramos Vazquez to terminate Plaintiff's counsel Julia Sylva and dismiss the case with prejudice. The motion was based on the argument that Armando Vazquez-Ramos, the original plaintiff, has passed away and therefore no longer has standing to pursue the action. However, the judge found that Antonio Ramos Vazquez, as the Successor Trustee of the Lourdes R. Vazquez Family Living Trust of 2004, has not demonstrated grounds to terminate Julia Sylva as attorney for the plaintiff or to dismiss the case. The judge also noted that Antonio Ramos Vazquez has not provided any evidence that the plaintiff discharged his lawyer and has not cited any legal authority to support his request to terminate Julia Sylva or dismiss the case.
