[1]Defendant also
argues that in a footnote that “[t]respass to Timber is a type of trespass
cause of action and Plaintiff has not provided any additional facts in his
regular trespass claim that distinguishes it from the trespass to timber cause
of action.” (Demurrer at p. 8, fn. 1.) The Court
notes that the Complaint here does not allege any cause of action for “trespass
to timber.” The Court does not see how this argument is relevant or applicable
to Plaintiff’s third cause of action for “wrongful tree removal under
California Civil Code.” 
 


[2]Defendant also
cites to Holcomb v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2007)
155 Cal.App.4th 490, 501, where the Court of Appeal noted that
“Holcomb’s negligence cause of action focuses on three alleged acts by Wells
Fargo. The first is that ‘Viles, acting for Wells Fargo Bank,
told Holcomb that his August 3 deposit with Wells Fargo had cleared
when, in fact, payment had been rejected by US Bank.’ These allegations are
merely duplicative of Holcomb’s negligent misrepresentation cause of
action, and therefore insufficient to support a separate cause of action.”
