And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiffs' request for default judgment against defendant Tori Riley and has found several defects in the submitted package. The plaintiffs did not file a Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100) and have not submitted sufficient evidence to prove up the requested damages. Additionally, the plaintiffs did not provide a declaration of nonmilitary status for defendant Tori Riley, which is required by federal law. As a result, the court is denying the request for default judgment without prejudice. The court will discuss with the plaintiffs a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
