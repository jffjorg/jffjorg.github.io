ADALBERTO PERAZA,

            v.
GENERAL
  MOTORS, LLC., et al , 
                        Defendant(s).


 
  Case No.: 24STCV11416
 
    DISCLOSURE AND ORDER
 



            
Judge
Beaudet hereby discloses that approximately 24 years ago, she and her husband
purchased a pickup truck for her husband’s use that he recalled was either a
Dodge or Chrysler pickup; Judge Beaudet does not remember the maker of the
pickup.  The pickup developed electrical
problems.  Judge Beaudet’s husband took
the pickup in to the dealer many times for the same electrical problem.  The pickup was tested with some device while it
was operating, and eventually, the manufacturer and the dealer agreed to take
the pickup back and refund the purchase price. 
No litigation was involved.  Judge
Beaudet does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased for or
against either party.  However,
if you believe differently, you will have until December 11, 2024, to file and
serve a verified statement of disqualification per section CCP 170.3(c)(1) (the
“Statement”).  If you do not file and
serve a Statement, grounds for recusal will be deemed waived. The Case management
conference will be continued to December 18, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 50 unless both parties waive the
right to file the Statement. Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this
Disclosure to any new parties who are added to the case and to file proof of
service of same promptly after service, with   a courtesy copy delivered to Department 50.
Any new party has 14 calendar days from the date of service to file and serve
the Statement per section CCP 170.3.
 
DATED:  October 21, 2024                                       _____________________________
                                                                               Honorable Teresa A. Beaudet
