Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Mardanis' Motion to Compel Depositions of Defendant and Plaintiff County of Los Angeles' Persons Most Knowledgeable. The County had objected to the deposition notices, but the Judge finds that the County's arguments are not authorized by statute and that the County has not provided sufficient verified information to support its claims. The Judge awards sanctions against the County and its counsel in the amount of $2,600. The Mardanis had sought $3,250.00 in sanctions, but the Judge reduces the amount to $2,600. The ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court.
