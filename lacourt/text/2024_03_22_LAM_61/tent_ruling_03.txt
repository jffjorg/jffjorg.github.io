I.      
MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to
the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a
propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding
party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  The propounding party must demonstrate that
the responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding
party asserted objections that are either without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)
“A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling responses to the production demand and interrogatories.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
 
Plaintiff Sara Cisneros (Plaintiff) moves to
compel responses to Form Interrogatories – General, and to compel further
responses to Requests for Production, Special Interrogatories, and Form
Interrogatories – Employment, from Defendant BaronHR West, Inc. Plaintiff
served the discovery at issue on August 24, 2023, and received responses on
October 9, 2023, but no responses to Form Interrogatories – General. (Motion at
p. 3.) Defendant’s responses to all special interrogatories and requests for
production consisted of the language: “Investigation and discovery are
continuing, and BARONHR WEST, INC. reserves the right to amend, modify, and/or
supplement this response.” (Separate Statement.)
 
Defendant’s responses to Form Interrogatories
– Employment are more diverse. Defendant responded to Form Interrogatories No.
200.1–200.5 with the same stock phrase as indicated above. (Separate Statement
at pp. 1–6.) Defendant responded to Interrogatory No. 200.6, which sought
Defendant’s position on whether Plaintiff and Defendant were in a business
relationship other than an employment relationship, and to state the evidence
supporting Defendant’s position, with objections and a statement that Defendant
“has located no responsive documents.” (Separate Statement at pp. 6–7.)
Defendant responded to Interrogatory No. 201.1 (which asked whether Plaintiff
was involved in a termination, and to state supporting evidence) with
objections and the statement that Defendant “is unaware of any responsive
information at this time.” (Separate Statement at pp. 7–8.) Defendant responded
only with objections based on vagueness, relevance, and proportionality to
Interrogatories No. 201.2–201.7, 207.1, 207.2, 208.1, 208.2, 209.2,
211.1–211.3, 214.1, 215.1, 215.2, 216.1, and 217.1. (Separate Statement at pp.
9–33.) 
 
Plaintiff’s requests for production are
supported by good cause. They seek documents related to Plaintiff’s employment
relationship, performance, termination, and complaints, which is at issue in
this litigation. Defendant’s responses are not code-compliant, as they consist
of mere assurances that discovery is continuing, or else objections that
Defendant has not supported with any opposition materials to this motion.
Defendant has also provided no responses to Form Interrogatories – General.
 
The motions are therefore GRANTED.
 
II.    SANCTIONS
Statute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon
a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response
to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for
admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
 
Plaintiff seeks $455 in
sanctions in connection with the motion to compel, representing one hour of
attorney work and a $60 filing fee. (Hahn Decl. ¶¶ 7–10.) For each of the
motions to compel further, Plaintiff seeks $850 in sanctions, representing two
hours of attorney work at $395 per hour, plus three $60 filing fees. This
represents a total sanctions request for all four motions of $2,885.00.
Sanctions are awarded against
Defendant and its counsel in the amount of $2,885.
