And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that United Wisconsin Insurance Company, administered by Next Level Administrators, is granted leave to file a First Amended Complaint in Subrogation to correct an administrative mistake in the naming of the plaintiff. The mistake was discovered on March 19, 2024, and United notified opposing counsel on April 2, 2024. Bragg's counsel refused to stipulate to the filing of the FAC, opposing the motion on the grounds that the original complaint was untimely and that the amendment would result in prejudice. The Judge finds that the amendment relates back to the earlier, timely filed pleading and does not change the facts, involve the same injuries, and refer to the same instrumentality. The Judge also finds that there is little, if any, prejudice to Bragg.
