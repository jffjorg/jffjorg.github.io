  Case Number:  22LBCV00531    Hearing Date:   August 8, 2024    Dept:  S25 Parties’ PositionsUnited Wisconsin Insurance Company, administered by Next Level Administrators (“United”), seeks leave to file a First Amended Complaint in Subrogation pursuant to Cal. Code of Civil Procedure section 437(a)(1) to correct the name of the Moving Party to “Ace American Insurance Company, administered by Next Level Administrators.” United argues this superficial amendment will ensure that the correct worker’s compensation carrier asserting subrogation rights will be correctly identified.On or around March 19, 2024, United’s counsel discovered an administrative error occurred which resulted in “United Wisconsin Insurance Company administered by Next Level Administrators” being named as the plaintiff instead of “Ace American Insurance Company, administered by Next Level Administrators.” (Pearlman Decl., ¶¶ 8-11.) United’s counsel notified Bragg’s counsel and Samanta Molina’s counsel of this mistake on April 2, 2024. (Id., ¶ 12.) While Molina’s counsel agreed on May 7, 2024 to stipulate to allow Plaintiff to filed an FAC, Bragg’s counsel would not stipulate to the filing of a FAC. (Id., ¶¶ 13-14.)United suggests the FAC corrects a simple administrative mistake and does not introduce any new facts, change the cause of action or otherwise prejudice Bragg. (See Klopstock v. Superior Court (1941) 17 Cal.2d 13, 20 [“[t]he power to permit amendment is denied only if a change is made in the liability sought to be enforced against the defendant”]; Engel v. Pech (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 1227, 1236 [“subsequent amendments to a pleading will relate back to an earlier, timely filed pleading if they (1) rest on the same general set of facts, (2) involve the same injury, and (3) refer to the same instrumentality, as the original pleading”]; Cal. Gas. Retailers v. Regal Petroleum Corp. (1958) 50 Cal.2d 844, 850–851 [amendment swapping in individual as plaintiff instead of business association relates back]; Canifax v. Hercules Powder Co. (1965), 237 Cal.App.2d 44, 46 [failure to amend a complaint until after the one-year statute of limitations had run did not bar the action against the corporation defendant since the corporation defendant had known it was being charged with negligence].)In opposition, Bragg contends the moving party is not entitled to a “relation back” under the circumstances of this matter. Bragg argues there is no justification for the two-year delay in the “misnomer” being identified by counsel nor for counsel’s delay in filing a request for leave once the error was discovered. Bragg notes Molina filed her complaint on September 25, 2022, four days after the two-year status of limitations for personal injuries had expired, pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1 and that United filed its claim for subrogation on September 22, 2022, just one day before the two-year statute of limitations on September 23, 2022. (See Dilberti v. Stage Call Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1468, 1471 (finding that a complaint could not be amended to substitute a passenger in an automobile for a driver as plaintiff after the expiration of the statute of limitations because the substituted plaintiff sought to enforce a different claim than alleged in the original complaint); Stephens v. Berry (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 474, 478-479 (ruling that amendment is not permitted after the statute of limitations has run when the result would be to drop one party to the action and to add another party who up to the time of the amendment was not a party.)In reply, United rejects Bragg’s contention that the original complaint was untimely as the complaint was e-filed on Friday, September 23, 2022, a court holiday, and was accordingly processed on the following Monday, September 26, 2022. (Pearlman Decl. ISO of Reply ¶ 5.) United also distinguishes these facts from those in Dilberti by suggesting this motion is not an attempt to add a new plaintiff with a separate and distinct claim from the already existing plaintiff. Instead, Ace American is seeking the same subrogation rights as United when United timely filed the original complaint in subrogation. United insists minimal additional discovery, if any, would be required and the “potential” need for a trial continuance does not rise to the level of prejudice necessary to deny the proposed amendment. Finally, United reiterates that the proposed amendment only seeks to correct an honest administrative mistake.Legal Standard“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 576.) As a condition of granting leave to amend, the trial court may require a plaintiff to bring a motion that is compliant with rule 3.1324 of the California Rules of Court (Rule 3.1324), including the evidentiary requirements, and doing so does not constitute an abuse of discretion. (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.) A party requesting leave to amend must submit a motion which includes: (1) a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings; (2) a statement of which allegations would be deleted by the amendment, and where they are located in the previous pleading; and (3) a statement of what allegations would be added by the amendment, and where they are located in theproposed pleading. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a).) The motion must be accompanied by a declaration stating: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) why the request was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).) Prejudice exists where the amendment would result in a delay of trial, along with loss of critical evidence, added costs of preparation, increased burden of discovery, etc. (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488; see P & D Consultants, Inc. v. City of Carlsbad (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1345; Fisher v. Larsen (1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 627, 649 [leave to amend properly denied where Plaintiff knew for over five months claims had not been properly pleaded and took no action to amend until after summary judgment granted against it]; Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 6:656.)Tentative RulingUnlike in Dilberti, where the substituted plaintiff sought to enforce an entirely different claim than those alleged in the complaint, moving party United is seeking to correct a administrative mistake, replacing “United Wisconsin Insurance Company administered by Next Level Administrators” with “Ace American Insurance Company, administered by Next Level Administrators.” The amendment relates back to the earlier, timely filed pleading and does not change the facts, involves the same injuries, and refers to the same instrumentality. There is little, if any, prejudice to Bragg.The motion to file a First Amended Complaint is GRANTED. As the amended complaint does not add any new cause of action, the parties may stipulate that Bragg’s prior answer to the original complaint is deemed its answer to this FAC.
