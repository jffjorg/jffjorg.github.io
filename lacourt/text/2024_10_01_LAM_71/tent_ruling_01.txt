1.    
Motion to Compel Further RFP 2
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses from Vegamour to Plaintiff’s RFP 2, the
Court rules as follows.
          On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff served RFP 2 on Vegamour.  (Decl. of Levy ¶3, Exh. 2.)  On June 22, 2023, Vegamour served its
response.  (Decl. of Axelrad ¶4.)  On January 23, 2024, Vegamour served its
supplementary responses to RFP 2 with boilerplate objections.  (Decl. of Levy ¶4, Exh. 3.)  On April 12, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent Vegamour’s
counsel a meet and confer letter.  (Decl.
of Levy ¶5, Exh. 4.)  Plaintiff now moves
to compel further responses.  
          RFP 2, No. 35, requests, “All COMMUNICATIONS sent or
received by plaintiff between August 2021 and April 2022 that refer or relate
to defendant’s ‘GRO AGELESS’ product(s).” 
(Motion RFP 2 SS, pg. 3.)
          C.C.P. §2031.240(c)(1) provides, “[i]f an objection
is based on a claim of privilege or a claim that the information sought is
protected work product, the response shall provide sufficient factual
information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including,
if necessary, a privilege log.”  (C.C.P. §2031.240(c)(1).)  “The information in the privilege log must be
sufficiently specific to allow a determination of whether each withheld
document is or is not in fact privileged.” 
(Wellpoint Health Networks, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 110, 130.)
Here, Defendant’s counsel argues
that the documents in question are privileged and thus not subject to
discovery.  However, despite this
assertion, Defendant’s counsel has failed to produce a privilege log to
demonstrate this.
          Defendant’s opposition states, “Defendant and Plaintiff
have been working to put in place a protective order with an attorneys-eyes
only provision with regard to Defendant’s confidential, proprietary, and trade
secret information. (See Declaration of Jacob M. Axelrad, ¶ 8.) Once the protective
order is in place, Defendant has agreed to produce responsive documents to
Plaintiff’s Request No. 35.”  Defendant
has willful delayed producing the discovery requested in RFP 2 No. 35 by
failing to submit to an authorized discovery method and refusing to respond on
the basis of evasive objections meant only to prevent the discovery of evidence
that is discoverable under the applicable standard.  
Defendant is ordered to
produce Code-compliant, non-evasive responses to RFP 2, No. 35, subject to a privilege
log, within 20 days of this Court’s ruling.
RFP 2, No. 36, requests, “All
COMMUNICATIONS sent or received by plaintiff between January and April 2022
that refer or relate to ‘GRO Biotin Gummies.’” 
(Motion RFP 2 SS, pg. 5.)
For the same reasons stated
with regard to RFP 2, No. 35, this Court orders Defendant to produce
Code-compliant, non-evasive responses to RFP 2, No. 36, subject to a privilege
log, within 20 days of this Court’s ruling.
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $8,460.00 against Defendant and its counsel of
record.  Plaintiff requests attorneys’
fees for time spent meeting and conferring with Defendant, which is required by
statute and therefore not compensable on the instant motion.  Therefore, the Court reduces the number of
hours Plaintiff’s counsel spent working on the instant motion from the
requested 14 hours on the moving papers alone. 
          The Court awards sanctions against Defendant and its
counsel pursuant to C.C.P. §§2023.010(d), 2023.010(e), and 2031.310(h) in the reduced
amount of $3,660.00, calculated as follows:
([4.5 hours to prepare
instant motion + 1 hour to review the opposition and draft a reply + 0.5 hour
to attend hearing on motion] x $600.00) + $60.00 filing fee = $3,660.00
The sanctions are payable,
jointly and severally, by Vegamour and its attorneys from Fisher &
Phillips LLP, within 20 days of this order.
Defendant’s request for
sanctions against Plaintiff is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
2.    
Motion to Compel Further RFP 3
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses from Vegamour to Plaintiff’s RFP 3, the
Court rules as follows.
          On August 11, 2023, Plaintiff served RFP 3 on
Vegamour.  (Decl. of Levy ¶3, Exh. 2.)[1]  On September 12, 2023, Vegamour served its
response.  (Decl. of Axelrad ¶4.)  On January 23, 2024, Vegamour served its
supplementary responses to RFP 3 with boilerplate objections.  (See Decl. of Levy ¶7, Exh. 4.)  On April 12, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent
Vegamour’s counsel a meet and confer letter. 
(Decl. of Levy ¶8, Exh. 5.) 
Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses.  
          RFP 3, Nos. 41-50, 52, 53, 57, and 58 ask Defendant to
produce: (41) “Any and all Slack COMMUNICATIONS between Plaintiff and Dan
Hodgdon”; (42) “Any and all Slack COMMUNICATIONS between Plaintiff and Mallory
Yohannan”; (43) “Any and all
Slack COMMUNICATIONS between Plaintiff and Darren Summer”; (44) “Any and all
Slack COMMUNICATIONS between Plaintiff and Lily Shao”; (45) “Any and all Slack
COMMUNICATIONS between Plaintiff and Jacob Hernandez”; (46) “Any and all Slack
COMMUNICATIONS between Plaintiff and Carla Durango”; (47) “Any and all Slack COMMUNICATIONS
between Plaintiff and Candice Macias”; (48) “Any and all Slack COMMUNICATIONS
between Plaintiff and Erin McGilvra”; (49) “Any and all Slack COMMUNICATIONS between
Plaintiff and any of YOUR
former employees”; (50) “Any
and all Slack COMMUNICATIONS between Plaintiff and any of YOUR current
employees”; (52) “Any and all COMMUNICATIONS between YOUR current employees and
the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau on behalf of YOU”;
(53) “Any and all COMMUNICATIONS between YOUR former employees and the National
Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau on behalf of YOU”; (54) “Any
and all articles ever posted on longhairtrends.com relating to the GRO Ageless
Anti*-*Grey Hair Serum”; (55) “Any and all articles ever posted on
hairhealthsecrets.com relating to the GRO Ageless Anti-Grey Hair Serum”; (56) “Any
and all reviews ever posted on longhairtrends.com relating to the GRO
Ageless Anti-Grey Hair Serum”;
(57) “Any and all reviews ever posted on hairhealthsecrets.com relating to the
GRO Ageless Anti-Grey Hair Serum”; and (58) “Any and all Sephora Marketing
Decks created by Plaintiff”.  (See
RFP 3, SS.) 
C.C.P. §2031.240(c)(1)
provides, “[i]f an objection is based on a claim of privilege or a claim that
the information sought is protected work product, the response shall provide
sufficient factual information for other parties to evaluate the merits of that
claim, including, if necessary, a privilege log.”  (C.C.P. §2031.240(c)(1).)  “The information in the privilege log must be
sufficiently specific to allow a determination of whether each withheld
document is or is not in fact privileged.” 
(Wellpoint Health Networks, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 110, 130.)
Here, Defendant’s counsel argues
that the documents in question are overly broad and privileged and thus not
subject to discovery.  However, despite
this assertion, Defendant’s counsel has failed to produce a privilege log to
demonstrate this.
          Plaintiff’s discovery requests are reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
First, the messages from the company’s communication platform, Slack,
are likely to lead to discovery of admissible evidence in the form of
complaints or communications by Plaintiff to others or by others to Plaintiff
regarding the allegations made against Defendant.  Second, Plaintiff’s causes of action surround
allegations of false advertising and the CEO Dan Hodgdon instructing Plaintiff
to make false and illegal claims involving the product in question.  The documents requested are relevant because
relate to the truth and transparency of Defendant’s advertising, especially
since the advertisements in question were about the same product Plaintiff was
allegedly instructed to make false claim(s) about.  Third, with regard to RFP 3, Nos. 54-57, Plaintiff
requests any and all articles concerning the product in question, which is relevant
because they were determined by the National Advertising Division to be
advertising and marketing for Defendant’s product in question. These requests
would include all articles posted before during and after the complaints and
Plaintiff’s termination. The articles from after Plaintiff’s termination are
relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence because they potentially give insight into the patterns and practices
of Defendant’s advertising and whether CEO Dan Hodgdon responded to or ignored Plaintiff’s
alleged complaints surrounding his instruction to falsely advertise.  Finally, with regard to RFP 3, No. 58, Defendant
has failed to produce the documents pursuant to a protective order; failure to
produce the documents does not moot Plaintiff’s request and is in violation of C.C.P.
§2031.240(c)(1).
Defendant is ordered to
produce Code-compliant, non-evasive responses to RFP 3, 41-50, 52, 53, 57, and
58, subject to a privilege log, within 20 days of this Court’s ruling.
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $8,460.00 against Defendant and its counsel of
record.  Plaintiff requests attorneys’
fees for time spent meeting and conferring with Defendant, which is required by
statute and therefore not compensable on the instant motion.  Therefore, the Court reduces the number of
hours Plaintiff’s counsel spent working on the instant motion from the
requested 14 hours on the moving papers alone. 
          The Court awards sanctions against Defendant and its
counsel pursuant to C.C.P. §§2023.010(d), 2023.010(e), and 2031.310(h) in the reduced
amount of $3,360.00, calculated as follows:
([4.5 hours to prepare
instant motion + 1 hour to review the opposition and draft a reply] x $600.00)
+ $60.00 filing fee = $3,360.00
The sanctions are payable,
jointly and severally, by Vegamour and its attorneys from Fisher &
Phillips LLP, within 20 days of this order.
Defendant’s request for
sanctions against Plaintiff is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 
3.    
Motion to Compel Further SROG
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Further Responses from Vegamour to Plaintiff’s SROG, the Court rules
as follows.
          On August 11, 2023, Plaintiff served SROG (Set Two) on Vegamour.  (Decl. of Levy ¶3, Exh. 2.)  On September 12, 2024, Vegamour served incomplete
and non-Code compliant responses to SROG. 
(Decl. of Levy ¶4.)  On January
23, 2024, Vegamour served supplementary responses to SROG with boilerplate
objections.  (Decl. of Levy ¶7, Exh. 4.)   Plaintiff now moves to compel further responses.  
          SROG Nos. 9, 16-22 asks Defendant to (9) “State any and all
reasons that Dan Hodgdon is no longer YOUR CEO”; (16) “State the name and dates
of employment of all copywriters YOU employed from 2019 until the present”; (17)
“Provide the contact information (names, address, phone number, of all copywriters
YOU employed from 2019 until the present”; (18) “State all website domains that
YOU currently own”; (19) “State all review websites that YOU currently own”; (20)
“State all website domains that YOU have owned from 2013 until the present”; (21)
“State all review websites that YOU owned from 2013 until the present”; and (22)
“State all review websites that YOU have a material connection or relationship with”.
(See SROG SS.)
          Defendant’s responses assert boilerplate objections including
relevance, proprietary and confidential information, attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product doctrine, third-party privacy rights, and “vague and
overbroad as to
the term ‘review websites.’”  Further, the information sought is not within
Plaintiff’s possession nor does it involve confidential or trade secret
information.  Defendant’s position that
the documents in question are privileged and thus not subject to discovery is
unavailing because Defendant’s counsel has failed to produce a privilege log to
demonstrate such privilege.
Defendant is ordered to
produce Code-compliant, non-evasive responses to SROG Nos. 9, 16-22, subject to
a privilege log, within 20 days of this Court’s ruling.
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $8,460.00 against Defendant and its counsel of
record.  Plaintiff requests attorneys’
fees for time spent meeting and conferring with Defendant, which is required by
statute and therefore not compensable on the instant motion.  Therefore, the Court reduces the number of
hours Plaintiff’s counsel spent working on the instant motion from the
requested 14 hours on the moving papers alone. 
          The Court awards sanctions against Defendant and its
counsel pursuant to C.C.P. §§2023.010(d), 2023.010(e), and 2030.300(d) in the reduced
amount of $3,360.00, calculated as follows:
([4.5 hours to prepare
instant motion + 1 hour to review the opposition and draft a reply] x $600.00)
+ $60.00 filing fee = $3,360.00
The sanctions are payable,
jointly and severally, by Vegamour and its attorneys from Fisher &
Phillips LLP, within 20 days of this order.
Defendant’s request for
sanctions against Plaintiff is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
