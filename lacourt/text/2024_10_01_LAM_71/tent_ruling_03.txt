[1] The Court notes the Declaration of Levy incorrectly
identifies RFP 2 as the document at issue in the instant motion.  RFP 3 is the document attached, not RFP 2.  The Court regards the notations of RFP 2 as a
typographical error and reminds Plaintiff’s counsel to proofread his
declarations before filing, particularly when multiple discovery motions are
before the Court.
