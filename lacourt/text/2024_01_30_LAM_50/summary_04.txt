And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the instant motion. The Court notes that the Defendants' motion for summary adjudication was granted as to the first to fourth causes of action and denied as to the fifth cause of action. The Plaintiffs filed objections, which the Court declines to consider because they were not authorized to file additional briefing. The Court also notes that the Plaintiffs' arguments about the stipulated judgment not being a trial are not new and are therefore admissible. The Court then discusses the application of Code of Civil Procedure section 583.350, which provides that an action shall not be dismissed if brought to trial within six months after the end of the period of tolling or extension. The Court also references Jimenez v. Chavez (2023) and Gonzales v. County of Los Angeles (1988) in its discussion.
