[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
DEFENDANT’S
  MOTION FOR MANDATORY DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT FOR PLAINTIFF’S DELAY IN BRINGING
  ACTION TO TRIAL
 



            
Background
Plaintiff Mostafavi
Law Group, APC filed this action
on December 2, 2014 against Defendants Larry Rabineau, a Professional
Corporation and Larry Rabineau.   
Plaintiffs Mostafavi
Law Group, APC and Amir Mostafavi (jointly, “Plaintiffs”) filed the operative
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on November 6, 2015. The SAC alleges causes of action for (1) inducing breach of
contract, (2) interference with contractual relations, (3) intentional
interference with prospective economic relations, (4) negligent interference
with prospective economic relations, and (5) defamation per se.[1]  
On May 4, 2018, Law Offices of Larry Rabineau, A Professional
Corporation and Larry Rabineau (jointly, “Defendants”) filed a Third Amended
Answer to Complaint. 
Defendants now move for an order “dismissing Plaintiffs’ Complaint.” Plaintiffs
oppose.
Evidentiary
Objection 
Plaintiffs object to the
Declaration of Virginia Narian filed with Defendants’ reply in support of the
motion. As noted by Plaintiffs, “[t]he general
rule of motion practice…is that new evidence is not permitted with reply
papers.” (Jay
v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th
1522, 1537.) Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ request to
strike the Declaration
of Virginia Narian filed with Defendants’ reply.[2]  
Discussion
Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310 provides, “[a]n action shall be
brought to trial within five years after the action is commenced against the
defendant.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.360, “(a) An action shall be dismissed by
the court on its own motion or on motion of the defendant, after notice to the
parties, if the action is not brought to trial within the time prescribed in
this article. (b) The requirements of this
article are mandatory and are not subject to extension, excuse, or exception
except as expressly provided by statute.” 
“In computing the time within
which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article, there shall
be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed: (a) The jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended. (b) Prosecution or trial of the
action was stayed or enjoined. (c) Bringing the action to trial,
for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.” (Id., § 583.340.) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.330, “[t]he
parties may extend the time within which an action must be brought to trial
pursuant to this article by…written stipulation” and “[b]y oral agreement made in
open court, if entered in the minutes of the court or a transcript is made.” 
In addition, pursuant to Emergency Rule 10(a),
“[n]otwithstanding
any other law, including Code of Civil
Procedure section 583.310, for all civil actions filed on or before April
6, 2020, the time in which to bring the action to trial is extended by six
months for a total time of five years and six months.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Appen.
1, Emergency Rule 10(a).) 
In the motion, Defendants assert that “[o]n October 31, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Notice of
Appeal on the Court’s Ruling on Defendant’s motion to set aside judgment due to
void 998. The Court of Appeal heard oral argument on February 10, 2021 and the
Completion Date was May 5, 2021. Thus, because the 5-year mark would have
originally been December 2, 2019, Plaintiff had 6 months from the end of the
tolling period - May 5, 2021, to bring the action to trial. CCP section 583.350.[3]
This was November 1, 2021.” (Mot. at p. 3:9-14, emphasis omitted.) Defendants
further assert that “even if Emergency Rule
10(a) adopted by the Judicial Council during the COVID-19 pandemic would
apply (although it arguably does not), an additional six months would extend
the 5-year deadline to April 30, 2022 — almost two years ago.” (Mot. at p.
3:15-17.) 
            Regarding the dates referenced by
Defendants above, on October 31, 2019, the Court issued a minute order in this
matter providing, inter alia, that “[t]he Court orders the case stayed
pending appeal base [sic] upon the Notice of filing of Notice of Appeal on
10/31/19 and Westphal v. Westphal 61 Cal App. 2nd,544. The Court hereby stays
the case in its entirety.” 
On March 3, 2021, the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District,
Division Four filed an opinion indicating, inter alia, “Rabineau filed a
motion to vacate the judgment under section 473,
subdivision (d). He argued his section 998
offer was invalid because it lacked an acceptance provision. Consequently,
Rabineau contended, the judgment stemming from the offer’s acceptance was void
and should be set aside. The trial court agreed and granted Rabineau’s motion.
On appeal, MLG contends the trial court erred by vacating the judgment because
its ruling: (1) lacks support in caselaw; (2) contradicts the policies and
purposes underlying section 998; and (3) violates
principles of contract law and equity. For the reasons discussed below, we
conclude the trial court correctly found the judgment was void. Accordingly, we
affirm.” On May 14, 2021, the Court issued a minute order in this action
providing, inter alia, that “Court in receipt of remittitur filed 05/05/21.”
(Emphasis added.) As set forth above, Defendants’ calculations are based on the
date of May 5, 2021.  
In the opposition, Plaintiffs assert that “[t]he motion must be denied
merely because the five-year period has been satisfied when judgment was
entered against Defendants on June 28, 2019.” (Opp’n at p. 3:19-20.) Plaintiffs
note that on June 28, 2019, the Court issued a minute order providing,
“Stipulated judgment entered for Plaintiff Mostafavi Law Group, APC, a
California Professional Corporation against Defendant Law Offices of Larry
Rabineau, APC and Defendant Rabineau, Larry on the Complaint filed by MOSTAFAVI
LAW GROUP APC on 12/02/2014 for damages of $25,000.01 for a total of $25,000.01…”
Plaintiffs note that this June 28, 2019 judgment was entered “prior to [sic] expiration
of the five-year period on December 2, 2019.” (Opp’n at p. 3:22.) As discussed,
the initial Complaint in this action was filed on December 2, 2014.   
Plaintiffs cite to McDonough Power Equipment Co. v. Superior Court
of Los Angeles County (1972) 8 Cal.3d 527, 529, where the California Supreme Court noted that “Petitioner McDonough Power Equipment Co. seeks a writ of
mandate to compel respondent superior court to dismiss a pending action for
lack of prosecution pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure…section
583, subdivision (b), because it was not brought to trial within three
years after the filing of the remittitur on a previous appeal. We have
concluded that the writ should issue.” The McDonough Power Equipment Court noted that former Code
of Civil Procedure section 583, subdivision
(b) provided in relevant
part: “Any action heretofore or hereafter commenced shall be dismissed by the
court in which the same shall have been commenced or to which it may be
transferred on motion of the defendant, after due notice to plaintiff or by the
court upon its own motion, unless such action is brought to trial within five
years after the plaintiff has filed his action, except where the parties have
filed a stipulation in writing that the time may be extended. . . . When in an
action after judgment, an appeal has been taken and judgment reversed with
cause remanded for a new trial . . . the action must be dismissed by the trial court, on motion
of defendant after due notice to plaintiff, or of its own motion, unless
brought to trial within three years from the date upon which remittitur is
filed by the clerk of the trial court.” (Id. at
p. 530 [emphasis omitted].) 
            The
McDonough Power Equipment Court found that “in
applying section 583, a hearing on a demurrer
constitutes a trial when the ensuing ruling is followed by a judgment of
dismissal.” (McDonough Power Equipment
Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, supra, 8 Cal.3d at p. 532.)
The Court concluded that “where, as in the instant case, a
judgment of dismissal, entered upon an order sustaining a demurrer without
leave to amend, has been reversed, the action must be brought to trial within
three years from the filing of the remittitur in the trial court. In such case
the determination of the issues of law raised by the demurrer constitutes a
trial within the meaning of section 583. Upon the
going down of the remittitur the cause is remanded for a new trial whether the
decision so provides expressly, is an unqualified reversal, or, as here,
contains a direction only as to the overruling of the demurrer. Under such
circumstances, the three-year provision of section
583, subdivision (b), applies and, since the action had been brought to
trial, the five-year provision of such section has no application.” (Id. at pp. 532-533.) 
            In
the reply, Defendants assert that the stipulated judgment entered in this case on
June 28, 2019 was not a “trial.” Defendants first assert that the stipulated
judgment “did not include all the parties and therefore did not bring the
entire matter to trial. The ‘stipulated judgment’ only involved one Plaintiff -
Mostafavi Law Group - and not Amir Mostafavi.” (Reply at p. 2:17-19, emphasis
omitted.) As set forth above, the Court’s June 28, 2019 minute order provides,
inter alia, “Stipulated judgment entered for Plaintiff Mostafavi Law Group,
APC, a California Professional Corporation against Defendant Law Offices of
Larry Rabineau, APC and Defendant Rabineau, Larry on the Complaint filed by
MOSTAFAVI LAW GROUP APC on 12/02/2014 for damages of $25,000.01 for a total of
$25,000.01.” (Emphasis added.) In addition, on June 28, 2019, a Judgment was
entered in this action indicating, inter alia, “Judgment is hereby
entered in favor of Plaintiff MOSTAFAVI LAW GROUP, APC, following an offer of
compromise pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 998 by
Defendants LAW OFFICES OF LARRY RABINEAU, and LARRY RABINEAU, (collectively as
‘Defendants’), and timely acceptance by Plaintiff MOSTAFAVI LAW GROUP, APC for
the sum of $25,000.01.” 
            In Lemaire v. Cox (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d
297, 299, cited by
Defendants, the Court of Appeal noted that “[t]he principal issue on this appeal is whether a partial
adjudication of issues pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c constitutes a ‘trial’ under Code
of Civil Procedure section 583, subdivision (b).” The Court of Appeal noted
that “[o]n
September 16, 1982, Lemaire filed
a motion for summary adjudication of issues pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 437c. The motion was granted in part and denied
in part. On March 23, 1984, approximately five years and six months after the
complaint and cross-complaint were filed, Lemaire filed a motion to dismiss the
cross-complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 583, subdivision (b). The motion was granted and [the] appeal
followed.” (Ibid.) The Court of Appeal
affirmed the judgment of dismissal. (Id. at p. 302.) 
            The Lemaire Court noted that “Cox argues that the court erred
in dismissing the action because the ‘trial’ had commenced within the five-year
period when the court heard and granted in part Lemaire’s motion for summary adjudication of issues. Cox relies on Berri v. Superior Court (1955) 43 Cal.2d 856 [279
P.2d 8], where the Supreme Court ruled that ‘a partial trial of an action
will take the case out of the operation of section
583.’…Berri involved
a situation where plaintiff’s action had been dismissed for failure to amend
his complaint after defendant’s demurrers had been sustained. The court stated:
‘Where a demurrer has been sustained without leave to amend, or the time given
to amend has expired, the matter has reached such a stage that a final
determination of the action is contemplated, and hence section
583 does not require a dismissal because of the lapse of five years since
the commencement of the action. There is nothing in the instant case to
indicate other than that the case is to be finally disposed of on issues of law
-- by way of demurrer.’…Our present case differs substantially from Berri. There had been no dismissal of the cross-complaint and numerous
issues remained to be tried after the partial adjudication of issues.” Similarly
here, the subject June 28, 2019 judgment did not include one of
the plaintiffs in this action, Amir Mostafavi. 
            Defendants also note that in McDonough Power Equipment Co.
v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, supra,
8 Cal.3d at pages 531-532, the
California Supreme Court found that “section 656, which is found within title 8
of part 2 of the code (‘Of the Trial and Judgment in Civil Actions’), does not
provide an exclusive definition of ‘trial’ or ‘new trial,’ nor does it
establish an identity of meaning between the term ‘trial’ as used in section 656 and as used in section
583. On the contrary, in defining ‘trial’ we have said ‘that it is the
determination of an issue of law or fact’ or ‘the examination . . . of the
facts or law put in issue in a cause . . . .’ Witkin recognizes
that ‘[in] its broad meaning the term includes a trial on the law. But whether
a hearing on demurrer constitutes a ‘trial’ usually depends upon the language
and purpose of the particular statute.’” (Internal citations omitted.)
Defendants assert that here, the June 28, 2019 judgment “was not a trial
because it was not a trial on the law.” (Reply at p. 3:22-23.) Indeed, as noted
by Defendants, “[t]he ‘stipulated judgment’ was not the result of ‘the
determination of an issue of law or fact’ or ‘the examination...of the facts or
law put in issue in a cause...’” (Reply at p. 3:23-24.)[4] 
In light of the foregoing authority, the Court does not find that
Plaintiffs have shown that the June 28, 2019 judgment constitutes a “trial” for
purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310. 
 
In the opposition, Plaintiffs also assert that the five-year period
was tolled while the action was pending on appeal. Plaintiffs cite to Bergin v. Portman (1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 23, 26, where the Court of Appeal
found that “[i]n determining whether
plaintiffs’ action was subject to dismissal we may not ignore subdivision (f),
which is expressly made applicable to all other subdivisions of section 583. Reading subdivisions (b), (c) and (f) as
a whole compels the conclusion that in computing the date by which plaintiffs’
action had to be brought to trial in order to avoid dismissal, the time during
which the court’s jurisdiction to try the action was suspended because of
defendant’s appeal from the summary judgment must be excluded from the overall
five-year period commencing with the filing of the complaint.” 
Plaintiffs appear to argue that this action was pending on appeal from
October 2, 2019, to May 14, 2021. But it is unclear why Plaintiffs assert that
this period started on October 2, 2019. As Plaintiffs acknowledge, on October
31, 2019, the Court issued a minute order in this action providing, inter
alia, that “[t]he Court orders the case stayed pending appeal base [sic] upon
the Notice of filing of Notice of Appeal on 10/31/19 and Westphal v. Westphal
61 Cal App. 2nd,544.” (Mostafavi Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. B.) Plaintiffs also assert
that “[t]he stay was lifted based on the final status conference to September
13, 2021 set by the Court.” (Opp’n at p. 4:18-19.) But Plaintiffs do not appear
to cite any order indicating that the stay was lifted on September 13, 2021. 
As the parties acknowledge, on May 14, 2021, the Court issued a minute
order providing “Court in receipt of remittitur filed 05/05/21.” (Mostafavi
Decl., ¶ 12, Ex. E.) The Court notes that there are 552 days between October
31, 2019 and May 5, 2021, the time period the case was stayed pending the
appeal. As discussed, this action was filed on December 2, 2014. Both parties
agree that five years after this date is December 2, 2019. (See Mot. at
p. 3:11-23; Opp’n at p. 2:5-6.) The Court notes that 552 days after December 2,
2019 is June 6, 2021. 
In addition, Plaintiffs cite to Emergency Rule 10(a) which, as
set forth above, provides that “[n]otwithstanding any other law, including Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310, for all
civil actions filed on or before April 6, 2020, the time in which to bring the
action to trial is extended by six months for a total time of five years and
six months.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Appen. 1, Emergency Rule 10(a).) The Court notes that 182 days
after June 6, 2021 is December 5, 2021.[5]
In the opposition, Plaintiffs also assert that “[t]he five year
statutory period is tolled from June 20, 2019, or the date of the settlement to
the date when the Court vacated the judgment entered October 2, 2019.” (Opp’n
at p. 4:4-5.) Plaintiffs cite to Canal St. v. Sorich (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th
602, 608, where the
Court of Appeal noted that “since Varwig the five-year statute has been
amended to particularly incorporate what had been simply a judicially created
exception to the mandatory five-year dismissal. The computation of the
five-year period now specifically excludes the time during which bringing the
action to trial was impossible, impracticable, or futile. (§
583.340, subd. (c).) As both Schiro and Brown & Bryant, Inc., conclude, the time during
which a settlement agreement is in effect tolls the five-year period, for the
reason that attempting to bring an action to trial when all issues have been
resolved through settlement would be futile.” 
Plaintiffs’ counsel states that “on June 20, 2019, MLG’s counsel
hand-wrote MLG’s acceptance onto the offer itself…Thereafter, on June 28, 2019,
the court entered judgment in favor of MLG pursuant to section
998, subdivision (b)(1)…” (Mostafavi Decl., ¶ 6.) The Court notes that on
October 2, 2019, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter alia,
that “[t]he Court grants Rabineau’s motion for relief from void judgment.” Plaintiffs
note that there are 104 days between June 20, 2019 and October 2, 2019. The
Court notes that 104 days after December 5, 2021 is March 19, 2022. 
Plaintiffs also assert in the opposition that “[b]eginning on March
16, 2020, civil jury trials were suspended in the Los Angeles County Superior
Court due to COVID-19. Pursuant to the Presiding Judge’s order of July 10,
2020, civil jury trials would resume on the first court day in January 2021,
which is January 4, 2021. Therefore, this time period—March 16, 2020, to
January 4, 2021—which is 294 days, is excludable.” (Opp’n at p. 4:23-27,
emphasis omitted.) Defendants counter that March 16, 2020 through January 4,
2021 is “an irrelevant period of time because the instant matter was stayed
during this time due to the appeal…the stay period is from October 31, 2019
(when Plaintiff filed appeal) through May 5, 2021 (when stay was lifted).”
(Reply at pp. 4:24-5:2.) As set forth above, the Court included in the
calculations of the tolling of the five-year period the 552 days between October
31, 2019 and May 5, 2021. 
Plaintiffs also assert, without citing to any supporting evidence,
that “[i]t was impossible for Department #50 to proceed with jury trials from
January 4, 2021, to May 11, 2021, due to the requirements of social distancing,
the number of attorneys and parties involved in jury trials, and the minimum
length of jury trials. Therefore, this time period—January 4, 2021, to May 11,
2021—which is 127 days, is excludable.” (Opp’n at p. 5:1-5.) In addition,
Plaintiffs assert without citing to supporting evidence that “[a]lthough
Department #50 reopened for jury trials on May 11, 2021, it could only conduct
jury trials in smaller cases, i.e., cases involving fewer parties and taking
less time than the instant case. It remained impossible for Department #50 to
conduct a jury trial in a case like the instant one until April 4,
2022…Therefore, this time period—May 11, 2021, to April 4, 2022—which is 328
days, is excludable.” (Opp’n at p. 5:5-13.) The Court notes that even if the five-year
period were further tolled for 455 additional days (127 days plus 328 days), as
Plaintiffs contend, 455 days after March 19, 2022 is June 17, 2023. Here, the
trial date is currently set for February 21, 2024. 
Plaintiffs also appear to assert that there was “[t]olling based on
impossibility, impractically [sic], or futility.” (Opp’n at p. 5:14.)
Plaintiffs cite to Chin v. Meier (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1473,
1474-1475, where the Court of Appeal held that “Code of Civil Procedure section
583.340, subdivision (c) tolling includes
the aggregate time a case is continued because of courtroom unavailability
regardless of whether a reasonable time remains to bring the action to trial
before the expiration of the five-year limitation period.”[6] 
Plaintiffs assert that here, “[o]n
the Court’s own motion, the Court has continued the proceedings twelve times…”
(See Opp’n at pp. 5:26-6:16.) In the reply, Defendants note that “[t]he
‘twelve’ continuances Plaintiff[s] cite[] in [their] Opposition are hearing
continuances, not trial continuances (except for one) and Plaintiff[s] cite[]
zero authority that hearing continuances toll the 5-year statute.” (Reply at p.
6:12-15.) Indeed, none of the orders referenced by Plaintiffs on pages
5:27-6:16 of the opposition appear to state that the Court continued the trial
date in this action on its own motion. The only minute orders identified by
Plaintiffs that appear to reference a trial date are the Court’s November 15,
2021 minute order, which provides, inter alia, that “Jury Trial is
scheduled for 09/07/2022 at 09:30 AM in Department 50 at Stanley Mosk
Courthouse,” and the Court’s November 8, 2022 minute order which provides, inter
alia, that “[o]n the Court’s own motion, the Jury Trial scheduled for
11/29/2022 is advanced to this date and vacated…” (Mostafavi Decl., ¶¶ 19, 16,
Exs. L, I.)    
 In Chin, cited by Plaintiffs,
the Court of Appeal noted that “for purposes of the
five-year limitation period, a court-ordered continuance when both sides
announce ‘ready’ and no courtroom is available is to be treated as a discrete
tolling event. ‘[I]t is clear that so long as the court may conclude that there
was a period of impossibility, impracticability or futility, over which
plaintiff had no control [here 50 days because of a pending writ petition in
the Court of Appeal], the court is required to toll that period even if there
is ample time after said period of impracticability within which to go to
trial.” (Chin
v. Meier, supra, 235
Cal.App.3d at p. 1478.) Here, Plaintiffs do not appear to point to
any instance of a “a court-ordered continuance when both sides
announce ‘ready’.” (Ibid.) 
In addition,
in De Santiago v. D & G Plumbing, Inc. (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 365, 368,
cited by Defendants in the motion, “[i]ntervener and appellant
Star Insurance Company (Star) appeal[ed] from a judgment of dismissal for failing
to bring its complaint in intervention to trial within the five-year statutory
period…Star contend[ed] the five-year limitation period did not bar its action
because the impracticability exception, based on court congestion, tolled the
five-year limitation period.” The Court of Appeal disagreed and affirmed the
judgment. The De Santiago Court found as follows: 
 
“In light of case precedent
emphasizing that reasonable diligence is a critical factor in determining
whether the impracticability exception tolls the five-year limitation period,
we conclude, contrary to Chin, that when
determining whether the impracticability exception applies and tolls the
five-year period, reasonable diligence must be taken into consideration,
particularly with regard to the period between the last continuance and the
five-year mark. (Tamburina, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 336;
see also Sanchez, supra,
109 Cal.App.4th at p. 1270; Moss v. Stockdale, Peckham
& Werner, supra, 47 Cal.App.4th at p. 502; Wale, supra, 206 Cal. App. 3d at p. 133.)
 
Where there is
the possibility that Star could have brought the case to trial before
expiration of the five-year mark, despite trial continuances, we cannot
conclude the continuances resulted in impracticability. Reasonable diligence after the
continuances is intrinsic to the determination of the impracticability
exception, whether it is considered in determining the causal connection factor
or as a separate factor. We thus reject Chin to the extent it concludes that the trial court must merely
subtract the aggregate periods of time attributable to each court-ordered
continuance because of courtroom unavailability, without considering whether
the plaintiff was reasonably diligent in bringing the case to trial,
particularly as the five-year mark approaches. (Chin, supra, 235 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1479.)
 
To conclude
otherwise would wreak havoc on application of the five-year limitation period.
In effect, every court-ordered continuance due to courtroom unavailability
would toll the five-year limitation, even if it was nevertheless possible to
bring the case to trial within the five-year limitation period upon exercising
reasonable diligence. It is unlikely this was the intent of the Legislature in
enacting section 583.340, subdivision (c).” (De Santiago v. D & G Plumbing, Inc.,
supra, 155 Cal.App.4th at pp. 376-377.) 
Here,
Plaintiffs do not appear to demonstrate (or even assert) in the opposition that
they exercised reasonable diligence in bringing the instant case to trial. 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court finds that Defendants have demonstrated that the instant
action shall be dismissed, as it was
“not brought to trial within the time prescribed in [Code
of Civil Procedure sections 583.310-583.360].” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.360, subd. (a).) 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing,
the Court grants Defendants’ motion to dismiss.   
The Court orders Defendants
to give notice of this ruling.
