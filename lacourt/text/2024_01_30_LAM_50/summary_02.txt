And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling is a disclosure by Judge Beaudet regarding her potential bias in the case. Approximately 24 years ago, Judge Beaudet and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to take the truck back and refund the purchase price. Judge Beaudet does not believe that her experience will cause her to be biased for or against either party, but if a party believes otherwise, they can file and serve a verified statement of disqualification within 14 calendar days of service. The Informal Discovery Conference is continued to February 13, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this disclosure to any new parties added to the case and to file proof of service with the court.
