  ORDER RE: 
 
PLAINTIFFS’
  MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, SUMMARY ADJUDICATION
 




            
 
Background
Plaintiffs Mike Yessian and Mandi Martinez filed this action on January
13, 2020 against Defendant Garfield Beach CVS LLC. 
On March 14, 2023, Plaintiffs Michael Yessian and
Mandi Martinez (jointly, “Plaintiffs”) filed the operative Third Amended
Complaint (“TAC”) against Defendants Garfield Beach CVS LLC dba CVS Pharmacy
Store and Deborah Padilla. The TAC alleges causes of action for (1)
discrimination in violation of the Unruh Act; (2) defamation per se; (3)
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (4) negligent hiring,
supervision, or retention of employee. 
Plaintiffs now move “for summary judgment, or in the alternative,
summary adjudication in their favor as to each cause of action asserted by
Plaintiffs against Defendants Garfield Beach CVS, LLC and Deborah Padilla…in
the operative complaint.” Garfield Beach CVS LLC and Deborah Padilla (jointly,
“Defendants”) oppose. 
 
Procedural Issues 
As
an initial matter, the Court notes that there are procedural issues with the
motion. 
First,
Defendants’ evidentiary objections concern a “Declaration of Mike
Yessian” and a “Declaration of Mandi Martinez.” However, it does not appear
that such declarations were filed in connection with the motion. The
“Compendium of Evidence in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion or Summary Judgment,
or in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication” does not include a Declaration of
Mike Yessian or a Declaration of Mandi Martinez.  
Second,
Exhibit “A” to the Declaration of Apemwoyah Kisob Alaric-Lorenzo is
highly redacted. Plaintiffs have not filed a motion to seal the redacted portions of the
exhibit. Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 2.551, subdivision (a),
“[a] record must not be filed under seal without a court order.” 
Conclusion
In
light of the foregoing, the hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for
summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication is continued to
____________, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. in Dept. 50. Plaintiffs shall immediately file
the subject Declaration of Mike Yessian and Declaration of Mandi
Martinez served on Defendants in connection with the instant motion. 
In
addition, if Plaintiffs seek to seal the subject Exhibit “A,” Plaintiffs must
immediately file a motion or application to seal pursuant to California Rules
of Court, rule 2.550 et seq.¿If Plaintiffs do not seek to seal Exhibit
“A,” Plaintiffs must immediately file with the Court an unredacted version of
the document.  
Plaintiffs
are ordered to give notice of this order.
