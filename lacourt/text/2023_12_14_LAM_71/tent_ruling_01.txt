reimbursement of verifiable costs and expenses in the amount of $22,446.70, for
a total amount requested by this motion of $127,511.95.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1.)  Plaintiffs make this motion pursuant to a

Background
This is a lemon law action brought under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly Act”). 
Defendant served Plaintiffs with a 998 Offer in this matter on February
17, 2023, which Plaintiffs accepted on February
27, 2023, in the amount of $65,000.00 plus
attorney’s fees, costs and expenses by motion wherein Plaintiffs would be the
prevailing party (“The Settlement”). 
(Decl. of Kirnos ¶30, Exh. D at pgs. 1, 3, ¶¶1, 8.)  
On November 15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed this motion for
attorneys’ fees and a memorandum of costs. 
Defendant filed its opposition on December 4, 2023.  Plaintiffs filed their reply on December 7,
2023.
 
Discussion
Civil
Code §1794(d) provides that a buyer who prevails in an action under that
section, “shall be allowed by the court to recover as a part of the judgment a
sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s
fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been
reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and the
prosecution of such action.” 
C.C.P.
§998(c)(1) provides as follows: “If an offer made by a defendant is not
accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award, the plaintiff shall not
recover his or her post offer costs
and shall pay the defendant’s costs from
the time of the offer.”  (C.C.P. §998(c)(1).)  “In determining whether the plaintiff obtains a more favorable judgment,
the court . . . shall exclude the post offer costs.”  (C.C.P. §998(c)(2)(A).)  “If an offer made by a defendant is not
accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award,
the costs under this section, from the time of the offer, shall be deducted
from any damages awarded in favor of the plaintiff.”  (C.C.P. §998(e).)
Section
998’s plain language only penalizes plaintiffs who “fail[] to obtain a more
favorable judgment or award” than a §998 offer by cutting off their post-offer
costs and requiring them to pay “defendant’s [post-offer] costs” out of any
“damages awarded.”  (C.C.P. §§998(c)(1),
(e).) 
A
party who settles cannot “fail” to obtain a more favorable “judgment or award.”
“Fail[ure]” connotes defeat, abandonment, or “[i]nvoluntarily” falling short of
one’s purpose.  (Madrigal v. Hyundai
Motor America (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 385, 413-414, citing Burton’s Legal
Thesaurus (3d ed. 1998) p. 228, col. 1, Black’s Law Dict. (rev. 4th ed. 1968)
at pg. 711, col. 1; accord Cambridge Dict. Online (2023) [“fail” means
“to not succeed in what you are trying to achieve”].)  Section 998(d) is explicit: A “judgment or
award entered pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be a compromise
settlement.”  (C.C.P. §998(d).) 
Here,
Plaintiffs are the prevailing party and is entitled to attorneys’ fees and
costs pursuant to the 998 Offer.
 
Civil
Code §1794(d)
Civil
Code §1794(d) provides, “[i]f the buyer prevails in an action under this
section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.”
 
Reasonable Fees
To calculate a lodestar amount, the Court must
first determine the reasonableness of the hourly rates sought by the
Plaintiff’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California has concluded that a
reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for private attorneys
“conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Plaintiffs’ Counsel declares the following hourly
rates for attorneys who worked on this case: (1) Roger Kirnos ($500.00/hour);
(2) Amy Morse ($350/hour for 2013-2020, $400/hour for 2021, $425/hour for 2022,
and $450/hour for 2023); (3) Angelica Zamudio ($175.00/hour); (4) Deepak
Devabose ($275/hour for 2015-2020, $325/hour for 2021, $375/hour for 2022 and
$425/hour for 2023); (5) Daniel Gopstein ($175/hour); (6) Daniel Kalinowski ($250/hour
for 2017-2020, $295/hour for 2021, $350/hour for 2022 and $400/hour for 2023); (7)
Heidi Alexander ($325/hour for 2019-2021 and $350/hour for 2022); (8) Jacob
Cutler ($425/hour for 2020/2021, $450/hour for 2022, and $495/hour for 2023);
(9) Katherine Smith ($175/hour as a law clerk and $295/hour as an associate for
2021-2022); (10) Maite Colón
($300/hour for 2017-2020, $345/hour for 2021, $395/hour for 2022, and $425/hour
for 2023); (11) Marisa Melero ($225/hour for 2017-2020, $295/hour for 2021,
$345/hour for 2022, and $395/hour for 2023); (12) Samantha Doody ($175/hour);
(13) Sundeep Samra ($225/hour for 2018-2020, $270/hour for 2021, and $325/hour
for 2022); (14) Thomas Dreblow ($250/hour for 2020, $295/hour for 2021, and
$350/hour for 2022); (15) Theodore Swanson Ramirez ($500/hour for 2022 and
$550/hour for 2023); (16) Thach Tran ($350/hour for 2022 and $395/hour for 2023);
and (17) Zachary Powell ($250/hour for 2017-2020, $325/hour for 2021, $375/hour
for 2022, and $425/hour for 2023).  (Decl.
of Kirnos ¶¶35-51.)  Plaintiffs have
sufficiently demonstrated their counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their
community of practice in their specialized area of law.  (Decl. of Kirnos ¶¶35-51.)
Defendant challenges Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly
rates as unreasonable on the basis there were too many lawyers and law clerks
who billed on this case and their rates are excessive given the simplicity of
the work and the experience level of the lawyers involved.  (Opposition, pgs. 8-9.)  The Court finds Plaintiffs’ counsel’s rates to
be reasonable and do not warrant a reduction.
 
Billed Hours
The party seeking fees and costs bears the burden
to show “the fees incurred were allowable, were reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994)
31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
In this case, the declarations and billing records
provided by Plaintiffs’ counsel are sufficient to meet the burden of proving
the reasonableness of the claimed fees in terms of amounts and tasks. To
satisfy this burden, evidence and descriptions of billable tasks must be
presented in sufficient detail, enabling the court to evaluate whether the case
was overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific claims, and the
reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
Plaintiffs’ fee recovery is based on 192.6 hours
Plaintiffs’ counsel spent litigating this case through this motion, including
an anticipated 7.5 hours reviewing Defendant’s opposition, drafting a reply
brief, and preparing for and attending the hearing on the instant motion.  (Motion Memo, Exh. A at pg. 20.)  The fees incurred are reasonable, as captured
in the billing records submitted to this Court. 
(Decl. of Kirnos ¶2, Exh. A.) 
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s billing records reflect the actual time and clear
descriptions of services performed in connection with litigating this case,
which has been carefully removed or reduced any time that appeared excessive,
duplicative, or otherwise unreasonable. 
(Decl. of Kirnos ¶53.)  Although
the submission of such detailed time records is not necessary under California
law, if submitted, such records “are entitled to credence in the absence of a
clear indication the records are erroneous.” 
(Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)
Defendant argues Plaintiffs’ counsel’s billed hours
were not reasonably incurred and therefore should be cut, and attempts to
circumvent this Court’s page limit by including their objections to specific
billed hours by referring to a spreadsheet in Defendant’s counsel’s
declaration.  (Opposition, pg. 10, Exh. B.)[1]  The Court does not consider such oppositions
incorporated by reference in an exhibit to a declaration and not specifically
argued with substance in Defendant’s opposition.
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ billed hours were
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and were reasonable in
amount.
 
Costs
Civil
Code §1794(d) provides, as follows: “If the buyer prevails in an action under
this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses . . . incurred
by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.”
“If
the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is
on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary. On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are
put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs.”  (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.) 
Defendants
do not object to Plaintiffs’ memorandum of costs in the body of their
opposition.
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ request for costs is granted in the amount of $22,446.70.
 
Final Lodestar Determination
The Court denies Plaintiffs’ request for a 0.5
lodestar multiplier.  Given the routine
work done in this case and the results obtained in this lemon law area, a
multiplier is not appropriate. Any contingency risk factor is already accounted
for in the hourly rates, which the Court has found to be reasonable.
 
Conclusion
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees is granted in the
reduced amount of $70,043.50, and Plaintiff’s costs is granted in the amount of
$22,446.70.  Plaintiffs’ motion is
granted in the total reduced amount of $92,490.20.
