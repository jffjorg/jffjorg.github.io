And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Fan Pena Chitiva v. Alicia Malone (24STCV06667). The defendant, Alicia Malone, had filed motions to compel responses to discovery requests, which were served on May 21, 2024. The plaintiff, Fan Pena Chitiva, did not respond until October 30, 2024. The defendant also requested sanctions in the amount of $1,230.00 against the plaintiff.

The court has ruled that the motions to compel are moot, as the plaintiff has since responded to the discovery requests. The court has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions, as there is no evidence that the plaintiff willfully misused the discovery process. The court notes that the plaintiff's counsel left the firm without responding to the discovery requests, but the court finds that this was an isolated incident and not evidence of willful misconduct.

The court's tentative ruling is as follows:

* The defendant's motions to compel responses to requests for production of documents, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories are MOOT.
* The defendant's requests for sanctions are DENIED.
