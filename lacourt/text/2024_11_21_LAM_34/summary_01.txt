And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has denied the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings filed by North Beverly Park Homeowner's Association, Inc. (Beverly HOA) against James Harden. The motion was filed in response to Harden's Cross-Complaint, which alleges that Beverly HOA failed to inform him of its rules and regulations when he rented a property within the community. The Judge found that Harden's allegations were sufficient to plead a cause of action for negligence against Beverly HOA, as he claimed that the HOA breached its duty of care by allowing over 200 people to access the property in violation of its rules. The Judge also found that the economic loss rule did not bar Harden's negligence claim, as he did not allege a contractual relationship with Beverly HOA.
