Background
 
             On March 18, 2024, Plaintiff Fan Pena Chitiva
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Alicia Malone (“Defendant”)
and Does 1-50 arising from injuries sustained by Plaintiff following a vehicle
collision with Defendant alleging causes of action for negligence. 
 
            On May 21, 2024, Defendant filed an
answer to Plaintiff’s complaint.  
 
On October 3, 2024, Defendant filed: (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Requests
For Production, Set One (“RFPs”); (2) Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One (“FROGs”); and (3) Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One (“SROGs”). On
November 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed oppositions to Defendant’s motions. As of
November 15, 2024, Defendant has not filed a reply.  
 
Legal
Standard
 
            California
Code of Civil Procedure requires a response from the party to whom form interrogatories,
special interrogatories, and demand requests are propounded within 30 days
after service of the requests, unless the time is extended by agreement of the
parties. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a), 2030.270, subd. (a),
2031.260, subd. (a), 2031.270, subd. (a).) If a party fails to serve timely
responses, "the party making the demand may move for an order compelling
response to the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).) By failing
to respond, the offending party waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
 
            For a
motion to compel, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served
its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the
party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response.
(See Leach v. Super. Ct. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905, 906.) Indeed,
"[o]nce [a party] 'fail[ed] to serve a timely response,' the trial court
had authority to grant [opposing party's] motion to compel responses." (Sinaiko
Healthcare Counseling, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 405.) 
 
            The court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel motions for interrogatories or requests for
production, unless the Court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
 
Discussion
 
            Defendant propounded Requests for Production
of Documents (“RPDs”), Form Interrogatories (“FROGs”), and Special Interrogatories
(“SROGs”), on Plaintiff on May 21, 2024. (RPDs Motion, Jones-Williams Decl., Exh.
A; FROGs Motion, Jones-Williams Decl., Exh. A; SROGs Motion, Jones-Williams
Decl., Exh. A.) 
 
            Defendant moves the court to compel
Plaintiff to serve responses to the RPDs, FROGs, and SROGs, without objections,
as Plaintiff has not responded to Defendant’s discovery requests. (RPDs Motion,
at p. 3; FROGs Motion, at p. 3; SROGs Motion, at p. 3.) Defendant’s counsel
declares that Plaintiff’s counsel was granted an extension to respond to
Defendant’s discovery requests by September 9, 2024. (RPDs Motion, Jones-Williams
Decl., Exh. D; FROGs Motion, Jones-Williams Decl., Exh. D; SROGs Motion, Jones-Williams
Decl., Exh. D.) Defendant requests $410.00 in monetary sanctions per motion,
for a total of $1,230.00 against Plaintiff. (RPDs Motion, at p. 5; FROGs
Motion, at p. 5; SROGs Motion, at p. 5.)
 
            In opposition, Plaintiff contends
that Plaintiff’s counsel’s firm was not aware of Defendant’s discovery requests
since they were served to an email address that was not being actively
monitored. (RPDs Opp., at p. 3; FROGs Opp., at p. 3; SROGs Opp., at p. 3.) Counsel
was assigned to Plaintiff’s case when the firm learned of Defendant’s requests.
(Ibid.) Plaintiff’s counsel then requested an extension to respond which
was granted by Defendant. (Ibid.) However, Plaintiff’s counsel abruptly
left the firm without having responded to Defendant’s request. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff’s new counsel learned that Defendant had filed these discovery motion
after being assigned to Plaintiff’s case. (RPDs Opp., at p. 4; FROGs Opp., at
p. 4; SROGs Opp., at p. 4.) Plaintiff’s counsel declares to have served
verified responses without objections to Defendant’s discovery requests on
October 30, 2024. (RPDs Opp., Oglesby Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. A; FROGs Opp., Oglesby
Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. A; SROGs Opp., Oglesby Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. A.) Plaintiff also
argues that monetary sanctions are not warranted since Plaintiff did not
willfully misuse the discovery process. (RPDs Opp., at p. 5; FROGs Opp., at p.
5; SROGs Opp., at p. 5.)
 
            Defendant has not filed a reply to
Plaintiff’s opposition. 
 
            There is no evidence before the
court that would indicate that Plaintiff has not responded to Defendant’s
discovery requests or any issues with Plaintiff’s responses purported to
Defendant on October 30, 2024. As such, Defendant’s motions are moot and
Defendant’s request for sanctions are denied.
