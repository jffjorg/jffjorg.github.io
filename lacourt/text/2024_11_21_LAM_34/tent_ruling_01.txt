Legal Standard
 
“A
party may move for judgment on the pleadings.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(b)(1).) “The motion provided for in this section may only be made on one of
the following 
grounds: . . . (B) If the
moving party is a defendant, that either of the following conditions exist: 
(i) The court has no
jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the complaint.
(ii) 
The complaint does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that 
defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 438, subd. (c)(1)(B).)
 
“A
motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general 
demurrer, and hence attacks
only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that 
can be judicially noticed.”
(Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999, 
citations omitted.)
 
“In
deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all properly pleaded
material facts 
are deemed to be true, as
well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly 
alleged.” (Fire Ins. Exch. v.
Super. Ct. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.)
 
Discussion
 
            Beverly HOA moves the court for judgment on the pleadings
to the Harden FACC arguing that Harden fails to allege sufficient facts to
constitute a negligence cause of action against Beverly HOA as there are no
facts supporting that Beverly HOA owed Harden a duty of care. (MJOP, at p. 5.) Beverly
HOA also argues that the economic loss rule bars Harden’s negligence claim. (Id.,
at p. 8.) 
 
Negligence
 
            In order to state a claim for negligence, Plaintiff must
allege the elements of (1) “the existence of a legal duty of care,” (2) “breach
of that duty,” and (3) “proximate cause resulting in an injury.” (McIntyre
v. Colonies-Pacific, LLC (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 664, 671.) 
 
            According to Beverly HOA, Harden alleges that Beverly HOA
did not inform him of the HOA rules when Harden rented Plaintiff George
Santopietro’s property controlled by Beverly HOA or informed Harden of any
violations to the HOA rules. (MJOP, at p. 6.) However, Beverly HOA argues that
the HOA’s regulations do not apply to non-members and only apply to homeowners
within the community, thus there was no duty owed to Harden. (Id., at
pp. 6-7.) Although Beverly HOA concedes that there are exceptions where an HOA
owes a duty to non-members to adequately maintain common areas to prevent
injuries, Beverly HOA argues that Harden is not within the exception since his
claims arise from an alleged economic injury caused by the HOA’s failure to
inform Harden of the HOA rules and regulations. (Id., at p. 7.) 
 
            In opposition, Harden argues that the substantial
allegation in the Harden FACC is that Beverly HOA violated its own rules when
allowing around 200 people within the community causing Plaintiff George
Santopietro to file suit against Harden for damages. (Opp., at p. 4.) 
 
            Whether a duty of care exists is a question of law for
the court. (Murray v. UPS Capital Insurance Agency, Inc. (2020) 54
Cal.App.5th 628, 639.) A complaint that lacks allegations of fact to show that
Defendant owed a legal duty is fatally defective. (Hegyes v. Unjian
Enterprises, Inc. (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1103, 1111.) In his FACC, Harden
alleges that Beverly HOA failed to inform Harden that he was violating HOA
rules. (Harden FACC, ¶ 19.) Harden also alleges that Beverly HOA is liable for
causing Harden’s damages as it did not follow and disregarded the HOA’s rules resulting
in significant damages. (Id., ¶ 20.) Harden also alleges that Plaintiff George
Santopietro gave Beverly HOA employees the instructions to not restrict the
number of guest that could enter the property while Harden was occupying it
which is in violation of HOA rules. (Id., ¶¶ 22-31.) As such, Harden
alleges that Beverly HOA had a duty to not put Harden at risk, that Beverly HOA
breached that duty when it allowed over 200 people to access the property, and
that the breach has caused an action to be filed against Harden incurring significant
economic damages. (Id., ¶¶ 37-41.) 
 
            The court finds that Harden’s allegations are sufficient
to plead a cause of action for negligence against Beverly HOA. 
 
Economic Loss Rule
“‘A person may not ordinarily recover in
tort for the breach of duties that merely restate contractual obligations.’” (Stop
Loss Insurance Brokers, Inc. v. Brown & Toland Medical Group (2006) 143
Cal.App.4th 1036, 1041 (quoting Aas v. Superior Court (2000) 24 Cal.4th
627, 643.) “‘Instead “[c]ourts will generally enforce the breach of a
contractual promise through contract law, except when the actions that
constitute the breach violate a social policy that merits the imposition of
tort remedies.’” (Ibid. [alteration in original].)
“‘[T]he same wrongful act may constitute
both a breach of contract and an invasion of an interest protected by the law
of torts.’” (Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551 (quoting North
American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 764, 774.)
“‘[A] contractual obligation may create a legal duty and the breach of that
duty may support an action in tort.’” (Ibid.)¿ “[H]owever, conduct
amounting to a breach of contract becomes tortious only when it also violates a
duty independent of the contract arising from principles of tort law.” (Ibid.)¿ 
Beverly HOA
argues that Harden is barred from recovering for negligently inflicted “purely
economic losses” in the absence of personal injury or physical damage to other
property under the economic loss doctrine. (MJOP, at p. 8.)
In opposition, Harden
contends that there is no contract between Harden and Beverly HOA. (Opp., at p.
5.) Instead, Harden argues that the gravamen of his FACC is that Beverly HOA
did not follow its own regulations breaching a duty owed to Harden by failing
to exercise reasonable care giving rise to his negligence claim. (Ibid.)

After reviewing the
Harden FACC, the court finds that the economic loss rules does not bar Harden
from bringing his claims. First, Harden does not allege that a contract existed
between Harden and Beverly HOA nor that a contractual duty was breached by
Beverly HOA. Instead, Harden claims that Beverly HOA breach a duty of care when
it allowed over 200 people to access the property in violation of HOA rules.
(Harden FACC, 19-41.) This harm is separate and apart from “economic
loss.” 
            The
motion is denied.

               Cross-Defendant North Beverly Park Homeowner’s
Association, Inc.’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED.
