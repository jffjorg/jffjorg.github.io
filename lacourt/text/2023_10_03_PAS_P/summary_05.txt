And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' unopposed special motion to strike the complaint filed by the plaintiffs. The complaint alleges that the defendants posted false and defamatory reviews on Google about the plaintiffs. The defendants argue that their speech is protected under the anti-SLAPP statute, which allows for the dismissal of meritless claims arising from protected activity. The judge has found that the defendants have met their burden of demonstrating that they have been sued for engaging in protected speech, and that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the probable success of their claims. As a result, the motion to strike is granted, and the case is dismissed without leave to amend.
