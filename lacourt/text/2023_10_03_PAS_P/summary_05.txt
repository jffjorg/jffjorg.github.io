The judge has granted the defendants' unopposed special motion to strike the complaint filed by the plaintiffs. The complaint alleges that the defendants posted false and defamatory reviews on Google about the plaintiffs. The defendants argue that their speech is protected under the anti-SLAPP statute, which allows for the dismissal of meritless claims arising from protected activity. The judge has found that the defendants have met their burden of demonstrating that they have been sued for engaging in protected speech, and that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the probable success of their claims. As a result, the motion to strike is granted, and the case is dismissed without leave to amend.

English text:
This is a defamation action in which plaintiffs Geoff Antonio Hedgpeth and G.A. Public Adjusters (GAPA) sue former clients for posting false and defamatory reviews on Google's review section for GAPA. Defendants deny posting the reviews but argue that the posts are defensible as true. Before the court is Defendants' special motion to strike, which is unopposed by Plaintiffs. The court finds that Defendants have met their burden of demonstrating that they have been sued for engaging in conduct that is protected under Code Civ. Proc. §425.16, the anti-SLAPP statute. Plaintiffs have failed to oppose the special motion to strike or come forward with any evidence demonstrating the probable success of their claims, and therefore the motion is granted without leave to amend. Defendants reserve the right to seek attorney fees by way of separate motion.
