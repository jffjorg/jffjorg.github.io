Case No.: 23AHCV00652
 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR “INAUTHENTIC” DELIVERY
 
Date:   October
  3, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          
 
          I.        INTRODUCTION
          This action stems from a domestic
violence incident. Plaintiff and former husband Fuxin Sun alleges that when the
police were summoned to their home following the incident, the police believed
Defendant and former wife Lin Gan’s version of the events, which was false. As
a result, Sun alleges he was arrested and held for two days before being
released. 
          Before the Court is Sun’s motion for
an order holding Gan criminally accountable for having filed what Sun contends
is a “false” proof of service. As this is not a criminal court and as Sun has
not cited any legal authority permitting this Court to provide the relief
requested, the motion is denied.         
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
          The memorandum of points and authorities cites Penal Code
§§115, 118, and 126.
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          It is Sun’s contention that because he did not receive a
copy of Gan’s answer, the proof of service attached to the answer must be
false. That is certainly a possibility. Another possibility is that the answer was
lost in the mail. To the extent the proof of service is false, which has
not been established, it is not clear what relief that would entitle Sun to.
          The proof of service attached to the answer complies with
the requirements of Code Civ. Proc. §1013a (1). Consequently, service is
presumed valid in the absence of contrary evidence, at which point it is up to
the trier of fact to make a determination: 
          “(Evid.Code, § 641 [a letter correctly addressed and
properly mailed is presumed to have been received in the ordinary course of
mail]; 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (4th ed. 2000) Burden of Proof and Presumptions,
§§ 67, 78, pp. 216, 219.) . . . When the
foundational facts are established, a presumption affecting the burden of
producing evidence obligates the trier of fact to assume the existence of the
presumed fact unless and until evidence is introduced to support a finding of
its nonexistence—in which event the trier of fact determines the existence or
nonexistence of the fact from the evidence and without regard to the
presumption. (§ 604.) Although the presumption disappears where . . . it is met
with contradictory evidence, inferences may nevertheless be drawn from the same
circumstances that gave rise to the presumption in the first place.” Craig
v. Brown & Root, Inc. (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 416, 421.
          Here, Sun provides purportedly contrary evidence in the
form of his declaration. Sun declares that he resides at the address to which
the answer was said to have been mailed, but he never received it. This is sufficient
to make the presumption of service disappear, leaving the trier of fact to make
a determination regarding the validity of service. 
Without
more evidence, the Court declines to find that service was invalid here. Gan
timely filed an answer and Sun is apparently in receipt of a copy of it. To the
extent there was a defect with service, Sun’s due process rights have not been shown
to be impacted.
 
IV.     ORDER
          Sun’s motion for an order that the proof of service
attached to Gan’s answer is “inauthentic” is denied.      
          The Clerk is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
