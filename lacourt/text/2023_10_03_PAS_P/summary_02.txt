And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying Fuxin Sun's motion to hold Lin Gan criminally accountable for filing a "false" proof of service. The court found that the proof of service attached to Lin Gan's answer complies with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1013a (1) and is presumed valid in the absence of contrary evidence. While Fuxin Sun did not receive a copy of Lin Gan's answer, the court declined to find that service was invalid without more evidence. The court also held that Fuxin Sun's due process rights have not been shown to be impacted, and therefore, denied the motion.
