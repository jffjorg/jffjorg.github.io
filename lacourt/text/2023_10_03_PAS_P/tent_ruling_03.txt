Case No.: 23AHCV00776
 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER OF DEFENDANTS COSTCO WHOLESALE MEMBERSHIP, INC., AND
  DANIEL HERRERA
 
Date:   October 3, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          I.
       INTRODUCTION
          This is a slip and fall case.
Plaintiff Enna Bertulia Gomez alleges that while she was on the premises of the
Costco store located on Commonwealth in Alhambra, she slipped and fell as a
result of a dangerous condition. The complaint names five defendants, each of
whom is alleged to have negligently owned, controlled, maintained, managed, and
operated the store where Gomez was injured. 
           Defendant Costco
Wholesale Corporation filed an answer, as did Defendants The Price Reit, Inc.
and KCRX Price Reit, LLC. Defendants Costco Wholesale Membership and Daniel
Herrera demur to the complaint. For the reasons that follow, their demurrer is overruled.
        
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
Code
Civ. Proc. §430.10(d) provides for a demurrer where there is a defect or
misjoinder of parties. Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on
the basis that a complaint fails to state a cause of action. A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.  
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          A. Summary of Pleading
          The form pleading alleges that Defendants Costco Wholesale Corporation,
Costco Wholesale Membership, The Price Reit, Inc., KRCX Price Reit, Inc., and
Daniel Herrera own, lease, operate, occupy, manage, maintain, and/or otherwise
control the premises at 2207 W. Commonwealth, Alhambra. Plaintiff alleges that
all defendants owed her a duty to prevent, eliminate, and rectify any dangerous
condition, to inspect the premises, and to warn of any dangerous conditions.
There are allegations regarding choices Defendants made that caused the floor
to be unreasonably slippery: 
          “For these reasons, Defendants breached their duty to use
reasonable care and Defendants were negligent in the use and/or maintenance of
the Premises so as to cause and/or allow the presence of a dangerously slippery
floor and/or the presence of a dangerous liquid/dangerously slippery substance
on their floor. While Plaintiff was walking through the Premises, Plaintiff
slipped and fell as a result of this dangerous condition. The dangerous
condition was known and/or reasonably should have been known to Defendants-and
also it was caused by Defendants.”
          Gomez alleges that she suffered bodily injury as a result
of the slip and fall, including but not limited to her tailbone, back, and
neck. 
          B. The Demurrer As To Costco Wholesale Is Overruled
          Costco Wholesale Membership argues that it is an improper party
because it does not own, operate, maintain, or control the premises. This
argument fails because, for purposes of a demurrer, the allegations of a
complaint are assumed to be true. A demurrer admits, provisionally for purposes
of testing the pleading, all material facts properly pleaded. Tindell v. Murphy (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th
1239, 1247.
The
Declaration of Leigh Ann Ruijters offered in support of the demurrer is
improper and cannot be considered. A demurrer challenges defects appearing on
the face of the complaint or in judicially noticeable material.  It cannot be based on extrinsic  evidence. “Speaking demurrers” are not
permitted. Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial
(The Rutter Group 2023), §7.8. The demurrer is thus overruled as to Costco
Wholesale.
          C. Herrera Demurrer is Overruled
          Herrera argues that the complaint does not contain any
factual allegations against him. This argument fails because the pleading
alleges that he, along with the other defendants all own, operate, manage,
and/or control the Alhambra Costco where Gomez slipped and fell. The demurrer
is therefore also overruled as to Herrera.[1]

IV.     ORDER
          The demurrer of Costco Wholesale Membership and Daniel
Herrera is overruled. Moving defendants are granted 10 days to answer. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
