Case No.: 22AHCV00425
 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO STRIKE OR TAX COSTS
 
Date:   October
  3, 2023
Time:  8:30 a.m.
Dept.:  P



 
          
 
I.        INTRODUCTION 
          Plaintiff Kenneth Powell (Powell) sued Defendant General
Motors, LLC (GM) for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Civ.
Code §§1792 et seq. The litigation concerns Powell’s purchase of a 2019
Cadillac XTS. In July 2023, GM’s motion for summary judgment was granted. GM
timely filed a cost bill.
          Before the Court is Powell’s motion to strike and/or tax
GM’s costs. The motion to tax is not well taken, and it is therefore
denied.       
 
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code Civ. Proc. §1032(b) provides that a prevailing party
is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs. Section 1033.5 itemizes
those costs that are recoverable. 
          Civ. Code §1794(d) provides for an award of costs and
expenses, including attorney fees, to a prevailing buyer in a Song-Beverly Act
action. This provision allows for an award of attorney fees only to buyers.
However, prevailing sellers can still recover costs. Murillo v.
Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 985 holds that Civ. Code
§1794(d) is not an exception to Code Civ. Proc. §1032(b).
          California Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(1) requires that
a motion to tax costs must be filed within 15 days of service of the cost bill.
Rule 3.1700(b)(2) provides, “Unless objection is made to the entire cost
memorandum, the motion to strike or tax costs must refer to each item objected
to by the same number and appear in the same order as the corresponding cost
item claimed on the memorandum of costs and must state why the item is
objectionable.”        
 
          III.     DISCUSSION
          Powell argues that GM’s cost bill should be stricken
because GM is not entitled to recover its costs at all. Powell’s counsel urge that
Civ. Code §1794(d) only provides for such recovery to buyers. That argument is
simply contrary to the Supreme Court’s holding in Murillo. The motion to
strike is not well taken, and it is denied.
          Failing an order striking the memorandum of costs, Powell also
seeks to tax the only two items contained in the cost bill: Item 1- Filing and
Motion Fees in the amount of $1,054, which are expressly recoverable pursuant
to Code Civ. Proc. §1033.5(a)(1); and Item 14 – Electronic Filing in the amount
of $151, which are expressly recoverable under Section 1033.5(a)(14) and Los Angeles
Superior Court rule 3.4. 
          Powell argues that GM offers “no justification” for these
costs and “no receipts, invoices, or other documentation establishing its
accuracy.” It is not GM’s job to do so in its initial filing: 
          “‘If the items in a cost memorandum appear proper, the
verified memorandum is prima facie evidence the expenses were necessarily
incurred by the’ prevailing party. (Citation.) To controvert this evidence, the
burden is on the objecting party to present evidence showing the contrary. (Ibid.)”
Whatley-Miller v. Cooper (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1103, 1115. 
          As Powell has not met his burden of presenting any evidence
showing either cost is invalid, unreasonable, or otherwise not recoverable, the
motion is denied.                      
 
IV.     ORDER
           Powell’s motion to
strike or tax costs is denied. GM’s recoverable costs of $1,205 will be added
to the judgment entered August 14, 2023. 
GM
is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
