And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to strike or tax the defendant's costs. The defendant, General Motors, LLC, had filed a cost bill after its motion for summary judgment was granted. The plaintiff, Kenneth Powell, argues that the defendant is not entitled to recover its costs at all, citing Civ. Code §1794(d), which provides for an award of costs and expenses, including attorney fees, to a prevailing buyer in a Song-Beverly Act action. However, the judge finds that this argument is contrary to the Supreme Court's holding in Murillo v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 985, which holds that Civ. Code §1794(d) is not an exception to Code Civ. Proc. §1032(b).

The judge also denies the plaintiff's request to tax the costs, finding that the plaintiff has not met its burden of presenting evidence showing that the costs are invalid, unreasonable, or otherwise not recoverable. The judge orders the defendant's recoverable costs of $1,205 to be added to the judgment entered on August 14, 2023.

**English Summary:**


This tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by Plaintiff Kenneth Powell to strike or tax costs submitted by Defendant General Motors, LLC (GM). The judge denies the motion. 

The background is that Powell sued GM for violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act regarding a 2019 Cadillac XTS.  GM won a summary judgment in July 2023.  GM then filed a cost bill, and Powell moved to strike or tax those costs.

Powell argued that GM, as a seller, is not entitled to recover costs under the Song-Beverly Act. The judge disagreed, citing the Supreme Court case Murillo v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc., which established that prevailing sellers can recover costs under California law.  

The judge also found that Powell failed to provide evidence to challenge the specific costs listed in GM's bill. Therefore, the motion to strike or tax costs is denied.

In this tentative ruling, Judge Margaret L. Oldendorf of the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, Northeast District, denied Plaintiff Kenneth Powell's motion to strike or tax Defendant General Motors, LLC's costs. The court held that GM is entitled to recover costs as a prevailing party under Code Civ. Proc. §1032(b) and Civ. Code §1794(d) does not provide an exception to this rule.

Powell had argued that GM should not recover costs as Civ. Code §1794(d) only provides for such recovery to buyers. However, the court rejected this argument, citing the Supreme Court's holding in Murillo.

Further, the court denied Powell's request to tax the only two items contained in GM's cost bill: Filing and Motion Fees in the amount of $1,054, and Electronic Filing in the amount of $151. The court held that Powell had not met his burden of presenting evidence showing either cost is invalid, unreasonable, or otherwise not recoverable.

Therefore, the court ordered that GM's recoverable costs of $1,205 will be added to the judgment entered August 14, 2023, and GM is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
