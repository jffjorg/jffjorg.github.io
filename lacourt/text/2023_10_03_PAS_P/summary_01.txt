And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion to strike or tax the defendant's costs. The defendant, General Motors, LLC, had filed a cost bill after its motion for summary judgment was granted. The plaintiff, Kenneth Powell, argues that the defendant is not entitled to recover its costs at all, citing Civ. Code §1794(d), which provides for an award of costs and expenses, including attorney fees, to a prevailing buyer in a Song-Beverly Act action. However, the judge finds that this argument is contrary to the Supreme Court's holding in Murillo v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 985, which holds that Civ. Code §1794(d) is not an exception to Code Civ. Proc. §1032(b).

The judge also denies the plaintiff's request to tax the costs, finding that the plaintiff has not met its burden of presenting evidence showing that the costs are invalid, unreasonable, or otherwise not recoverable. The judge orders the defendant's recoverable costs of $1,205 to be added to the judgment entered on August 14, 2023.
