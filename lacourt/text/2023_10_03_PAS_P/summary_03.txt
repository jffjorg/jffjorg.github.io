And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling overruling the demurrer filed by defendants Costco Wholesale Membership, Inc. and Daniel Herrera. The demurrer was based on the argument that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against these defendants. The judge has determined that the allegations in the complaint, which include claims of negligence and breach of duty, are sufficient to state a cause of action against these defendants. The judge has also determined that the demurrer filed by Costco Wholesale Membership, Inc. is improper because it relies on extrinsic evidence that is not properly before the court. As a result, the demurrer is overruled and the defendants are granted 10 days to answer the complaint.
