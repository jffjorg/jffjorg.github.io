The judge has determined that the allegations in the complaint, which include claims of negligence and breach of duty, are sufficient to state a cause of action against these defendants. The judge has also determined that the demurrer filed by Costco Wholesale Membership, Inc. is improper because it relies on extrinsic evidence that is not properly before the court.
