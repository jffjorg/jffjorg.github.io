Petition to Confirm
Minor’s Compromise
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel should be prepared to address the following issues:
 
            1.         Why is there “interest” in the amount
of $2,779.51?
 
            2.         Why does the cost summary state that “James
DeSimone Law to pay 50% of all costs” but the petition has the client paying
100% of all costs?
 
            3.         Will Plaintiff be able to access any necessary
future mental healthcare if the settlement proceeds are invested in an annuity?
