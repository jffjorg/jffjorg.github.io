Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a motion to quash summons filed by Defendant Lyndsey Ardoin in an employment discrimination action brought by Plaintiff Raudel Salinas against Goulds Pumps (IPG) LLC. The motion is based on Ardoin's argument that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over her as a resident of Texas. The judge grants the motion, finding that Salinas failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish personal jurisdiction over Ardoin and failed to oppose the motion. The judge cites relevant case law, including Code Civ. Proc., ยง 418.10, subd. (a)(1), Jewish Defense Organization, Inc. v. Superior Court (1999), Ziller Electronics Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988), and Thomson v. Anderson (2003).
