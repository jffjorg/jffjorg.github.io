 Case Number:  23PSCV00672    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Lyndsey Ardoin’s Motion to Quash Service of
Summons
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant Lyndsey Ardoin’s Motion to Quash Service of
Summons is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This is an employment
discrimination action. In October 1979, Plaintiff Raudel Salinas was hired as a
janitor for Defendant Goulds Pumps (IPG) LLC (Goulds Pumps). In November 1988,
Salinas became a certified welder and continued to work for Goulds Pumps. After
being diagnosed with cancer in January 2019, Salinas began to take time off to
receive cancer treatment starting in March 2019. In May 2020, Salinas went on
medical leave until November 2020 upon the advice of Salinas’s doctor. In
November 2020, Salinas’s wife, Ana Orozco, informed Goulds Pumps that Salinas
would return to work in March 2021. On March 18, 2021, Orozco contacted Goulds
Pumps and informed them that Salinas would return to work on March 22 with
light duty restrictions. On March 19, Goulds Pumps’s human resources manager,
Defendant Lyndsey Ardoin, allegedly informed Orozco that Salinas had been
terminated because “people who are long-term disability get terminated.” On
March 22, Salinas alleges Goulds Pumps terminated Salinas’s employment.
On March 7, 2023, Salinas
filed a complaint against Goulds Pumps, Ardoin, Kevin Harris, and Does 1-25,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) failure to accommodate, (2)
failure to engage in an interactive process, (3) retaliation for whistleblowing,
(4) disability discrimination, (5) retaliation in violation of the Fair
Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), (6) retaliation in violation of the
California Family Rights Act (CFRA), (7) failure to prevent discrimination and
retaliation in violation of FEHA, (8) age discrimination, and (9) wrongful
termination in violation of public policy.
On January 22, 2024, Ardoin
filed the present motion. A hearing on the present motion is set for March 21,
along with a case management conference.
ANALYSIS
Ardoin
moves to quash the service of summons on the grounds that the court lacks
personal jurisdiction. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS Ardoin’s motion.
Legal
Standard
“A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice
of motion . . . [t]o quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd.
(a)(1).) “When a nonresident defendant challenges personal jurisdiction the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate by a preponderance of
the¿evidence that all necessary jurisdictional criteria are met.” (Jewish
Defense Organization, Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 1045,
1054-1055, quoting Ziller Electronics Lab GmbH v. Superior Court (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1232-1233 (Ziller).) A plaintiff meets this burden
by providing “competent evidence in affidavits and authenticated documentary
evidence.” (Id., at p. 1055, quoting Ziller, supra,
206 Cal.App.3d at p. 1232-1233.)
Discussion
In
this case, Ardoin argues both forms of personal jurisdiction are lacking
because Ardoin is a resident of Texas. In opposition, Salinas fails to provide
any evidence to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Ardoin. Further,
Salinas failed to oppose the motion to quash. Because Salinas bears the burden
of establishing personal jurisdiction, and allegations in unverified pleadings are
insufficient to do so, Ardoin’s motion is GRANTED. (See Thomson v.
Anderson (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 258, 271.)
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Ardoin’s
motion to quash summons is GRANTED.
