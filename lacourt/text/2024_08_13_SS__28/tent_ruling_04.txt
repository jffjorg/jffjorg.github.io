 Case Number:  23STCV30306    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On December  12, 2023, Plaintiffs Briana Barr (“Briana  Barr”), Denise Corbin (“Corbin”), and Kairos Barr (“Kairos Barr”), a minor, by  and through her guardian ad litem Briana Barr filed this action against  Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber”), Jiajia Doe, and Does 1-100 for  assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and  negligent hiring, retention, and supervision.  On  December 14, 2023, the Court appointed Briana Barr to serve as Kairos Barr’s  guardian ad litem.  On March  4, 2024, Uber filed an answer.  On  June 5, 2024, Uber filed a motion to compel arbitration. The motion was set for  hearing on July 2, 2024.  The Court continued  the hearing to August 13, 2024.   Plaintiffs have not filed an opposition.  Trial  is currently set for June 10, 2025.  PARTY’S REQUESTS  Uber  asks the Court (1) to compel Plaintiffs to submit their claims to arbitration and (2) to  stay the case pending completion of arbitration.  LEGAL STANDARD  “A  written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a  controversy thereafter arising is valid, enforceable, and irrevocable, save  upon such grounds as exist for the rescission of any contract.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 provides in  part:  “On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement  alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and  that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that controversy, the court  shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if  it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it  determines that:  “(a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived  by the petitioner; or  “(b) Grounds exist for rescission of the  agreement."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2,  subds. (a), (b).)  “Arbitration  is a favored procedure. An ‘ “ ‘arbitration should be upheld unless it can be  said with assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible to an  interpretation covering the asserted dispute.’ ” ’ ” (Salgado v. Carrows  Restaurants, Inc. (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 356, 360, quoting Cruise v.  Kroger Co. (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 390, 397.) “Doubts about the  applicability of the arbitration clause to the dispute should be resolved ‘in  favor of sending the parties to arbitration.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Cione  v. Foresters Equity Services, Inc. (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 625, 642.)  “[N]o  single test delineates the nature of the conduct that will constitute a waiver  of arbitration.”   (St. Agnes Medical  Center v. PacifiCare of California (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1187, 1195 (St.  Agnes).) “ ‘ “In the past, California courts have found a waiver of the  right to demand arbitration in a variety of contexts, ranging from situations  in which the party seeking to compel arbitration has previously taken steps  inconsistent with an intent to invoke arbitration [citations] to instances in  which the petitioning party has unreasonably delayed in undertaking the  procedure. [Citations.] The decisions likewise hold that the “bad faith” or  “wilful misconduct” of a party may constitute a waiver and thus justify a  refusal to compel arbitration. [Citations.]” ’ ” (Id. at p. 1196,  quoting Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951,  983.)  In St.  Agnes, the Supreme Court agreed that the following factors are relevant and  properly considered in assessing waiver claims: “(1) whether the party's  actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate; (2) whether ‘the  litigation machinery has been substantially invoked’ and the parties ‘were well  into preparation of a lawsuit’ before the party notified the opposing party of  an intent to arbitrate; (3) whether a party either requested arbitration  enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking  a stay; (4) whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim  without asking for a stay of the proceedings; (5) ‘whether important  intervening steps [e.g., taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not  available in arbitration] had taken place’; and (6) whether the delay  ‘affected, misled, or prejudiced’ the opposing party.” ’ ” (St. Agnes, supra,  31 Cal.4th at p. 1196, quoting Sobremonte v. Superior Court  (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 980, 992.)  DISCUSSION          Uber  has provided evidence that Corbin expressly agreed to arbitrate her claims  against Uber by accepting Uber’s Terms of Use.   According to Uber, Corbin violated her agreement by filing this action  in state court.  As a result, Uber  argues, the Court should compel Corbin to arbitrate her claims against Uber.  In  addition, Uber asserts that the Terms of Use required Briana Barr and Kairos Barr, as Corbin's guest riders, to arbitrate their claims as well.  (See Memorandum of Points and Authorities (“MPA”)  p. 7.)  “ ‘Both  the federal government and California have strong public policies “ ‘in favor  of arbitration as an expeditious and cost-effective way of resolving disputes.”  ’ ” (In re Uber Technologies Wage & Hour Cases (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th  1297, 1304, cert. petition pending, quoting People v. Maplebear Inc.  (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 923, 930 (Maplebear).)  “But ‘[e]ven though the “ ‘law favors  contracts for arbitration of disputes between parties’ [citation], ‘ “there is  no policy compelling persons to accept arbitration of controversies which they  have not agreed to arbitrate ....’ ” ’ ” ’ ” (Id. at pp. 1304-1305,  quoting Maplebear, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 931.)  With  limited exceptions, only parties to an arbitration agreement can enforce it or  be required to arbitrate. (See Westra v. Marcus & Millichap Real Estate  Investment Brokerage Co., Inc. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 759, 763.)  But nonsignatories of arbitration agreements  may be bound under ordinary contract and agency principles.  (See Philadelphia Indemnity Ins. Co. v.  SMG Holdings, Inc. (2019) 44 Cal.App.5th 834, 840-841 (Philadelphia).)  According  to Uber, Briana Barr and Kairos Barr – who  did not enter into an arbitration agreement with Uber – “are bound to the  arbitration agreement [between Uber and Corbin] because they were an intended  third-party beneficiary under both contract and common law, because of the  principles of estoppel.”  (MPA p. 15.) “Whether  a nonsignatory is an intended third party beneficiary to the contract is  determined from the parties’ intent, as gleaned from the contract as a whole  and the circumstances under which it arose.”   (Philadelphia, supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at p. 841, quoting Epitech,  Inc. v. Kann (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 1365, 1371–1372.) “ “ ‘The test for determining whether a contract was  made for the benefit of a third person is whether an intent to benefit a third  person appears from the terms of the contract.” ” ” ” (Pillar Project AG v.  Payward Ventures, Inc. (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 671, 677 (Pillar Project);  see id. at p. 671 [the “ “ ‘mere fact that a contract results in  benefits to a third party does not render that party a ‘third party  beneficiary” ” ”].)  In Goonewardene  v. ADP, LLC (2019) 6 Cal.5th 817 (Goonewardene), the Supreme Court  clarified that “the contracting parties must have a motivating purpose to  benefit the third party, and not simply knowledge that a benefit to the third  party may follow from the contract.”  (Goonewardene, supra, 6 Cal.5th at p. 830.)  “Under  the equitable estoppel theory, a nonsignatory ‘ “is estopped from avoiding  arbitration if it knowingly seeks the benefits of the  contract containing the arbitration clause.” ’ ” (Philadelphia, supra,  44 Cal.App.5th at p. 841, quoting Crowley Maritime Corp. v. Boston Old  Colony Ins. Co. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1061, 1070.)  “Equitable estoppel, thus, ‘ “precludes a  party from claiming the benefits of a contract while simultaneously attempting  to avoid the burdens that contract imposes.” ’ ” (Ibid., quoting Comer  v. Micor, Inc. (9th Cir. 2006) 436 F.3d 1098, 1101.)  A nonsignatory  plaintiff may be estopped from refusing to arbitrate when he or she asserts  claims that are dependent upon, or inextricably intertwined with the underlying  contractual obligations of the agreement containing the arbitration clause.  (Pillar Project, supra, 64  Cal.App.5th at p. 677.)  Uber has not carried its burden of proving that Briana  Barr and Kairos Barr are third-party beneficiaries of the agreement between  Uber and Corbin.  Although Uber argues  that the Terms of Use “specifically identified” Briana Barr and Kairos Barr, Uber has not shown that Corbin  and Uber had “a motivating purpose to benefit [Briana Barr and Kairos Barr], and not simply  knowledge that a benefit to the third party may follow from the contract.”  (Goonewardene, supra, 6 Cal.5th  at p. 830.)  Uber  also argues that Briana Barr and Kairos Barr are equitably estopped from avoiding arbitration  because their action is based on their use of Uber’s services, “which arose out  of the use of Plaintiff Corbin’s Rider App and Account.”  (MPA p. 17.)   But Uber has not shown that Briana Barr and Kairos Barr “knowingly” sought  the benefits of an agreement containing an arbitration clause.  (See Philadelphia, supra, 44  Cal.App.5th at p. 841.)  Uber has  presented no evidence that Briana Barr and Kairos Barr knew about the Terms of  Use or the arbitration clause.  The  Court grants the motion to compel arbitration of Corbin’s claims against Uber.  The Court denies Uber’s motion to compel arbitration of Briana Barr’s and Kairos Barr’s claims against Uber.  CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.’s motion to compel Plaintiff Denise Corbin to arbitrate her claims against Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.  The  Court DENIES Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.’s motion to compel Plaintiff Briana  Barr to arbitrate her claims against Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.  The  Court DENIES Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.’s motion to compel Plaintiff Kairos  Barr to arbitrate her claims against Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.  The  Court STAYS proceedings on Plaintiff Denise Corbin’s claims against Defendant  Uber Technologies, Inc.  In all other  respects, the Court DENIES Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.’s request for a  stay.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
