And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the arguments presented in a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The case involves a plaintiff, Sedigheh Hajizadeh, who filed a complaint against a defendant, Magic Mountain, LLC, alleging general negligence and premises liability. The defendant filed an answer, and the court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication in part and denied it in part.

The defendant is now seeking judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the doctrine of res judicata applies because the plaintiff previously filed a similar case in Santa Clara County Superior Court and had it dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the two cases are not identical and that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply.

The judge has granted the parties' requests for judicial notice and has overruled the plaintiff's objections. The judge has also continued the hearing on the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings to a date to be provided at the August 13, 2024 hearing.
