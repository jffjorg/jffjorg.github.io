And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that the defendant is immune from liability under Education Code section 44808. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, alleged that the defendant school district was responsible for her injuries, which occurred during a physical attack by her classmates outside of school premises. The defendant argued that it was immune from liability because the student was not on school property at the time of the attack.

The judge found that the defendant had carried its initial burden on summary judgment by presenting evidence that the plaintiff was not on school property when the attack occurred. The judge also found that the plaintiff had not raised a triable issue of fact concerning immunity under Education Code section 88404.

The judge noted that the case law has consistently held that a school district is not responsible for the safety of students outside of school property absent a specific undertaking by the school district and direct supervision by a district employee. The judge also noted that the school district's promise to "get to the bottom" of the problem did not amount to an undertaking to be responsible or liable for the conduct or safety of pupils when they were not on school property.

Therefore, the judge granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiff's request for a trial.
