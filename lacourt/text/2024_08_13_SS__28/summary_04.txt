Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Uber's motion to compel arbitration of Corbin's claims against Uber is granted, but Uber's motion to compel arbitration of Briana Barr's and Kairos Barr's claims against Uber is denied. The Court finds that Corbin is bound by Uber's Terms of Use and is required to arbitrate her claims against Uber, but Briana Barr and Kairos Barr are not bound by the Terms of Use and are not required to arbitrate their claims against Uber. The Court also finds that Uber has not carried its burden of proving that Briana Barr and Kairos Barr are third-party beneficiaries of the agreement between Uber and Corbin, and that they are not equitably estopped from avoiding arbitration. The Court stays proceedings on Corbin's claims against Uber pending completion of arbitration.
