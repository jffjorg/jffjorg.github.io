And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Sergio Antonio Gutierrez-Escalera, by Carney R. Shegerian. The court notes that no opposition papers were filed and that the moving party has served the client and other parties with the moving papers. The court finds that the motion should be granted, as the attorney has shown sufficient reasons why the motion should be granted and why counsel has brought the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) instead of filing a consent under section 284, subdivision (1). The court grants the motion and orders Carney R. Shegerian to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff effective upon the filing of the signed order.
