  plaintiff
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Carney R. Shegerian   
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Carney
R. Shegerian (“Plaintiff’s Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel for
plaintiff Sergio Antonio Gutierrez-Escalera (“Plaintiff”). 
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿¿¿  
The court
finds that Plaintiff’s Counsel has served Plaintiff with the moving papers by
mail at Plaintiff’s last known address, which Plaintiff’s Counsel has confirmed
within the past 30 days is current, and by email.  (MC-052, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(1)(d);
Nov. 14, 2023 Proof of Service.)  The
court also finds that Plaintiff’s Counsel has shown sufficient reasons why the
motion should be granted, and why counsel has brought the motion under Code of
Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) instead of filing a consent under
section 284, subdivision (1).  (MC-052, ¶
2.) 
The court
therefore grants Plaintiff’s Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff. 
Carney R.
Shegerian will be relieved as counsel for record for plaintiff Sergio Antonio
Gutierrez-Escalera effective upon the filing of the signed “Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” on the client. 
 
The court
orders Carney R. Shegerian to give notice of this ruling and the signed “Order
Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” to plaintiff
Sergio Antonio Gutierrez-Escalera and to all other parties who have appeared in
this action.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 14, 2023
