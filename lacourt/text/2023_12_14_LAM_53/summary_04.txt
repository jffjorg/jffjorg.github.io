And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel arbitration and stay action filed by Defendants Miod and Company, LLP and Jeremy J. Salvador, CPA. The motion is based on an arbitration provision in an engagement letter dated October 9, 2020, which requires arbitration of claims relating to the determination of payment of fees under the agreement. The court finds that Defendants have met their burden of producing prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate, but that the Arbitration Provision is narrow and does not include language that encompasses all claims related to the engagement letter. The court also finds that Plaintiff's cause of action for professional negligence does not relate to the determination of payment of fees and is therefore not encompassed by the Arbitration Provision. As a result, the court denies Defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay action.
