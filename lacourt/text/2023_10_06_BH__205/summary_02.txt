And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Plaintiff Maxim Commercial Capital LLC's request for a default judgment against Defendants Stoneridge Construction LLC and Onesimo Martinez, Jr. The case arises from a default on an equipment finance agreement and a personal guaranty. The plaintiff has properly complied with the procedural requirements for a default judgment, including serving the defendants with the complaint and requests for entry of default and default judgment, and submitting evidence in support of the judgment requested.

The plaintiff is seeking a total of $168,799.90, which includes damages, interest, attorneys' fees, and costs. The judge finds that the plaintiff is entitled to this amount based on the evidence submitted and the terms of the agreement. The judge also grants the plaintiff's request for possession of the collateral, a 2015 Vermeer D20x22 S3 w/ Falcon F5 GPS VIN No. 1VRA170VF1000313.

The judge notes that default judgment is appropriate in this case as there has been no appearance or filing whatsoever from the defendants. The judgment will be awarded in favor of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff will be entitled to immediate possession of the collateral. If the collateral is recovered, the plaintiff will sell it and apply the proceeds to the money judgment.
