BACKGROUND
            On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff Julia
Heredia filed a complaint against Defendants Bodega Latina Corporation,
Chedraui USA, Inc., and Does 1 through 100, alleging (1) premises liability;
and (2) general negligence. On June 29, 2022, Plaintiff alleges that she was
shopping at the property 15202 Hawthorne Blvd, Lawndale, CA 90260 (“Premises”),
owned and managed by Defendants, where Plaintiff slipped and fell due to a
liquid substance on the floor. (Compl. ¶ 9.) Plaintiff alleges that the
defendants negligently failed to maintain and inspect the premises, causing her
injuries, pain, suffering, and loss of income. (Compl. ¶¶ 10-14.) 
 
            On April 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set
One, set for hearing on September 12, 2024.
 
            On April 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set
One, set for hearing on September 19, 2024. Advanced to September 12, 2024, by the Court.
 
On April 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses
to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, set for hearing
on September 12, 2024.
 
            On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set
One, set for hearing on September 12, 2024.
 
            On July 30, 2024, an IDC was held.
The Court noted that the motions to compel further discovery scheduled for
September 12, 2024 and September 19, 2024 would remain on calendar. 
 
            On September 6, 2024, Defendant untimely
filed oppositions to Plaintiff’s discovery motions. Given the untimely filing
and prejudice to Plaintiff, the oppositions are not considered. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
The propounding party may file motions to compel further responses to
interrogatories or requests for production if it believes the responses
received are (1) evasive, (2) incomplete, or (3) if the objections raised are
meritless or overly general. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a).) In
response to a motion to compel further responses, the respondent bears the
burden of justifying any objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)
 
If a party fails to serve timely responses to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and seek a
monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (b), (c).) Failure to
respond timely waives all objections, including those based on privilege and
work product, unless the party has (1) subsequently served a response that is
in substantial compliance and (2) the failure to timely respond was due to
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subds. (a)(1), (a)(2).)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
On September 11, 2023, Plaintiff served discovery requests, including
Special Interrogatories, Set One; Form Interrogatories, Set One; and Request
for Production, Set One on Defendants. (Graves Decl. ¶ 3, Exhib. A.) Defendants
did not respond to these requests. (Id. ¶ 4.) On January 16, 2024,
Plaintiff’s Counsel reached out to the Defense, who claimed not to have
received the discovery requests. (Id.) Plaintiff granted Defendants’
request for extensions. (Id. ¶ 5.) Defendants served responses on
February 28, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6, Exh. E.) On March 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel sent an email stating that objections were already waived due to
missing the original deadline. (Id. ¶ 7, Exhib. G.) Plaintiff stated
that email served as her attempt to meet and confer. (Id.) 
 
SPROGS
 
Special Interrogatories No. 1-92 consist of requests regarding the
circumstances surrounding the slip and fall incident involving Plaintiff on
June 29, 2022. These requests seek to uncover specific information about
various aspects of the incident and Defendant Bodega Latina Corporation’s
knowledge, actions, and procedures. The requests seek information regarding
presence of any safety measures, such as warning signs, cones, or notices in
the area where the incident occurred (SPROG No. 1), and whether Defendant was
aware of the hazardous condition, such as a liquid substance on the floor,
prior to the incident (SPROGS Nos. 2-4). Plaintiff also asks about Defendant’s
position on the reasonableness and necessity of the medical treatments
Plaintiff received following the incident. (SPROGS Nos. 5-6.) Other requests focus
on the details of the incident itself, including how it occurred (SPROG No. 7),
who investigated it (SPROGS Nos. 9-10), and the identification of all persons
with knowledge of the incident. (SPROG No. 11.) Plaintiff requests
identification of any documents or evidence that Defendant intends to introduce
at trial. (SPROG No. 8.) Additionally, the interrogatories explore Defendant’s
contentions regarding the incident, including any claims that it did not occur (SPROGS
Nos. 20-23), that Plaintiff was comparatively negligent (SPROGS Nos. 24-27), or
that Defendant did not create or allow a dangerous condition to exist on the
premises. (SPROGS Nos. 28-35.) Plaintiff also seeks detailed information about
Defendant’s maintenance, repair, and inspection practices for the premises over
the past ten years and specifically on the day of the incident (SPROGS Nos.
36-64), as well as identification of any insurance policies that might provide
coverage for the claims arising from the incident. (SPROGS Nos. 65-68.) The
interrogatories include questions about the flooring where the incident
occurred, covering topics such as installation (SPROGS Nos. 69-72), maintenance
(SPROGS Nos. 73-78), cleaning practices (SPROGS Nos. 79-88), and the specific
products used (SPROGS Nos. 83-90). Furthermore, Plaintiff asks for details
regarding the opening date of the premises. (SPROG No. 92.)
 
In response, Defendant objects to all of these interrogatories on
various grounds, including claims that they are vague, ambiguous, overbroad,
irrelevant, and burdensome. 
 
The Court finds the requests to be relevant to the issues in this case
as they seek to uncover the circumstances surrounding Plaintiff’s fall.
Defendant’s response in the form of one objection is improper. Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.210(c) requires each interrogatory to be responded to
separately — which Defendant failed to do. Defendant has failed to provide any
arguments in opposition. The Court finds that further responses are warranted. 
 
Thus, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses
to SPROGS set one. 
 
FROGS
 
The FROGS seek information regarding various aspects of the slip and
fall incident involving Plaintiff such as the identities of individuals who
prepared Defendant’s responses (FROG No. 1.1), the corporate structure of
Defendant (FROG No. 3.1), and any insurance policies that might provide
coverage for damages related to the incident (FROG No. 4.1). The requests also
seek information about potential witnesses, statements made at the scene, and
any individuals with knowledge of the incident. (FROG No. 12.1.). Further
interrogatories seek details about Defendant’s business structure, insurance
coverage, and contentions regarding liability, damages, and other defenses,
including whether Defendant operated as a partnership or joint venture, the
existence of any insurance policies, and whether Defendant obtained any
statements or conducted interviews related to the incident. (FROGS Nos.
3.2-3.7, 4.2, 12.2-12.7, 13.1-14.2, 15.1, 16.1-16.10, 17.1.)
 
In response, Defendant objected to all these interrogatories on
numerous grounds, arguing that the requests were vague, ambiguous, overbroad,
irrelevant, unduly burdensome, and intended to harass. Defendant also claimed
that certain requests improperly sought confidential or privileged information,
required expert opinions or legal conclusions, and invaded the attorney-client
privilege or attorney work product doctrines. Defendant did not provide
substantive responses, instead repeating identical objections to each
interrogatory. 
 
Plaintiff contends that these objections are without merit and have
been waived due to Defendant’s failure to provide timely responses as required
under California law. Consequently, Plaintiff has filed a motion to compel
further responses, arguing that Defendant’s objections are invalid and that
complete answers are essential for properly evaluating and preparing the case. 
 
            The Court finds that the requests
appear to be relevant. Defendant’s responses are deficient as they fail to
provide substantive answers to the other interrogatories. The objections raised
by Defendant—claiming the requests were vague, overbroad, irrelevant, or unduly
burdensome—are not adequately justified, and the failure to respond timely under
California law results in a waiver of these objections. 
 
Thus, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses
to FROGS set one.
 
RPDs
 
The Requests for Production seek various documents such as insurance
policies that may cover damages related to the incident, as well as any
incident or investigation reports, including statements from any witnesses and
the Plaintiff. (RPDs Nos. 1-4.) Plaintiff also requests visual and surveillance
evidence, such as photographs, diagrams, and video footage from the premises on
the day of the incident. (RPDs Nos. 5-6.) Additionally, Plaintiff seeks
documents related to Defendant’s investigation of the incident, any admissions,
and any documents supporting Defendant’s claim that Plaintiff was comparatively
negligent. (RPDs Nos. 7-10.) Further, the requests include records concerning
the maintenance, repair, and inspection of the floors on the premises over the
past 10 years, and any safety procedures or policies regarding slip and fall or
personal injury accidents that were in effect at the time of the incident. (RPDs
Nos. 11-18, 24-29, 42-44.) Plaintiff also seeks documents related to any prior
slip and fall incidents at the premises within the past 10 years and any
citations by government agencies concerning conditions at the premises over the
last 15 years. (RPDs Nos. 19-21.) In addition, the requests cover management
agreements for the premises for the last 10 years and the current deed for the
ownership of the premises. (RPDs Nos. 22-23.) Plaintiff further requests
documents regarding the installation, purchase, maintenance, and cleaning of
the flooring where the incident occurred, including records of glossing,
waxing, buffing, polishing, and the brands of cleaning solutions used before and
at the time of the incident. (RPDs Nos. 30-41.) Finally, Plaintiff seeks
documents detailing procedures and policies for inspecting the floors in effect
at the time of the incident and any supporting documents referenced in
Defendant’s responses to the Form and Special Interrogatories. (RPDs Nos. 43-46.)
Plaintiff states that these requests are aimed at establishing the
circumstances of the incident, identifying potential negligence, and
determining any contributory factors related to Defendant’s liability. 
 
Defendant provides one response to all of Plaintiff’s RPDs Nos. 1-46. Defendant
states that the requests are speculative, compound, vague, ambiguous,
uncertain, confusing, unintelligible, and overbroad. It further contends that
the requests are overly broad in scope and time, irrelevant to the subject
matter, and not likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Defendant also claims that complying with the requests would be unduly
burdensome, cause unwarranted annoyance or embarrassment, and be oppressive. Additionally,
Defendant objects to the requests as being argumentative, assuming facts that
may not be true, and improperly requiring the adoption of those assumptions. It
argues that the requests seek confidential, proprietary information that is
irrelevant and invades privacy rights, including those of third parties.
Defendant also contends that the requests violate attorney-client privilege and
the attorney work product doctrine, call for expert opinions and legal
conclusions, and seek premature disclosure of expert witness information. It
further states that the information sought is equally or more readily available
to Plaintiff. Defendant reserves the right to supplement and amend its
responses as discovery is ongoing.
 
The Court finds the requests to be relevant to the issues in this case
as they seek to uncover the circumstances surrounding Plaintiff’s fall.
Defendant’s response in the form of one objection is improper. Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.210(c) to be responded to separately — which Defendant
failed to do. Defendant has failed to provide any arguments in opposition. The
Court finds that further responses are warranted. 
 
Thus, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses
to RPDs set one. 
 
RFAs
 
            In the Requests for
Admissions, Plaintiff requests that Defendant admit several key points related
to the slip and fall incident that occurred on June 29, 2022. These include the
ownership and management of the premises by Bodega Latina Corporation, the
occurrence of the incident, and the resulting injuries and medical expenses
sustained by Plaintiff. Plaintiff also seeks admissions that Bodega Latina
Corporation’s negligence caused or contributed to the incident and that the
company had a duty to maintain, inspect, and repair the premises to ensure
safety. Furthermore, Plaintiff requests Defendant to admit that a liquid
substance was present on the floor at the time of the incident, that Defendant
knew of this condition but failed to respond appropriately, and that no proper
procedures or policies for inspection, maintenance, or handling of slip and
fall accidents were in place or followed on the day of the incident. Additionally,
Plaintiff requests that Defendant admit that it did not provide any warning
signs or other warnings for slip and fall hazards and failed to call emergency
personnel after the incident. Finally, Plaintiff seeks admissions regarding the
existence of video surveillance footage that captured the incident, which
Defendant allegedly destroyed or allowed to be erased. 
 
In response, Defendant objects
to requests for admission numbers 1-40 in one response. It asserts that the
requests are speculative, vague, ambiguous, uncertain, confusing,
unintelligible, overbroad, and compound. It further contends that the requests
are overly broad and irrelevant to the subject matter of the lawsuit, not
likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and unduly burdensome
and oppressive, imposing an undue burden and expense. It also asserts that the
requests appear to be intended to annoy and harass them and rely on assumptions
that may not be true, thereby improperly requiring the adoption of these
assumptions. Additionally, it argues that the requests seek confidential and
proprietary information that is irrelevant and invade their right to privacy as
well as the privacy rights of third parties. It further objects on the grounds
that the requests violate attorney-client privilege and the attorney work
product doctrine and seek expert opinions, legal conclusions, and the legal reasoning
behind their case strategy. It maintains that the information sought is equally
or more readily available to the Propounding Party and that the requests demand
premature disclosure of expert witness information and opinions. Finally, it notes
that discovery is ongoing and reserves the right to amend or supplement their
response in the future.
 
The Court finds these requests to
be relevant and aimed at establishing Defendant’s liability for Plaintiff’s
injuries by confirming Defendant’s ownership and management responsibilities,
failure to maintain a safe environment, and inadequate response to the
incident. The Court also finds Defendant’s response in the form of one objection to be improper under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.210(a), which states “each response shall
answer the substance of the requested admission, or set forth an objection to
the particular request.” (emphasis added.) Thus, further responses are
warranted. 
 
Thus, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses
to RFAs, set one. 
 
Sanctions
 
            As the prevailing party,
Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions. For each of the SPROGS, FROGS, RPD, and RFA
motions, Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amount of $811.65, consisting of $300
hourly fee at 1 hour for the motion, 1 hour for reply, and 0.5 hours to attend
the hearing, along with the $61.65 filing fee. The Court finds the $300 hourly
fee to be reasonable. However, given the lack of opposition, the Court reduces
the hours to 1.5 for each motion, at $511.65 for each motion. 
 
            Thus, the Court awards
sanctions to Plaintiff in the total amount of $2,046.60.
