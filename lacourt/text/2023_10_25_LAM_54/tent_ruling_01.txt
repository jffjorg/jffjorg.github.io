Hearing Date: October 25, 2023
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Tax Costs
Moving Party: Plaintiff Larry Waldie 
Responding Party: Defendant County of Los Angeles
 
T/R:      PLAINTIFF'S MOTION IS GRANTED IN PART
AND DENIED IN PART. 
 
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please email the
courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the
hearing. 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply.
Except as otherwise expressly provided
by statute, “a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover
costs in any action or proceeding.”  (CCP
§ 1032(b).)  “Allowable costs shall be
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” 
(CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).)  “If the
items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on
the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary.”  (Ladas v. California
State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774.)  “On the other hand, if the items are properly
objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party
claiming them as costs.”  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiff moves to tax court-ordered
transcript costs, photocopy costs, process server fees, witness fees, jury
fees, mediation fees, filing fees, and travel costs. 
 
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s
claimed filing fees, jury fees, and deposition transcript costs are higher than
the attached invoices for these costs. Those costs are reduced by $1,590.32, $954.08, and $512.45, respectively.
 
Plaintiff state that Defendant’s photocopy costs are not trial photocopy
costs and therefore are not recoverable. These costs are reduced by $1,557.75.
 
Plaintiff challenges witness costs on the ground that half the costs are
for Defendant’s expert, which are not recoverable. These costs are reduced by
$1,350.00.
 
Defendant seeks $13,188.21 in transcript costs, but the Court did not
order any transcripts. These costs are stricken in their entirety.
 
The Court does not take issue with the travel costs or meditation fees.
These were reasonably necessary to conduct the litigation.
