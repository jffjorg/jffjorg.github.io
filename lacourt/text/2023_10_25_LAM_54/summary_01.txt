And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Larry Waldie, has moved to tax court-ordered costs incurred in the case against the defendant, County of Los Angeles. The judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The plaintiff has been granted a reduction of $1,590.32 in filing fees, $954.08 in jury fees, and $512.45 in deposition transcript costs. The plaintiff has also been granted a reduction of $1,557.75 in photocopy costs, as these costs are not trial photocopy costs and are therefore not recoverable. Additionally, the plaintiff has been granted a reduction of $1,350.00 in witness costs, as half of these costs are for the defendant's expert, which are not recoverable. The defendant's request for $13,188.21 in transcript costs has been stricken, as the court did not order any transcripts. The travel costs and mediation fees claimed by the plaintiff have been allowed, as these were reasonably necessary to conduct the litigation.
