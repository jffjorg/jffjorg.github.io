Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Defendant Thunder Ridge Transport's motion for leave to conduct discovery related to Plaintiff Chad Perrigo's past and future wage loss claims and pending worker's compensation case. The court ruled that the scope of the requested information is overbroad and seeks information beyond that which would lead to discoverable information in this case. The court noted that the requested information is not limited to documents related to the accident and may include more information than just Plaintiff's accident. The court also noted that seeking medical records from Plaintiff's employer may raise HIPAA concerns.
