And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to quash the deposition subpoena for production of documents. The subpoena was issued by the Plaintiff to obtain financial documents and communications from the Defendant's outside accountants, FGMK, LLC. The Defendant argued that the documents were prepared under specific privileges, were unrelated to the Plaintiff's claims, and went beyond the scope of the issues in the action. The Judge found that the Plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated that the information cannot be obtained in a less intrusive manner and that the subpoena is overly broad. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff is seeking the information from a third-party, not the Defendant itself, and that the subpoena is not limited to seeking only basic information about the valuation of the company. As a result, the Judge granted the motion to quash the deposition subpoena.
