And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The defendant's motion for reconsideration of the court's May 9, 2024 decision is denied. The court has already considered the defendant's contention that it has discovered new facts, specifically that the plaintiff underwent a spinal cord stimulator trial. However, the defendant was aware of this fact as early as May 7, 2024, but failed to present it at the hearing on May 9, 2024. The defendant's request for depositions and requests for the plaintiff's friends and prior employers is also denied, as these requests had already been requested in the original motion to extend discovery and were denied by the court. The court finds that there are no new facts and no actionable basis for the motion. The defendant's motion is denied."
