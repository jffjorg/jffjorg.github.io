Background  
  
On March 3, 2022, Plaintiffs Trenna Kertrell
Jones and Journella Paige Saunderson filed the present car accident lawsuit. On
October 24, 2023, Defendants served Special Interrogatories, Set One, Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production and Inspection of
Documents, Set One. The deadline for Plaintiffs’ verified responses was November
24, 2023. Defendants did not receive any discovery responses or a request for
an extension by the deadline, November, 24,2023. On January 17, 2024, Defendant's
counsel sent a meet and confer letter requesting status of the late discovery responses.
Plaintiffs were then given a January, 31, 2024, deadline to serve verified
discovery responses without objections. On January 31, Plaintiffs requested and
were granted an extension until February 19, 2024, to respond to discovery
requests. Plaintiffs then requested and were granted three more extensions to
respond to Defendant’s discovery requests. Finally, on March 22, 2024, Defendant’s
counsel e-mailed Plaintiffs’ counsel stating  that the extension to April 4, 2024, was the
fourth and final extension. On April 4, 2024, Plaintiffs requested an extension
until April, 24, 2024 to respond to discovery requests. On April, 9, 2024, Defendant’s
counsel e-mailed Plaintiff’s counsel and declined to grant Plaintiffs another
extension. 
 
Defendants now move the Court to compel
Plaintiffs to serve verified discovery responses to its Form Interrogatories,
Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production and
Inspection of Documents, Set One, without objections.  Defendant also seeks sanctions of $561.65 per
motion. Plaintiffs’ counsel filed an opposition indicating that she could not
reach Plaintiffs and therefore requesting that Defendant’s request for sanctions
be denied.
Legal Standard
A defendant may make a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time. Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.020(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020(a).) A defendant may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.020(a); 2030.020(a).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030(a)(1) - (a)(2).)   
  
The party whom the request is propounded upon
is required to respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the
parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such
agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260(a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.260(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270(a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270(a)
- (b).)   
  
If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or
interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to
exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and
waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for
work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(a).)  The party propounding the discovery requests may move for an order
compelling responses.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a motion to
compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030(a)
provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a
party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to respond or
submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010(d).) A
court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791.) Yet, monetary sanctions are inappropriate when the party who fails
to adequately respond to discovery responses has acted with substantial
justification or the circumstances make imposition of sanctions unfair and
unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030).  
    
Analysis
 
It is undisputed that Plaintiffs did not
serve initial discovery responses. Due to Plaintiffs’ failures to provide
responses even after several extensions were granted, they have forfeited all
objections, including those pertaining to privilege. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290
(a).). Consequently, Defendant's motions to compel are GRANTED, and Plaintiffs are
ORDERED to submit verified discovery responses without objections within 20
days from today’s date. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of
$561.65 for each motion to compel initial responses. Because Defendant’s
motions to compel are granted and the Court does not find that Plaintiffs to
have acted with substantial justification, sanctions are mandatory. The Court
finds the amount of sanctions requested to be reasonable. Consequently, the
Court sanctions Plaintiffs in the amount of $1,685. Because Plaintiffs’ Counsel
has made substantial efforts to locate Plaintiffs through various ways such as
phone calls to their last known phone number, emailing Plaintiffs at their last
known email address, sending letters to Plaintiffs’ last known mailing address,
and even hiring a private investigator to inquire about Plaintiffs’
whereabouts, the sanctions will be imposed only on Plaintiffs, not Plaintiffs'
counsel. The court orders each
Plaintiff to pay sanctions of $842.50 to Defendant within 30 days of today’s
date.
