The defendant has demonstrated good cause for the production of the documents sought and has fulfilled the meet and confer requirement under CCP § 2025.450(b)(2). The plaintiff is ordered to appear for his deposition and produce the requested documents within 20 days. The defendant also seeks sanctions in the amount of $500.46, which the court finds reasonable. The court orders the plaintiff and his counsel to pay sanctions to the defendant within 20 days. Additionally, the defendant's motion to continue the trial from September 18, 2024, to June 18, 2025, is granted.
