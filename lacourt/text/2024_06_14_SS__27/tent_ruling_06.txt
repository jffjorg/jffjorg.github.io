MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL 
Hearing Date: 6/14/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV07147 KENIA GABRIELA
ANDRADE, et al. vs BRANDY WEISS
Moving Party: Defendant Defendants
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED 
 
On February 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed the
present motor accident case. Defendants filed their answers in July or October
2023. The current trial date is set for August 28, 2024. On May 14, 2024,
Defendant Avis Budget Car Rental filed a motion for summary judgment (MSJ) with
a hearing date set for December 2, 2024. Defendant now moves the Court to
continue the trial to a date 30 days after December 2, 2024.
 
"A trial court may not refuse to hear a
summary judgment filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 437c. [Citation.] Local rules and practices may not be applied so as to
prevent the filing and hearing of such a motion." (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First
State Inc. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330
[invalidating case management order to the extent it precluded filing motions
pursuant to section 437c ]; Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 918, 923 [local court rule that "require a party filing a
complex summary judgment motion to file the motion six months before the date
set for trial is void and unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section
437c"].) As the Sentry court explained: "We are sympathetic to
the problems the trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many
motions for summary judgment. However, the solution to these problems cannot
rest in a refusal to hear timely motions." (Sentry, supra.
at p. 530.) 
 
Continuing the trial so the MSJ can be heard constitutes good
cause. No opposition was filed alleging prejudice. Thus, the present motion is
GRANTED. Considering that Defendants filed their answers in July or October
2023, the parties have had less than a year to conduct discovery. Therefore,
fact discovery will follow the new trial date.
 
Trial is continued to January __, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status Conference
is continued to January __, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. All case-related deadlines are
to follow the new trial date.
