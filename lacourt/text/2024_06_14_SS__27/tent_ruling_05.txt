 Case Number:  22STCV01252    Hearing Date:   June 14, 2024    Dept:  27 Hon. Lee S. Arian, Dept 27
 
MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE
Hearing Date: 6/14/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV01252 DUAYNE BRYANT vs
HARBOR BREEZE CORP 
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE IS DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE
 
Plaintiff moves the
Court to consolidate case no. 22STCV01252 pending in this department (Spring
Street, Dept. 27) and case no. 23LBCV01231 filed at the Governor George
Deukmejian Courthouse and pending in a department at that courthouse. 
Los Angeles County Court Rules, Rule 3.3(g) states, “Cases may not
be consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate
two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in
different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the
cases were already assigned to that department.”¿ 
 
Consolidation is currently improper as the
two cases are in different departments. The cases must first be related and
then the Court can consider consolidation. 
Thus, the motion is denied without prejudice.
