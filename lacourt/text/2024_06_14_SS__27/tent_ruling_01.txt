MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE CROSS COMPLAINT
Hearing Date: 6/14/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 19STCV45605 OCTAVIO
HERNANDEZ vs CITY OF INGLEWOOD
Moving Party: Defendant City of Inglewood
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE CROSS
COMPLAINT
IS GRANTED 
 
A cross-complaint against any of
the parties who filed the initial complaint or cross-complaint against the
cross-complainant must be filed before or at the same time as the answer to the
initial complaint or cross-complaint, which answer must be filed within 30 days
of service of the complaint or cross-complaint.¿(CCP §§ 412.20(a)(3), 428.50(a), 432.10.)¿Any other cross-complaint may be
filed at any time before the court has set a trial date.¿(CCP §428.50(b).) 
 
If a party fails to file a
cross-complaint within the time limits described above, he or she must obtain
permission from the court to file the cross-complaint.¿(CCP §§ 426.50, 428.50(c).) The proposed
cross-complaint is mandatory when it arises out of the same transaction as
plaintiff’s claim. The court must grant leave to file the mandatory
cross-complaint absent bad faith. (Code Civ. Proc., § 426.50, Silver Organizations,
Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 99.) Leave to file a permissive
cross-complaint need only be granted in the interest of justice. (CCP
§428.50(c).) Judicial policy generally supports the resolution of all disputed
matters between parties, leave to amend or leave to cross-complain is typically
granted liberally. (See Kolani v. Gluska (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 402,
412.) The Court may, however, deny such leave if there is demonstrated
prejudice to the opposing party, such as trial delays, loss of critical
evidence, or increased preparation costs. (Id.)¿ “Cross complaints for comparative equitable
indemnity would appear virtually always transactionally related to the main
action.” (Time for Living, Inc. v. Guy Hatfield Homes/All American
Develop. Co. (1991) 230 CA3d 30, 38.)
 
California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1324 requires a copy of the proposed cross complaint to be attached to the
motion. 
 
Defendant City of
Inglewood moves the Court to file a cross-complaint for indemnity against
Defendant Consolidated Disposal Services. A cross-complaint for indemnity is
mandatory. The Court does not find that Defendant acted in bad faith, and no
opposition was filed alleging prejudice. Furthermore, Defendant attached a copy
of the proposed cross-complaint to the motion. Thus, the present motion is
GRANTED.
