And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses several motions in limine (MIL) filed by the defendants in a case involving alleged assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress by Jacquelyn Lacey. The judge denied the defendants' MIL #5, which sought to exclude all evidence not disclosed in discovery, as the defendants failed to identify specific evidence that should be excluded and did not demonstrate a right to an exclusion order.

The judge also denied MIL #6, which sought to exclude evidence and argument that the gun allegedly pointed by Jacquelyn Lacey was loaded, as this evidence is relevant to the plaintiffs' claims for assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge denied MIL #7, which sought to exclude testimony by plaintiff Justin Marks that his father is a law enforcement officer, as this testimony is directly relevant to his perception of imminent threat and the fear and trauma that arose from that perception.

The judge granted MIL #8 in part, excluding evidence regarding specific officer-involved shooting incidents and prosecutorial decisions made by Jacquelyn Lacey during her tenure as DA, but allowed broad descriptions of the parties' policy-based opposition to her tenure and candidacy.

The judge granted MIL #9 in part, excluding testimony by treating therapist Monica Ellison regarding the degree of stress created by the incident at issue in the case, but allowed her to testify about the symptoms reported by the plaintiffs and the diagnosis or prognosis of their conditions.

Finally, the judge granted MIL #10 in part, limiting the testimony of expert witness David Lombardo to his opinions on human factors and firearms safety, but not allowing him to testify on other matters.
