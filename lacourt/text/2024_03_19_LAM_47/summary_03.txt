```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has denied the motion of Attorney Nick Iezza, counsel for Defendant Washington Motors, LLC, to be relieved as counsel. The court had previously ordered Attorney Iezza to serve all parties with the moving papers and file proof of service with the court by January 29, 2024. However, Attorney Iezza only filed proof of service for the declaration in support of the motion and did so on February 1, 2024, failing to comply with the court's order. As a result, the court has denied the motion without prejudice to a procedurally proper motion.
