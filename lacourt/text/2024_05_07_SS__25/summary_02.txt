The judge has granted the plaintiff's amended motion for order allowing the plaintiff to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff is ordered to serve and electronically file the proposed first amended complaint by the close of business on Friday, May 10, 2024. The demand amount in the proposed first amended complaint takes the case out of limited civil jurisdiction, so the case will be reclassified as an unlimited civil jurisdiction matter. The plaintiff is also ordered to pay the proper reclassification fees upon filing of the first amended complaint.
