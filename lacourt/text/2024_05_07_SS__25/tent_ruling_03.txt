 
BACKGROUND
 
This
action arises from the alleged failure to pay premiums under a policy for
workers compensation. On August 17, 2022, Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment
Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Greenfield
Landscaping and Maintenance, Inc. aka Greenfield Tree Service (“Defendant”) and
DOES 1 through 10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of
contract; (2) open book account; (3) account stated; and (4) reasonable value. 
 
On
October 25, 2022, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing that the summons
and complaint were substitute served on Defendant on October 13, 2022.  
 
On December
6, 2022, default was entered against Defendant. 
 
On
December 20, 2022, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request, Does 1 through 10,
inclusive were dismissed without prejudice. 
 
On
January 4, 2023, default judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant in the total of $25,671.14.
 
On April
25, 2023, Defendant filed a Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment
and to Stay Execution of the Judgment. Defendant filed a joint stipulation on
May 9, 2023, indicating that the parties agreed to set aside the default and
default judgment and that Defendant would file an answer to the Complaint
within ten days of the Court’s order.
 
On May
30, 2023, pursuant to stipulation between the parties, the Court entered an
order setting aside the default and default judgment entered against Defendant.

 
On June
13, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On July
7, 2023, the Court reassigned this matter to the Honorable Katherine Chilton in
Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse. 
 
On February
23, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served a Motion for Order Allowing Plaintiff
Leave to File a First Amended Complaint. 
 
On March
20, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion for leave to
amend to May 7, 2024. (03/20/24 Minute Order at p. 5.) The Court continued the
hearing because Plaintiff did not sufficiently satisfy the requirements of California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. (03/20/24 Minute Order at p. 4.) The Court found
that the motion included “a copy of the proposed amended complaint as well as a
declaration specifying the effect, necessity, and propriety of the amendments,
date of discovery and reasons for delay.” (03/20/24 Minute Order at p. 4.)
Plaintiff, however, did “not provide the Court with specifications by reference
to pages and lines the allegations that would be deleted and added to the
proposed First Amended Complaint” which the Court stated, “can be provided in
the form of a supporting chart that references the page and line of what is
being changed.” (03/20/24 Minute Order at p.4.) 
 
The Court
ordered Plaintiff to “serve and electronically file supplemental papers
providing specifications by reference to pages and lines the allegations that
would be deleted and added to the proposed First Amended Complaint” at least 16
court days before the continued hearing date. (03/20/24 Minute Order at p. 5.)
The Court indicated that “[f]ailure to do so [would] result in the Motion being
placed off calendar or denied.” (03/20/24 Minute Order at p. 5.) 
 
On March 27,
2024, Plaintiff filed and served the operative Amended Motion for Order
Allowing Plaintiff Leave to File a First Amended Complaint. Plaintiff’s amended
motion is unopposed. Any opposition was required to have been filed and served
at least nine court days prior to the hearing pursuant to CCP § 1005(b).

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Leave to
Amend    
A.               
Legal Standard 
The trial
court has discretion to allow amendments to pleadings in the furtherance of
justice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) “Any judge, at any time before
or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of justice, and upon such
terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any pleading.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 576.) “There is a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments
to the pleadings at any stage of the proceeding.” Berman v. Bromberg (1997)
56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945, citation omitted. “An application to amend a
pleading is addressed to the trial judge’s sound discretion.” Ibid.,
citation omitted. 
Under Rule
3.1324, subdivision (b) of the California Rules of Court, a separate
declaration must accompany a motion for leave to amend and must specify: (1)
the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3)
when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4)
the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (b).) A party seeking leave to amend must attach a
copy of the proposed pleading to the motion for leave to amend. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324, subd. (a)(1).) A motion for leave to amend must also state
what allegations are proposed to be added or deleted to the previous pleading,
if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number the additional or
deleted allegations or located. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subd.
(a)(2)-(3).) 
B.        Discussion  
Plaintiff has provided the proposed First Amended
Complaint along with a supporting declaration from its counsel, Michael D.
Frischer (“Frischer”), stating the reason why Plaintiff seeks leave to amend.
(Frischer Decl.; Exh. 3.) The amended motion also sets forth the proposed
changes to the Complaint by reference to paragraph, page, and line number.
(Amended Motion at pp. 5-6.)  
 
Mr. Frischer states that the matter was brought due to
Defendant’s failure to cooperate with the State Compensation Insurance Fund
(“SCIF”) for the purposes of completing the audit for two workers compensation
policy numbers 9277782-20 and 9277782-21. (Frischer Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendant
provided an answer to the complaint on June 13, 2023. (Id., ¶ 3.)
However, Plaintiff served discovery on May 9, 2023, to compel Defendant to
comply with the audit by producing the information and documentation needed by
SCIF’s auditor to properly calculate the earned premiums for the 2020 and 2021
policies. (Id., ¶ 4.) Defendant produced the information and payroll
records which were forwarded to SCIF. (Id., ¶ 5.) As a result of the
audit, SCIF provided Plaintiff’s counsel with the worksheets and revised
invoice for the 2020 and 2021 policies to show actual earned premiums due and
owing for this policy in the sum of $19,055.62 for policy no. 9277782-20 and
$20,635.55 for policy no. 9277782-21. (Id., ¶ 6; Exh. 2.) Counsel
attests that Plaintiff now seeks to amend its complaint to accurately reflect
the precise amount of insurance premiums earned by SCIF and still due and
owing. (Id., ¶ 7.) 
 
The Court finds that the amended motion satisfies the
requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. The amended motion
includes a copy of the proposed amended complaint as well as a declaration from
counsel which sets forth the effect, necessity, purpose, date of discovery, and
reasons why the request for amendment was not made sooner. Plaintiff has also
rectified the deficiency identified in the Court’s March 20, 2024 minute order
by providing the Court with specifications articulating the paragraph, pages,
and line numbers of the additional or deleted allegations. (See Amended Motion
at pp. 5-6.) 
 
The Court therefore finds that the instant motion is
procedurally proper. The Court also notes that the amended motion is unopposed,
which creates an inference that the amended motion is meritorious. Sexton v.
Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410. 
 
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Amended Motion for
Order Allowing Plaintiff to File a First Amended Complaint is GRANTED. The Court orders Plaintiff to serve and electronically file
the proposed First Amended Complaint—which is attached to the declaration of
counsel in support of the amended motion—by the close of business on Friday,
May 10, 2024, so that it becomes an operative pleading in this action.  
  
            The
Court notes that the demand amount in the proposed First Amended Complaint
takes this matter out of limited civil jurisdiction.  Therefore, the Court further orders:
 
Upon filing of Plaintiff’s First
Amended Complaint, and pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
403.010 through 403.090, the Court orders this action reclassified as an unlimited
civil jurisdiction matter.  Plaintiff Creditor
Adjustment Bureau is ordered to pay the reclassification fees upon filing of its
First Amended Complaint.  
 
  

            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
