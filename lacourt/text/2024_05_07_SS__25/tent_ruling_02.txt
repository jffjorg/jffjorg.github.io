 
Tentative Ruling:                    Plaintiff’s Amended Motion for
Order Allowing Plaintiff to File a First Amended Complaint is GRANTED. 
                                                                        
The Court orders Plaintiff to serve and electronically
file the proposed First Amended Complaint—which is attached to the declaration
of counsel in support of the amended motion—by the close of business on Friday,
May 10, 2024, so that it becomes an operative pleading in this action.  
  
The Court finds that the demand amount in the proposed
First Amended Complaint takes this matter out of limited civil
jurisdiction.  Therefore, the Court
further orders:
 
Upon filing of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, and pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure sections 403.010 through 403.090, the Court orders this action
reclassified as an unlimited civil jurisdiction matter.  Plaintiff Creditor Adjustment Bureau is
ordered to pay the proper reclassification fees upon filing of its First
Amended Complaint.
