And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the case, which was dismissed due to the plaintiff's counsel's mistake. The case involves a breach of contract, fraud, and other claims between the plaintiff, FARHAD MOOSSAZADEH, and the defendant, HERSHEL MANGOLI. The plaintiff's counsel claimed that they were misinformed by the courtroom clerk about the trial date, which was scheduled for July 1, 2024. However, the court's minute order from June 24, 2024, stated that the trial would be continued to July 1, 2024, and the order was never amended or withdrawn. The judge finds that mandatory relief is available, even if counsel's mistake was inexcusable, and grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The action is reinstated, and a new trial date is set for September 13, 2024.
