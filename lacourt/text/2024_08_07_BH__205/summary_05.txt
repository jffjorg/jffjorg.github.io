And here is the English summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Nicole Sedlock, assaulted and battered her on October 4, 2022, and is seeking to add a new cause of action against Sedlock based on verbal death threats made on November 7, 2023. The plaintiff is also seeking to add Cannaco Research Corporation as a defendant, as it is alleged that Sedlock was employed by Cannaco at the time of the alleged assault and battery. The court grants the plaintiff's motion, finding that the delay in seeking to add the new cause of action against Sedlock was not unreasonable and that there is no prejudice to the defendant. The court also finds that the defendant's employer, VFarm 1509, has a duty to disclose its employees' employers, and that the plaintiff has satisfied the requirements for amending its complaint.
