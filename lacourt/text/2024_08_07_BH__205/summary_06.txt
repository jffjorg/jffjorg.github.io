And here is the summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling on a petition filed by Villa Velletri Homeowners Association seeking a court order to approve an amendment to its CC&Rs. The proposed amendment seeks to reduce the current 75% approval requirement to a simple majority requirement. The Association sought to amend its CC&Rs due to the burden of the supermajority requirement, which prevents the Association from exploring beneficial changes to the CC&Rs in the interest of the community. The Court finds that the Association has complied with the filing requirements necessary to make the petition and that the balloting on the proposed amendment was conducted in accordance with the governing documents and applicable law. The Court also finds that a reasonably diligent effort was made to permit all eligible members to vote on the proposed amendment and that members having more than 50 percent of the votes voted in favor of the amendment. However, the Court continues the hearing to September 15, 2024, as the Association has not provided proof of more than 15 days written notice of the hearing date to all required parties.
