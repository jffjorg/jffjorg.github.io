And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Christopher and Margaret Forman. The case involves a dispute between neighbors, where the plaintiffs, Michael and Ileane Brones, claim that the defendants' properties were in a dangerous condition, causing damage to the Brones' property when a hillside collapsed due to rainfall. The defendants argue that the claim for dangerous condition is limited to public property and is duplicative of other claims. The judge agrees with the defendants and sustains the demurrer to the dangerous condition claim. The judge also agrees that the plaintiffs cannot recover for emotional distress (NIED) in this case, as California law only allows for recovery in cases involving a preexisting relationship or intentional tort. The judge notes that the parties have no contractual or trust relationship, and the relationship between owners of adjoining lots is not the type of preexisting relationship contemplated in California case law. The judge sustains the demurrer to the NIED claim without leave to amend.
