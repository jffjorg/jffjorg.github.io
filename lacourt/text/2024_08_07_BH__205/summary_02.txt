Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for a protective order to prevent the discovery of his medical records. The plaintiff alleges medical malpractice and emotional distress, but the judge finds that the medical records are relevant to the case and necessary for the defendants to evaluate and defend against the plaintiff's claims. The judge cites various California statutes and case law to support the decision, including the patient-litigant exception, which allows the court to waive the patient's privilege in medical records when the patient has placed their condition at issue in the lawsuit.
