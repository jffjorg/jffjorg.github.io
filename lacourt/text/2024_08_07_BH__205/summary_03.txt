And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the Cross-Plaintiffs, EP One, LLC and PR Blu, Ltd, and grants their Request for Default Judgment against the Cross-Defendant, Michael Mizrachi. The dispute arises from a landlord-tenant dispute over a rental agreement for a property located in Beverly Hills. The Tenant, Michael Mizrachi, failed to return a security deposit of $13,000 and the Landlord filed a Cross-Complaint alleging that the Tenant failed to make rental payments, abandoned the property without notice, and caused damage to the property. The Tenant was served with the Cross-Complaint but did not respond, and default was entered. The Landlord has complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment and is seeking a total of $41,989.67, including damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. The Judge finds that default judgment is appropriate given the lack of response from the Tenant and grants the Request for Default Judgment.
