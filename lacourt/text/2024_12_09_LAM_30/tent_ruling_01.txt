Tentative Ruling re: 
Defendant’s Motion to Tax Costs
Tentative
Ruling re:  Plaintiff’s Motion to Tax
Costs
 
7520 S. Broadway, LLC
(Defendant) moves to tax the memorandum of costs filed by Charvette Michelle
Griffis and David Doye (Plaintiffs). The motion is denied.
 
A prevailing party in
litigation may recover costs, including but not limited to filing fees. (Code
of Civ. Proc., §1033.5, subd. (a)(1).) 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2),
allowable costs are only recoverable if they are “reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation.” Even mandatory costs, when incurred unnecessarily,
are subject to limitation under section 1033, subdivision (c)(2). (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245.) 
The memorandum of costs is a verified
statement by the party, attorney, or agent that the costs are correct and were
necessarily incurred in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a)(1).) If
the items on a verified cost bill appear proper charges, they are prima facie
evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed therein were necessarily
incurred. (Oak Grove School Dist. v. City
Title Ins. Co. (1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 678, 698.) “The trial court’s first
determination is whether the statute expressly allows the particular item and
whether it appears proper on its face; if so, the burden is on the objecting
party to show the costs to be unnecessary or unreasonable.” (Foothill-DeAnza Community College Dist. v.
Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 29.) The burden of showing that an item
is not properly chargeable or is unreasonable is upon the party challenging the
costs. (Wilson v. Nichols (1942) 55
Cal.App.2d 678, 682–683.) 
Where the items are properly objected
to, they are put at issue, and the burden of proof is on the party claiming
them as costs. (Oak Grove,
supra, 217 Cal.App.2d at p. 698.) In other words, the burden is initially
on the objecting party to show that the costs are not proper on their face.
Then, the burden shifts to the moving party to justify its costs and expenses.
If the costs are not facially proper, that is, the costs are not expressly
allowed under a statute, then the moving party must justify the requests for
the expenses. 
Under section 1033.5, “[a]n item not
specifically allowable under subdivision (a) nor prohibited under subdivision
(b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court if
‘reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation.’” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761,
774.)
 
The Court entered judgment on October
15, 2024. Plaintiffs prevailed on two causes of action and were awarded damages.
Plaintiffs filed a memorandum of costs on October 17, 2024. Defendant moved to
tax Plaintiffs’ memorandum on various grounds on November 4, 2024. Plaintiffs
filed an opposition on November 22, 2024. Defendant filed a reply on December
2, 2024.  Because the reply advances
entirely new arguments, the Court will not consider it.
 
As a threshold matter, Defendant argues
that all of Plaintiffs’ claimed costs should be halved because Plaintiffs only
prevailed on two out of four causes of action. Because all of the causes of
action relied on virtually the identical facts there is no basis to allocate
the costs.  Accordingly, the Court will
not halve all of Plaintiffs’ costs.
 
First, Plaintiffs seek $735 to recover costs
for filing and motion fees. (Memorandum of Costs ¶ 1.) Filing, motion, and jury
fees are allowable costs. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(1).) Defendant
objects to an ex parte application filed by Plaintiffs and a JNOV motion filed
after trial as not being necessary to the litigation. Plaintiffs needed counsel
present at the final status conference, and the ex parte application ensured
this result. (Strom Decl. ¶ 3.) Additionally, Plaintiffs’ post-trial motions
are standard and reasonable. Thus, the Court does not tax any costs claimed by
Plaintiffs as motion or filing fees.
 
Second, Plaintiffs seek $14,291.36 for costs
related to depositions. (Memorandum of Costs ¶ ¶ 4.) Costs related to the
taking, video recording, and transcribing of necessary depositions are
allowable under statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(3).) However,
fees of experts not ordered by the Court are expressly disallowed. (Id.
§ 1033.5, subd. (b)(1).) Defendant argues that the inconsistency of cost per
page between various depositions taken by Plaintiffs make the costs
unreasonable. Defendant fails to account for the cost of photocopying exhibits
and other miscellaneous charges involved in court reporter services. (Strom
Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. 3.) The Court finds Plaintiffs’ claimed costs reasonable,
including the fees required for expert depositions. Such fees do not constitute
fees paid to experts, which are disallowed under section 1033.5, subdivision
(b)(1). Thus, the Court does not tax any costs claimed by Plaintiffs relating
to depositions.
 
Third, Plaintiffs claim $1,263.06 in
jury fees. (Memorandum of Costs ¶ 2.) These fees are authorized under section 1033.5,
subdivision (a)(1). Plaintiffs have provided evidence of jury fees incurred, as
requested by Defendant. (Strom Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. 2.) The Court does not tax any costs
claimed by Plaintiffs relating to jury fees.
 
Fourth, Plaintiffs seek $239.33 in
service of process fees. (Memorandum of Costs ¶ 5.) Such fees are authorized
under section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(4). This is the accurate amount paid to a
registered process server by Plaintiffs’ counsel. (Strom Decl. ¶ 7.) The Court
does not tax any costs claimed by Plaintiffs relating to service of process.
 
Fifth, Plaintiffs claim $675 in witness
fees. (Memorandum of Costs ¶ 8.) These are allowed by statute. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(7).) “[W]itness’ fees for each day’s actual
attendance, when legally required to attend a civil action or proceeding in the
superior courts, are thirty-five dollars ($35) a day and mileage actually
traveled, both ways, twenty cents ($0.20) a mile.” (Gov. Code, § 68093.) Defendant
challenges $275 paid by Plaintiffs to a witness that they never called as
unreasonable. However, Plaintiffs offer evidence demonstrating that such a cost
was reasonable at the time and necessary for litigating the case effectively; another
witness provided more effective testimony than expected. (Strom Decl. ¶ 8.)
Plaintiffs should not be penalized for being efficient with jurors’ time.
Defendant additionally objects to $100 paid to another lay witness, but
Plaintiffs offer evidence that such a payment was required to secure her
testimony given her limited means. (Id. ¶ 9.) Thus, the Court does not
tax any costs claimed by Plaintiffs relating to witnesses.
 
Sixth, Plaintiffs claim $2,043.25 in
costs for models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits. (Memorandum of
Costs ¶ 12.) Such costs are allowed by statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(13).) Defendant challenges Plaintiffs’ description of this cost as
too vague. Plaintiffs provide evidence that such a cost is reasonable for the printing
of over 5,000 pages of exhibits. (Strom Decl. ¶ 10.) Thus, the Court does not
tax any costs claimed by Plaintiffs relating to exhibits. 
 
Separately, Defendant has filed a
memorandum of costs which Plaintiffs have moved to tax.  The motion is granted.
 
Defendant argues that it is the
prevailing party pursuant to Civil Code Section 1942.4.  But Defendant never brought a motion pursuant
to Section 1942.4 and in fact submitted their memorandum of costs under the
purview of Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1032 and 1033.5.  Similarly, Defendant never objected to the
judgment entered by the Court which does not provide Defendant an opportunity
to seek recovery of fees and costs pursuant to Civil Code Section 1942.4.  Accordingly, the Court looks to Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1032 to assess Plaintiffs’ motion to strike or tax costs.
 
The prevailing party entitled to costs
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 is defined as “the party with a net
monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a
defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a
defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against
that defendant.” Here, Plaintiffs recovered damages against Defendant, and
Defendant recovered no damages against Plaintiff nor did Defendant obtain a
dismissal of the Complaint. (Judgment, October 15, 2024.) Thus, Plaintiffs are
the prevailing parties under section 1032, and the only parties entitled to
costs.
