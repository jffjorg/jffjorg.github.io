The Court has reviewed the evidence presented by both parties and has found that most of the costs claimed by Plaintiffs are reasonable and necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The Court has denied Defendant's motion to tax costs and has granted Plaintiff's motion to tax Defendant's costs. The Court has also denied Defendant's request to halve all of Plaintiffs' claimed costs, as Defendant has failed to show that the costs were incurred unnecessarily.
