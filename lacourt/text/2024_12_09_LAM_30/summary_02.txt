And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to file a cross-complaint in the present action. The defendant had failed to initially plead a cause of action related to a release agreement signed by the plaintiff, which purports to release the defendant from the present causes of action. The court finds that the release agreement and any potential breach thereof arise out of the same series of transactions or occurrences as the plaintiff's causes of action, making the cross-complaint compulsory. The court also finds that the defendant has acted in good faith by attempting to resolve the matter informally and notifying the plaintiff about the potential counterclaim. Therefore, the court grants the defendant leave to file the cross-complaint pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 426.50.
