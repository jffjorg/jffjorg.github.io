 Case Number:  24STCP01183    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  9 The OSC is continued to July 29, 2024
at 9:30 am.  
The Criminal History assessment
reflects an active protective order restraining Petitioner. The protective
order remains in effect until June 11, 2028. 
Petitioner is ordered to file a declaration no later than July 1, 2024
explaining (1) the circumstances of the issuance of the protective order
against Petitioner and (2) why the Court should not require Petitioner to alert
the Court that issued the protective order of Petitioner’s request for name
change so that the protective order can be updated to reflect Petitioner’s new
name.
Petitioner is also ordered to appear
(either in person or remotely via LACourtConnect) at the continued OSC hearing
to answer any further questions the Court may have after reviewing Petitioner’s
declaration. 
 
In addition, the criminal history
assessment that the Name Change Clerk has run through CLETS reveals that
Petitioner has an active outstanding warrant. Warrant #GLN1GD0138201
Petitioner must clear the outstanding
warrant and file evidence of such before the Court will rule on the petition
for name change.  The OSC and hearing on the petition for name change are
continued to July 29, 2024 at 9:30 am.  No later than two weeks before the
continued OSC and hearing, Petitioner must file written proof that the
outstanding bench warrant has been fully addressed and resolved.  Failure
to do so will result in the OSC and hearing on the petition being taken off
calendar without prejudice to be placed back on calendar upon filing of proof
that all outstanding warrants have been cleared.  
 
The Name Change Clerk is to run a new
criminal history assessment prior to the continued OSC to verify that the
warrant has been cleared.
 
The Court Clerk is to give notice to
all parties.
