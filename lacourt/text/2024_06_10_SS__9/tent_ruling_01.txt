  Case Number:  24STCP00138    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  9 The criminal history form is still incomplete as
the Name Change Clerk has failed to check off on the criminal history
assessment form whether Petitioner is a registered sex offender or not. In
addition, the criminal history check appears incomplete as the Name Change
Clerk has failed to include the report from CLETS indicating whether there are
“no hits on sex/arson registration." On the Court's own motion, the
Non-Appearance Case Review scheduled for 06/10/2024 is continued to 06/24/24 at
09:30 AM in Department 9 at Spring Street Courthouse. The Court hereby
reiterates its orders of May 13, 2024 and June 3, 2024. Prior to the continued
hearing of June 24, 2024, the Name Change Clerk must re-run the criminal
history assessment and provide more clear notation whether Petitioner has any
convictions, including for offenses that require sex offender registration.
