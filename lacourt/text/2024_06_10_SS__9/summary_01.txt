And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the incomplete criminal history assessment form submitted by the Name Change Clerk. The clerk failed to check off whether the Petitioner is a registered sex offender or not, and also failed to include the report from CLETS indicating whether there are any "no hits on sex/arson registration". As a result, the Non-Appearance Case Review scheduled for June 10, 2024, is continued to June 24, 2024. The court reiterates its prior orders of May 13, 2024, and June 3, 2024, and requires the Name Change Clerk to re-run the criminal history assessment and provide a clear notation of the Petitioner's convictions prior to the continued hearing.
