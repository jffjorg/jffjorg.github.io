And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling states that the petitioner must clear an outstanding warrant before the court will rule on the petition for a name change. The court has run a criminal history assessment through CLETS, which revealed the outstanding warrant. The petitioner must file evidence of clearing the warrant before the court will rule on the petition. If the petitioner fails to do so, the OSC and hearing on the petition will be taken off calendar without prejudice to be placed back on calendar upon filing of proof that all outstanding warrants have been cleared.

Additionally, the court has not received proof of publication, which is required for the petition. The petition is continued to July 29, 2024 at 9:30 am, and the petitioner must file proof of publication no later than one week before the continued hearing. Failure to do so will result in the denial and dismissal of the petition without prejudice.
