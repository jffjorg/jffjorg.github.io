 Case Number:  24STCP01153    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  9 The criminal history assessment that
the Name Change Clerk has run through CLETS reveals that Petitioner has an
active outstanding warrant. Warrant #C152908744, Warrant #MVA901784.
Petitioner must clear the outstanding
warrant and file evidence of such before the Court will rule on the petition
for name change.  The OSC and hearing on the petition for name change are
continued to July 29, 2024 at 9:30 am.  No later than two weeks before the
continued OSC and hearing, Petitioner must file written proof that the
outstanding bench warrant has been fully addressed and resolved.  Failure
to do so will result in the OSC and hearing on the petition being taken off
calendar without prejudice to be placed back on calendar upon filing of proof
that all outstanding warrants have been cleared.  The Name Change Clerk is directed to re-run Petitioner’s
criminal history assessment approximately one week prior to the continued (July
29, 2024) hearing to ascertain whether the outstanding warrant has been
cleared.  
 
The Court Clerk is to give notice to
all parties.
