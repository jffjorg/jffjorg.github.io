 Case Number:  23STCV27234    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  34 Defendant/X-Complainant
Rodeo Collection, Ltd.’s Motion to Compel Further Responses from
Plaintiff/X-Defendant Cannon Constructors South, Inc. to the Demand for Production
of Documents, Set One, is GRANTED as to Nos. 23-24, 26 and DENIED as to RFP No.
25.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff provided general contracting services to Defendant
Spa De Med Wellness Institute, LLC (“Spa De Med”).  Plaintiff alleges Defendant Spa De Med failed
to pay for services rendered.  Plaintiff
alleges Defendant Rodeo Collection Ltd. (“Rodeo Collection”) and/or Spa De Med
are the principals on the Mechanic’s Lien Release Bond.
 
On November 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging
(1) breach of contract; (2) quantum meruit; (3) account stated; (4) open book
account; (5) foreclosure of mechanic’s lien; and (6) enforcement against
Mechanic’s Lien Release Bond.
 
On November 28, 2023, Defendant Rodeo Collection filed an
answer to Plaintiff’s complaint. 
Defendant Rodeo Collection also filed a cross-complaint against
Plaintiff and Spa De Med alleging (1) negligence; (2) full equitable indemnity;
(3) comparative equitable indemnity; and (4) declaratory relief.  
 
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an answer to Rodeo
Collection’s cross-complaint.  As of
September 19, 2024, Spa De Med has not appeared in the action.  
 
 
Legal Standard           
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310:
 
(a)        On receipt of a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an
order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems
that any of the following apply:
            (1)
      A statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete.
            (2)       A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
            (3)
      An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.
(b)       A
motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with each of the following:
(1)       The motion shall set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.
(2)       The motion shall be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
(3)       In lieu of a separate statement required
under the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to
submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.
(c)        Unless notice of this motion is given
within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental
verified response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding
party waives any right to compel a further response to the demand.
… 
(h)       Except as provided in subdivision (j), the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
Where a party is seeking to compel further responses to
requests for document production, the burden is on the moving party to show
both relevance to the subject matter and specific facts justifying discovery. (CCP
§2031.310(b)(1); Kirkland v. Supr. Ct. (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98
(“Once good cause was shown, the burden shifted to Kirkland to justify his
objection”); Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117.)  Once good cause
is established by the moving party, the burden then shifts to the responding
party to justify any objections made to document disclosure. (Hartbrodt v.
Burke (1996, 2nd Dist.) 42 Cal.App.4th 168, 172-174.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendant Rodeo Collection moves to compel further responses
to its Demand for Production of Documents, Set One (“RFP”), Nos. 23-26.  Defendant Rodeo also moves to compel
compliance with Plaintiff’s responses agreeing to produce responsive documents
to RFP Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 7-22, 28 and 29. 

 
Defendant’s motion was filed on April 29, 2024.  Plaintiff served corrected responses on June
18, 2024.  The supplemental responses are
unverified.  Defendant argues the
supplemental responses and production in response to RFP Nos. 23-26 are still
incomplete and improper.  Defendant
argues Plaintiff only provided supplemental responses due to the motion to
compel further responses.  
 
Meet and Confer. 
Defendant sent a letter stating that the responses to RFP Nos. 23-26
were improper boilerplate objections. 
Defendant did not raise the typographical errors in the meet and confer
letter.  (Motion, Horn Dec., Exs. 3 and
4.)  In response, Plaintiff assured
Defendant that it would respond after speaking with the client and extended the
deadline to file the motion to compel further to May 12, 2024.  (Motion, Horn Dec., Exs. 5 and 6.)  Plaintiff failed to provide any substantive
response to the meet and confer. 
Defendant filed the motion on April 29, 2024.  
 
Defendant’s meet and confer discussed the
defects raised in the motion to compel further with the exception of the
captioning and the typographical error in the first sentence of the
responses.  Plaintiff served corrected
responses on June 18, 2024 correcting these errors.  The motion is moot as to these defects.  
 
Defendant’s meet and confer is sufficient as
to RFP Nos. 23-26 and its request that Plaintiff produce further documents in
response to RFP Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 7-22, 28 and 29 
 
Defendant’s Motion to Compel is GRANTED as to
RFP Nos. 23-24 and 26 and DENIED as to RFP No. 25.  
 
Plaintiff served corrected responses on June
18, 2024.  (Opposition, Marootian Dec.,
Ex. A.)  These corrected responses
continue to assert the same objections asserted in the original responses.  
 
Defendant establishes good cause for further
production to RFP Nos. 23-24 and 26. 
(Separate Statement, 3:8-24-4:1-4 (RFP No. 23—corporate documents
relevant to standing and activities as corporation in CA); 5:8-24-6:1-3 (RFP
No. 24—licensing documents relevant because plaintiff is suing as a licensed,
general contractor); 8:13-21 (RFP No. 26—CCP §2017.210 expressly allows for
discovery of a defendant’s liability insurance coverage).)  
 
However, Defendant fails to establish good
cause for further production to RFP No. 25. 
Defendant fails to establish the relevance of other civil litigation
filed against Plaintiff since January 1, 2018 to this action for breach of the
parties’ general contract and nonpayment. 
(Separate Statement, 6:19-24-7:1-21 (RFP No. 25—seeking documents
relating to other litigation against plaintiff to determine if plaintiff is
engaged in pattern of wrongful business conduct).  
 
In response, Plaintiff fails to justify its
objections to RFP Nos. 23-24 and 26.  To
the extent Plaintiff objects based on attorney-client privilege or work product
doctrine, Plaintiff must produce a privilege log in compliance with CCP
§2031.240(c)(1).  
 
Defendant’s other
requests.  Defendant’s reply appears to abandon any
issues other than further production in response to RFP Nos. 23-26.  Defendant’s opening brief limited argument to
those RFPs, although the separate statement inserted a request to compel
compliance with Plaintiff’s responses agreeing to produce responsive documents
to RFP Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6, 7-22, 28 and 29. 
If Defendant finds the production to other RFPs insufficient despite
Plaintiff’s further production after this motion was filed, Defendant should
file a motion to compel further based on the further production.  
 
Sanctions. 
Defendant is the prevailing party. 
Defendant is entitled to sanctions. 
Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $2,985.00 (6.5 hrs @
$450/hr hour plus $60 filing fee) against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
counsel.  Utilizing a Lodestar approach,
and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the court finds that the
total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the pending motion is $1,635.00 (3.5 hrs @ $450/hr
hour plus $60 filing fee). Sanctions are awarded jointly and severally and are payable
within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling. 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is
GRANTED as to RFP Nos. 23-24, 26 and DENIED as to RFP No. 25.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve further
responses in accordance with the Court’s order within 20 days.  Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel are ordered
to pay sanctions of $1,635.00 within 20 days.
