And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the demand for production of documents, except for RFP No. 25. The defendant has established good cause for further production of documents related to the defendant's standing and activities as a corporation in California, and for documents related to liability insurance coverage. However, the defendant has failed to establish good cause for further production of documents related to other civil litigation filed against the plaintiff since January 1, 2018.

The plaintiff has failed to justify its objections to the defendant's requests for document production, and is ordered to serve further responses in accordance with the court's order within 20 days. The plaintiff and its counsel are also ordered to pay sanctions of $1,635.00 within 20 days.

The judge has also denied the defendant's request to compel compliance with the plaintiff's responses agreeing to produce responsive documents to certain other requests for production. The defendant's motion was filed on April 29, 2024, and the plaintiff served corrected responses on June 18, 2024. The judge has found that the defendant is the prevailing party and is entitled to sanctions.
