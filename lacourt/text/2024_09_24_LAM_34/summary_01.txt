And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies Plaintiffs' Motion to Seal, finding that Plaintiffs have waived their right to request that the Settlement Agreement be sealed. The judge also denies Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, finding that Plaintiffs have not established entitlement to judgment on the third cause of action for unjust enrichment. However, the judge grants Plaintiffs' motion for summary adjudication of the first, second, and fourth causes of action for breach of the Settlement Agreement, breach of the Purchase Agreement, and declaratory relief, finding that Plaintiffs have established the existence of the Settlement and Purchase Agreements, Defendants' breach of these agreements, and Plaintiffs' performance under both agreements. The judge also finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment on the first, second, and fourth causes of action.
