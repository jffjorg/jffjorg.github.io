And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion for leave to file a first amended answer by defendants Joe Byron, Egg Heaven, LLC, and Ramona Streit (Doe 1). The court notes that the defendants failed to include an affirmative defense based on the Statute of Frauds in their original answer and that the plaintiff initially agreed to allow for the amendment, but later conditioned the agreement based on receipt of unrelated amended discovery responses. The court, exercising its discretion liberally in favor of amendments, allows the proposed amendment. The defendants are ordered to file their proposed first amended answer within five days of the date of this order.
