The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to augment their expert witness designation to add Dr. Marc Kayem as an expert witness. The plaintiff filed the motion on November 18, 2024, after Dr. Kayem assumed the plaintiff's care on October 16, 2024. The judge found that the plaintiff acted with reasonable diligence and that the defendants will not be unduly prejudiced by the addition of the expert witness. The court considered the evidence in the record, the argument of each side, and the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2034.610 and 2034.620. The judge ordered that the plaintiff make Dr. Kayem available for deposition promptly and that the defendants have a reasonable period of time to prepare for the deposition.
