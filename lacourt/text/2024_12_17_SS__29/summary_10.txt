And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Holder v. AG Redlands, LLC. The defendant has filed a motion to change the venue of the case from the Los Angeles County Superior Court to the San Bernardino County Superior Court. The judge has concluded that Los Angeles County Superior Court is a proper venue for the case under Code of Civil Procedure section 395, but has also determined that changing the venue to San Bernardino County would be convenient and promote the ends of justice. However, the judge has determined that the defendant failed to pay the transfer fees at the time the motion was filed, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 399. Therefore, the judge has continued the hearing on the motion to change venue for 30 days to give the defendant the opportunity to cure this procedural defect and pay the fees. The judge has also continued the hearing on the defendant's demurrer for 30 days.
