And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion for leave to conduct a mental examination of the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims to have suffered injuries from a vehicle accident, including mental, cognitive, and emotional injuries. The defendants seek to conduct a mental examination to gather evidence about the plaintiff's injuries, but the plaintiff objects to the examination, citing concerns about the confidentiality of the raw test data.

The judge finds that the defendants have not sufficiently identified the tests to be administered and that the plaintiff's right to confidentiality of raw test data outweighs the defendants' right to conduct the examination. The judge also notes that the defendants' proposed examiner, Dr. Manuel Saint Martin, has stated that he will not comply with the court's ruling regarding the raw test data, so the court cannot grant leave for him to conduct the examination.

The judge rules that the defendants must disclose the raw test data and testing materials directly to the plaintiff's counsel, subject to a protective order, and that the motion for leave is denied.
