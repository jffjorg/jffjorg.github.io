 Case Number:  22STCV33581    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  29 Duclos v. Elie
Case No. 22STCV33581
Defendant’s Motion to Seal
Tentative
The motion is granted in part and denied in part.
Background
On October 14, 2022,
Plaintiffs Jacqueline Duclos, Sumoya Michael, and Jane Doe (a minor child)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed the Complaint in this action against
Defendants Ronald Elie; InterContinental Hotel Los Angeles Downtown;
InterContinental Hotels Group, PLC; Keehong Woo; Hajin International Corp; and
Does 1-50, asserting causes of action for (1) negligence, (2) negligent
hiring, supervision, and retention, (3) invasion of privacy, (4) negligent
infliction of emotional distress (“NIED”), and (5) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress (“IIED”). All of Plaintiffs’ claims arise out of an incident
in which, Plaintiffs allege, they were assaulted and robbed at
gunpoint while they were staying in a guestroom of the InterContinental Hotel
in downtown Los Angeles.
Plaintiffs
subsequently amended their complaint to name Hanjin International Corporation
as Doe 1; Jin Ho Lee as Doe 2; and IHG Management (Maryland) LLC as Doe 3.
On
November 3, 2023, Defendants IHG Management (Maryland) LLC (“IHGM”) and Hanjin
International Corp. (“Hanjin”) filed an answer.
On
September 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement.
On
November 15, 2024, the guardian ad litem for the minor child, Semiyra Duclos,
filed a petition for approval of the minor’s compromise, along with supporting
papers and a proposed order.  An amended
petition, proposed order, and supporting papers were filed on December 6, and a
further amended petition, proposed order, and supporting papers were filed on
December 12.  
On
December 13, 2024, the Court granted the petition and approved the minor’s
compromise.
On
December 6, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ ex parte application to seal the
entire petition, all supporting documents, and the proposed order, reasoning
that the request was not narrowly tailored and not sufficiently supported by a
showing of an overriding interest.
On
December 13, 2024, Defendants filed this motion to seal.  By agreement of the parties, the Court
advanced the hearing on the motion to December 17, 2024.
No
opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
“[T]he First Amendment provides a right
of [public] access to ordinary civil trials and proceedings.”  (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Super.
Ct. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1212.) “[C]onstitutional standards governing
closure of trial proceedings apply in the civil setting.”  (Ibid.)  Those standards are embodied in California
Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551.
“Unless confidentiality is required by
law, court records are presumed to be open.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(c). 
“A record must not be filed under seal without a court order.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(a).)  “The court must not permit a record to be
filed under seal based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the parties.”  (Ibid.)
California Rules of Court, rule
2.550(d) sets forth the basic standard for an order permitting the filing of
documents under seal:
“The court may order that a record be
filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish:  
(1) There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record;  
(2) The overriding interest supports
sealing the record;  
(3) A substantial probability exists
that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed;  
(4) The proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored; and  
(5) No less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest.”   
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d).)  
“An order sealing the record must: (A)
Specifically state the facts that support the findings; and (B) Direct the
sealing of only those documents and pages, or, if reasonably practicable,
portions of those documents and pages, that contain the material that needs to
be placed under seal.  All other portions
of each document or page must be included in the public file.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(e)(1).
A motion or application to file under
seal must be accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts
sufficient to justify the sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.551(b)(1).)  “A request to seal a document must be filed publicly and
separately from the object of the request.  It must be supported by a
factual declaration or affidavit explaining the particular needs of the case.”
(In re Marriage of Lechowick (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1416.) “[A]t a
minimum that the party seeking to seal documents, or maintain them under seal,
must come forward with a specific enumeration of the facts sought to be
withheld and specific reasons for withholding them.”  (H.B. Fuller Co.
v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894.) 
Discussion
Defendants seek an order sealing the specific financial terms
of the settlement agreement and related information.  
A motion to seal must be supported by (among
other things) “an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access
to the record.”  (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 2.550(d)(1).)  Here, counsel’s
declaration states that a material term of the settlement agreement is a
confidentiality provision; without this provision, Defendants would not have
agreed to settle.  (Berkley Decl., ¶ 2
& Exhs. 1-2 [including, in Exh. 2, Palmer Decl., ¶¶ 6-7].)  A number of California cases have recognized
that, under appropriate circumstances, protecting a contractual
confidentiality provision will constitute an “overriding interest” under Rule
2.550(d)(1).  (E.g., NBC Subsidiary,
supra, 20 Cal.4th at p.1222, fn. 46; Huffy Corp. v. Super. Ct. (2003)
112 Cal.App.4th 97, 106; Universal City Studios v. Super. Ct. (2003) 110
Cal.App.4th 1273, 1281-1283.)  
Moreover, there is a distinction in the interests involved
in the settlement terms for the minor plaintiff and the settlement terms for
the adult plaintiffs.  Although of course
the default rule is that all court filings are public documents, the public’s interest
in access to the specific financial terms of the settlement for the adult
plaintiffs is quite limited.  Adult
plaintiffs commonly enter into confidential settlements; the terms of the
settlement are generally not filed with the Court, and therefore no issue of
public access or redaction arises.
In this matter, because a minor plaintiff is involved, court
approval – and therefore court filings to obtain the approval – are
required.  The public has an interest in ensuring
that the proceedings relating to the court approval of the minor plaintiff’s
settlement were conducted in a fair and appropriate manner.  But the public has little or no interest in
the financial terms of the adult plaintiffs’ settlement – which are only in the
public record as a result of the happenstance that there is also a minor
plaintiff involved in the case.
Based on these principles, the Court rules as follows on
each of the sealing/redaction requests:
