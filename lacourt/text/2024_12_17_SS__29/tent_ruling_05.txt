Legal Standard
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367,
381-382.)
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Request for Judicial Notice
Defendant requests that the Court take judicial
notice of six documents. The request, which is unopposed, is granted.
Objections to Evidence
Plaintiff asserts 19 objections to Defendant’s
evidence. The objections are OVERRULED.
Defendant asserts 13 objections to Plaintiff’s
evidence. The objections are OVERRULED.
Discussion
On February 15, 2021, Plaintiff sustained
injuries while riding a bicycle on a path next to the Los Angeles River.
(Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [“DSUMF”], Nos. 1-2.) 
As Plaintiff was riding her bicycle, she rode
across a plastic tarp on the ground. (DSUMF, No. 4.) The front tire of Plaintiff’s
bicycle became caught in the tarp; the bicycle stopped abruptly, and Plaintiff
catapulted over the handlebars on to the ground. (DSUMF, No. 5.)
There was a detour to the bike path. (DSUMF,
No. 8.) On the date of the accident, there were black gates (compromised of two
panels) that were open; the opening was wide enough for Plaintiff to ride
through. (DSUMF, Nos. 9-10.)
Prior to the date of the accident, Plaintiff had
ridden her bicycle on the path approximately 20 times. (DSUMF, Nos. 6-7.) Prior
to the date of the accident, Plaintiff was aware that there was ongoing construction
in the area of the accident. (DSUMF, No. 19.) On the date of the accident,
Plaintiff saw construction equipment and tarps. (DSUMF, No. 18.) Plaintiff
decided to ride over the tarp rather than dismounting and walking her bicycle
over it. (DSUMF, No. 21.)
The path is owned and maintained by City for
both pedestrian and bicycle use. (DSUMF, Nos. 1, 24-25.) Defendant does not own
the property where the accident occurred. (DSUMF, No. 66.) Defendant is not a
public entity. (DSUMF, No. 67.)
City hired Defendant in 2018 to build the
Taylor Yard Bikeway/Pedestrian Bridge over the Los Angeles River. (DSUMF, Nos. 26,
28.) Construction began in May 2019 and was completed in May 2022; construction
was ongoing at the time of the accident. (DSUMF, No. 27.) 
Defendant, as the general contractor, assumed
custody and control of the construction site during the construction. (DSUMF,
No. 60.) Plaintiff’s accident occurred on Presidents’ Day, which was a holiday
observed by Defendant. (DSUMF, No. 58.)
In August 2019, City issued Allowance Order
No. 7-001, which allowed and required Defendant to install a bike path detour “that
will allow bicyclist[s] and pedestrians to safely by-pass the construction
site.” (DSUMF, No. 29.)
Defendant completed its work in May 2022 and received
a Statement of Completion. (DSUMF, No. 34.)
Defendant was never notified that its plastic
tarps (used to deter graffiti) were covering the bike path. (DSUMF, Nos. 52, 60.)
Defendant was never notified, prior to Plaintiff’s accident, that the gates
were inadequate to prevent bicyclists from entering the construction site. (DSUMF,
No. 57.) Defendant was never informed of any other bicycle accident at the
construction site related to an unsecured tarp. (DSUMF, No. 63.)
Defendant’s expert witness, Michael Clark,
testified that, in his opinion, gates and fencing around the construction site
should be locked and secured at the end of each workday. (DSUMF, No. 64.)
Defendant now moves for summary judgment. In
the alternative, Defendant moves for summary adjudication on each of the causes
of action in the complaint (for premises liability, for general negligence, and
for dangerous condition of public property).
Premises Liability/General Negligence
The basic elements
of a cause of action for negligence and for premises liability are the same:
(1) the existence of a legal duty; (2)
breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown
v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) The existence and scope of duty are legal questions
for the court.¿¿(Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 213; Annocki¿v.
Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 36.)
Those who own,
possess, or control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in
managing the property to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.
(Annocki, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 37.) If a dangerous condition exists, the property owner is “under a
duty to exercise ordinary care either to make the condition reasonably safe for
their [customers’] use or to give a warning adequate to enable them to avoid
the harm.” (Bridgman v. Safeway Stores, Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.)

“A plaintiff
alleging injuries based on a dangerous condition must prove the defendant
either: (1) created the dangerous condition, or (2) knew or should have known
of the dangerous condition.” (See Peralta v. Vons Companies, Inc. (2018)
24 Cal.App.5th 1030, 1036.) “Because
the owner is not the insurer of the visitor’s personal safety …, the owner’s
actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition is [in many cases] a
key to establishing its liability.” (Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at
p. 1206.) “[W]here the plaintiff relies on the failure to correct a dangerous
condition to prove the owner’s negligence, the plaintiff has the burden of
showing that the owner had notice of the defect in sufficient time to correct
it.” (Ibid.) “Most Courts of Appeal hold that a defendant is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law if the plaintiff fails to show that the dangerous
condition existed for at least a sufficient time to be discovered by ordinary
care and inspection.” (Id. at p. 1207.) “Whether a dangerous
condition has existed long enough for a reasonably prudent person to have
discovered it is a question of fact for the jury.” (Ibid.) 
If
a dangerous condition exists, the property owner is “under a duty to exercise
ordinary care either to make the condition reasonably safe …. or to give a
warning adequate to enable them to avoid the harm.” (Bridgman v. Safeway
Stores, Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446; see also, e.g., Kinsman
v. Unocal Corp. (2005) 37 Cal.4th 659, 672-73.) In some cases, and subject
to certain exceptions, however, a dangerous condition may be so obvious that
the condition itself serves as a warning, and the landowner may have no further
duty to remedy or warn of the condition. (See Kinsman, supra, 37 Cal.4th
at p. 673; Montes v. YMCA of Glendale (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 1134, 1142; Christoff
v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 118, 126; Krongos
v. Pacific Gas Electric Co. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 387, 393.)
Defendant contends that it is not liable
under premises liability or negligence cause of action as it had clear signage of
the bike path detour, the construction site was regularly inspected, and
Defendant has installed barriers to keep pedestrians and bicyclists from
entering the construction site. Defendant argues that it did not create the
allegedly dangerous condition and did not have actual or constructive knowledge
of it. 
Defendant relies on the deposition testimony
of its project manager, Juan Ramirez. (Exh. G, 8:1-24.) Mr. Ramirez states that
there were plastic tarps on the construction site covering walls to protect
them from graffiti; the tarps were secured with wood and sandbags. (Id.,
15:2-8, 16:21-22.) The sandbags and wood on the tarps would be checked in the
afternoon before the end of a shift. (Id., 18:10-14.) Further, a rod
iron gate was put up to block secure the construction site; the gates were
checked daily at the end of a shift (around 3:30 pm) and secured with chains
and locks. (Id., 23:11-14, 21-25, 23:1-2.) 
Mr. Ramirez conceded, however, that wind
could blow the tarps off the walls; that the weather was checked weekly; and the
weekend before the incident, there was a windstorm. (Id.¸19:5-21.) Mr.
Ramirez also recognized that there was a significant amount of vandalism on the
construction site and that people frequently trespassed. (Id., 22:10-14.)

Defendant further provides the declaration of
expert witness Michael Clark. Mr. Clark opines that Defendant met the industry
standard of leaving a clean and secure work site as it provided barriers,
signage, and left the worksite clean and locked at the end of each workday.
(Clark Decl., ¶¶ 12, 13.) 
Along with her opposition, Plaintiff submits the
declaration of expert witness Peter Lupo. Mr. Lupo opines that Defendant had
possession of the construction site and was on notice that its measures to
secure the site at the end of each work day were inadequate, as Defendant was
on notice that trespassers and vandals were obtaining access to the site at
night and on weekends. (See Lupo Decl., ¶¶ 9, 11.) Mr. Lupo also notes that Plaintiff
was able to ride her bicycle into the construction site on the date of the
accident, showing Defendant did not meet the standard of taking appropriate
measures to control access to the construction site. (Id., ¶¶ 13-14.) 
In addition, Plaintiff testified that prior
to the date of the accident, she had used the path at the location of the
accident approximately 20 times, including once less than a month before ethe
accident. (Exh. 2, 13:6-10., 14:17-24.) Plaintiff testified that she did
not see any signs posted of bike detours. (Id., 18:22-24.) Plaintiff remembered
seeing a sign in 2020 of the detours, but not in the weeks leading up to the
accident or on the day of the accident. (Id., 38:2-17.) 
 
Plaintiff also testified that during earlier
rides, the bike lane had been blocked, but it was not blocked on the day of the
accident. (Id., 19:1-20:9.) There was no locked gate that prevented her from
riding on the day of the accident. (Id., 20:18-22.) Plaintiff states
that as she rode her bike, she saw gray tarps on the ground, and that she was
aware there was construction occurring on the bike path. (Id.,
35:11-23.) 
Moreover, Plaintiff returned to the site of
her accident a few days later to take photographs, and again there was an
opening in the gate that allowed her to gain access and take the photos. (Id.,
43:3-7; 44:1-22.)
After carefully considering the arguments
from both sides and all of the evidence in the record, the Court concludes that
there are a number of triable issues of material fact. Viewing the evidence in
the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and drawing all reasonable
inferences in her favor, the Court concludes that the trier of fact could
reasonably find that Defendant breached its duty by creating a dangerous
condition: inadequately secured tarps on an inadequately secured construction site,
lacking adequate signage, and readily accessible to outsiders, including
members of the public accustomed to walking or riding their bicycles along the path.
Of course, the trier of fact could reasonably find the opposite as well, but on
summary judgment it is not for the Court to weigh evidence or attempt to predict
the likely outcome of a trial. It is enough, for purposes of this motion, for
the Court to conclude that there are triable issues of whether the site was
properly secured, whether there were adequate signs in place, whether the tarps
were adequately secured, and whether Defendant was on notice that member of the
public could access the site on nights and weekends (when the workers were not
present). 
Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment
is denied, and the motion for summary adjudication of the causes of action for premises
liability and general negligence is denied.
Dangerous Condition of Public Property
Government Code¿section¿835 states:¿
“Except as provided by statute, a public entity is liable for
injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the plaintiff
establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time of the
injury, that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous condition, that
the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the kind of
injury which was incurred, and either:¿ 
(a) A negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the
public entity within the scope of his employment created the dangerous
condition; or¿¿ 
(b) The public entity had actual or constructive notice of the
dangerous condition under Section 835.2 a sufficient time prior to the injury
to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.”
Defendant is not a public entity. (DSUMF, No.
67.) Rather, Defendant is a private entity hired by City to perform certain
work.
As Defendant is not a public entity, it
cannot be held liable for a dangerous condition of public property under
Government Code section 835.
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for summary
adjudication as to the cause of action in the complaint for a dangerous
condition of public property is granted.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment.
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for summary
adjudication of the premises liability cause of action in the complaint.
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for summary
adjudication of the general negligence liability cause of action in the
complaint.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for summary
adjudication of the dangerous condition of public property cause of action in
the complaint.
Moving Party is to give notice.
