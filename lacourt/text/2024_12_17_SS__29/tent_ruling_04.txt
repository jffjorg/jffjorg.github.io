 Case Number:  21STCV11145    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  29 Gutierrez v. State of California
21STCV11145
Motions to Continue Trial or Advance Summary Judgment/Adjudication Hearings
 
Background 
 
Three related cases arise out of a series
of events involving multiple parties on the 105 Freeway on March 22, 2020.
In this case, the first filed action
(this case, Case No. 21STCV11145), on March 22, 2021, David and Patty Gutierrez
(“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Defendant State of California, California Department
of Transportation, California State Transportation Agency, Department of
California Highway Patrol, County of Los Angeles (“County”), City of Lynwood
(“City”), Teron Liggins (“Liggins”), Trino Naranjo (“Naranjo”), and Does 1
through 100, asserting causes of action for dangerous condition of public property,
negligence (two counts), negligent infliction of emotional distress, and loss
of consortium.  This is referred to as
the “Gutierrez Action.”
In May and June 2022, answers were filed
by the State of California, acting by and through the Department of
Transportation (“Caltrans”); Liggins; Naranjo; and State of California, acting
by and through the California Highway Patrol (“CHP”).
In June 2022, the Court, at the requests
of Plaintiffs, dismissed City and County.
On June 13, 2022, Naranjo filed a
cross-complaint against Liggins and Roes 1 through 50.
On October 22, 2024, the Court, at the
request of Plaintiffs, dismissed the fifth cause of action by Plaintiff Patty
Gutierrez, for loss of consortium.
On November 22, 2024, the Court denied the
motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Liggins.
In the second filed case (Case No. 22STLC00914),
on February 14, 2022, Plaintiff Aspire General Insurance Company (“Aspire”) filed
a complaint for subrogation against Liggins and Does 1 through 10.  This is the “Aspire Action.”
On August 29, 2024, the Court, at the
request of Aspire, dismissed the entire Aspire Action with prejudice.
In the third filed case (Case No. 22STCV07237), on February 28, 2022, Plaintiffs Jorge and
Guadalupe Gomez filed a complaint for motor vehicle and general negligence
against Liggins,
Naranjo, and Does 1 through 100. 
This is the “Gomez Action.”
On June 10, 2022, Naranjo filed an answer
and a cross-complaint against Liggins and Roes 1 through 50.
On August 23, 2022, Liggins filed an
answer to the complaint.
On April 24, 2024, the Court granted the
motion of Infinity Insurance Company (“Infinity”), the insurer for Naranjo, to
intervene.  On May 1, 2024, Infinity
filed a pleading labeled “Complaint-In-Intervention.”
By order dated August 25, 2022, the Court
related these three actions.  All are
assigned to Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
As it relates to the two motions before the Court and set
for hearing on December 17, 2024, the case is set for trial on February 25,
2025.
 
On November 4, 2024, Defendant Caltrans filed a motion for
summary judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication.  The motion is set for hearing on April 7,
2025.
 
On November 6, 2024, Defendant CHP filed a motion for
summary adjudication.  The motion is set
for hearing on July 2, 2025.
 
On November 8, 2024, Caltrans filed its motion to advance
the hearing date or continue trial.  The
motion was initially set for hearing on December 6 and was continued by the
Court to December 17.
 
On November 20, 2024, CHP filed its motion to continue trial
or advance the hearing date.  The motion was
set for hearing on December 17.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has
the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance should
be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v.
Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide
latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of
continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d
12, 18.) 
“To
ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases, the dates assigned for trial are
firm.  All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for
trial as certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(a).)
“Although
continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a continuance only on an
affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances
that may support a finding of good cause include: 
“(1) The unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; 
(2) The unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or
other excusable circumstances; 
(3) The unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances; 
(4) The substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an
affirmative showing that the substitution is required in the interests of
justice; 
(5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The
other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and
prepare for trial in regard to the new party's involvement in the case; 
(6) A party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony,
documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts; or 
(7) A significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case
as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).) 
“In
ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the court must consider all
the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the
determination.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(d).)  California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a
non-exhaustive list of factors that the court may consider: 
“(1) The proximity of the trial date; 
(2) Whether there was any previous continuance, extension of time,
or delay of trial due to any party; 
(3) The length of the continuance requested; 
(4) The availability of alternative means to address the problem
that gave rise to the motion or application for a continuance; 
(5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a
result of the continuance;
(6) If the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the
reasons for that status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the
need to avoid delay;
(7) The court's calendar and the impact of granting a continuance
on other pending trials;
(8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 
(9) Whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; 
(10) Whether the interests of justice are best served by a
continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions on the
continuance; and 
(11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair
determination of the motion or application.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)
 
Discussion
Defendants move to continue trial or
advance the hearings on their motions for summary judgment/summary
adjudication.  Defendants timely filed
their motions but could not obtain earlier hearing dates. 
A party has a right to have a timely
filed summary judgment or adjudication heard before trial. (Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88; Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529.)
The Court cannot accommodate the request
for advancing the hearing dates.  
Good cause has been shown to continue
trial so that the summary judgment/summary adjudication motions can be heard
before trial.
The motions are granted.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS
the motions of defendants to continue trial.
 
The Court
CONTINUES trial to a date on or after August 5, 2025.
 
The Final Status
Conference and all discovery deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
 
Counsel for
Caltrans is ordered to give notice.
