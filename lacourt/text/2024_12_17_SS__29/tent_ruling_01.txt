  Case Number:  19STCV20094    Hearing Date:   December 17, 2024    Dept:  29 Meza v. Ocampos
19STCV20094
Petitions for Approval of Minors’ Compromises for Claimants Starr Olabaza (Age
16) and David Meza (Age 13).
Tentative 
 
The Court
excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem.
Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.  
 
The Court has
reviewed the Petitions for Approval of Minors’ Compromises and the proposed
orders filed on November 6, 2024. The Court finds several issues that must be
addressed before the Court can approve the petitions.
 
First, Attachment
11b(6) does not address the reason for apportionment of the settlement. It is
unclear, even after review of Attachment 11b(3), why one claimant is to receive
$2,500 and the other $8,000 when neither incurred medical damages. Further,
there is little to no discussion as to Petitioner’s settlement and
apportionment.
 
Second, the
Attorney-Client Fee Agreement is illegible.
 
Third, it
appears that the Petitions may seeks duplicative costs as $450 is sought in
both petitions from both of Claimants’ settlements to cover the same fees of the
complaint filing fee and police reports.
 
Fourth, Item 17f
contends petitioner’s attorney is to be paid by Defendant Violet Mary Campos,
either $650 as listed on Claimant Starr’s petition, or $2,000 as listed on
Claimant David’s petition.
 
Last, Item 1 on
all proposed orders lists the incorrect hearing date and department as this
matter was recently transferred to Department 29.
 
These issues must
be addressed before the Court can approve the Petition.
 
Accordingly, the Court CONTINUES the hearing re Petitions
for Approval of Minor’s Compromise for Starr Olabaza (Age 16) and David Meza (Age 13) to __/__/2025 at 01:30 P.M. in Department 29 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.Moving party to give notice.
