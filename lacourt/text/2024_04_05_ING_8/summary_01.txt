And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to quash the plaintiff's complaint is granted. The plaintiff alleged causes of action for breach of contract, concealment, violation of California Business & Professions Code § 17200, and accounting against the defendants. The defendants argued that the plaintiff lacks jurisdiction over them, and the judge agrees.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's complaint fails to provide sufficient evidence of jurisdiction over the defendants. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants contracted with the plaintiff's predecessor-in-interest, but the evidence submitted is insufficient to establish that the contracts were assigned to the plaintiff or that the plaintiff has jurisdiction over the defendants.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff's amended complaint includes new allegations that are unverified and appear to be sham pleadings. The judge concludes that the plaintiff lacks jurisdiction over the defendants and grants the defendants' motion to quash the complaint.

The judge orders the defendants to give notice of the ruling and will entertain oral argument as to how the 3 dozen categories of proposed document demands address the deficiencies outlined in the plaintiff's effort to exercise specific jurisdiction over the moving defendants.
