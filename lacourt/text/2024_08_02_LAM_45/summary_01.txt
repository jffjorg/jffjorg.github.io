Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the first amended complaint without prejudice. The motion was procedurally defective because it failed to comply with the California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires the party seeking to amend to specify the allegations that will be deleted and added, as well as the effect of the amendment, why it is necessary and proper, and when the facts supporting the amended allegations were discovered. The plaintiff's counsel's declaration also failed to state why the request was not made earlier. The judge found that the plaintiff's delay in bringing the motion was inexcusable and prejudiced the defendants, and that granting the motion would delay the trial, add costs of preparation, and require additional discovery.
