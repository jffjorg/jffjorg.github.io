  - Counsel: Hesam Yazdanpanah
  - Plaintiff: Rommel Navarro
Significant Statements:
  - "The moving attorney shall file with his motion: (1) a notice of the motion, directed to the client using Judicial Council form MC-051; (2) a declaration in support of the motion using Judicial Council form MC-052; and (3) a proposed order granting the motion; all to be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case."
  - "Counsel properly filed an accompanying notice of the motion using Judicial Council form MC-051, a declaration in support of his motion using form MC-052, and a proposed order granting the motion using form MC-053."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. Counsel filed the necessary documents and provided notice to Plaintiff and other parties. The motion is granted because Counsel properly filed the required documents and the withdrawal does not raise the risk of unduly prejudicing the client. The next hearing date in this action is a mandatory settlement conference, and Counsel's withdrawal will not impact the case.
