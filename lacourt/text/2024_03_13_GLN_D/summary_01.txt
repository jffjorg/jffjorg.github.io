Introduction:
  - The court conducted a trial on September 20, 21, and 26, and on October 2, 3, 17, and 18, 2023.
  - Plaintiff was represented by Michael Sloan, of the Law Office of Michael L. Sloan.
  - Defendant was represented by A.J. Glassman, of the Law Offices of A.J. Glassman.
Causes of Action:
  - From First Amended Complaint:
    - 1) Imposition of Resulting Trust
    - 2) Quiet Title
  - From Cross-Complaint:
    - 1) Partition of Real Property and Accounting
    - 2) Conversion
Pre-trial Procedural Posture and Status of Pleadings:
  - The parties filed no motions in limine.
  - The parties did not file any motions for summary judgment.
Summary of Relevant Facts:
  - In Fall 1995, Ali and Tipu's mother was a tenant at the subject property located at 715 N. Jackson Street, Glendale, California 91206.
  - Ali and Tipu orally agreed that Ali was the 100% owner of the property.
  - Tipu was added to the title as a joint tenant due to the bank's insistence.
  - Ali paid most of the mortgage payments and expenses, including taxes, insurance, maintenance, and improvements.
  - Tipu contributed funds when Ali fell behind on the payments.
Analysis:
  - Procedural Issues Regarding CCP Section 631.8:
    - Defendant seeks the entry of judgment in his favor as to the resulting trust and quiet title claims without putting on his case in chief.
  - Existence of Resulting Trust:
    - Plaintiff seeks to establish a resulting trust based on his having paid the down payment and expenses for the subject property.
    - Plaintiff relies on Lloyds Bank California v. Wells Fargo Bank (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1038.
    - The court of appeal emphasized the importance of a party claiming a resulting trust to establish the payment toward the original purchase price of property.
    - The court of appeal also noted that a resulting trust cannot be enforced in favor of a person who has paid part of the consideration for the transfer of property unless it is possible to clearly establish the amount of money contributed by him or her.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the evidence presented at trial and has concluded that the plaintiff has failed to meet the burden of proof to establish a resulting trust and quiet title to the subject property. The court finds that the defendant's motion for judgment pursuant to CCP section 631.8 is granted, and judgment is entered in favor of the defendant.

The court's analysis is based on the evidence presented at trial, which showed that the plaintiff's claim of a resulting trust is based on the payment of the down payment and expenses for the subject property. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish with definiteness and specificity the proportional amount contributed to the purchase price of the property, as required by the law.

The court also notes that the evidence presented at trial does not support the plaintiff's claim of a quiet title, as the defendant has shown that the title to the property is properly held by both parties as joint tenants.

Accordingly, the court grants the defendant's motion for judgment and enters judgment in favor of the defendant.
