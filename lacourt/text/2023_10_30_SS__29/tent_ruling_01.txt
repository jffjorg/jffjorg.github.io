Defendant’s requests for sanctions are GRANTED in part.

 
Background 
 
This is an
action for premises liability arising from alleged injuries causes by a train
in Griffith Park in Los Angeles on May 19, 2018.  On May 15, 2020, Plaintiffs Malvina Mkhchyan,
Ovsanna Mkhchian, Adam Bersigian (a minor by and through his Guardian Ad Litem
Ovsanna Mkhchian) (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against
Defendants City of Los Angeles, Travel Town Transportation Museum, City of Los
Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation, and Does 1 through 50, asserting
claims for premises liability and general negligence.
 
On
September 26, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint against the same
defendants, asserting a single cause of action for premises liability.  
 
On October
31, 2022, Defendant City of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) filed an Answer and a
Cross-Complaint against Roes 1 through 20. 
 
On February
16, 2023, Defendant served discovery on Plaintiffs, including Form Interrogatories
(Set One) and Requests for Production (Set One) directed to Plaintiff Adam
Bersigian (“Plaintiff”).  (Smith Decls.,
¶ 2 & Exhs. A.)  Counsel exchanged
correspondence, but Plaintiff never served responses to the discovery.  (Id., ¶¶ 3-8 & Exh. B.)
 
On August
29, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to
Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production (Set One).  Defendant also seeks sanctions. 
 
Plaintiff
did not file any opposition to the motions. 
 
The Court
is aware that Defendant filed other discovery motions in this case that either
were or are set for hearing this month.
 
Trial is
scheduled for December 20, 2023. 
 
Legal
Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed ….” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
On February
16, 2023, Defendant propounded Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for
Production (Set One) on Plaintiff. 
(Smith Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.) 
Plaintiff never served responses. 
(Id., ¶¶ 3-8.)
 
Defendant need
show nothing more.  The motions to compel
are GRANTED.
Defendant’s
requests for sanctions are also GRANTED. 
Given the relatively straightforward nature of a motion to compel
initial responses, and the economies of scale associated with preparing multiple
parallel motions, the Court awards sanctions on each motion in the amount of $525,
calculated as 2.5 hours of attorney work multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing
rate of $210 per hour.  (See id., ¶
9.)  
Conclusion
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Defendant’s two motions to compel.
Plaintiff is ORDERED to
provide verified, code-compliant, written responses, without objections, to
Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set
One) and Requests for Production (Set One) within 21 days of notice of this
order.
Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED in
part. Plaintiff and counsel of record K & L Associates are ORDERED, jointly
and severally, to pay monetary sanctions to Defendant in the amount of $1,050
($525 for each motion, multiplied by two motions) within 21 days of notice of
this order. 
Moving party to give notice.
