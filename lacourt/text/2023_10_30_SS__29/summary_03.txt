And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial. The defendant argues that they need more time to complete discovery, depositions, and expert discovery, which will not be finished before the current discovery cut-off date. The judge considers the evidence and finds that there is good cause to grant the continuance. The trial date is set to mid-June 2024, and the final status conference and deadlines are reset accordingly.
