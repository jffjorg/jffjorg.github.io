Significant Statements:
  - "To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process..."
  - "Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery."
  - "If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse."
  - "Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective."

And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, denying the Plaintiffs' motion for terminating sanctions, issue sanctions, and evidentiary sanctions. However, the Judge grants the motion for monetary sanctions in part.

The case involves a car accident that allegedly occurred on October 17, 2021, and the Plaintiffs, Luca Bruno and Brandi M. Brown, filed a complaint against the Defendants, Jim K. Garcia, Ian McNeal Guevara, and Does 1 through 50.

The Judge notes that the Defendants failed to respond to discovery requests and failed to comply with Court orders, resulting in a serious and significant pattern of violation. However, the Judge also notes that the Defendants have since brought themselves into compliance with their obligations under the Civil Discovery Act and the Court's prior orders.

The Judge denies the request for terminating sanctions because the primary purpose of escalating discovery sanctions is to bring the offenders into compliance with their obligations, and the Defendants are now in compliance. The Judge grants the motion for monetary sanctions because the Plaintiffs incurred costs due to the Defendants' failure to comply with their discovery obligations.

The Judge orders the Defendants and their counsel to pay sanctions to the Plaintiffs in the amount of $1,810 within 30 days of notice of this order.
