 Case Number:  22STCV22709    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2023    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE 
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’
motion for terminating sanctions, issue sanctions, and evidentiary sanctions.
 
The
Court GRANTS in part Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions.
 
Background 
 
On
July 14, 2022, Plaintiffs Luca Bruno and Brandi M. Brown filed the complaint in
this action against Defendants Jim K. Garcia, Ian McNeal Guevara, and Does 1
through 50, asserting claims for motor vehicle negligence and general
negligence arising out of a car accident that allegedly occurred on October 17,
2021. 
 
On
January 19, 2023, Defendants Jim K. Garcia and Ian McNeal Guevara filed their
answer.
 
On June 7, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motions to
compel Defendant Guevara to provide verified responses to discovery requests
and set monetary sanctions.
 
On August 4, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion
to compel Defendant Garcia to provide verified responses to discovery requests
and set monetary sanctions.
 
A third motion to compel was set for hearing on October
26.  The motion was not opposed, but one day
before the hearing, Defendants’ counsel filed a declaration stating that
Defendants had served responses to all of the outstanding discovery requests on
October 24.  Accordingly, the Court denied the motion to compel as
moot and set monetary sanctions.
 
Prior to that recent development, on September 27, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed and served the  motion that is
currently before the Court, seeking terminating sanctions against Defendants,
or, in the alternative, issue and/or evidence sanctions.  Plaintiffs also request monetary sanctions.
 
Defendants
have not filed an opposition to the motion. 
 
Legal
Standard 
 
“To the extent authorized by
the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of
this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney,
and after opportunity for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against
anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: ... (d)
The court may impose a terminating sanction …."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of
the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an
escalating and “incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with
monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v.
Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and
commensurate with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is
required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors,
Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser sanction fails to curb
misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery
process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached
that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.;
see also, e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 

Terminating sanctions should be used
sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative,
Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although
in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction as a
first measure, a terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the
court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful
and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez,
supra, 246 Cal.App.4th at p. 604.) 
But where discovery
violations are “willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th
at p. 992.)
Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders that prejudice the opposing
party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang
v. Hachman (2000) 77
Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v. Super.
Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.)
A discovery sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a
party in a better position than it would have been if the opposing party had
simply complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil
Discovery Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th
1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Discussion              
 
Plaintiffs contend that the Court
should issue terminating sanctions because no other form of sanctions is
effective because, as of the date of filing, Defendants had not responded to
any discovery.   
 
The record shows that Defendants,
for months, ignored their obligations under the Civil Discovery Act.  In addition, Defendants failed to comply in a
timely fashion with – which is a polite way of saying violated – not one but
two Court orders compelling Defendants to provide discovery responses to
Plaintiffs.  This is a serious and
significant pattern of violation.
 
Nonetheless, Defendants’ counsel
has submitted a declaration stating, under oath, in connection with a motion to
compel that was set for hearing last week, that Defendants have brought
themselves into compliance with their obligations under the Civil Discovery Act
and the Court’s prior orders.  That Court
finds this significant, and, indeed, dispositive as to this motion.  The primary purpose of escalating discovery sanctions
is to bring the offenders into compliance with their obligations; Defendants
are now in compliance with those obligations (based on the statements in the declaration
of their counsel).  Accordingly, and
based on all of the evidence in the record, the Court DENIES the request for terminating
sanctions, issue sanctions, and evidence sanctions.
 
The Court GRANTS in part Plaintiffs’
motion for monetary sanctions.  It was Defendants’
failure to comply with their obligations in a timely fashion that caused
Plaintiff to incur the costs associated with filing this motion, which was
certainly a reasonable course of action given Defendants’ total failure to
comply with their discovery obligations as of the time of filing.  Defendants and their counsel did not act with
substantial justification, and it would not be unjust to impose monetary
sanctions against them.  The Court sets
monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,810, calculated based upon five hours of
attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $350 per
hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Miletic
Decl., ¶ 17.)   
 
Conclusion 
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’
motion for terminating sanctions, issue sanctions, and evidentiary sanctions.
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions.  The Court ORDERS Defendants and their counsel
of record, Chavez Law Group aka Martinez, Dieterick & Zarcone Legal Group, jointly
and severally, to pay sanctions to Plaintiffs in the amount of $1,810 within 30
days of notice of this order. 
Moving parties are
ordered to give notice.
