And here is the English text summary:

The Judge is issuing a tentative ruling on two motions to compel and requests for sanctions filed by Defendant City of Los Angeles. The Defendant filed Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production (Set One) on Plaintiff Malvina Mkhchyan, Ovsanna Mkhchian, and Adam Bersigian on February 16, 2023. However, the Plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's failure to respond is a misuse of the discovery process, and therefore grants the Defendant's motions to compel and requests for sanctions. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant, written responses to the Defendant's discovery requests within 21 days of notice of this order. Additionally, the Judge orders the Plaintiff and their counsel, K & L Associates, to pay monetary sanctions to the Defendant in the amount of $1,050 within 21 days of notice of this order.
