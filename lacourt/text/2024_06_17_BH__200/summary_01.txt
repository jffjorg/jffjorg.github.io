And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the court's decision regarding the communication between counsel and a witness during a bench trial. The judge found that the counsel for the defendants violated the court's rules by communicating with the witness during the trial. The judge also found that the communication may have influenced the witness's testimony. Despite this, the judge did not strike the witness's testimony and instead will consider the materiality of any change in her testimony as part of the analysis of all the evidence and applicable law and regulations after the case is submitted for decision.
