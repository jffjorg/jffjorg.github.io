And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by Plaintiff Juliana Payne regarding an October 2, 2023 order granting Defendant Everdyke's motions to set aside and vacate default and to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Court denies the motion. The Plaintiff argues that Defendant Everdyke voluntarily participated as a streamer on Twitch, which is a California company, and therefore has subject himself to California jurisdiction. However, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to allege new facts, law, or other circumstances that would justify reconsideration. The Court also finds that Plaintiff failed to meet her burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that all necessary jurisdictional criteria are met. The motion is untimely and fails to provide evidence to support the allegations.
