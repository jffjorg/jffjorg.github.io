Significant Statements:
  - "Defendant Lee moves for the Court to reconsider its January 2, 2024 order after court trial finding in favor of Plaintiff on the grounds that (1) the Court denied Lee her constitutional right to jury trial, (2) Lee did not waive jury trial, and (3) the Court improperly denied Lee's December 28, 2023 ex parte motion to continue trial and accommodation request."
  - "Lee fails to allege new facts, law, or other circumstance which would justify reconsideration."
  - "The Court's docket reflects that the actual notice of the removal was filed in the Superior Court on January 2, 2024 at 10:20 p.m., after the trial had occurred."
  - "Based on all of these facts, the notice of removal was frivolous, and the Court did not lose jurisdiction to proceed with trial even if the case actually had been removed to federal court at the time of trial."
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Defendant Lee's motion for reconsideration of the January 2, 2024 order, which found in favor of Plaintiff. Defendant Lee argued that the court improperly denied her request for a jury trial, denied her ex parte application to continue the trial, and lacked jurisdiction over the matter. The court found that Defendant Lee failed to allege new facts, law, or other circumstances that would justify reconsideration. The court also found that Defendant Lee waived her right to a jury trial by failing to appear for trial, and that the court did not improperly deny her ex parte application. Additionally, the court found that the notice of removal to federal court was frivolous and did not affect the court's jurisdiction. The motion for reconsideration is therefore denied.
