et al. v. Quintero, et al., Case
No. 23PSCV01583
 
ORDER ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION
Plaintiffs’
Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
Plaintiff
Loraine Felton and Plaintiffs Delilah Brown, and Devonteon Brown, minors, by
and through their Guardian Ad Litem, Loraine Felton, (“Plaintiffs”) allege that
they sustained damages and injuries in a June 5, 2021 motor vehicle accident on
the 605 freeway.
On May 26, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a complaint, asserting
causes of action against Joel Palomera Quintero (“Quintero”), Joel Palomera
Ibarra (“Ibarra”), and Does 1-50 for:
          1.       Motor
Vehicle, and
          2.       Negligence.
On September 28, 2023, the Clerk entered default against
Quintero and Ibarra.
Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs’ application for
default judgment.

Discussion
Plaintiff’s
application for default judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defects are noted:
          1.       Paragraph
2(f) of each of Plaintiffs’ Judicial Council Form CIV-100 Requests for Court
Judgment (there are six in total, two for each Plaintiff, one of which is
against Ibarra and the other of which is against Quintero) reflects that
Plaintiffs seek a total judgment of “$102,589.647.” Paragraph 2(b)(1) and (2),
however, indicate that Plaintiffs seek special damages of “$25,986.47” and
general damages of “$1,000,000.00,” which equals “$1,025,986.47.” Further, four
of the six proposed judgments (again, two for each Plaintiff, one of which is
against Ibarra and the other of which is against Quintero) list a total
judgment amount of $102,589,647.” One of the proposed judgments (i.e., as to
Plaintiff Loraine Felton against Quintero) identifies the amount sought as
$77,959.41 in damages, plus $1,226.59 in costs only. The above discrepancies
must be reconciled.
          2.       The
proposed judgments as to Plaintiffs Delilah Brown and Devonteon Brown all fail
to name a defendant in item 5a. One of the proposed judgments (i.e., as to
Plaintiff Delilah Brown) is blank with respect to any monetary amounts in
Paragraph 6. The Court requests that any future submission by Plaintiffs
include one judgment encompassing all of Plaintiffs’ claims against Ibarra and
Quintero.
          3.       Plaintiffs
Delilah Brown and Devonteon Brown both purport to seek $25,986.47 in special
damages; however, it is unclear to the Court how this figure was calculated,
inasmuch as their Guardian ad Litem, Loraine Felton, has confirmed that neither
of them received any treatment and that they are not currently in need of any
treatment as a result of the accident. Plaintiff Loraine Felton also seeks
$25,986.47 in special damages against both Ibarra and Quintero but fails to
provide the Court with any information as to how these damages were calculated,
stating only that she presented to St. Mary Medical Center over a month after
the accident with complaints of back pain and that she currently has severe
back pain. 
          4.       Plaintiffs
have not dismissed Does 1-50. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).)
          5.       Plaintiffs
have failed to provide the Court with a brief summary of the case. (See Cal.
Rules of Court, rule3.1800(a)(1).)
          6.       The Court is not
inclined to award anywhere near $1,000,000.00 in general damages based upon the
information provided.
          7.       In personal injury and wrongful death actions, the
complaint must not state the amount of damages sought (Code Civ. Proc., §
425.10). Before a default may be entered, plaintiffs must serve defendants with
a statement of “the nature and amount of damages being sought.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 425.11). The proofs of service filed with the Court reflect that
Ibarra and Quintero were, in fact, served with Statements of Damages; however,
the Court has not been provided with copies of the State of Damages or with any
information as to the amounts listed. It is unclear to the Court, then, whether
or not Ibarra and Quintero have been provided notice of the actual liability
threatened against them.
 
          8.       Plaintiffs state, without more, that they
are unable to confirm Quintero’s and Ibarra’s respective nonmilitary status
without having their dates of birth. It is unclear to the Court that date of
birth information is needed. The Court will require counsel to provide a
supplemental declaration explaining what efforts have been made to comply with
the requirements of Paragraph 8 in each of the each of Plaintiffs’ Judicial
Council Form CIV-100 Requests for Court Judgment.
Accordingly, the application for default judgment is denied
without prejudice. Plaintiffs are directed to
submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned
issues.
