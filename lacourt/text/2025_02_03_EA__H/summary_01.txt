```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiffs' application for default judgment and has denied it without prejudice. The court has identified several defects in the application, including discrepancies in the calculation of damages, failure to name a defendant in some of the proposed judgments, and lack of information on how the special damages were calculated. The court has also noted that the plaintiffs have not dismissed the unknown defendants (Does 1-50), have failed to provide a brief summary of the case, and have not provided the court with a statement of the nature and amount of damages being sought. Additionally, the court is concerned that the defendants may not have been provided with notice of the actual liability threatened against them. The court has directed the plaintiffs to submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses these issues.
