```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' application for default judgment without prejudice. The denial is due to several defects in the application, including:

1. The amount demanded in the complaint, $311,494.74, is not clearly supported by the complaint's prayer and damage allegations.
2. It is unclear how the plaintiffs calculated the amount demanded in the complaint.
3. The plaintiff, Chiang, has failed to authenticate Exhibit A to his declaration.
4. The plaintiffs have not provided a translation of the Lease Transfer Agreement, which is written in a foreign language.
5. The proposed judgment does not identify the defendant in Paragraph 5a.

The judge is requesting that the plaintiffs submit a revised default judgment packet that addresses these defects.
