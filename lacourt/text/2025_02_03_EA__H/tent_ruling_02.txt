v. Lu, Case No.
23PSCV01973
 
ORDER ON APPLICATION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
Plaintiffs’
Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
Plaintiffs Hsien
Ta Chiang (“Chiang”) and One More Cup LLC (“One More Cup”) (together, “Plaintiffs”)
allege as follows:  
          In 2021, Chaing formed One More Cup to
operate a beverage business. Around March 2022, Plaintiffs saw Yaotian Liu, a/k/a Alex Liu’s (“Defendant”) advertisement
that there was a storefront available for rent in the City of Industry and that
Defendant desired to transfer his lease for same. Defendant promised that he
would obtain landlord JSL Plaza Puente Hills LLC’s (“Landlord”) approval to
transfer the lease to LLC.
          On
March 23, 2022, One More Cup and
Defendant entered into a Transfer of Lease and Equipment Sales Agreement
(“Lease Transfer Agreement”), wherein One
More Cup was to pay $40,000.00 as a deposit; that same day, One More Cup and Defendant entered
into an LLC Member Contribution Agreement, wherein Defendant agreed to
contribute $30,000.00 to own 10% of One
More Cup. Thereafter, Defendant agreed that Plaintiffs only had to pay
$10,000.00 as a deposit under the Lease Transfer Agreement. Defendant told
Plaintiffs that Plaintiffs could pay the rents and utility fees via check to
him and that he would pay Landlord; Plaintiffs did so. On October 8, 2022,
Plaintiffs received a notice to vacate from Landlord and later a writ of
possession. Plaintiffs confronted Defendant and learned Defendant never paid
the rent to Landlord.
On February
8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (the “Operative Complaint”
or “FAC”), asserting causes of action against Liu and Does 1-20 for: (1) breach
of contract, (2) conversion, and (3) fraud.
On October
16, 2024, Liu’s default was entered on the Operative Complaint.
Pending
before the Court is Plaintiffs’ Application for Default Judgment.

 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs’ application is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
 
          1.       Plaintiffs identify the “[d]emand
of complaint” in Paragraph 2 of the Request for Court Judgment (Judicial
Council Form CIV-100) as $311,494.74. In
actions for money damages a default judgment is limited to the amount demanded
in the complaint. (See Greenup v. Rodman
(1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 824.) The amount demanded in the complaint is determined
both from the prayer and from the damage allegations in the complaint. (National Diversified Services, Inc. v.
Bernstein (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 410, 417-418). Plaintiffs identify the rent
as being $5,200.00/month (FAC, ¶ 9), the deposit under the Lease Transfer
Agreement as $40,000.00 (and thereafter reduced to $10,000.00 after Defendant
agreed to contribute $30,000.00 to own 10% of the LLC (Id., ¶¶ 12 and
14), and the electricity fee for June 2022 as $1,100.19 (Id., ¶ 17). Plaintiffs
allege sustaining, inter alia, “contractual damages, loss of use of the
premises, loss of business investments, lost opportunity damages, loss of the
$10,000 fee for the lease of interest; loss of rents, loss of revenue, income,
and profits, loss of interest on the damages, and other contractual damages and
losses, in an amount to be determined at trial according to proof” (Id.,
¶ 33); however, the specific monetary accounts are not identified in the Operative
Complaint aside from those figures set forth above.
 
          2.       It is unclear to the Court how the
$311,494.74 figure was calculated. The Court requests an explanation of how
this figure was reached.
 
          3.       Plaintiff Chiang has failed to
authenticate Exhibit A to his declaration. 
 
          4.       Plaintiffs have not provided a
translation of the Lease Transfer Agreement and quotations from Elite Branding Group
Co., Ltd. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(g) [“Exhibits written in a
foreign language must be accompanied by an English translation, certified under
oath by a qualified interpreter”].)
 
          5.       The proposed judgment does not identify
any defendant in Paragraph 5a.
Accordingly,
the application is denied without prejudice. Plaintiffs are directed to submit
a revised default judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned defects.
