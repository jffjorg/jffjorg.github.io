English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants City Defendants' Motion to Stay the Action or Order to Furnish Security for Vexatious Litigant. The court finds that Plaintiff, Arthur Lopez, is a vexatious litigant and has no reasonable probability of prevailing in the litigation. The court also finds that Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) is frivolous as to all other named Defendants because it fails to state a cause of action against each Defendant, is uncertain, and Plaintiff failed to show the possibility of successfully amending the complaint despite previously being given the opportunity to do so. The court sets an OSC re: Status of Appeal for January 31, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and orders City Defendants to give notice.
