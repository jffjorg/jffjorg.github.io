[1] CCP § 391.7 states, in relevant part, “[i]n addition
to any other relief provided in this title, the court may, on its own motion or
the motion of any party, enter a prefiling order which prohibits a vexatious
litigant from filing any new litigation in the courts of this state in propria
persona without first obtaining leave of the presiding justice or presiding
judge of the court where the litigation is proposed to be filed. Disobedience
of the order by a vexatious litigant may be punished as a contempt of court.
