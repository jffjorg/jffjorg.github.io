And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date to March 2025 due to the defendant's noncompliance with the discovery process. The defendant failed to respond to discovery requests, ignored the plaintiff's Demand to close escrow, and has not provided any discovery responses despite notice. The judge finds that the timing of the defendant's motions, including a motion to be relieved of deemed admissions, has caused prejudice and unfairness to the plaintiff. The judge has also extended the discovery cut-off date and the motion cut-offs. The trial will be continued to a date to be determined at the hearing, depending on the court calendar and availability of counsel.
