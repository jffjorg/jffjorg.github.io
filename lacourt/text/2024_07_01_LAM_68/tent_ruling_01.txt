PROTECTIVE ORDER
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant, Confluent, Inc.
RESPONDING PARTY: Unopposed 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED:
Defendant Confluent, Inc. moves for a protective order that
orders Plaintiff Ava Naeini’s 461 requests for admission be deemed withdrawn
and that Defendant Confluent, Inc. is not required to provide any responses or
further objections thereto, and that Plaintiff be admonished from further
abusing civil discovery. 
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Ava Naeini, alleges gender, ethnic and religious
discrimination as an Iranian, Muslim female working in computer/software
technology consulting. Plaintiff maintains management responsible for the
series of events leading to the subject action is the result of their “love of
alcohol and impaired judgment, or hidden sexual and mental disorders that lead
to lower level of awareness, understanding and judgment where subordinates have
to quit, or suffer and tolerate oppression.” Said behavior was also apparently
as a means of disguising technical incompetence and narcissism. The complaint
includes denied time off, payment for only economy class seats “with not enough
legroom” on extensive “coast to coast” flights. 
 
Plaintiff represents to obtain counsel, but due to “national
origin, racial battles in the country and the subconscious bias of the majority
of bias of the majority of attorney that do not yet acknowledge systematic
issues as shifts have not occurred yet” leads to lawyers refusal to take on the
subject action. Plaintiff also contends improper legal rulings striking out
prior iterations of the complaint and unfair treatment of Plaintiff in pro per
has allowed Defendant to effectively block any discovery over the last 15
months of attempting to prosecute the subject action.

court therefore finds the motion MOOT and the court takes the motion
off-calendar.
