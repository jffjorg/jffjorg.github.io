Case #22CHCV01021
 
MOTION TO
COMPEL FURTHER DEPOSITION
 
(Amended) Motion filed on 9/11/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Los Angeles Federal Credit Union
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Jessica J. Martin aka Jessica
Jna Baker 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order compelling Defendant
Jessica J. Martin aka Jessica Jna Baker to re-appear for her deposition on
9/22/23 and answer questions. 
Additionally, Plaintiff requests sanctions against Defendant in the
amount of $2,214.45.
 
RULING: The motion is denied.    
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Los Angeles Federal
Credit Union’s (Plaintiff) claims that Defendant Jessica J. Martin aka Jessica
Jna Baker (Defendant) has defaulted on two loans made by Plaintiff to
Defendant.  On 10/31/22, Plaintiff filed
this action against Defendant for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Money Lent, (3)
Claim and Delivery, (4) Breach of Contract and (5) Money Lent.  On 1/5/23, Defendant, representing herself,
filed an answer to the complaint.
 
On 6/28/23, Plaintiff served Defendant with a notice of
taking her deposition on 7/25/23. 
(Graziano Decl., Ex.A).  On
7/25/23, Defendant appeared for her deposition; however, Plaintiff  contends that Defendant refused to answer any
questions other than her name, former names, and her mailing address.  (Graziano Decl., Ex.B).  
 
Therefore, on 7/27/23, Plaintiff filed and served its
first motion seeking an order compelling Defendant to re-appear for her
deposition on 9/22/23 and answer questions. 
Additionally, Plaintiff requested sanctions against Defendant in the
amount of $2,214.45.  On 8/18/23,
Defendant filed and served, by regular mail, an opposition to the first motion.  On 9/1/23, this Court denied the first motion
without prejudice.
 
On 9/11/23, Plaintiff filed the instant Amended Notice of
Motion and Motion to Compel Defendant to Re-Appear and Answer Questions At
Deposition and requested sanctions against Defendant in the amount of
$2,214.45.  Although the motion was not
filed until 9/11/23, according to the proof of service attached to the motion,
Plaintiff served the motion on Defendant on 9/7/23.  On 9/8/23, Defendant filed and served, by
regular mail, an opposition to the motion. 

 
The motion misrepresents that on 9/1/23, the Court
continued the hearing on the motion to 9/21/23. 
(See Motion, p.3:9-10). 
The Minute Order from 9/1/23 specifically states that the motion was
denied without prejudice.  (See
9/1/23 Minute Order, p.1, p.3).  Additionally,
the Minute Order indicates that the “[d]ate of 9/21/2023, at 8:30  a.m., in Department F47at Chatsworth
Courthouse is reserved for hearing on Plaintiff’s new motion to compel
deposition.”  (9/1/23 Minute Order, p.3).  There is no indication in the 9/1/23 Minute
Order that the Court shortened time to hear the new motion and it was counsel’s
obligation to determine whether the 9/21/23 reserved date provided sufficient
time to notice a new motion.  
 
As noted above, Plaintiff did not serve the instant/new
motion until 9/7/23 and did not file same until 9/11/23 which does not meet the
statutory requirements to file and serve the motion at least 16 court days
before the 9/21/23 hearing date, plus 2 court days for service by email.  See CCP 1005(b); CCP 1010.6(a)(3)(B).
 
Even if the defect in service is deemed waived based on
Defendant’s opposition to the motion, Plaintiff has failed to adequately address
the bases on which the prior motion was denied. 
     
 
One of the reasons the prior motion failed was because it
was not accompanied by a separate statement as required by CRC 3.1345.  While Plaintiff has filed a separate
statement in support of the instant motion, the separate statement is
inadequate.  In part, a separate
statement must set forth “[a] statement of the factual and legal reasons for
compelling further responses, answers, or production as to each matter in
dispute.”  CRC 3.1345(c)(3).  With regard to three of the questions at
issue, Plaintiff merely cites authority which provides that all doubts about
discovery are resolved in favor of disclosure and as to the remaining 14
questions, Plaintiff merely states, without citing any authority, that “[t]his
is not a criminal case.”  Plaintiff has
failed to adequately explain why Defendant’s responses are improper and/or provide
authority to support its position.  
 
Another reason the first motion was denied was because the
Court found that Plaintiff failed to satisfy its meet and confer obligation
before filing that motion.  (See
9/1/23 Minute Order, pp.2-3).  The
instant motion indicates that on 9/1/23, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant
a meet and confer letter requesting that she appear for her deposition on
either 9/7/23 or 9/12/23 at 1 pm.  (Anaya
Decl. ¶3, Ex.A).  The declaration of
attorney Anaya indicates that Defendant did not agree to reset the deposition
date and therefore, an order compelling Defendant’s deposition is still
needed.  (Anaya Decl. ¶4).  However, a review of Defendant’s response to
Plaintiff’s 9/1/23 meet and confer letter indicates that the dates selected by
Plaintiff conflicted with Defendant’s schedule and Defendant stated: “Should
you propose a schedule and we can agree upon a date and time, I’ll be happy to
oblige.”  (Anaya Decl., Ex.B; See also
Opposition, p.7:6-18, p.9:10-12 and Ex.A thereto).  There is no indication that Plaintiff made
any effort to contact Defendant thereafter to attempt to schedule a mutually
agreeable date for the deposition. 
Further, the meet and confer letter, like the instant motion and
accompanying separate statement fails to provide authority as to why Plaintiff
is entitled to substantive answers to each of the questions at issue.  Instead, Plaintiff merely cites authority for
the proposition that a party is entitled to take depositions which is not the
issue as Defendant has appeared for her deposition and is seemingly willing to
appear for another deposition on a mutually agreeable date.  
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is denied.
