And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further deposition and seek sanctions against the defendant. The motion was filed after the plaintiff's previous motion was denied without prejudice, and the judge found that the plaintiff failed to adequately address the bases for the denial. Specifically, the judge noted that the plaintiff's separate statement did not provide sufficient factual and legal reasons to compel further responses, and that the plaintiff failed to meet and confer obligations with the defendant before filing the motion. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not serve the motion in a timely manner, as required by statute. As a result, the judge denied the motion, meaning that the defendant will not be required to re-appear for her deposition or answer questions, and the plaintiff will not receive sanctions.
