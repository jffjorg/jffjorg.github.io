The judge also found that the plaintiff did not serve the motion in a timely manner, as required by statute. As a result, the judge denied the motion, meaning that the defendant will not be required to re-appear for her deposition or answer questions, and the plaintiff will not receive sanctions.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel the Defendant to re-appear for her deposition and answer questions. The motion was filed on September 11, 2023, and seeks to compel the Defendant to re-appear for her deposition on September 22, 2023, and answer questions. The Plaintiff is also seeking sanctions in the amount of $2,214.45.

The Judge found that the motion was defective because it was not served on the Defendant until September 7, 2023, which does not meet the statutory requirements for service. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff failed to adequately address the bases on which the prior motion was denied, including the requirement that a separate statement be filed in support of the motion.

Furthermore, the Judge found that the Plaintiff failed to satisfy its meet and confer obligation before filing the motion, as the Plaintiff did not make any effort to contact the Defendant to attempt to schedule a mutually agreeable date for the deposition. The Judge concluded that the motion is denied, and that the Plaintiff will need to file a new motion that complies with the statutory requirements and adequately addresses the bases for the motion.
