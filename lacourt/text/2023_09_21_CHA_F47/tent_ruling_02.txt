Case #21STCV26434
 
SUMMARY
JUDGMENT
 
Motion filed on 6/7/23.
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Bassam Bejjani, M.D.
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Felix Soto
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order granting summary
judgment in favor of Defendant Bassam Bejjani, M.D.
 
RULING: The hearing will be continued to 10/3/23.
 
Defendant Bassam Bejjani, M.D. (Defendant) has filed two
separate motions for summary judgment. 
The first motion, based solely on the statute of limitations, was filed
on 9/28/22 and originally set for hearing on 4/25/23 when this action was
pending in Department 27 in the Spring Street Courthouse.  Before the 4/25/23 hearing, this action was
transferred to this department and rescheduled for hearing on 10/3/23.
 
On 6/7/23, Defendant filed a second motion for summary
judgment (the instant motion) on the merits of the case which is scheduled for
hearing on 9/21/23.  
 
On 9/14/23, Plaintiff Felix Soto (Plaintiff) filed an
opposition which lists the 10/3/23 hearing date and addresses the arguments in
both motions.  The opposition is untimely
for the 10/21/23 hearing date but is timely for the 10/3/23 date.  
 
Defendant has not provided authority which allows it to
file two separate motions for summary judgment based on different grounds.  However, since the combined memoranda of
points and authorities in support of the motions do not exceed the 20-page
limit for a summary judgment, it does not appear that Plaintiff was prejudiced
by the filing of the two motions, except for the fact that the two filings may
have caused confusion as to the hearing date and/or briefing schedule.
 
The reply is based, in part, on the arguments that
Plaintiff filed and served his opposition late leaving Defendant approximately
only one day to file and serve its reply. 
The reply also notes that the opposition was not served on the current
handling attorneys causing further delay. 

 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that it is in the
interests of justice to continue the hearing on the instant motion to 10/3/23.  In its reply for the 10/3/23 hearing date,
Defendant may also include additional arguments regarding the instant motion
(i.e., not limit its argument to the statute of limitations).
