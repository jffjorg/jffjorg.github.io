## English Summary:

The judge in this case has decided to continue the hearing on Defendant Bassam Bejjani, M.D.'s motion for summary judgment to October 3, 2023.  

The Defendant filed two motions for summary judgment: the first based on the statute of limitations, and the second addressing the merits of the case. The first motion was originally scheduled to be heard in April 2023 but was transferred to this department and rescheduled. The Plaintiff filed a late opposition addressing both motions. 

The judge acknowledges that filing two separate motions on different grounds may cause confusion, but finds that Plaintiff was not unduly prejudiced due to the combined memoranda not exceeding the page limit. The judge is continuing the hearing to allow the Defendant to address the merits of the case in its reply.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two separate motions for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Bassam Bejjani, M.D. The motions were filed on different grounds, with the first motion based solely on the statute of limitations and the second motion on the merits of the case. The plaintiff, Felix Soto, filed an opposition to both motions, but it was untimely for the first hearing date. The judge notes that the defendant did not provide authority to support filing two separate motions, but since the combined memoranda of points and authorities do not exceed the 20-page limit for a summary judgment, it does not appear that the plaintiff was prejudiced. However, the judge is concerned that the two filings may have caused confusion as to the hearing date and/or briefing schedule. The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the second motion to 10/3/23, and the defendant may include additional arguments regarding the motion in its reply.
