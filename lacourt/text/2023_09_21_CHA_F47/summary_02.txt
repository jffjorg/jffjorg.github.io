## English Summary:

The judge in this case has decided to continue the hearing on Defendant Bassam Bejjani, M.D.'s motion for summary judgment to October 3, 2023.  

The Defendant filed two motions for summary judgment: the first based on the statute of limitations, and the second addressing the merits of the case. The first motion was originally scheduled to be heard in April 2023 but was transferred to this department and rescheduled. The Plaintiff filed a late opposition addressing both motions. 

The judge acknowledges that filing two separate motions on different grounds may cause confusion, but finds that Plaintiff was not unduly prejudiced due to the combined memoranda not exceeding the page limit. The judge is continuing the hearing to allow the Defendant to address the merits of the case in its reply.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two separate motions for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Bassam Bejjani, M.D. The motions were filed on different grounds, with the first motion based solely on the statute of limitations and the second motion on the merits of the case. The plaintiff, Felix Soto, filed an opposition to both motions, but it was untimely for the first hearing date. The judge notes that the defendant did not provide authority to support filing two separate motions, but since the combined memoranda of points and authorities do not exceed the 20-page limit for a summary judgment, it does not appear that the plaintiff was prejudiced. However, the judge is concerned that the two filings may have caused confusion as to the hearing date and/or briefing schedule. The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the second motion to 10/3/23, and the defendant may include additional arguments regarding the motion in its reply.

## English Summary:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on Defendant Bassam Bejjani, M.D.'s motion for summary judgment to October 3, 2023. This is because the Plaintiff's opposition to the motion was filed late, creating confusion about the hearing date and briefing schedule.  

The Defendant had previously filed a motion for summary judgment based solely on the statute of limitations, which was originally scheduled to be heard in April 2023.  That hearing date was then postponed to October 3, 2023, after the case was transferred to the current department. 

The Plaintiff's opposition addresses both motions, as it was filed after the second motion was filed. Although the opposition was timely for the October 3rd hearing, it was late for the originally scheduled September 21st hearing. 


The judge acknowledges that the Defendant filed two separate motions, but since the combined length of the briefs does not exceed the page limit for a summary judgment motion, the Plaintiff was not unfairly prejudiced.  The judge also notes that the Defendant's reply brief will have the opportunity to address any additional arguments regarding the second motion.

**Case Number:** 21STCV26434
**Hearing Date:** September 21, 2023 (continued to October 3, 2023)
**Department:** Dept. F47

**Parties:**

- Plaintiff: Felix Soto
- Defendant: Bassam Bejjani, M.D.

**Summary:**

Defendant Bejjani filed two separate motions for summary judgment. The first motion, filed on September 28, 2022, was based on the statute of limitations and had a hearing date of April 25, 2023. However, the case was transferred to this department and the hearing was rescheduled for October 3, 2023.

The second motion, filed on June 7, 2023 (the "instant motion"), is based on the merits of the case and is scheduled for hearing on September 21, 2023. Plaintiff Soto filed an opposition on September 14, 2023, which addresses the arguments in both motions. The opposition is timely for the October 3, 2023 hearing date but not for the September 21, 2023 date.

Defendant Bejjani has not provided authority for filing two separate motions on different grounds. The court finds that the combined memoranda of points and authorities in support of the motions did not prejudice Plaintiff Soto, except for causing potential confusion regarding the hearing date and briefing schedule.

The reply to the opposition is based on the argument that the opposition was filed late, leaving Defendant Bejjani with minimal time to file a reply. The reply also notes that the opposition was not served on the current handling attorneys, causing further delay.

The court has decided to continue the hearing on the instant motion to October 3, 2023. Defendant Bejjani may include additional arguments regarding the instant motion in the reply for the October 3, 2023 hearing date, not limiting the argument to the statute of limitations.

**Significant Statements:**

- The court finds it in the interests of justice to continue the hearing on the instant motion to October 3, 2023.
- Defendant Bejjani may include additional arguments regarding the instant motion in the reply for the October 3, 2023 hearing date.
