## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the attorney's motion to be relieved as counsel for the defendants. The judge found that the attorney did not properly serve the motion on the clients, as there was no evidence they consented to electronic service. The declaration supporting the motion also lacked sufficient proof that the attorney confirmed the clients' email addresses. 

Furthermore, the attorney's reasons for wanting to withdraw were too vague. They cited "failure to cooperate" and "mandatory withdrawal under the Rules" without providing specifics about the cooperation issues or which rules mandated the withdrawal.
