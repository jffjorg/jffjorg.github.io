And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by attorney Anne L. Holland to be relieved as counsel for the defendants without prejudice. The motion was filed on May 18, 2023, and served electronically on the clients, but the judge found that this was impermissible service in the absence of consent and adequate confirmation of the email addresses. The judge also found that the reasons given for withdrawal, including "failure of cooperation" and "withdrawal is mandatory under the Rules," were too vague. The judge noted that the attorney failed to provide adequate information as to how the defendants have failed to cooperate and which rules the attorney claims mandate withdrawal.
