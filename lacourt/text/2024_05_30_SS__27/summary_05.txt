The Court orders the Plaintiff to serve verified and complete responses to the discovery requests at issue without objections within 20 days of today's date. Additionally, the Court imposes sanctions of $1000 on the Plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally, to be paid to the Defendant within 20 days of today's date.
