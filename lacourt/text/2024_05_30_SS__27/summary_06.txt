And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) and has decided to hear argument on the negligence cause of action. The plaintiff, Kyle Aaron Testa, was allegedly assaulted by a Lyft driver, Robert Doe. Testa is suing Lyft for negligent hiring, supervision, and retention. Lyft demurred to the FAC, arguing that it failed to allege how Lyft was aware or should have known about the driver's risk of danger. The Court has reviewed the FAC and finds that it improves upon the initial complaint by pleading new facts that are not legal conclusions. However, the Court notes that the FAC still fails to allege how Lyft was aware or should have known about Robert Doe's risk of danger and neglected to take any action to prevent Doe's hiring. The Court will hear argument on the negligence cause of action to resolve this issue.
