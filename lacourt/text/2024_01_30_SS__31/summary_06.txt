And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to Plaintiff Demetrio Montanez's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against Los Angeles Unified School District, et al. The Plaintiff seeks to add causes of action against private entities, specifically A-1 Fencing and Turner Construction, which were discovered in late October 2022. The Court previously denied the motion without prejudice due to procedural deficiencies, but the Plaintiff re-filed the motion and submitted a supplemental brief and declaration to comply with California Rules of Court. The Court grants the Plaintiff's unopposed motion for leave to file the FAC, ordering the Plaintiff to file a separate copy of the proposed FAC within 10 days.
