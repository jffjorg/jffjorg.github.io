And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, granting the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The dispute arose when the plaintiff's counsel failed to calendar deadlines correctly, resulting in the plaintiff's failure to appear at a non-jury trial and the subsequent dismissal of the complaint. The judge has found that the plaintiff's counsel's mistake was excusable and that the plaintiff has shown a reasonable excuse for the default. The judge has also ordered an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proof of Service, requiring the plaintiff to provide evidence showing that the defendant has been served with the summons and complaint or why such service has not occurred.
