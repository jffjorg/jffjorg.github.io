And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendant, Kate Lebenzon, to compel the plaintiff, Kaitlyn Adams, to submit to an independent medical examination (IME) with Dr. Luke Macyszyn. The defendant seeks to conduct a virtual IME due to the plaintiff's residence being over 75 miles from Dr. Macyszyn's office. The plaintiff opposes the motion, citing the distance and lack of good cause for travel involved. The judge notes that the defendant has offered to pay the plaintiff's reasonable travel costs, but the plaintiff refused the offer.

The judge rules that the defendant's motion to compel IME is granted, and discovery is re-opened for the limited purpose of conducting the plaintiff's virtual IME with Dr. Macyszyn. The parties are ordered to meet and confer on a mutually agreeable date to schedule the IME within 20 days. If the plaintiff does not participate in the meet and confer discussion, the defendant may unilaterally notice the plaintiff's remote IME with Dr. Macyszyn.

The judge also denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions and orders the defendant to give notice of the tentative ruling. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
