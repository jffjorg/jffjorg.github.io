Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some reasonable excuse for the default." (Credit Managers Association of California v. National Independent Business Alliance)

Summary:
The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside the dismissal of a complaint filed by Plaintiffs Lito Reotutar and Rubirosa Reotutar against Defendant Caitlin M. Bishop. The complaint was filed in 2021 and was dismissed in 2023 due to the failure of Plaintiffs' counsel to calendar the hearing. Plaintiffs' counsel has since filed a motion to set aside the dismissal, citing excusable neglect due to a series of unfortunate events. The Court has granted the motion, finding that Plaintiffs' counsel's admission of fault is sufficient to set aside the dismissal. However, the Court has also set an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proof of Service, requiring Plaintiffs' counsel to provide evidence of service of the summons and complaint on Defendant. If Plaintiffs fail to appear at the OSC and file proper proof of service, the action may be dismissed.
