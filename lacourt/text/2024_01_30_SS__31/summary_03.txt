And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants, Julian Kim and Delta SBOC Corporation dba MAPSSE, in the amount of $125,000. The plaintiff had originally sought $7,927 in special damages and $500,000 in general damages, but the judge reduced the amount due to the plaintiff's failure to specify the amount of special damages in the Statement of Damages. The judge also reduced the amount of general damages from $500,000 to $125,000, citing a lack of evidence to support the higher amount.
