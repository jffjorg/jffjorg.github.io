And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel and motion to deem requests for admission admitted. The defendant, City of Los Angeles, et al., has moved to compel the plaintiff, Benjamin Gonzalez, to respond to outstanding discovery requests. The plaintiff has failed to serve responses to the discovery requests, and the defendant is seeking an order compelling the plaintiff to respond and pay sanctions. The court finds that the motion to compel is moot in light of the responses served on the defendant prior to the hearing. However, the court awards $480 in attorney's fees and $120 in costs to the defendant. The court also imposes sanctions against the plaintiff and the plaintiff's counsel in the amount of $600.

Regarding the motion to deem requests for admission admitted, the defendant has served requests for admission and form interrogatories on the plaintiff, but the plaintiff has failed to respond. The plaintiff has now served verified responses to the discovery requests, and the court finds that the motion is moot. No sanctions are awarded in this matter.
