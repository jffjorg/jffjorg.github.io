On

jurisdiction to make orders to enforce any and all terms of settlement,

ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
A
party that requests that a record or portion of a record be filed under seal
must file a motion or an application for an order sealing it. The motion must
be accompanied by a supporting memorandum and a declaration containing facts
sufficient to justify the sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1); Savaglio
v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 588, 597–601.) All parties
that have appeared in the case must be served with a copy of the motion or
application. Unless the judge orders otherwise, a party that already possesses
copies of the records to be sealed must be served with a complete, unredacted
version of all papers as well as a redacted version. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.551(b)(2).)
 
The
moving party must lodge the record with the court in a separate envelope when
the motion or application is made, unless good cause exists for not lodging it
or it has been lodged previously. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(4) and
(d).) The lodged record is conditionally under seal pending the judge's
determination of the motion or application. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.551(b)(4).)
 
Pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d), a judge may order that a record be
filed under seal only if the judge expressly finds facts that establish all the
following:
 
(1)      
There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record.
 
(2)      
The overriding interest supports
sealing the record.
 
(3)      
A substantial probability exists
that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed.
 
(4)      
The proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored, and
 
(5)      
No less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d).)
 
In
ruling on a motion to seal, the court must weigh the competing interests and
concerns. This process necessitates (1) identifying the specific information
claimed to be entitled to protection from public disclosure, (2) identifying
the nature of the harm threatened by disclosure, and (3) identifying and
accounting for countervailing considerations. (H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894.) Therefore, to prevail on his or her motion,
the moving party must present a specific enumeration of the facts sought to be
withheld and the specific reasons for withholding them. (Id. at p. 904.)
 
The
California Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment provides “a right of
access to ordinary civil trial and proceedings.” (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV),
Inc. v. Super. Ct. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1212.) The court further noted
its belief that “the public has an interest, in all civil cases, in observing
and assessing the performance of its public judicial system.” (Id. at
1210.) There is a presumption of openness in civil court proceedings. (Id.
at 1217.) This presumption may apply to seemingly private proceedings. (Burkle
v. Burkle (2006) 135 Cal. App.4th 1045, 1052 (divorce proceedings).)
Therefore, it is up to this Court to determine if that presumption has been
overcome.
 
Courts
must find compelling reasons, prejudice absent sealing and the lack of
less-restrictive means, before ordering filed documents sealed. (Hurvitz v.
Hoefflin (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1246; NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV),
Inc. v. Super. Ct. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1208-1209 n. 25; Champion v.
Super. Ct. (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 777, 787.) A compelling reason could
include to protect confidential trade secrets, which “have been recognized as a
constitutionally protected intangible property interest.” (DVD Copy Control
Ass’n, Inc. v. Bunner (2003) 31 Cal.4th 864, 878, internal citations
omitted.)
 
A
proposed sealing must be narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest,
such as by sealing portions of pleadings or redacting text. (In re Marriage
of Burkle (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1052, 1070.) An application to seal
must be accompanied by a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify
sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1).)
 
A
“contractual obligation not to disclose can constitute an overriding interest”
is sufficient to justify sealing the requested documents so long as the moving
party establishes that disclosure of the information will result in substantial
prejudice. (Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2003) 110 Cal.
App. 4th 1273, 1283–84.)
 
II.       Discussion
 
Defendants move the Court to seal: (1)
Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Nicole S. Phillis, which is the Parties’
Settlement and General Mutual Release Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”), which
was submitted in support of Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Ex Parte
Application; and (2) the portions of the memorandum in the Opposition to the Ex
Parte Application that quote the Settlement Agreement. 
 
        Regarding the Settlement Agreement and
the portions of the Opposition that discuss it, the Court finds: (1) that there exists an overriding interest that overcomes
the right of public access to the record; (2) that the overriding interest
supports sealing the record; (3) that a substantial probability exists that the
overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) that
the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and (5) that no less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest. 
 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
        The Motion to File Documents Under Seal
is GRANTED.
