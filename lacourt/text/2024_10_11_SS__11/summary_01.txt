And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions: the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and the Defendant's motion for a protective order. The Court has granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel as to document requests 24 through 29 for the 271 non-opt-out putative class members, allowing the documents to be unredacted and unorganized. The parties are also ordered to meet and confer regarding document requests 9 through 18. The Court has denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions and the Defendant's request for sanctions. The Defendant's motion for a protective order is also denied. The Judge has considered the supplemental filings and believes that the factors eliminate the need for redactions and negate the need to limit the production to a 30% random sample.
