TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel is granted as to document requests 24
through 29 for the 271 non-opt-out putative class members (the documents can be
unredacted and unorganized).
 
The Court orders the parties to meet and confer as to document requests 9
through 18.
 
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied without prejudice.
 
Defendant’s motion for protective order is denied.
 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
KC is a company that supplies
eye-care and lens-care products.  (See
Motion for Protective Order, p. 2.) 
Plaintiff used to work for KC. 
(See ibid.)  She alleges that KC
subjected her and current and former employees to numerous wage-and-hour
violations.  (See First Amended
Complaint, ¶¶ 42-117.)
 
On September 3, 2024, the Court
heard Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses and KC’s motion for
protective order.  Ultimately, the Court continued the hearing and granted
the parties leave to file supplemental evidence and supplemental briefs.
 
Now, the Court considers the supplemental filings.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Prior to the September 3rd
hearing, the Court issued two tentative decisions.  For Plaintiff’s motion, the Court ordered
further responses to document requests 24 through 29 (as modified) and
instructed the parties to meet and confer regarding document requests 9 through 18. 
For KC’s motion, the Court ordered Defendant to provide responses to the
discovery requests for a 30% random sample of putative class members.
 
During oral arguments, however, the Court became persuaded that a
protective order is unnecessary.  At
least four reasons stood out to the Court. 
One, the evidence showed that Defendant has already gathered and scanned
all or most of the documents.  Two,
Plaintiff’s counsel represented that the parties’ April 16, 2024 stipulated
protective order protects the documents from public disclosure.  Three, Plaintiff’s counsel offered to exclude
the documents of the 22 opt-out putative class members from the production.  Four, Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to receive
the documents of the 271 non-opt-out putative class members in their current,
unorganized state.  The Court’s
inclination was to find that these factors eliminate the need for redactions,
negate the need to limit the production to a 30% random sample, and minimize
the overall burden on Defendant related to producing the documents.
 
The Court continues to believe this.
 
Nevertheless, as a matter of fairness, the Court continued the hearing to
give Defendant an additional chance to submit evidence demonstrating burden.
 
Defendant did not.  The Court
expected Defendant to submit a declaration from an information-technology
worker to show the hours and costs required to produce the non-opt-out
documents.  Instead, Defendant filed a
five-page supplemental brief that attaches zero evidence, let alone new
evidence.  In short, Defendant’s burden
is unsatisfied.
 
Accordingly, the Court:
 
* grants the motion to compel as to document requests 24 through 29 for
the 271 non-opt-out putative class members (the documents can be unredacted and
unorganized);[1]
 
* orders the parties to meet and confer as to document requests 9 through
18;
 
* denies Plaintiff’s request for sanctions without prejudice (Plaintiff
can re-raise the request if Defendant fails to comply with this ruling); 
 
* denies the motion for protective order; and
 
* denies Defendant’s request for sanctions.
