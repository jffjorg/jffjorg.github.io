MOTION:  


Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Saul Gonzalez




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant General Motors LLC



 
MOTION
            Plaintiff
Saul Gonzalez (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel further responses from Defendant
General Motors LLC (“Defendant”) to Requests for Production of Documents, set
one (“RPD”), Nos. 1, 3, 9, 17, 37-51, 54, 59-63, and 65.  Defendant opposes the motion.  But in their Joint Statement in keeping with
the court’s April 30, 2024 order, the parties inform the court only responses
to RPD Nos. 9, 17, and 37-51 remain in dispute.
 
ANALYSIS
If the propounding
party deems responses to requests for production of documents unsatisfactory,
the propounding party may move to compel further responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310.)  
Here, Plaintiff
alleges his 2019 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 vehicle had defects Defendant was
unable to repair within a reasonable number of attempts.  Plaintiff, therefore, contends Defendant is
liable under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.  
Defendant objects
to the RPD to the extent Plaintiff seeks documents about vehicles other than
Plaintiff’s vehicle.  As Plaintiff timely
filed this motion to compel further responses, Defendant has the burden to
justify its objections.  (Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  Pursuant to Santana v. FCA US, LLC
(2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 334, Plaintiff is entitled to discovery regarding the
alleged defects in other vehicles of the same year, make, and model as
Plaintiff’s vehicle.  Likewise, Plaintiff
is entitled to evidence of Defendant’s conduct towards other purchasers of
defective vehicles, which is pertinent to a finding that the manufacturer
willfully violated the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act in failing to
adequately repair a vehicle.  (Johnson
v. Ford Motor Co. (2005) 35 Cal. 4th 1191, 1204.)  Furthermore, “whether [Defendant] had a
written policy on the requirement to repair or replace” under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act is relevant to a finding of willfulness.  (Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc.
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 136.)  Thus, Plaintiff
is entitled to discovery concerning Defendant’s policies and procedures.  
Defendant contends
some of the information Plaintiff seeks is irrelevant. “In the context of
discovery, evidence is ‘relevant’ if it might reasonably assist a party in
evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a settlement.
Admissibility is not the test, and it is sufficient if the information sought
might reasonably lead to other, admissible evidence.”  (Glenfed Development Corp. v. Superior
Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)  As set forth above, information about the same
year, make, and model as Plaintiff’s vehicle is pertinent to this case.
Defendant claims,
given the breadth of the documents Plaintiff seeks, some of the responsive
information would constitute trade secrets.  Defendant has not substantiated that
objection.  “‘Trade secret’ means
information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device,
method, technique, or process, that: (1) Derives independent economic value,
actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other
persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) Is
the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain
its secrecy.”  (Civ. Code, § 3426.1.)  First, the court notes the parties in this
action entered into a stipulation and protective order which addresses confidential
materials.  Second, in support of its
contention in this regard, Defendant provides a declaration dated October 25,
2018 that is unrelated to this case.  (See
Declaration of Huizhen Lu, attached as Exhibit A to Declaration of Ryan Kay.)  There is no evidence before the Court the averments
in that more than five-year-old declaration are accurate. The court, therefore,
disregards it.
Therefore, Defendant
is ordered to produce responsive documents regarding “service bulletins and/or
technical service bulletins” (RPD, No. 9) and “the Warranty Administration
Manual” governing “the warranty diagnosis and repairs to the SUBJECT VEHILCE,” given
Plaintiff’s statement in the Joint Statement it is willing to compromise concerning
this request (RPD, No. 17). 
Additionally, as Plaintiff requests, Defendant is ordered to provide
code-compliant further responses to requests concerning the production of
documents relating to California owners of the same year, make, model as the subject
vehicle regarding issues with “an abnormal noise coming from the front end as
identified on Repair Order No. 248764 on August 3, 2020, at Delano Chevrolet
Buick GMC”; “a loud knocking noise coming from under the hood as identified on
Repair Order No. 154813 on June 5, 2023, at Delano Chevrolet Buick GMC”; “the
front center seatbelt as identified on Repair Order No. 154813 on June 5, 2023,
at Delano Chevrolet Buick GMC”; “hard transmission shifting as identified on repair
Order No. 162100 on August 21, 2023, at Delano Chevrolet Buick GMC”; and “the vehicle
juddering when accelerating as identified on Repair Order No. 162100 on August
21, 2023, at Delano Chevrolet Buick GMC” (RPD, Nos. 37-51).
The court declines
to impose sanctions because, for the most part, Defendant has agreed to produce
many of the documents Plaintiff seeks.  (See
Opposition to Motion to Compel Further Responses, pp. 4-5.)  Accordingly, an award of sanctions in this
instance would be unjust.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiff’s motion
to compel further responses to the subject RPDs which remain in dispute is
granted.  Defendant is ordered to produce
responsive documents to, and further responses regarding, those RPDs noted above
in keeping with Section D of the Courtroom Information for Department 39 . 
Plaintiff is
ordered to give notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
