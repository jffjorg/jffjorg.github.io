CASE NUMBER:


23STCV19761




MOTION:  


Motion to Compel Discovery Responses




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Ariel Alfaro




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
            Plaintiff
Ariel Alfaro (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel responses from Defendant Man
Staffing, LLC (“Defendant”) to Form Interrogatories—Employment Law, set one.   Defendant has not filed an opposition to the
motion.
In a proof of
service attached to Plaintiff’s motion, an individual states she had the notice
of motion and motion served personally on Defendant’s attorney “through a
courier.”  That is hearsay and
insufficient proof of service.  Any such
proof of personal service requires a declaration from the courier who actually effected
the service, not someone who gave the document to the courier for service.  (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 9.85 et seq., p. 9(1)-55.)  Sufficient proof of service is particularly
relevant here when there is no indication Defendant opposes the motion, and the
circumstances call into question whether Defendant was served such notice.  
Accordingly, the
motion is denied without prejudice.  Plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
