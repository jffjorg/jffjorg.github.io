Roles:
  - Judge: The judge is the one who is hearing the case and making the tentative ruling.
  - Plaintiff: The plaintiff is the party who is bringing the lawsuit against the defendant.
  - Defendant: The defendant is the party who is being sued by the plaintiff.
  - PSD: PSD is the Palmdale School District, which is the defendant in this case.

Significant Statements:
  - The court declines to consider PSD's untimely reply and response to plaintiff's statement of additional facts.
  - PSD has failed to provide any sufficient evidence that it has met its initial burden in such a manner as to shift the burden onto the plaintiff.
  - With the granting of the evidentiary objections, PSD has little support based on the facts as they are available today to assert that they have demonstrably met their burden of supervision regarding the plaintiff.
  - The majority of PSD's evidentiary reliance is based on the declaration of Lisa Fowler, which is objected to by the plaintiff.
