PARTY’S REQUEST 
          Campbell asks the Court to consolidate case numbers 22STCV11587,
23SMCV01086, and 23SMCV01411 for all purposes including trial.  Allen joins in the motion.
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 1048, subdivision (a),
provides: 
 “(a)
When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1048,
subd. (a).) 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a), provides: 
“(a)
Requirements of motion 
“(1)  A notice of motion to consolidate must: 
“(A)  List all named parties in each case, the
names of those who have appeared, and the names of their respective attorneys
of record; 
“(B)  Contain the captions of all the cases sought
to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first; and 
“(C)  Be filed in each case sought to be
consolidated. 
“(2)  The motion to consolidate: 
“(A)  Is deemed a single motion for the purpose of
determining the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums, declarations, and
other supporting papers must be filed only in the lowest numbered case; 
“(B)  Must be served on all attorneys of record and
all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases sought to be consolidated; and 
“(C)  Must have a proof of service filed as part of
the motion.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.350(a).) 
Los
Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(g) provides: 
“(1) Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in
the same department. A motion to consolidate two or more cases may be noticed
and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been
related into a single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that
department. (2) Upon consolidation of cases, the first filed case will be the
lead case, unless otherwise ordered by the court. After consolidation, all
future papers to be filed in the consolidated case must be filed only in the
case designated as the lead case. (3) Before consolidation of a limited case
with an unlimited case, the limited case must be reclassified as an unlimited
case and the reclassification fee paid.” 
DISCUSSION 
          Campbell has filed a motion to consolidate case numbers
22STCV11587, 23SMCV01086, and 23SMCV01411. 
Campbell filed the motion in case number 22STCV11587.  
Campbell did not, however, file notices of the motion in case numbers 23SMCV01086 and
23SMCV01411.  (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.350(a)(1)(C).)  The Court therefore denies
the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the motion to consolidate filed by Dana Campbell on February 27, 2024. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
