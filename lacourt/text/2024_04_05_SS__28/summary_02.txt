And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the motion of the City of Los Angeles and Sean L. Williams for leave to file a cross-complaint against Jesus Sandoval. The cross-complaint seeks indemnity, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief. The court finds that the defendants have acted in good faith and that the statute liberally construes to avoid forfeiture of a cause of action. The court orders the defendants to file and serve the cross-complaint within 30 days of the hearing and to provide notice of this ruling.
