And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is about a motion by Plaintiff Daniel Chavez to file a first amended complaint against Defendant Simon Jihoon Sohng. The motion is to add a claim for punitive damages and to allege that Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of a drug. Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that Plaintiff unreasonably delayed in filing the motion and that the motion is procedurally defective. The Court grants the motion, finding that the added costs of preparation do not constitute prejudice and that Plaintiff's original complaint remains intact. The Court orders Plaintiff to file and serve the first amended complaint within 20 days of the hearing.
