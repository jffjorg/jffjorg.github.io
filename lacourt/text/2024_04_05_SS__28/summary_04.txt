Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories and demand for inspection and production of things filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, Minerva Gomez, has objected to the motions, claiming that the requests are vague, ambiguous, overbroad, unduly burdensome, and invade her privacy. The judge has found that the plaintiff has not carried her burden of showing preliminary facts supporting the application of attorney-client privilege or work product protection. Therefore, the judge grants the motions and orders the plaintiff to provide further, verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories and demand for inspection and production of things by May 3, 2024. The judge also orders the plaintiff to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested by May 3, 2024.
