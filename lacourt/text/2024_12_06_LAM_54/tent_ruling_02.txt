Motion to Determine Responsibility for
Initiating Arbitration
Moving Party: Plaintiff Curtis Randolph 
Responding Party: Defendant Palmetto Solar, LLC
 
T/R:     PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION IS DENIED.
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition and reply. 
 
Plaintiff moves for an order
determining responsibility for initiating arbitration proceedings following the
Court’s order granting Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration. Plaintiff
asserts that Defendant should initiate the arbitration because they moved to
compel arbitration. Defendant asserts Plaintiff should initiate because
Plaintiff is the party pursuing claims against Defendant. The Court agrees with
Defendant. It is Plaintiff’s responsibility to initiate arbitration if
Plaintiff has claims against Defendant. Defendant need not open an arbitration
on Plaintiff’s behalf. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED.
