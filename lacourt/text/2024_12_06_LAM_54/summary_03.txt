And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to strike. The demurrer to the second cause of action for UCL violations has been OVERRULED. The Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a claim for UCL violations, and the relief sought is not duplicative of the relief sought for quantum meruit. The demurrer to the claim against Defendants KPIC and KFH has also been OVERRULED, as the Plaintiff has alleged claims against all Defendants.

The motion to strike the Plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief under the UCL has been DENIED. The Plaintiff may seek injunctive relief under the statutory scheme. The Court has also denied the motion to strike the complaint, as the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged claims against all Defendants.

The Judge has ordered the Defendants to file and serve answers to the complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
