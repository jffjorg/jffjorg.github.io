The judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has denied the plaintiff's motion to determine responsibility for initiating arbitration. The plaintiff, Curtis Randolph, had argued that the defendant, Palmetto Solar, LLC, should initiate the arbitration because they moved to compel arbitration. However, the judge agrees with the defendant that it is the plaintiff's responsibility to initiate arbitration if they have claims against the defendant. The defendant does not need to initiate arbitration on the plaintiff's behalf. The judge's ruling is based on the court's previous order granting the defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
