“‘The Constitution does not require a stay of civil proceedings pending
the outcome of criminal proceedings.’”  (Avant!
Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 876, 886 (quoting Afro-Lecon,
Inc. v. U.S. (Fed. Cir. 1987) 820 F.2d 1198, 1202).)  “‘A court, however, has the discretion to
stay civil proceedings, postpone civil discovery, or impose protective orders
and conditions ‘‘when the interests of justice seem [] to require such action,
sometimes at the request of the prosecution, . . . sometimes at the request of
the defense[.]’’’” (Id. (quoting Afro-Lecon, Inc., supra, 820
F.2d at 1202).)  
 
“The determination of whether to stay an action pending resolution of
criminal proceedings should be made in light of the particular circumstances
and competing interests involved.”  (People
ex rel. Harris v. Rizzo (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 921, 952.)  “The decisionmaker should consider the extent
to which Fifth Amendment rights are implicated.”  (Id.) 
“In addition, factors to be considered include: (1) the interest of the
party opposing the stay in proceeding expeditiously with the action, and the
potential prejudice to the party opposing the stay of a delay; (2) the burden
which any particular aspect of the proceedings may impose on the party seeking
the stay; (3) the convenience to the court in management of its cases and the
efficient use of judicial resources; (4) the interests of persons not parties
to the civil litigation; and (5) the interest of the public in the pending
cases.”  (Id.)  “While the privilege against
self-incrimination is a factor to be considered, the issue of a stay itself
does not implicate constitutional issues.” 
(Id.; see also Avant! Corp., supra, 79 Cal.App.4th at 882
(“‘[I]t is not unconstitutional to force a litigant to choose between invoking
the fifth amendment in a civil case, thus risking a loss there, or answering
the questions in the civil context, thus risking subsequent criminal
prosecution. [Citations.]’” (quoting Brock v. Tolkow (E.D.N.Y. 1985) 109
F.R.D. 116, 119)).)
 
Defendants Alexander R. Baldwin III and
El Dorado Pictures, Inc. move for a renewed stay of this action pending
criminal proceedings in New Mexico against Defendant Baldwin. On January 4,
2024, the Court stayed this action against Baldwin and El Dorado because
Baldwin faced a possible criminal trial. On July 31, 2024, after two days of
trial, the New Mexico court dismissed the case against Baldwin with prejudice.
This Court then lifted the stay in this action, on August 16, 2024.
 
Defendants again move for a stay of
this action because the prosecutor in the criminal case is appealing the
dismissal. Defendants represent that on November 21,
2024 the special prosecutor
filed a notice of appeal of the New Mexico court’s orders dismissing the criminal
case against Baldwin and denying the special prosecutor’s motion for
reconsideration. Defendants
assert that a stay of the case in this Court is necessary to continue to
protect Baldwin’s Fifth Amendment rights. In opposition, Plaintiff asserts that
Plaintiff will be prejudiced by a delay in adjudicating this case. 
 
The filing of the notice of appeal shows that the criminal proceedings in
New Mexico may not have concluded. If the New Mexico Court of Appeals reverses the
trial court’s dismissal, the criminal case against Baldwin would be reinstated,
and Baldwin again would face the dilemma discussed in this Court’s January 4,
2024 order: 
 
Statements made by Baldwin in this case – at a deposition,
for example – could be used against him in the criminal proceedings;
conversely, asserting his Fifth Amendment right could be used against him in
this civil case. Either way, the prejudice to Baldwin could be extreme.
Protecting a party’s constitutional right is “paramount.” Pacers, Inc. v.
Sup. Ct. (1984) 162 Cal. App. 3d 686, 690; see also S.E.C. v. Nicholas
(C.D. Cal. 2008) 569 F. Supp. 2d 1065, 1070.
 
(1/4/24 Minute Order,
at 2.)
 
Under these circumstances. the Court finds that a renewed stay as to
moving Defendants is appropriate. The potential prejudice to moving Defendants
without a stay is high, and the potential prejudice to Plaintiff of a stay is
relatively low. 
 
Defendants’ motion for stay is GRANTED.
