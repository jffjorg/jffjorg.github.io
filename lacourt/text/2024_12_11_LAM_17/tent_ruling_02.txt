DARRYL WAYNE MOODY 
 
        
  vs.
 
CITY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF
  RECREATION & PARK
  


 Case
  No.:  24STCV21086
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 11, 2024




 
            Defendant’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED, WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. 
 
            On
8/20/2024, pro per Plaintiff Darryl Wayne Moody (Plaintiff) filed suit
against City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation & Park (Defendant). 
 
            On
10/30/2024, Defendant demurred to Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this claim, and that
Plaintiff’s allegations are insufficiently pled and uncertain. 
 
            After
review, the Court agrees.  
 
Although
Plaintiff’s Complaint does not identify any specific cause of action alleged
against the City, it appears from reviewing the Complaint that Plaintiff is
attempting to allege a cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of
public policy against the City.
 
Under the
Government Claims Act (Govt. Code § 810 et seq.), government entities cannot be
held liable under common law and judicially declared forms of liability. (Hoff
v. Vacaville Unified School District (1998) 19 Cal.4th 925, 932; Brown
v. Poway Unified School District (1993) 4 Cal.4th 820, 829.) California
public entities can only be held liable to the extent provided by statute.
 
Government
Code section 815(a) states: “Except as otherwise provided by statute [a] public
entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or
omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.”
(Emphasis added). The Legislative Committee Comment to this statute states: “In
the following portion of this division there are many sections providing for
the liability of governmental entities under specified conditions…But there is
no liability in the absence of a statute declaring such liability.” (Mikelesen
v. State of California (1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 621, 626.) Thus, a governmental
entity is not liable for injuries except as provided by statute. (Cf. Gates
v. Superior Court (1995, 2nd Dist.) 38 Cal.App.4th 481).
 
Plaintiff’s
cause of action for Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy is a
common law cause of action. (Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 167.) Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot pursue a common law claim of
wrongful termination in violation of public policy against the City. (Gov. Code
§ 815(a); Ross v. S.F. Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. (2007) 146
Cal.App.4th 1507, 1514.)
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is sustained, without
leave to amend. 
 
It is so ordered.
