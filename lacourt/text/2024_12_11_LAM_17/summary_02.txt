And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation & Park has successfully demurred to Darryl Wayne Moody's complaint, alleging wrongful termination in violation of public policy. The court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning Moody cannot pursue this claim against the City. The court's decision is based on the Government Claims Act, which states that government entities are not liable for injuries except as provided by statute. Specifically, Government Code section 815(a) states that a public entity is not liable for an injury, unless otherwise provided by statute. The court has concluded that Moody's claim is a common law cause of action, which is not permitted against a government entity.
