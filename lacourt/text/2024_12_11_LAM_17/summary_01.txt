The court finds that the service of summons on CT Corporation was defective because it was delivered by first-class mail without the required notice and return envelope, and CT Corporation is not named in the summons or complaint. Similarly, the court finds that the service of summons on Amanda Garcia was defective because it was delivered by first-class mail without the required notice and return envelope, and CT Corporation is not authorized to accept service on her behalf. Based on these findings, the court grants the motion to quash service of summons on both Defendant CT Corporation and Defendant Amanda Garcia.
