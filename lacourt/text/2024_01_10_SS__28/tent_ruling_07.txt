On

application. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court enter a default judgment against Defendant 7051 Sunset
Boulevard LLC. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
          On a request for default judgment,
“[w]here a cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs
to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon
entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the
complaint or, for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the
complaint, the amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
580, subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was
designed to insure fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co.
(1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that
“defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of
the judgments that may be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other
than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been
deprived of his day in court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’
’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards
damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or statement of
damages. (Id. at p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
has not dismissed or applied for a separate judgment against the Doe defendants.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7)
[party seeking default judgment must provide “A dismissal of all parties
against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment
against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported
by a showing of grounds for each judgment”].) 
Plaintiff
has not filled out Part 6 of the JUD-100 form, which asks for the amount of
damages sought. 
Plaintiff
submitted an outdated version of the CIV-100 form.  Plaintiff should use the current CIV-100 form,
which was revised on January 1, 2023.  In addition, Plaintiff must fill out the portion of the
form asking for the amount of the judgment he is seeking. 
Plaintiff
must submit a complete new default judgment packet. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the application for default judgment filed by Plaintiff Dajuan
Gross on September 5, 2023. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
