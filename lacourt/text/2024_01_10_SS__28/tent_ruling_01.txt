  Case Number:  20STCV22973    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers, the Court rules as
follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On
June 17, 2020, Plaintiff Rigoberto Caratachea (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Jesus Manuel Medina Garcia (“Defendant”) and Does 1-25 for
negligence. 
On
June 10, 2021, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to quash service of summons,
finding that service was not proper. 
On
June 22, 2022, the Court granted Defendant’s second motion to quash service of
summons, ruling that service must comply
with the requirements of the Hague Convention. 
On
January 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel informed the Court that counsel was
waiting for the Ministry of Mexico to serve the defendant. 
On
May 11, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s request for additional time to file
the proof of service of the summons and complaint based on Plaintiff’s counsel’s
statement that Plaintiff needed to serve Defendant via the Hague Convention. 
On
September 26, 2023, specially-appearing Defendant filed a motion to quash service
of the summons and complaint to be heard on January 10, 2024. On December 27,
2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition.  On
January 3, 2024, Defendant filed a reply. 
No
trial date is currently set. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS         
Defendant
requests that the Court quash service of the summons and complaint. 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
         Code
of Civil Procedure section 418.10, subdivision (a)(1), provides: 
“(a)  A defendant,
on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any further
time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of
motion for one or more of the following purposes: 
“(1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack
of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10.
subd. (a)(1).) 
A
motion made under section 418.10 does not constitute an appearance unless a
court denies the motion.  (See L. Edmon
& C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter
2023) ¶ 3:376, p. 3-116 [“If the motion is denied,
defendant is deemed to have made a general appearance – waiving any
jurisdictional objection – upon entry of the order denying the motion” (emphasis
omitted)].) 
“
‘Although a proper basis for personal jurisdiction exists and notice is given
in a manner which satisfied the constitutional requirements of due process,
service of summons is not effective and the court does not acquire jurisdiction
of the party unless the statutory requirements for service of summons are met.’
” (Engebretson & Co. v. Harrison (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 436, 443,
quoting Schering Corp. v. Superior Court (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 737, 741.) 
The
filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service
was proper “if the proof of service complies with the applicable statutory
requirements.” (Floveyor Internat., Ltd. v. Superior Court (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 789, 795 (Floveyor), quoting Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441-1442 (Dill).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
January 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service stating that Plaintiff’s
process server served the summons, complaint, and statement of damages on
Defendant by substitute service on January 17, 2023 at 139 Ocean Street, West
Covina, CA 91790.  According to the
process server’s declaration, the process server left the summons and complaint
with a female co-occupant. 
The proof
of service which Plaintiff filed on January 19, 2023 complies with the
applicable statutory requirements.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 417.10, subds. (a), (f).) 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s filing of the proof of service on January 19,
2023 created a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper.  (See Floveyor, supra, 59
Cal.App.4th at p. 795.) 
Defendant
has submitted a declaration from Karla Rodas (“Rodas”), who states the
following: Rodas owns the home at 139 Ocean Street, West Covina, CA 91790 and has resided
there since 2015.  Defendant has not resided
at 139 Ocean Street, West Covina, CA 91790 since 2015, Defendant does not receive
mail there, and Rodas does not know Defendant.  Rodas is unaware of any connection Defendant
may have to 139 Ocean Street, West Covina, CA 91790.  Rodas was not given any documents by a process
server and did not receive the summons and complaint in the mail. 
Defendant
also argues that he lives in Mexico and Plaintiff has previously represented to
the Court that service will be carried out in compliance with the Hague Convention. 
Plaintiff argues the motion is untimely under Code of Civil Procedure
section 418.10, Defendant has not rebutted the presumption of proper service, Defendant
has actual notice of the lawsuit, and service was proper. 
The
Court finds good cause to allow Defendant to file the motion to quash on September 26, 2023 based on Defendant’s counsel’s reasonable
reliance on Plaintiff’s counsel’s representation that Plaintiff was proceeding
with service under the Hague Convention. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a) [“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to
plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may
serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1)
To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court
over him or her”].) 
The
Court finds that Defendant has rebutted the presumption of proper service based
on the declaration of Karla Rodas.  
Defendant
is entitled to proper service whether or not he has actual knowledge of the
lawsuit. “ ‘In the absence of a voluntary
submission to the authority of the court, compliance with the statutes
governing service of process is essential to establish that court's personal
jurisdiction over a defendant. . . . When a defendant challenges that jurisdiction
by bringing a motion to quash, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service. . . .” (Floveyor, supra, 59 Cal.App.4th at p.
793, quoting Dill, supra, 24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1439-1440.) 
Plaintiff
argues service was proper because, according to Plaintiff, Defendant no longer
resides in Mexico.  Yet the only evidence
Plaintiff presents to support this assertion is a statement by the current
resident of Defendant’s former home that Defendant moved to Norwalk, California.
 The document containing this statement
does not explain the basis for the current resident’s supposed knowledge of
Defendant’s current residence. Indeed, the individual stated that since Defendant
sold him the house in July 2019, “I haven’t had any news on him since then.”  In the absence of any information showing the
current resident has personal knowledge of where Defendant lives, the Court
finds the statement does not carry Plaintiff’s burden of proving proper
service. 
Because
Plaintiff has not carried his burden of proving facts establishing effective
service, the Court grants the motion and quashes service of the summons. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Jesus Manuel Medina Garcia’s motion to quash service of
summons.  The Court quashes service of
the summons. 
The
Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proof of
Service of Summons and Complaint for March 12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department
28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
          Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
