And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The case was filed by Plaintiff Gerardo Becerra against Defendant Cesar Hernandez and Does 1-10 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The Defendant filed an answer and later filed a motion for terminating sanctions or, in the alternative, monetary sanctions. The Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.

The court notes that it has previously granted the Defendant's motions to compel Plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for inspection and production of documents. However, the Plaintiff has not complied with the court's orders.

The court finds that the Plaintiff's failure to comply with the discovery orders is willful and preceded by a history of abuse. The court concludes that a lesser sanction than dismissal would not result in the Plaintiff complying with his discovery obligations. Therefore, the court grants the motion for terminating sanctions and dismisses the Plaintiff's action with prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (d)(3).
