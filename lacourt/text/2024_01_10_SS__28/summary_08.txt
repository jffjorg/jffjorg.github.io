```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion for terminating sanctions brought by the defendant against Jose Gonzalez, one of the plaintiffs. The motion was filed on October 20, 2023, and the court had previously granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to discovery requests on August 7, 2023. Jose Gonzalez failed to comply with the court's order, and the defendant gave notice of this failure on March 24, 2023. The court found that, given Jose Gonzalez's history of not responding to discovery requests and failure to comply with the court's order, no lesser sanction than dismissal would result in compliance with discovery obligations. Therefore, the court grants the motion and dismisses Jose Gonzalez's action with prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (d)(3).
