 Case Number:  21STCV24142    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
reviewed the moving papers and status report, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
June 30, 2021, Plaintiff Claire Sabin (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Stephen Zino (“Zino”), Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”), and Does 1-50 for
negligence. 
On
January 12, 2023, Lyft filed an answer. 
On
June 23, 2023, the clerk entered Zino’s default. 
On
August 29, 2023, Lyft filed a motion to compel Plaintiff to provide further
responses to requests for admission, set one, and for sanctions. The hearing
was set for November 8, 2023 and later re-set for January 10, 2024. Plaintiff
has not filed an opposition. 
On
January 2, 2024, Lyft filed a report on the status of discovery responses. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for May 1, 2024. 
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
A.      Informal Discovery Conference 
The
Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts
Effective October 10, 2022 (filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub
Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery
until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Discovery.” 
The
parties participated in an IDC on December 1, 2023. 
B.       Timeliness
of motion 
A
notice of motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of
the service of the responses, or any supplemental responses, or on or before
any specific later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.290, subd, (c).) Failure to file a motion within this time period
constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses to requests for
admission. 
Lyft
filed the motion on August 29, 2023. 
Plaintiff does not dispute the motion’s timeliness. 
C.   Meet and
confer 
“A
motion to compel must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd.
(b)(2).)  “A meet and confer declaration
must state facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an informal resolution
of each issue presented by the motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
Lyft
has provided a meet and confer declaration. 
D.      Separate statement 
With
exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is
warranted.  
Lyft
has filed a separate statement. 
APPLICABLE LAW 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.290 provides: 
“(a) On receipt of a response to requests for
admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a
further response if that party deems that either or both of the following
apply: 
“(1) An answer to a particular request is evasive or
incomplete. 
“(2) An objection to a particular request is without
merit or too general. 
“(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or any specific later date to which the requesting party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the requesting party waives any right
to compel further response to the requests for admission. 
“(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. 
“(e) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
further response to requests for admission, the court may order that the
matters involved in the requests be deemed admitted. In lieu of, or in addition
to, this order, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
Motion
to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to requests for admission, set one, and
for sanctions 
Propounded:  May 23, 2023 Responses:   July
11, 2023 Further
responses:  December 26, 2023 Motion filed: August 29, 2023


Lyft
states that Plaintiff “serve[d] verified amended, Code-complaint responses,
without objection to Lyft’s Request for Admission, Set One on December 26,
2023. Therefore, the motion to compel further responses to requests for admission is moot. Lyft asks the Court to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010, subdivisions (e), (f), and (i), because “Plaintiff’s [earlier]
failure to serve Code-compliant responses necessitated filing this Motion to
Compel.”  (Status report p. 2.) 
Lyft asks the Court to grant $2,532.50.00 in sanctions
based on 11.5 hours of attorney time billed at $215 per hour and one $60 filing
fee.  However, Lyft has not identified a statute
that authorizes a sanctions award here. 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.290, subdivision (d), provides that “[t]he
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further response, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290.)  Plaintiff did not make or oppose a motion to
compel a further response to the requests for admission. 
Lyft
also relies on the statutory definition of misuse of the discovery process.  (Code Civ. Proc, §
2023.010.)  However, “[Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010 is] ‘definitional’ and monetary sanctions may not be
imposed based solely on [the statute]. 
Monetary sanctions may be imposed only if authorized by some other
provision of the Discovery Act.”  (L.
Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter
2023) ¶ 8:1900, p. 8M-2; see Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030 [court may impose
sanctions for misuse of the discovery process “[t]o the extent authorized by
the chapter governing any particular discovery method or other provision of
this title”].) 
Because
Lyft has not identified a statutory basis for sanctions, the Court denies the
request for monetary sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES as moot the motion of Defendant Lyft,
Inc. to compel further responses to requests for admission, set one. 
The Court DENIES Defendant Lyft, Inc.’s request for
sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
