Proc., § 1048, subd.  (a).)  California  Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a), provides:  “(a) Requirements of motion  “(1)  A notice  of motion to consolidate must:  “(A)  List all  named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names  of their respective attorneys of record;  “(B)  Contain  the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest  numbered case shown first; and  “(C)  Be filed  in each case sought to be consolidated.  “(2)  The motion  to consolidate:  “(A)  Is deemed  a single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but  memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in  the lowest numbered case;  “(B)  Must be  served on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the  cases sought to be consolidated; and  “(C)  Must have  a proof of service filed as part of the motion.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.350(a).)  Los  Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(g) provides: “(1) Cases may not be  consolidated unless they are in the same department. A motion to consolidate  two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in  different departments, have been related into a single department, or if the  cases were already assigned to that department. (2) Upon consolidation of  cases, the first filed case will be the lead case, unless otherwise ordered by  the court. After consolidation, all future papers to be filed in the  consolidated case must be filed only in the case designated as the lead case.  (3) Before consolidation of a limited case with an unlimited case, the limited  case must be reclassified as an unlimited case and the reclassification fee paid.”  DISCUSSION  O’Connell  has filed a motion to consolidate case numbers 22STCV11346 and 23CHCV01767.  O’Connell properly filed the motion in case  number 22STCV11346, the lowest numbered case.  (See Cal.
