Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Harout Broutian's motion for summary judgment. The case involves a negligence and premises liability claim brought by Plaintiff Larysa Kotandzhyan against Broutian, his family trust, and Albro, LLC. The Plaintiff alleges that she slipped and fell down a staircase at a collision center owned by Broutian due to a dangerous condition on the premises. Broutian argues that he did not control the premises and did not have notice of a dangerous condition. The Judge finds that Broutian has carried his initial burden on summary judgment, but the Plaintiff has raised triable issues of fact concerning control and constructive notice. The case will proceed to trial.
