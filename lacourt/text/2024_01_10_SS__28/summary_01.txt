And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Jesus Manuel Medina Garcia. The Plaintiff, Rigoberto Caratachea, filed the complaint on June 17, 2020, and the Defendant has been trying to quash service since then. The Court has previously granted two motions to quash service, finding that service was not proper. On January 11, 2023, Plaintiff's counsel informed the Court that they were waiting for the Ministry of Mexico to serve the Defendant. The Plaintiff filed a proof of service on January 19, 2023, stating that the summons and complaint were served on the Defendant by substitute service on January 17, 2023.

The Defendant argues that the service was not proper because the Defendant did not reside at the address where the summons and complaint were served and did not receive any documents. The Defendant also argues that they live in Mexico and that the Plaintiff has previously represented that service would be carried out in compliance with the Hague Convention.

The Court finds that the Defendant has rebutted the presumption of proper service based on the declaration of Karla Rodas, who states that she does not know the Defendant and that the Defendant does not receive mail at the address where the summons and complaint were served. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff has not carried its burden of proving facts establishing effective service. Therefore, the Court grants the motion and quashes service of the summons.
