**Kehinde Elemuren v. Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science**

**Tentative Decision on Petition for Writ of Mandamus:**

**Granted**

**Background:**

Petitioner Kehinde Elemuren, a student in the Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) program at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU), seeks a writ of administrative mandamus directing CDU to set aside his dismissal and reinstate him as a student.

**Statement of the Case:**

Elemuren commenced this proceeding on July 5, 2023, alleging causes of action for administrative mandamus and breach of contract. The verified petition alleges, in pertinent part:

* On July 26, 2020, Elemuren was scheduled to take the final examination for the NUR 645 PMHNP course.
* Due to technical difficulties, Elemuren was unable to take the exam during the designated window, but he was able to log in and take the exam at 10:52 a.m., leaving only eight minutes until the 11 a.m. cutoff.
* The exam was rescheduled for September 3, 2020, but Elemuren refused to take the exam, citing concerns about the study guide and extra credit.
* As a result, Elemuren received a failing grade in the course.

**Course of Proceedings:**

* On August 28, 2023, CDU filed and served an Answer.
* On October 3, 2023, CDU agreed that the Petition lies in administrative mandamus.

* Private universities are required to comply with the common law doctrine of fair procedure, which is similar to due process.

**Statement of Facts:**

1. Background:
	* Elemuren graduated from CDU with a degree in Family Nurse Practitioner in 2014.
