 Case Number:  23STCP03550    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  85 
James Samatas, et al. v. City of Los Angeles, et
al., 23STCP03550


Tentative decision on demurrer:
 overruled



 
            
Respondent City of Los Angeles (“City”) and Real Party-in-Interest
Tanager View LLC (“Tanager” or “Developer”) demur to the Petition filed by
Petitioners James Samatas (“Samatas”) and Steven Lintz (“Lintz”). 
The court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,
and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1. The Petition
            On
September 25, 2023, Petitioners Smatas and Lintz filed the verified Petition against
Respondents City, Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (“LADBS”), and the
Board of Building and Safety Commissioners (“BBSC”).  The Petition names Tanager and Berserker LLC
(“Beserker”) as Real Parties-in-Interest and alleges claims for mandamus and
declaratory relief.  The Petition alleges
in pertinent part as follows.
Petitioner Lintz is
the current owner of 1424 N. Tanager Way (“1424 Tanager”) which neighbors the
Property.  Pet., ¶5.  Lintz acquired 1424 Tanager from Petitioner
Samatas, who initiated a series of appeals against the Property based on
building height violations, as well as two prior lawsuits filed August 16, 2016
and March 29, 2018, respectively.  Pet.,
¶¶ 5, 16.  Lintz has provided Samatas
with a Special/Limited Power of Attorney in connection with the claims that are
the subject of this action.  Pet., ¶5. 
The parties’ dispute
concerns an abuse of discretion by Respondent LADBS in allowing
the construction of an over-height 14,000 square-foot residence
(“Project”) located at 1410 N.  Tanager
Way in the Hollywood Hills (“Property”) in contravention of the Project’s original
building permits.  Pet., ¶1.  A supplemental permit and a certificate of
occupancy were improperly issued.  Id.  The property is subject to Los Angeles
Municipal Code (“LAMC”) section 12.26.K. 
Pet., ¶5.  Respondent BBSC
violated the applicable 30-foot height limit despite Petitioners’ evidence that
Real Party Tanager illegally manipulated the Property’s topographical lines to
misrepresent the Project’s height so that an illegal structure was built.   Pet., ¶¶ 1, 8.  Petitioners challenge LADBS’ actions allowing
the Project to be constructed in violation of applicable height limits and the
Project’s original building permits, including LADBS’ initial denial of
Petitioners’ appeal and the BBSC’s subsequent denial of appeal and request for
reconsideration.  Pet., ¶4.
 
a.
May 2018 Building Permits
In connection with
the replacement of the Property’s existing residence of less than 3,000 square feet,
LADBS issued permits under the 2011 Hillside Ordinance (“Hillside Ordinance”) for
the grading and construction of an approximately 13,471-square-foot
residence.  Pet., ¶13.  The Hillside Ordinance, codified at LAMC section
12.21.C.10(d)(2), allows a project to exceed the maximum envelope height only
with Zoning Administrator (“ZA”) approval. Pet., ¶34.  At the time, the Project’s building permits
showed a new 30-foot structure that would be built in compliance with the
applicable height limit.  Pet., ¶1. 
 
b. May 2018
Appeal to LADBS
In May 2018, when it
became apparent that the Project’s construction violated the 30-foot height
noted on the plans, Petitioner Samatas appealed to LADBS.  Pet., ¶15. 
LADBS agreed with his appeal that the Project was over-height and
accordingly refunded Petitioner’s appeal fee. 
Id.  LADBS did not require
the over-height construction to be demolished. 
Id. 
 
c. Supplemental
Permit
In October 2018,
after Developer exerted its influence with the City, Petitioner learned that LADBS
had issued a supplemental permit for a new, fictional height limit of 36
feet which violates the zoning code and allowed the as-built structure that
exists today.  Pet., ¶15.
Given that the
original plans used the 30-foot height limit permitted by the zoning code,
Petitioner Samatas filed appeals from the building permits pursuant to LAMC section
12.26.K.  Pet., ¶15.  LADBS denied the appeals and forced an appeal
of that determination to the ZA.  Id.  Despite the fact that the structure already
exceeded 30 feet, Planning stated it was too early to determine whether the
residence would violate the LAMC’s height limit upon completion.  Id. 
LADBS advised that it would measure the height of the Project after the
building was completely constructed but before a certificate of occupancy was
issued.  The ZA did not take action on
the appeal for years and ultimately terminated the appeal without prejudice on
June 3, 2022 with an invitation to file a new appeal at a subsequent time.  Id. 
This decision resulted in approximately a three-year delay.  Id. 
 
d.
Post-Completion Appeal of Building Permits
  After the Project was completed, a licensed
surveyor, Neil Hansen ((“Hansen”) of N.C. Hansen, Inc., was retained and
surveyed the as-built height of the Project and issued a report dated June 30,
2022 (“Hansen Report”).  Pet., ¶17, Ex.
B.  The Hansen Report concluded that the
Project significantly exceeds the 30-foot maximum envelope height permitted by the
City’s Hillside Ordinance.  Pet.,
¶18.
On
August 1, 2022, Petitioner Samatas filed an appeal from the Property’s building
permits pursuant to LAMC section 12.26.K on the grounds that LADBS abused its
discretion in allowing the construction of a single-family dwelling that
exceeded the maximum building envelope height required for buildings in the
Hillside Area in contravention of LAMC section 12.21.C.10(d)(1) of the Hillside
Ordinance.  Pet., ¶19, Exs. A, C.  On December 5, 2022, LADBS summarily denied
the building permit appeal. Pet., ¶22, Ex. F. 

LADBS informed
Petitioner Samatas that the appeal would be forwarded to the BBSC for a
determination instead of forwarding the appeal to a ZA and the Planning
Commission as required under LAMC section 12.26.K.  Pet., ¶¶ 23, 26.  By doing so, LADBS did not have to prepare a written
report with findings as required by the LAMC. 
Id.  
The appeal was set on
BBSC’s August 22, 2023 agenda.  Pet.
¶24.   On August 21, 2023, Petitioners’
counsel submitted a letter to the BBSC which outlined why it lacked
jurisdiction and that the appeal should be heard by the Director of the
Department of Planning (“Planning”). 
Pet., ¶25, Ex. G. 
Despite not having
the authority to do so pursuant to LAMC section 98.0403.1(b)(2), the BBSC heard
Petitioners appeal.  Pet. ¶ 26.  On August 24, 2023, the BBSC issued its Final
Action letter which denied Petitioners’ appeal, affirming LADBS’ prior denial
of the building permit appeal.  Pet. ¶27,
Ex. H.  The denial was substantively
based on testimony by LADBS employee Victor Cuevas (“Cuevas”) that he visited
the Property and performed a measurement by “dropping a tape measure.”  Id.  Cuevas’ tape measure effort would not
accurately measure height because there is a large balcony below the roof and extending
east for a significant distance.  Id.  Measurement of height under the Hillside
Ordinance also is based off natural grade, which Cuevas would not have been
able to identify by dropping a tape measure. 
It further is based on a point five feet from the building.  Id. 
Neither Petitioners’ counsel nor Hansen were permitted to respond to
Cuevas’ testimony.  Id.  
 
e. Request for
Reconsideration
On August 25, 2023,
Petitioners’ counsel filed a Request for Reconsideration from the BBSC’s Final
Action letter pursuant to LAMC section 98.0312. 
Pet. ¶ Ex. I.  On September 19,
2023, the hearing on the request for reconsideration took place.  None of the Commissioners addressed any of
the points in Petitioners’ counsel’s August 25, 2023 letter regarding the
impossibility of measuring techniques. 
Pet. ¶29. 
On September 21,
2023, the BBSC issued a Final Action letter denying Petitioners’ Request for
Reconsideration. Pet. ¶29, Ex. J. 
            Petitioners
seek (1) a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1085,
or in the alternative, CCP section 1094.5 (a) directing LADBS to set aside the building
permits, (b) directing the BBSC to set aside its Final Action letter, and (c)
ordering that all construction exceeding maximum envelope height be demolished.  Petitioners also seek (a) temporary and
preliminary injunctive relief prohibiting the issuance of additional building
permits for the Project that violate the maximum envelope height, (b) a
declaration that the Project is over-height and that the BBSC did not properly
hear the appeal of the building permits because they should have been heard by
the ZA and then the Planning Commission. 
Petitioners further seek attorney’s fees and costs.  
 
2. Course of Proceedings
            On
December 11, 2023, the court partially granted Petitioners ex parte application
to authorize service of process on Beserker through the Secretary of State
and/or by publication.
            On
December 12, 2023, the court found that the instant case is related to cases
BS164400, BS173012, and 23STCP03550 within the meaning of California Rules of
Court Rule 3.300(a).  For good cause
shown, said cases were assigned to Department 85 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse and
all hearings in Department 82 were vacated. 
 
B. Applicable Law
            Demurrers
are permitted in administrative mandate proceedings.  CCP §§1108, 1109.  A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the
pleading alone and will be sustained where the pleading is defective on its
face.
            Where
pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer or
motion to strike or by motion for judgment on the pleadings.  CCP §430.30(a); Coyne v. Krempels,
(1950) 36 Cal.2d 257.  The party against
whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object by demurrer or
answer to the pleading.  CCP §430.10.  A demurrer is timely filed within the 30-day
period after service of the complaint. 
CCP § 430.40; Skrbina v. Fleming Companies, (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th
1353, 1364.
            A
demurrer may be asserted on any one or more of the following grounds: (a) The
court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the
pleading; (b) The person who filed the pleading does not have legal capacity to
sue; (c) There is another action pending between the same parties on the same
cause of action; (d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties; (e) The
pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; (f)
The pleading is uncertain (“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible);
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the
pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is implied by conduct;
(h) No certificate was filed as required by CCP §411.35 or (i) by §411.36.  CCP §430.10. 
Accordingly, a demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the
grounds for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from
judicially noticeable matters.  CCP
§430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan, (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.  The face of the pleading includes attachments
and incorporations by reference (Frantz v. Blackwell, (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94); it does not include inadmissible hearsay.  Day v. Sharp, (1975) 50 Cal.App.3d
904, 914.  
            The
sole issue on demurrer for failure to state a cause of action is whether the
facts pleaded, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to relief.  Garcetti v. Superior Court, (1996) 49
Cal.App.4th 1533, 1547; Limandri v. Judkins, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326,
339.  The question of plaintiff’s ability
to prove the allegations of the complaint or the possible difficulty in making
such proof does not concern the reviewing court.  Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty
Co., (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 47.  The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.  Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher,
(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403. 
Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations expressing mere
conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits to the
complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.  Vance v. Villa Park Mobilehome Estates,
(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.
            For
all demurrers filed after January 1, 2016, the demurring party must meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
CCP §430.31(a).  As part of the
meet and confer process, the demurring party must identify all of the specific
causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and provide legal
support for the claimed deficiencies.  CCP §430.31(a)(1).  The party who filed the pleading must in turn
provide legal support for its position that the pleading is legally sufficient
or, in the alternative, how the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer could be
amended to cure any legal insufficiency. 
Id.  The demurring party is
responsible for filing and serving a declaration that the meet and confer
requirement has been met.  CCP
§430.31(a)(3).

(Y). pages AR 485-549 from the administrative record in Samatas
I; and 
(Z). Samatas’ opening brief in Samatas I, dated May
24, 2017. 
Petitioners object to these requests for judicial notice on
several grounds.  As a threshold matter,
Petitioners object to the City’s and Developer’s failure to cite the Petition’s
allegations in the demurrer in favor of the exhibits subject to judicial
notice.  Obj. at 2.   This is not a proper ground for
objection.  If an exhibit is subject to
judicial notice, it may be relied upon in a demurrer.  CCP §430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan, supra,
39 Cal.3d at 318.  
Petitioners also object that the City seeks to rely on
the truth of the matters stated in judicially noticed exhibits.   This is true to a point.  The court may not
take judicial notice of the truth of the findings in a court document.  Sosinsky v. Grant, (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th
1548, 1551.  Similarly, judicial
notice of official acts of a government agency does not mean that the court may
accept the truth of factual matters in the document since it is the existence
of the contents, not their truth, which is subject to judicial notice.  Cruz v. County of Los Angeles, (1985)
173 Cal.App.3d 1131, 1134.  Nor may the
court judicially notice the proper interpretation of a disputed document.  Herrera, supra, 196 Cal.App.4th at 1375.
However, a court may properly judicially notice both
recorded documents and the facts arising from the legal effect of those
documents.  Fontenot v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., (“Fontenot”) (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 266 (facts that a party is an assignee or trustee in judicially
noticed document is proper).  See also JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (2013)
214 Cal.App.4th 743, 755 (“…court may take judicial notice of the fact of a
document's recordation, the date the document was recorded and executed, the
parties to the transaction reflected in a recorded document, and the document's
legally operative language, assuming there is no genuine dispute regarding the
document's authenticity. From this, the court may deduce and rely upon the
legal effect of the recorded document, when that effect is clear from its
face.”).  
In
sum, when a court judicially notices a court record or an agency document, it
may judicially notice the operative facts which flow from the document’s
existence.  So, a court order or judgment
can be judicially noticed for its existence and for the truth of the results
reached, but not the truth of hearsay contained in the record.  People v. Harbot, (1997) 61 Cal.App.4th
123, 127.  Additionally, statements of
independent legal significance are not hearsay. 
Am-Cal Investment Co. v. Sharlyn Estates, Inc., (1967) 255
Cal.App.2d 526, 528.  Petitioners fail to
point to any specific exhibit for which the City’s demurrer improperly relies
on the truth of its contents and this objection is overruled.
Petitioners further object that Exhibits W and X are
irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. 
Exhibit W is a City Lobbying Firm Registration Form and Exhibit X is a
docket from the U.S. Bankruptcy court. 
Obj. at 3.  These exhibits are
relevant to the demurrer’s standing arguments and Petitioners’ relevance
objections are overruled.
Finally, Petitioners object that Exhibit K is not properly
subject to judicial notice because it consists of City emails.  Obj. at 3. 
These emails are not official City documents and the objection is
sustained.  As Petitioners fail to make
any other specific objections, Exhibits A-Z are judicially noticed except
Exhibit K.  Evid. Code §§ 452(c), (d).
 
D. Analysis
            Respondent City
and Real Party Tanager demur to the Petition on the grounds that (1) it is
barred by the statute of limitations because Petitioners failed to serve Beserker
within the 90-day limitations period of Government Code[1]
section 65009(c), (2) the Petition is barred by Petitioners’ failure to timely
challenge the City’s decision on Samatas’ appeal filed on January 9, 2019 and
denied  by Planning on June 3, 2019 (“First
Height Appeal”), (3) Petitioner Samatas lacks standing and Petitioner Lintz
failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and (4) the Petition is barred
by res judicata.
 
            1. The Meet-and-Confer
            On
February 2, 2024, counsel for (1) Respondent City (Deputy City Attorney
Jennifer Tobkin); (2) Real Party Tanager (Attorney Daniel Freedman); and (3)
Petitioners James Samatas and Steven Lintz (Attorneys Victor De La Cruz and
Viral Methta) met via a zoom video conference to discuss the potential demurrer.[2]  Freedman Decl.  After conferring, the parties were not able
to reach an agreement on the legal issues discussed.  Id.   
The City and Developer have satisfied their meet and confer obligation under CCP section 430.41.
 
2. Statute of
Limitations
a. Section 65009(c)(1)’s 90-Day Period for Service 
Except as inapplicable, no action or proceeding shall be
maintained to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul any decision on the
matters listed in sections 65901 and 65903, or to determine the reasonableness,
legality, or validity of any condition attached to a variance, conditional use
permit, or any other permit “unless the action or proceeding is commenced and
services is made on the legislative body within 90 days after the legislative
body’s decision.” §65009(c)(1)(E).  Section
65009(a)(3) provides in part that “[t]he purpose of this section is to provide
certainty for property owners and local governments regarding decisions made
pursuant to this division.” 
The legislative intent for this provision “is to establish a
short limitations period in order to give governmental zoning decisions
certainty, permitting them to take effect quickly and giving property owners
the necessary confidence to proceed with approved projects.”  Wagner v. City of South Pasadena,
(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 943, 948-49. 
Strict compliance with the limitations period is required.  Id., at 950; see §65009(e).  This short limitation period serves the
important legislative purpose of permitting the rapid resolution of legal
challenges to local land use decisions and to provide “certainty” to local
agencies and property owners alike.  Honig v. San Francisco Planning Dept., (“Honig”)
(2005) 127 Cal. App. 4th 520, 528. The intent is for permit decisions to take
effect quickly and give property owners the confidence to proceed with approved
projects.  Wagner v. City of S. Pasadena, (2000) 78
Cal. App. 4th 943, 948–49. 
To avoid keeping projects in “a state of perpetual limbo,” a
challenger must file and serve the action within 90 days of the challenged
decision.  1305 Ingraham, LLC v. City
of Los Angeles, (“1305 Ingraham”) (2019) 32 Cal. App. 5th 1253, 1262-63.
The term “legislative body” is interpreted broadly to include decisions by City
zoning administrator, director, and/or boards of appeals.  Id. at 1263-65.  After expiration of the statute of
limitations, “all persons are barred from any further action or proceeding”,
and there are no exceptions.  Travis v. County of Santa Cruz, (2004) 33
Cal. 4th 757, 768.   A demurrer is properly sustained on statute of limitations
grounds when the pleading discloses on its face, or on facts subject to
judicial notice, that it is barred by the applicable statute of
limitations.  Honig v. San Francisco
Planning Department, (“Honig”) (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th
520, 524.
Even if a petition is timely filed, the petition must be
dismissed if it is not timely served.  Wagner v. City of South Pasadena, supra,
78 Cal. App. 4th at 948-51.  The
service deadline is important to achieving the statutory objectives because
“[r]equiring an aggrieved citizen to file an action within 90 days but
permitting him or her to withhold service for months or even years would
effectively suspend the effective date of local land use and development
decisions and leave such matters at the mercy of the complainant.” Honig, supra, 127 Cal. App. 4th at
526 (citation omitted). 
Additionally, CCP section 389(a) provides for the compulsory
joinder of necessary parties and CCP section 389(b) provides for the dismissal
of the action if a necessary party is also indispensable and cannot be joined.[3]  Failure to join an indispensable party is not
a jurisdictional defect in the fundamental sense of jurisdiction.  The court has the power to render a decision
as to the parties before it in the absence of an indispensable party.  It is for reasons of equity and convenience
only that a court will not proceed with a case where it determines that an
indispensable party is absent and cannot be joined.  Save Our Bay, Inc. v. San Diego Unified
Port District, (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 686, 693.         The
controlling test for whether a necessary party is also indispensable under CCP
section 389(b) is whether “the plaintiff seeks some type of affirmative relief
which, if granted, would injure or affect the interest of a third person not
joined.  Id. at 692.
The City and Developer argue that Berserker currently owns
the Property, and the relief sought in this action would impair its ability to
protect its interests.  See RNJ, Ex. A.  They contend that Berserker is an
indispensable party that Petitioners were required to serve within the 90-day
limitations period.  The BBSC issued its
Final Action Letter on August 24, 2023, and stamped it “Action by the [BBSC] on
August 22, 2023.” Pet., ¶27.  Thus, to be timely, any challenge to the
decision must have been filed and served on all necessary parties by
November 20, 2023.  Berserker was served
on December 12, 2023, 112 days after the BBSC’s August 24, 2023 decision.  RJN Ex.
T.  Therefore, the lawsuit is time-barred
because Petitioners failed to serve indispensable Real Party Berserker within
the 90-day limitation period.  Dem. at
16.
The City and Developer rely on Templeton Action Committee v. Cnty. of San
Luis Obispo, (“Templeton”) (2014) 228 Cal. App. 4th 427, 431-32. In Templeton, the governing statute, section 66499.37, required that an action or
proceeding to set aside the decision of an appeal board or legislative body
concerning a subdivision shall not be maintained unless the action or
proceeding is commenced, and service of summons effected, within 90 days after
the date of decision.  Id. at 429.  The petitioner timely filed a petition and
served the respondent agency, but failed to timely join a developer whose
rights could have been affected by the action.  Id.
The court held that the developer was an indispensable party and ordered
dismissal of the case for failure to serve an indispensable party within the 90-day
statutory period.  Id. See also, Sierra Club, Inc. v. Cal. Coastal Comm’n, (“Sierra
Club”) (1979) 95 Cal. App. 3d 495, 499-505; County of Imperial v. Sup. Ct., (“County
of Imperial”) (2007) 152 Cal. App. 4th 13, 40.  Dem. at 15-16.
Petitioners do not dispute that Beserker is an indispensable
party, and it is.  See Beresford
Neighborhood Assn. v. City of San Mateo, (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180,
1188 (where plaintiff seeks to set aside developer’s permit, developer
is indispensable party).  Petitioners argue
that the City and Developer gloss over the language in section 65009(c)(1), which expressly provides
for dismissal “unless the action or proceeding is commenced and service is
made on the legislative body within 90 days after the legislative body’s
decision…” (emphasis added).  The statute
refers to service on the legislative body only. 
Nowhere in the statute did the Legislature require service on a real
party-in-interest in the 90-day period.  The
Legislature could have easily written the statute to include service on real
parties and elected not to do so.  
Petitioners note that a court
first looks to the plain language of the statute in interpreting at statute.  When the language is clear and unambiguous,
there is no need for further construction. 
Wells Fargo Bank v. Goldzband,
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 596, 614.  To
interpret section 65009(c)(1) any
differently would be to ignore its express language and lead to unintended and
perverse consequences.  Any developer who
obtained a permit that would result in illegal development could get away
scot-free so long as the developer evaded service of process for 90 days.  The Legislature did not create such an easy
loophole.  Opp. at 8.
Petitioners argue that Templeton, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at
431-32 is factually inapposite because the governing statute in that case was section
66499.37, not section 65009(c)(1).  Unlike section
65009(c)(1), section 66499.37 contains no express limitation for service on the
“legislative body.”  Additionally, both Sierra Club, supra, 95
Cal.App.3d at 495 (developer was indispensable party to permit challenge under
the Coastal Act), and County of
Imperial, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at 13 (water districts were indispensable
parties to county’s challenge to state water board’s approval of water transfer
agreement), are distinguishable because the petitioner sought to amend the
pleading to add the indispensable party after the statute of limitations had
run and neither case involved a legal challenge governed by section 65009(c)(1).  Petitioners add that a case cited by the City
and Developer, Salmon Protection &
Watershed Network v. County of Marin, (“SPAWN”) (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 195, 208, actually undercuts their argument because the court
stated the law clearly: “The 90-day time limit in Government Code section 65009, subdivision
(c)(1)(A) requires service of a complaint only on “’the legislative body’….”  (emphasis added).  Opp. at 9.
Petitioners make a substantial
argument about section 65009(c)(1)’s plain meaning.  It expressly provides for dismissal unless service
is made on the legislative body within 90 days after the legislative body’s
decision and does not make any reference to real parties.  This is distinct from section 66499.37, which
concerns subdivisions and refers to service of summons within 90 days after the
date of decision without reference to service on the legislative body.  In interpreting a statute, the court first
looks to the language of the statute, attempting to give effect to the usual,
ordinary import of the language and seeking to avoid making any language mere
surplusage.  Brown v. Kelly
Broadcasting Co., (1989) 48 Cal 3d 711, 724.  “’The
statute's words generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative
intent; if they are clear and unambiguous, ‘[t]here is no need for judicial
construction and a court may not indulge in it. [Citation.]’” MCI
Communications Services, Inc. v. California Dept. of Tax & Fee
Administration, (“MCI”) (2018) 28 Cal. App. 5th 635, 643.
However, in construing a
statute, the court always must ascertain the intent of the Legislature to
effectuate the purpose of the law.  Brown
v. Kelly Broadcasting Co., (1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724.  Additionally, where
ambiguity remains, the court should consider “reason, practicality, and common
sense.”  This requires consideration of
the statute’s purpose, the evils to be remedied, public policy, and
contemporaneous administrative construction. 
MCI, supra, 28
Cal.App.5th at 643.  The
enactment must be given a reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent
with the apparent purpose and intent of the lawmakers, practical rather than
technical in nature, and which, when applied, will result in wise policy rather
than mischief or absurdity.  Lungren
v. Deukmejian, (1988) 45 Cal. 3d 727, 735.
Petitioners’
argument ignores the fact that there must be some statute of limitations for
naming and serving a real party developer that is indispensable to a permit challenge.  The only viable limitations period besides the
90-day period in section 65009(c)(1) is the three-year period of CCP section
338(a) for action on liability created by statute.  Yet, a three-year limitation period would be
directly contrary to the purpose of section 65009.  As the City and Developer argue (Reply at 3),
the short limitations period in section 65009(a) was adopted by the Legislature
to (i) “reduce delays and restraints upon expeditiously completing housing
projects…” (ii) avoid a “chilling effect on the confidence with which property
owners and local governments can proceed with projects…” and, (iii) provide
certainty for property owners and local governments.” (emphases added).
“The clear legislative intent of this statute is to establish a short
limitations period in order to give governmental zoning decisions certainty,
permitting them to take effect quickly and giving property owners the
necessary confidence to proceed with approved projects.” Ching v. San
Francisco Bd. of Permit Appeals, (1988) 60 Cal.App.4th 888, 893 (emphasis
added).  
Thus,
the express intent of section 65009 is to bring cases to a speedy resolution
for local agencies and property owners alike. The only interpretation of
section 65009(c)(1) that effectuates this purpose is to require service on real
parties in addition to “service…on the legislative body”.  This interpretation does not rewrite or do
violence to the plain language of section 65009(c)(1) because real parties are
not respondents; they are interested parties who must be added under CCP
section 389.  It makes sense, therefore,
that section 65009(c)(1) would not address them directly and that its 90-day
period should apply to them as a matter of consequence.
Berserker
is an indispensable party and Petitioners were required to serve it within the 90-day
period of section 65009(c)(1).  
 
b.
Accrual for Service on Berserker
Petitioners argue that, even if
the City and Developer are correct that the 90-day period applies to service of
the Petition on Berserker, they are wrong in stating that the statute of
limitation deadline was November 20, 2023. 
The Petition does allege that the BBSC issued its denial letter on
August 24, 2023.  Pet., ¶27. 
But the City and Developer ignore the fact that the Petition and the
August 24 letter itself, which set forth a reconsideration process pursuant to
LAMC section 98.0312.  Pet., ¶27, Ex. H,
p. 130.  Pursuant to that process, there
was a reconsideration hearing and a new BBSC Final Action letter issued on
September 21, 2023.   See Pet., ¶¶ 28-29, Exs. I-J.  Petitioners’ service of Berserker on December
12, 2023 occurred within 90 days of September 21, 2023.[4]   See Opp. at 10.[5]
The City and Developer reply
that Petitioners cite no law that a request for reconsideration would impact
the finality of the BBSC’s August 24, 2023 decision.  If Petitioners were seeking to challenge the
BBSC’s denial of reconsideration, then perhaps Petitioners would have a point.  But the BBSC’s refusal to grant
reconsideration is not at issue.  The
case law does not support Petitioners’ view that a request for reconsideration
somehow tolls the statute of limitations of an agency’s final decision. In fact,
the court in Saint Francis Mem’l Hosp. v. State Dep’t of Pub. Health, (“Saint
Francis”) (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 965, 982, refused to recognize tolling in
similar circumstances.  (request for
reconsideration did not constitute timely pursuit of an available remedy since
reconsideration was unavailable; statute of limitations was therefore not
tolled).  Reply at 4-5.
In Saint Francis, a
hospital petitioned for administrative mandamus from a fine imposed by the
State Department of Health.  59
Cal.App.5th at 968.  The petition was
untimely under the 30-day limitations period of section 11523.  Id. at 969.  The hospital had served a request for
reconsideration pursuant to section 11518.5, which was the wrong statute.  Id. at 970.  Section 11518.5 applies only when a party
seeks to correct a mistake or clerical error, but the hospital sought to change
the decision’s outcome.  Id.  The correct statute for seeking reconsideration
was section 11521, which allows an agency to order reconsideration within 30
days after the decision is mailed to the respondent.  Id. 
However, the power to reconsider under section 11521 lies only until the
effective date of the decision.  Id.
at 976.  When an agency makes a decision
effective immediately, as the Department did, the 30-day period is eliminated
for reconsideration and section 11523’s 30-day period for filing a mandamus
petition begins.  Id. at 970, 975.
Upon review, the California
Supreme Court directed the Saint Francis appellate court to consider
whether equitable tolling should apply to the hospital’s failed effort.  Id. at 972-73.  The appellate court did so and concluded that
the hospital could not show the requisite element of reasonable and good faith
conduct.  While the hospital’s counsel
acted in good faith (id. at 969), counsel’s conduct was not
reasonable because, under either of sections 11518.5 and 11521, the power to
reconsider ended on the effective date of the decision and the 30-day clock
under section 11523 began.  Id. at
973.
It is clear from Saint
Francis that whether the 90-day period in section 65009(c)(1) was tolled
while Petitioners sought reconsideration is dependent on the wording of the
operative statute.  Section 65009(c)(1)
states that the action must be commenced “within 90 days after the legislative
body’s decision.”  It does not refer to a
reconsideration process.  Petitioners rely
on LAMC section 98.0312, which provides that the BBSC may order reconsideration
upon petition of any party, and the power to do so shall expire five days after
the effective date of the decision. 
Petitioners timely filed their reconsideration request on August 25, the
reconsideration hearing occurred on September 19, and the BBSC’s denial was
issued on September 21, 2023.  Pet., ¶¶
28-29.  This reconsideration process pursuant
to ordinance should be construed in harmony with section 65009(c)(1) to extend
the date of the legislative body’s decision to the date of its final
decision.  The BBSC’s decision was not
final until September 21, 2023.  Petitioners
timely served Berserker.
 
3. Petitioners’
Failure to Timely Challenge the First Height Appeal
The City and Developer argue that Samatas
challenged the building permits on the same grounds as in this lawsuit in his
May 4, 2018 letter to LADBS, and then in his First Height Appeal filed on
January 9, 2019.  RJN Exs. J, M.  LADBS denied the First Height Appeal on April
3, 2019 when it found that the building permits were not issued in error and
that: (i) the Project does not exceed the maximum allowable envelope height;
(ii) does not exceed the maximum allowable overall height; (iii) the sloped
roofs are not “ornamental structures;” (iv) the as-built structure does not
exceed the maximum envelope height; and (v) the as-built construction does not
exceed any maximum allowable overall building height.  RJN Ex.
N.  
Samatas appealed that decision to
Planning on April 17, 2019.  RJN Ex. O.  On June 3, 2022, Planning terminated the
appeal, stating that “[b]ased on the appeal application and [its] contents
[..], [Planning] is rejecting the application based on the Court of Appeal
ruling in Samatas v. City of Los
Angeles, No. B293811, 2019 WL 5558069 (Cal. Ct. App. Oct. 29, 2019)” (the
“Termination Notice”).  Pet., ¶15; RJN, Ex. P.  The City’s action denying the First Height
Appeal was final on June 3, 2022.  Under
section 65009(c)(1), Petitioners were required to challenge that decision
within 90 days, or by August 31, 2022, and they did not do so.  Dem. at 16.
The City and Developer anticipate
that Petitioners may argue that this lawsuit is timely because Samatas re-filed
the appeal on August 1, 2022 (“Second Height Appeal”), and that the limitation
period runs from the BBSC’s decision on the Second Height Appeal as opposed to
the Termination Notice.  This argument is
wrong. The August 1, 2023 staff report issued for the August 22, 2023 BBSC hearing
on the Second Height Appeal stated that the BBSC would not consider any issues
that were not within the BBSC’s jurisdiction and/or were previously denied.  The staff report explained that, while Samatas
“filed this as a zoning code appeal[,]… the primary issue […] pertains to the
measurement of the as-built height… which is done by the LADBS Inspection
Bureau….”, and all other issues “are not within the [BBSC’s] purview.”  RJN Ex. U, p.5. Accordingly, the only issue heard by the BBSC
in the Second Height Appeal concerned the Inspection Bureau’s confirmation
of the Project’s as-built height.  The
issue of whether the building permits were issued in error or in violation of
the LAMC—the subject matter of this
action—was not before the BBSC.  Dem. at
16-17.
Moreover, the Petition’s claim that
the Termination Notice was issued “without prejudice… with an invitation to
file a new appeal” does not save the Petition’s untimeliness.  Pet., ¶15.  The City’s appeal procedures unambiguously
state that the BBSC has no authority to hear appeals on matters implicating the
zoning code or other land use ordinances.  LAMC
§98.0403.1(b) (BBSC “shall have no authority to hear and determine appeals from
orders… determinations, or actions…pertaining to enforcement of specific ordinances,
regulations, or laws contained in Chapter
I of this code and in other land use ordinances.”) (RJN Ex V).  Rather, appeals concerning an interpretation
of the zoning code are heard by the Director of Planning. LAMC 12.26.K.  The Second Height Appeal concerned the enforcement
and application of the zoning code and the Hillside
Ordinance, issues which were not legally before the BBSC.  See Pet.,
¶19 (explaining that the August 1, 2022 appeal concerns maximum building
envelope height required by the 2011
Hillside Ordinance).  Those claims were
required to be heard by the Director of Planning under LAMC section 12.26(K).  Dem. at 17.
Thus, even if it is true that the
Termination Notice permitted Petitioners to re-file the same appeal—and the
City and Developer disagree — Petitioners failed to do so.  This action is barred by Petitioners’ failure
to exhaust their administrative remedies – i.e., refile the appeal with
the Director of Planning.  As Petitioners
failed to file a lawsuit within 90 days of the issuance of the Termination
Notice, and as the claims raised in this lawsuit are duplicative of the claims
at issue in the First Height Appeal, this lawsuit is time-barred.  Whether the Termination Notice was final or
not, the action is barred.  Dem. at
17-18.
Petitioners respond that the
City and Developer ignore the express allegations in the Petition, which must
be accepted as true.  The Petition
expressly alleges that LADBS’ position for the First Height Appeal was that it
would not take up the issue until “after the building was completely
constructed but before a certificate of occupancy was issued.”  Pet.,
¶15 (emphasis in original).  The Petition
makes clear that Petitioners did not want a three-year delay and sought
resolution by LADBS earlier.  But it was LABDS
that improperly deferred the issue. 
Moreover, Planning’s June 3, 2022 Termination Notice expressly states:
“In the event that you wish to pursue this matter in the future, it will be
necessary for you to file a new application and pay the required fees.  The present termination, however, will not
adversely prejudice consideration of your new application….” (emphasis added).  Opp. at 10-11.
That is precisely the process
that Petitioners followed for the Second Height Appeal, filed on August 1, 2022
after the Project was completed.  These allegations in the Petition cannot
simply be ignored on demurrer.  Given
that Petitioners objected to the BBSC’s jurisdiction and were forced into the
farcical BBSC process discussed in the Petition, the demurrer is quite rich in arguing that Petitioners cannot
rely on the August 1, 2022 Second Height Appeal for
statute of limitation purposes because such an appeal should be heard by the
Director of Planning.  See, e.g., Pet., ¶¶ 2, 25-26, 31, 70, Ex.
G.  Petitioners alerted the City to the
fact that the Director of Planning had the appropriate jurisdiction, but the City ignored them to avoid hearing
the merits of Petitioners’ appeal and insulate LABDS’ decisions.  Id.  Now, the City and Developer not only admit
wrongdoing -- i.e., that the Director of Planning had the appropriate
jurisdiction -- they rely on that wrongdoing to prevent Petitioners from a mandamus
hearing on their claims.  The City’s improper
processing of the appeals cannot be a basis to bar the Petition.  Opp. at 11.
The City and Developer reply
that the Termination Notice’s proviso that “[i]n the event that you wish to
pursue this matter in the future, it will be necessary for you to file a new
application [and the] present termination [] will not adversely prejudice
consideration of your new application….” does not save Petitioners’ case.  This language at the bottom of the
Termination Notice concerning the filing of a future appeal does not negate the
clear language at the top stating that “[b]ased on the appeal application and
contents presented within, the Department of City Planning is rejecting the
application…based on the Court of Appeal ruling in Samatas v. City of Los
Angeles, No. B293811, 2019 WL 5558069 (Cal. Ct. App. Oct. 29, 2019.”  RJN Ex. P. 
In other words, the Senior City Planner, acting on behalf of the
Director of Planning, determined that the First Height Appeal was barred by res
judicata.  If Samatas disagreed with
this conclusion, he was required to file a timely lawsuit.  Reply at 5.
Although Samatas contends that
the Termination Notice “invited” him to file a new appeal, the issues rejected
by the Termination Notice were not considered by the BBSC.  See RJN Ex. U, p. 6 (BBSC staff report
stating that Petitioner’s challenges to the building permits “were previously
addressed…and will not be discussed here…[and] are not within the Board’s
purview.”).  The BBSC limited its
consideration of the new appeal to the as-built height of the existing
permitted structure—the same issue the City indicated it could not hear until
the Project was completed. Thus, the City has been consistent in its responses
to Petitioner: the First Height Appeal was rejected by the June 3, 2022
Termination Notice and the BBSC did not have authority to hear that issue as
part of the Second Height Appeal.  Reply
at 6.
As pled in the Petition, and the
parties agree, the Director of Planning had authority to address the Project
height limits required by the Hillside Ordinance and the BBSC lacked authority
to hear such appeals.  See LAMC
§98.0403.1(b) (RJN Ex. V); Pet., ¶¶ 13, 19. 
Planning issued the Termination Notice for the First Height Appeal June
3, 2022.  RJN Ex. P.  If Petitioners wished to seek judicial review
of that decision, they were required by section 65009(c)(1) to do so within 90
days.  They did not do so.  Instead, Petitioner Samatas filed the Second
Height Appeal on August 1, 2022.  This
appeal was presented to LADBS, which forwarded it to the BBSC, not the Director
of Planning, over Petitioners’ objection. 
Pet., ¶¶ 23, 25.  The BBSC staff
report then expressly stated that the BBSC was addressing only the as-built
height of the existing permitted structure.
Based on these facts,
Petitioners timely sought review of the BBSC’s decision.  That the BBSC limited its decision to
consideration of the as-built height of the existing permitted structure does
not affect the scope of Petitioners appeal, which more broadly sought review of
the Project’s violation of the Hillside Ordinance’s maximum allowable envelope
height.  While Planning decided this
issue in the Termination Notice, concluding that the First Height Appeal was
barred by res judicata under the Samatas II Appeal, it did so
without prejudice.   The Termination Notice expressly states: “The
present termination, however, will not adversely prejudice consideration
of your new application….” (emphasis added).  The Petition expressly alleges that this was
an affirmance of LADBS’ position on the First Height Appeal that it would not
take up the issue until “after the building was completely constructed
but before a certificate of occupancy was issued.”  Pet., ¶15 (emphasis in original).  The Termination Notice implicitly adopts
LADBS’ position.  The Petition is
untimely for judicial review of the Termination Notice, but that does not mean
that it is untimely for consideration of a new appeal based on the same grounds
after the Project was completed.[6]  It is not.
 
4. Samatas Does
Not Have Standing
Standing is a threshold issue necessary to maintain a cause
of action, and the burden to allege and establish standing lies with the plaintiff. 
Mendoza v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (“Mendoza”) (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 802, 810.  As a general rule,
a party must be “beneficially interested” to seek a writ of mandate.  Friends of Oceano Dunes, Inc. v. San Luis
Obispo County Air Pollution Control Dist., (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 957,
962 (citing CCP §1086).  Likewise, to
seek declaratory relief, a party must be an “interested person.”  CCP §1060. 
An “interested person” means the same thing as a “beneficially
interested” person in mandamus cases. 
Asimow, et al., Administrative Law (2018), Ch. 14, §14:6.  The term “beneficially interested” has been
generally interpreted to mean that one may obtain the writ only if the person
has some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved
or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public
at large.  SJJC Aviation Services, LLC
v. City of San Jose, (“SJJC”) (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 1043,
1053.  The beneficial interest must be
direct and substantial.  Ibid.  A petition has no beneficial interest if she
will gain no direct benefit from the writ’s issuance and suffer no direct
detriment if it is denied.  Ibid.
The City and Developer correctly argue that Samatas does not
have the requisite beneficial interest to pursue this mandamus action because
he no longer lives next to the Property. Title
records show that Samatas sold 1424 Tanager in May 2021.  RJN Ex.
D.  He now resides in Oak Brook,
Illinois.  RJN Ex. X. (Samatas’ Illinois driver’s
license).  In 2022 and 2023, Samatas’
counsel filed lobbyist registrations with the City identifying Samatas’ address
in Illinois.  RJN Ex. W. 
Samatas signed the verification of the Petition in Illinois.  Pet., p. 35.
 As a former neighbor of the Property,
Samatas has no legal interest in the Project’s compliance with the Hillside
Ordinance. Samatas was not prejudiced by the BBSC’s action on his appeal, which
was filed after Samatas sold 1424 Tanager.  Californians
for Disability Rts. v. Mervyn’s, LLC, (2006) 39 Cal. 4th 223, 233 (standing
must always exist until judgment is entered). 
Dem. at 18-19.
Petitioners respond that Samatas was negatively impacted
in connection with his sale of the Property to Lintz due to the illegal
Project.  Samatas sold 1424 Tanager in or
around April 2021 when appeals were pending and the June 3, 2022 Termination
Notice had not yet been issued.  RJN Exs.
D, P.  If necessary, the Petition may be
amended to include such negative impacts, which establish the interest Samatas
has in this action.  Opp. at 12.
Samatas is incorrect.  As a resident of Illinois without any ownership
of property near the Project, Samatas cannot establish that anything the City
did after he sold 1424 Tanager prejudicially affected his substantial rights,
or that he will benefit from a mandamus ruling. 
A writ of mandate could not provide Samatas a higher sale price several
years after the sale.  
Petitioners also argue that the
Petition expressly alleges that Lintz has provided Samatas with a
Special/Limited Power of Attorney in connection with the claims that are the
subject of this action, including the prosecution thereof.”  Pet., ¶5.  The Power of Attorney clearly states that
Samatas has the authority to prosecute this lawsuit on behalf of the current
owner of the Property, Lintz.  Opp. at
11-12.
This allegation enables Samatas
to prosecute Lintz’ claim, and it is undisputed that Lintz has standing.  But the claim still belongs to Lintz; it does
not confer standing on Samatas.    Yet, Samatas purports to be a
Petitioner.  Pet., ¶5.  The City and Developer correctly reply that California
law does not give a party personal standing to assert rights or interests
belonging solely to others.  CCP §367 (action
must be brought by or on behalf of the real party in interest); Jasmine
Networks, Inc. v. Superior Court, (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 980, 992. Reply at
6.
Samatas does not have standing
to prosecute this case in his own name.
 
b. Lintz’s Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies
As a general rule, a court will not issue a writ of mandate
unless a petitioner has first exhausted its available administrative
remedies.  See, e.g., Alta
Loma School Dist. v. San Bernardino County Com. On School Dist. Reorganization,
(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 542, 554.  Under
this rule, an administrative remedy is exhausted only upon termination of all
available, non-duplicative administrative review procedures.  Coachella Valley Mosquito & Vector
Control Dist. v. California Public Employment Relations Bd., (2005) 35
Cal.4th 1072, 1080.
The exhaustion doctrine has been described as “a
jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts.”  Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal,
(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 293.  The
exhaustion doctrine contemplates that the real issues in controversy be
presented to the administrative body, which must be given the opportunity to
apply its special expertise to correct any errors and reach a final decision,
thereby saving the already overworked courts from intervening into an
administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary.  Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court,
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 391.  
The failure to allege exhaustion of administrative remedies
or facts excusing the failure to exhaust renders the petition subject to
demurrer for failure to state a cause of action.  See, e.g., Stenocord Corp.
v. City & County of San Francisco, (1970) 2 Cal.3d 984, 990.  A mere allegation that petitioners have
exhausted their administrative remedies has been held to be conclusory and
insufficient to survive demurrer.  Pan
Pacific Property v. County of Santa Cruz, (1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 244,
251.  On the other hand, such an
allegation has also been held sufficient to survive demurrer.  Wong v. Regents of University of
California, (1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 823, 829. 
Therefore, the court has discretion in determining whether the
allegation is adequate.  
 The exhaustion doctrine includes issue exhaustion as well as
exhaustion of administrative remedies. 
The agency must be given the opportunity to reach a reasoned and final
conclusion on each and every issue upon which it has jurisdiction to act before
it is raised in a judicial forum.  Hill
RHF Housing Partners, L.P. v. City of Los Angeles, (“Hill”) (2021),
12 Cal.5th 458, 479 (citation omitted). 
“Exhaustion requires ‘a full presentation to the administrative agency
upon all issues of the case and at all prescribed stages of the administrative
proceedings.’”  City of San Jose v.
Operating Engineeers Local Union No. 3, (2010) 49 Cal.4th 597,
609 (citations omitted).  “The
exhaustion doctrine contemplates that the real issues in controversy be
presented to the administrative body, which must be given the opportunity to
apply its special expertise to correct any errors and reach a final decision,
thereby saving the already overworked courts from intervening into an
administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary.”  Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court,
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 391. 
The exact issue raised in the lawsuit must have been presented to the
administrative agency.  Tahoe Vista
Concerned Citizens v. County of Placer, (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th
577, 594.  Otherwise, a litigant could
present narrow arguments or even omit them before the final administrative
authority in hopes of obtaining a more favorable decision from a trial
court.  Id.
The City and Developer argue that Lintz
has not exhausted his administrative remedies.  He was never a party to the administrative
appeals, never personally commented on Samatas’ appeals, and never paid an
appeal fee.  If Lintz was a party to an
appeal, his counsel needed to report his involvement in its required lobbyist
registration, which it did not do.  See
RJN Ex. W.  Lintz’s name was merely referenced in an
August 21, 2023 letter submitted by Petitioners’ counsel one day before the
BBSC hearing, and again in an August 25, 2023 reconsideration request after the
BBSC denied the appeal.  Pet., ¶¶ 25, 28, ,Exs. G, I.  Simply noting Lintz’s name in two letters does
not make him a party to the appeal.  Moreover,
pursuant to the LAMC’s appeal procedures, a party to an appeal is not simply an
interested person.  See LAMC Sec. 98.0308(f) (RJN Ex. V) (party has
rights of introducing exhibits,
cross-examining witnesses, and representing himself or to be represented by
anyone of his choice).  Lintz was not a party to the
appeal and cannot meet the exhaustion requirement by piggybacking onto Samatas’
appeal at the last minute.  Dem.  at 19-20.
Lintz
cannot argue that he is excused from exhausting administrative remedies by
granting Samatas a power of attorney.  The
City’s ordinances do not permit “secret” or “hidden” appellants.  If Lintz was a party to the appeal—on his own
or via representation by Samatas—Samatas’ counsel needed to report Lintz’s
involvement in its required lobbyist registration.  Samatas also needed to file an appeal on
behalf of Lintz. Neither occurred.  Dem. at 20.
Petitioners respond that the position of the City and
Developer is demonstrably false.  The
Petition alleges that “Mr. Lintz joined Mr. Samatas’ appeal of the subject
building permits and is a successor-in-interest to Mr. Samatas.”  Pet.,
¶5.  Appeal letters to the BBSC expressly
stated that the letters were on behalf of both Samatas and Lintz.  Pet., Exs. G, I.  The BBSC’s denials of the requests in those
letters are directly at issue in this litigation.  Pet., ¶¶
23-29, 67-75.  
“The essence of the exhaustion doctrine is the public
agency’s opportunity to receive and respond to articulated factual issues and
legal theories before its actions are subjected to judicial
review.”  Citizens for Open Government v. City of Lodi,
(“City of Lodi”) (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 865, 874 (2006) (emphasis in
original).  That unquestionably
happened.  Case law makes clear that a
petitioner has exhausted so long as the issues are presented to the final
decision-making body—it does not matter that a petitioner did not appear before
or present issues to the lower body.  Browning-Ferris Indus. v. City Council, (“Browning-Ferris”)
(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 852, 859-60 (1986). 
Nor does a petitioner need to file a separate appeal document where
another party has filed a similar appeal. 
Citizens for Open Government v.
City of Lodi, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at 878 (citizens group
not barred from challenging approval of project and permit by its failure to
appeal planning commission approval decision to city council, where another
group did file appeal on similar grounds); Blue v. City of Los Angeles, (“Blue”)
(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1141 n.8 (“An individual challenging a
redevelopment plan need not have personally raised each issue at the
administrative level, but may rely upon issues raised or objections raised by
others, so long as the agency had the opportunity to respond.”).  Opp. at 12-13.
Petitioners argue that none of
the cases cited by the City and Developer stand for the proposition that, in
order to exhaust his administrative remedies, Lintz must file an initial appeal
and cannot join the appeal later.  The
City and Developer’s strange reliance on LAMC
section 98.0308(f) adds little because it merely sets forth the rights of
parties at City hearings and does not speak to exhaustion of administrative
remedies.  Opp. at 13.
The court agrees with the City
and Developer that Petitioners’ reliance on City of Lodi and Browning-Ferris
is ineffectual because they are CEQA cases involving relaxed standing
requirement.  Under Public Resources Code
section 21177, a litigant need only raise an objection during the public
comment period to challenge an agency’s CEQA action, and the litigant may rely
on the objections of others in doing so.  While Blue, supra, 137
Cal.App.4th at 1141 n.8, is not a CEQA case and states that an objector may
rely on the objections of others, Petitioners point to no general rule in land
use or City appeals that the objector need not file an appeal.  Reply at 7.
Nonetheless, the Petition alleges
that “Lintz joined [] Samatas’ appeal… and is a successor-in-interest to []
Samatas.”  Pet., ¶5.  The court must accept that as true unless
contradicted by judicially noticed facts. 
The City and Developer reply that Lintz cannot simply jump into an
existing appeal and that neither Samatas nor his legal counsel registered Lintz
with the City’s ethics commission as a client that was being represented in
connection with the BBSC appeal hearing.  If Lintz was a party to the appeal, his legal
counsel would have had to have registered with the City.  Reply at 7, n.2.  
This issue has not been
adequately developed.  The City and
Developer fail to show that Lintz must file his own appeal, that Petitioners’
counsel is required to register as a lobbying firm and name its clients per City
ordinance, and the legal consequences of not doing so.  The reference to a party’s rights on appeal
in LAMC section 98.0308(f) (RJN Ex. V) are insufficient.[7]
Lintz has standing and the
demurrer is overruled on the issue of exhaustion of his failure to exhaust administrative
remedies. 
 
5. Res
judicata 
Res judicata, also known as claim preclusion, prevents
re-litigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same
parties or parties in privity with them. 
Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co., (2002) 28 Cal.4th 888, 896.  Res judicata serves to prevent
inconsistent rulings, promote judicial economy by preventing repetitive
litigation, and protect against vexatious litigation.  Federation of Hillside and Canyon
Associations v. City of Los Angeles, (“Federation”) (2004) 126
Cal.App.4th 1180, 1205.  A judgment on
the merits is res judicata and
is conclusive on all issues that were raised or could have been raised in the
prior proceeding.  Id. at 1205.  Res judicata applies if (1) the
decision in the prior proceeding is final and on the merits, (2) the present
proceeding is on the same cause of action as the prior proceeding, and (3) the
parties in the present proceeding (or parties in privity with them) were
parties to the prior proceeding.  Id.
at 1202.  In order to avoid piecemeal
litigation, a judgment is conclusive not only as to the issues actually decided,
but those that might have been raised as well. 
Thibodeau v. Crum, (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 749, 754; Sych v.
Insurance Co. of North America, (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 330.  
The City and Developer
point out that Samatas I
sought the revocation of the Project’s building permits.  RJN Ex.
E.  Samatas alleged that the Project was
permitted to be over-sized in that the developer allegedly manipulated the
site’s “natural grade” in the Project’s plans so that a larger house could be
developed than otherwise would have been allowed.  Ex. E, ¶¶
1-7.  Samatas specifically alleged that the
Developer intentionally misrepresented the slope under the prior home in the
Project’s topographical survey to “build a larger home than permitted under the
LAMC (i.e.,
a “Slope Band Claim”).  RJN Ex. A, ¶1.  Samatas prevailed on the Slope Band Claim. Id.  The City complied with the ensuing writ and
filed its return on December 19, 2017, evidencing that a supplemental permit
was issued and that the size of the Project was reduced.  Id.
No appeal was taken from the judgment, which is final.  Id.,
p. 7.  Dem. at 11.
On March 29, 2018,
Samatas filed Samatas II.  Id.,
p. 5.  As in Samatas I, Samatas alleged
that the same building permits violated the LAMC
based on different legal theories.  Id., pp. 5-6. Relying on allegedly “newly
discovered” evidence, the petition alleged that the Developer evaded zoning
requirements designed to limit the residential floor area” and that the height
of the Project’s walls exceeded the LAMC
limitations.  RJN Ex. F., ¶2.  Samatas II alleged four causes of
action:(i) the Project’s basement walls were in fact retaining walls that were
over-height; (ii) the Project’s grading exceeded applicable LAMC limitations; (iii) the Project once again
incorrectly calculated the permitted Residential Floor Area (“RFA”); and (iv)
the basement walls exceeded the height limitations above natural grade to
qualify as basement walls.  Id., ¶¶ 129-51.  The petition prayed for the Project’s building
permits to be revoked.  Id. at Prayer, pp. 66-67.  Dem. at 11-12.
The court sustained the City’s demurrer that Samatas II was barred by the doctrine of res
judicata.  RJN Ex. C, p. 6.  The court found that all of the elements of res
judicata had been met: (i) a final decision had been made on the merits in Samatas I; (ii) Samatas II was
between the same parties or parties in privity; and (iii) the two cases
involved the same cause of action.  Id. Dem. at 12.
The Second District Court of Appeal upheld the dismissal in
an unpublished decision filed on October 29, 2019, which confirmed the primary
right at issue: Samatas “right to be free from City-issued building permits for
the Project that do not comply with the City’s zoning laws so that the Project
interferes with the quiet enjoyment of his property.”  RJN Ex.
C, p. 6.  Dem. at 12.
The City and Developer argue that, just as in Samatas II, Petitioners are attempting to
vindicate the same primary right at issue in Samatas I.  Petitioners’ new legal theory is that LADBS
permitted an over-height Project that exceeds the applicable zoning laws.  Pet., ¶¶
67-75.  While the Petition contends that this
legal theory was not discovered until May 2018, Samatas made the same argument
in Samatas II, and the appellate
court rejected the use of the “discovery rule” for purposes of the res
judicata doctrine.  RJN Ex. C, n. 5.  Dem. at 22. 
Moreover, this issue could have been raised in Samatas I. Petitioners’ Second Height Appeal
to the BBSC arises from their claim that the Project’s original building permits
relied on allegedly inaccurate topographical surveys.  Pet., ¶¶
1, 9; RJN Ex. J, p.7.  This was the exact issue litigated in Samatas I.  RJN Ex. C, Ex. E, p. 9.  Samatas admitted in Samatas I that his experts scrutinized
both the Project’s architectural plans, survey, and the site itself, before
filing suit.  RJN Ex. Z.  Samatas knew during Samatas I that an error relating to the
calculation of natural grade could also result in errors in the calculation of
height, and yet he did not raise the issue.  He (i) knew that the Project’s height was
measured from natural grade, (ii) knew that the natural grade in the in the
Project plans contained errors, and (iii) should have known that the Project was
permitted over-height.  Samatas could
have raised this over-height claim in Samatas
I but failed to do so.  Dem. at 22-23.
The Petition argues
that res judicata should not apply because the prior lawsuits did not
address the height of the Project and a supplemental permit was issued in
October 2018.  Pet., ¶16.  Neither argument holds water, and both were
rejected in Samatas II.  As explained in Colebrook v. CIT Bank, N.A., (“Colebrook”)
(2021) 64 Cal. App. 5th 259, 263, “one injury gives rise to only one claim for
relief” and “the primary right is simply
the plaintiff’s right to be free from the particular injury suffered.”  Id. 
The issue is not whether new facts have arisen, or a new legal theory is
alleged, but whether a subsequent action seeks to “vindicate the same primary
right” created by the same injury.  Id. at 246.  The primary right and injury at issue in Samatas I, Samatas II, and this action are
identical, and it is of no significance whether concerns over the Project’s
height were specifically raised in Samatas
I.  Dem. at 23.
The City and
Developer argue that the fact that a supplemental permit was issued in 2018
does not change the result.  Samatas
similarly argued in Samatas II that
the issuance of a supplemental permit, issued after Samatas I was filed, supported a new claim
and cause of action. This court rejected this same argument, again focusing on
the primary right.  RJN, Ex. G, p. 14;
Ex. C, p. 10.  The court correctly noted
that Samatas knew “about the grading… and was obligated to raise his claims
concerning the original grading permit in Samatas
I.”  Id., p. 15.  The same is true here. Samatas knew: (1) that
height was measured from natural grade, and (2) the permits contained errors
with respect to the measurement of natural grade.  Res judicata does not permit Samatas to
piecemeal his litigation.  Dem. at 23.
As in Samatas II, Petitioners may attempt to
rely on Allied Fire Protection v. Diede
Constr., Inc., (“Allied Fire”) (2005) 127 Cal. App. 4th 150, 155, to
argue that res judicata does not apply because Petitioners could not
have raised the claims relating to the Project’s new sloped roofs—which were
permitted in the supplemental permit—in Samatas
I. This is incorrect. Allied Fire
concerned a fraud that was committed by the defendant prior to the plaintiff’s
first suit, but about which the plaintiff was unaware at the time.  Id.
at 153. The court found that these new facts resulted in a new claim (i.e.,
a different injury), and res judicata did not apply.  Compare 5th & LA v. W. Waterproofing Co., (“5th
& LA”) (2023) 87 Cal. App. 5th 781, 790, (changed conditions or new
facts are not by themselves enough to avoid res judicata, and
distinguishing Allied Fire “because
it involved two different claims: one contractual, one for fraud.”).  Samatas had his chance to vindicate this
primary right in Samatas I, and
Petitioners do not get another bite at the apple.  See Tahoe-Sierra
Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg’l Plan. Agency, (9th Cir. 2003) 322 F.3d
1064, 1077 (“The doctrine of res judicata is meant to protect parties
against being harassed by repetitive actions.”).  Dem. at 23-24.
Petitioners
respond that the City and Developer ignore the factual allegations in the
Petition and clear law that the Petition is not barred by res judicata.  “The determination of whether a cause of
action could have been brought is made as of the date the first complaint was
filed; res judicata does not bar any claims that arise after that.”  RJN Ex. C (Samatas II Appeal, supra, 2019 WL
5558069 at *7) (citing Allied Fire,
supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at 155).  Samatas
I and Samatas II were filed on August 16, 2016 and March 29, 2018, respectively.  Pet.,
¶16.  The October 1, 2018 supplemental
permit that took the Project’s permitted height from 30 feet as contemplated in
the original plans to the illegal 36 feet was issued years after Samatas I
and over six months after Samatas II. 
The present action asserts claims relating to various issues having
nothing to do with the City’s issuance of the original building permits.  The claims are based on facts that arose after
Samatas I and Samatas II were filed and do not relate to the 2015
issuance of the original building permits. 
Instead, they relate to the actual structure that was constructed.  Pet.,
Ex. A.  Res judicata is not carte
blanche for the City or Developer to violate the law by deviating from permits
and issuing new supplemental permits that illegally support that deviation.  Opp. at 13-14.
            Unlike
Federation, supra, 126 Cal.App.4th at 1202, these issues could not
have been actually litigated in the prior actions and do not implicate the same
primary right.  As the City and Developer
concede, the primary right at issue in Samatas I and Samatas
II related to LABDS’ issuance of the original building permits for the
Project as they relate to the Project’s square footage, retaining walls, and
slope band analysis.  Pet., ¶16; RJN Ex. C.  There is a drastic difference between
challenging initial project approvals (Samatas I and Samatas
II) versus challenging an illegal deviation from such project approvals
during construction and issuing new approvals to justify the illegal
construction.  Opp. at 14.
            The
City and Developer are also wrong in contending that “Samatas knew during Samatas
I that an error relating to the calculation of natural grade could
also result in errors relating to the calculation of height.”  That mischaracterizes the Petition, which
alleges that the as-constructed and actual location of the Project was shifted
at critical points in comparison to the Project’s approved height survey.  Pet., ¶¶
62, 65.  Samatas could not have known in Samatas
I that the Developer would move the Project in an effort to make it
illegally higher, and that the City would allow it.  Opp. at 15.
            Finally,
the October 2018 supplemental permit at issue in the Petition is drastically
different from the supplemental grading permit at issue in the prior
litigation.  In Samatas II,
the Court stated that “[b]ecause the supplemental grading permit made no change
in the allegedly flawed analysis, Samatas[’] failure to challenge the analysis
when originally made barred a subsequent challenge in Samatas II.”  RJN, Ex.
C, p. 10.  In contrast, the original
building permits at issue in the prior cases stated that the Project would be
30 feet high, which was in compliance with the law.  Pet.,
¶15.  After construction commenced and
the Project was plainly over-height, the City issued the October 2018
supplemental permit allowing the Project to be 36 feet high in violation of the
zoning code.  Id. 
In fact, the as-built Project is even higher than 36 feet.  Unlike the supplemental permit at issue in
the prior litigation, the October 2018 supplemental permit changed the City’s
analysis in a way that Samatas could not have possibly known or anticipated in Samatas
I or Samatas II.  Opp. at 15.
The City and Developer reply that it is not
true that Petitioners’ claims arose after the filing of Samatas I. It
always has been Samatas’ allegation that the home was permitted to exceed the
maximum allowable height. The Petition alleges that Samatas first had concerns
about the Project height in May 2018 when “it became apparent [to him] that
construction violated the 30-foot height limit.”  Pet., ¶15.  At that time, the Project plans were precisely
the same as they were when Samatas filed Samatas I and Samatas II.  The court sustained the City’s demurrer in Samatas
II after a hearing in September 2018.  RJN Ex. G.  Samatas could have raised this issue in Samatas
II or asked for a stay while the administrative appeal was pending, but he did
not.  Reply at 8.
The fact that a supplemental permit was
issued does not change the result. Res judicata turns on whether or not
the same primary right is at issue, and not whether or not new facts
subsequently came to light.  Colebrook,
supra, 64 Cal. App. 5th at 264.  In
Samatas I, the primary right was “the right to be free from City-issued
building permits for the Project that do not comply with the City’s zoning laws
so that the Project interferes with the quiet enjoyment of his property.” Samatas
v. City of Los Angeles, 2019 WL 5558069 *6 (RJN Ex. C). This right was
fully litigated.  Reply at 8-9.
Petitioners’ reliance on Allied Fire,
supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at 150 to suggest that the existence of
any new facts avoids application of res judicata is wrong.  In 5th & LA, supra,
87 Cal. App. 5th at 781, a building owner filed a lawsuit against a roofing
company alleging that the roof leaked and the roofing company breached express
and implied warranties.  Id. at
783. At trial, the company admitted to errors in its work, but the jury did not
find the leaks to be caused by those errors.  Id. at 785. Later, the owner sought to
invoke an optional renewal of the roof’s warranty, and the company refused.  Id. The owner sued again, now
challenging the company’s refusal to honor the extension of the warranty, a new
and different breach of contract.  Id.
 The trial court granted summary judgment
on the basis that the new lawsuit was barred by res judicata.  Id. 
The building owner argued that the case was not res judicata
because it “focused on the breach of the express 10 year warranty…”  Id.  Although this was a new fact/breach, the appellate
court affirmed, finding that the case was still res judicata because the
owner was again “suing on the same primary right: ‘for [the company] to honor
its warranty for the work it did in 2012.’”  Id. at 786.  The court distinguished Allied Fire “because
it involved two different claims: one contractual, one for fraud… [and] there
is nothing like that here.”  Id.
at 790.  Reply at 9.
Similarly, in Thibodeau v. Crum,
(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 749, a homeowner sued a general contractor for the
deficient installation of a new driveway which exhibited problems with “broken
chunks” and “radiating cracks.” An arbitrator awarded the homeowner damages to
repair the driveway’s broken chunks.  When
the radiating cracks worsened, the homeowner attempted to sue the
subcontractor.  The court found the
second action barred by res judicata, explaining that the “worsening of
the cracks did not change the analysis” because it could “conceive of no
logical reason why the arbitration should encompass the chunks but not the
cracks.”  Id. at 756.  Reply at 10.
The
City and Developer conclude that Petitioners make the same type of illogical
distinction.  The entire purpose of Samatas
I was to challenge the size of the Project and its compliance with the Hillside
Ordinance.  The Petition seeks to
re-litigate the same issue but tries to differentiate height from size without
any logical basis.  Accordingly, Petitioners
are precluded from bringing new challenges to the building permits for the same
reasons the owner in 5th and LA and the homeowner in Thibodeau
could not do so.  The primary right is
the same.  Reply at 10.
Additionally,
according to Petitioners’ opposition, the Project was not constructed
consistent with the City-issued permits because the as-built height of the
constructed house is greater than permitted and the house was built in a
different location than shown in the approved plans.  Pet., ¶¶ 1, 15-16, 44, 49-51, 67-68.  To the extent Petitioners allege that the
Project was constructed inconsistently with its permits, that is an enforcement
complaint which is discretionary and not subject to a writ of mandate
challenge.  Reply at 10.
The
Petition can be parsed into two claims based on Samatas’ Second Height Appeal: (a)
the City improperly issued the October 2018 supplemental permit in violation of
the Hillside Ordinance’s height restrictions and (b) the as-built Project is
over-height and wrongly located in violation of the Hillside Ordinance.  The Petition’s allegations for the latter issue
include (a) LADBS’ approval of a height survey dated August 9, 2022 based on
incorrect information in violation of the LAMC (Pet., ¶53, Ex. K), (b) construction
that deviated from the 30-feet height limit set forth in the original plans and
building permits (Pet., ¶¶ 1, 15-16, 44, 49-51, 67-68), and (c) the shifting of
the as-built Project eastward at a critical location at the northern portion of
the west roof so as to render the Approved Height Survey false (Pet., ¶¶ 62-65,
Exs. O-Q). 
The
court agrees with the City and Developer (Reply at 10-11) that the City cannot
be compelled to file an enforcement action for the as-built claims.  Traditional mandamus is only available to
compel the performance of an act where a statute or ordinance proscribes a
“clear, present and usually ministerial duty. CCP §1085(a).  It must be an act that the City is “required
to perform in a prescribed manner without any exercise of judgment or opinion
concerning the propriety of the act.”  Cal.
Assn. for Health Serv’s. at Home v. State Dept. of Health Serv’s, (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 696, 707-08.  The City
has no mandatory duty to conduct building inspections or abate a nuisance for
the as-built Project.  
This
fact does not explain, however, why the BBSC ruled that the Project as-built
complies with the Hillside Ordinance’s maximum building envelope height.  RJN Exs. R, U, p. 6-7.  If BBSC erred in concluding that the Project meets
height requirements, that decision can be set aside.  While the City cannot be compelled to file an
abatement action against Developer and Berserker, a ruling that the as-built
Project does not comply with the law could be used by Lintz for his own
nuisance action.  Therefore, his mandamus
claim is justiciable.
This
leaves the supplemental permit.  The
court has ruled that Petitioners timely sought review of the BBSC’s decision
for the Second Height Appeal.  This judicial
review includes the BBSC’s failure to consider Petitioner Samatas’ claims that the
supplemental permit allows the Project to violate the Hillside Ordinance’s maximum
allowable envelope height.  As in Samatas
I and Samatas II, the primary right is the right of a neighbor (Lintz)
to be free from a City-issued building permit for the Project that does not
comply with the City’s zoning laws so that the Project interferes with the
quiet enjoyment of his property.  The
Petition alleges that, after construction commenced and the Project was plainly
over-height, the City issued the October 2018 supplemental permit allowing the
Project to be 36 feet high in violation of the zoning code.  Pet., ¶15. 

The
court agrees with Petitioners that this claim is not barred by res judicata.
 The October 2018 supplemental permit
allegedly allows an illegal 36-foot height. Unlike the supplemental grading
permit in Samatas II, which made no change in the allegedly flawed
analysis (RJN Ex. G, p. 17, n. 10), the October 2018 supplemental permit is
alleged to have changed the permitted structure height of 30 feet to allow a 36-foot
height in violation of the zoning code.  Pet.,
¶15.  . 
The court must accept this allegation as true, and it presents a new
claim against the City not barred by res judicata.  The fact that it concerns the Project height and
the prior cases concerned Project size, and therefore also height, does not
affect this conclusion.  The supplemental
permit is a new City action not folded into the prior rulings on the Project’s
permits. 
The
argument by the City and Developer that Samatas could have amended his
complaint in Samatas II or sought a stay pending the outcome of the
Second Height Appeal also does not affect its status as a new claim.  “The determination of whether a cause of
action could have been brought is made as of the date the first complaint was
filed; res judicata does not bar any claims that arise after that.”  RJN Ex. C (Samatas II Appeal, supra,
2019 WL 5558069 at *7) (citing Allied Fire, supra, 127
Cal.App.4th at 155).  

 
            E. Conclusion
            The demurrer to the
Petition is overruled.  While it is not
clear that Lintz exhausted his administrative remedies, the City and Developer
have not met their burden on this issue. 
The City and Developer have 30 days to answer only.
