And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a petition by the Developer to determine the fate of an action in the absence of Berserker, who has been served but has not appeared. The court agrees that Berserker is an indispensable party and that the action should proceed with or without Berserker. The court also finds that the Developer's failure to exhaust administrative remedies does not preclude the City and Developer from bringing the action. The court notes that the City and Developer ignore key allegations in the Petition occurring after the June 3, 2022 Termination Notice, including the approval of a height survey based on incorrect information and construction that deviated from the 30-feet height limit. The court agrees that these issues were timely presented in the Second Height Appeal.
