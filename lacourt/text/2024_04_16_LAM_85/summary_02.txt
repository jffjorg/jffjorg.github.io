The Judge's tentative ruling discusses the case between Bisong, the plaintiff, and CDU, the defendant, regarding the dismissal of Elemuren, a student. The Judge found that CDU's opposition incorrectly cited the University Catalog's requirement, which includes the Provost ad hoc appeal. The Judge also noted that the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (BPPE) has no authority to compel CDU to reinstate a dismissed student. The Judge concluded that CDU's breach of contract claim is subsumed within the administrative mandamus claim.
