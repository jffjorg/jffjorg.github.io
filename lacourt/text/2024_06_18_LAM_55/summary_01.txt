English Text Summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment or in the alternative, motion for summary adjudication filed by Ashland Pacific, LP against Anthony Hasan and Muriel Iwanowski. The court has denied the motion for the following reasons:

* The court sustains the defendants' evidentiary objections to the plaintiff's evidence.
* The plaintiff failed to shift the burden of proof as to all claim elements, particularly as to the amount of damages.
* Triable issues of fact exist regarding which lease agreement applies to the dispute.
* The defendants' affirmative defenses of mitigation, habitability, and repair expenses raise triable issues of fact.
* The total late fees sought by the plaintiff are an exorbitant penalty.

The court has therefore denied the motion for summary judgment or adjudication.
