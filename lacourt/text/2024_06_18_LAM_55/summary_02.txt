Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial date and related deadlines. The plaintiff owns a residential and vacant lot in Los Angeles and is suing the defendants for claims of property interests. The defendants have not opposed the motion. The judge finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause for the continuance due to the recent addition of new defendants, who would not have sufficient time to prepare for trial in only about two months. The case will be set for a new trial date in consultation with counsel at the hearing.
