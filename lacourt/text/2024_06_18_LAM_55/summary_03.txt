And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the case. The Plaintiff, Jonathan Wolpert, brings an employment discrimination case against the Defendant, Clear Channel Outdoor, LLC. The Defendant argues that the parties have a valid arbitration agreement and that the Plaintiff has assented to it. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff did not assent to the arbitration agreement because he never viewed or acknowledged the agreement. The Judge also finds that the agreement is unconscionable because it was presented to the Plaintiff as a condition of his employment and he was not given the opportunity to negotiate or opt out. The Judge denies the motion to compel arbitration and stay the case.
