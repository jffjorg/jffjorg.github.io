And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the plaintiffs (Santiago Nuno, Rosario Nuno, Consuelo Razo, Teresa Bojorquez, Arnulfo Nuno, Reynalda Nuno, Maria Hernandez, Jesse Nuno, and Oscar Nuno) and the defendant (Francisco Noyola). The settlement agreement provides that the defendant would transfer a real property to the plaintiffs for 10% of its fair market value, or $75,500. The agreement also requires the defendant to provide substantiation for a claimed amount of $170,976.18.

The defendant failed to provide the required documentation, and the plaintiffs are seeking to enforce the settlement agreement and proceed with the sale of the property. The judge finds that the defendant missed the 60-day deadline to provide substantiation for the claimed amount, and therefore, the plaintiffs' motion to enforce the settlement agreement is granted. The defendant's motion to enforce the settlement agreement is denied. The judge also denies the plaintiffs' request for attorney fees.
