Summary:

The court issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for summary judgment filed by NuScience Corporation and Martin Miranda. The motion was filed in response to Francisca Orozco's claims of disability discrimination, harassment, and failure to provide reasonable accommodations. The court found that NuScience failed to meet its burden of showing that Orozco cannot prevail on her claims, particularly with respect to her harassment claim. The court also found that NuScience's evidence did not demonstrate that it was unaware of Orozco's disability until June 17, 2019, and therefore did not have an opportunity to accommodate her. The court denied the motion for summary judgment and ordered NuScience to give notice of the order and file proof of service.
