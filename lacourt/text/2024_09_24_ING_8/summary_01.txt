And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to stay the civil lawsuit pending resolution of a related criminal case. The motion was filed by Defendant Jane Khanh Pham and her employer, Donna's Cocktail, Inc. The lawsuit was filed by the Plaintiffs, who are seeking damages for the death of Tomas Ramirez, who was killed in a motor vehicle accident involving Pham's vehicle.

The Court has granted the motion in part, staying discovery proceedings against Pham pending resolution of the criminal proceedings. The Court has also agreed with the Plaintiffs that the stay should be limited to discovery as to Pham, and that discovery proceedings can continue against other parties and third parties.

The Court's decision was based on the principle of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which protects individuals from being forced to testify against themselves in a criminal proceeding. The Court found that Pham's fear of self-incrimination was reasonable in light of the circumstances, and that the stay was necessary to protect her privilege.

The Court has scheduled a hearing on the motion for September 24, 2024, and has ordered the moving party to give notice of the tentative ruling.
