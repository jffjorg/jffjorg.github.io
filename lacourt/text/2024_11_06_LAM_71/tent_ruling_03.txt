I.                  
Background
Petitioner, individually and as guardian ad litem for Claimants (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed an initial complaint against Defendants Hudson Rose Investments
LLC (“Hudson Rose”) and Eric T. Carlisle (“Carlisle”) individually and as
trustee of the Chestnut Revocable Living Trust (“Trustee”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
on March 27, 2023.  Plaintiffs attempted
to file with the Court a first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants on September
29, 2023, which was not filed.  On
October 4, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the operative second amended complaint
(“SAC”) against Defendants for (1) breach of the implied warranty of
habitability, (2) breach of statutory warranty of habitability, (3) breach of
the covenant of quiet enjoyment, (4) negligence, (5) violation of Civil Code
§1942.4, (6) private nuisance, (7) violation of the City of Long Beach
Ordinance No. ORD 20-0044, (8) wrongful/constructive eviction, (9) fraud, (10)
breach of contract, and (11) unlawful business practice, Business &
Professions Code §§17200 et seq., for
issues at an apartment building located at 921 Chestnut Ave., Long Beach, CA
90813 (“Subject Property”). 
(See SAC.)  Pursuant to the instant petitions, Defendant Hudson Rose has
agreed to pay Plaintiffs to settle the claims. 
(See Petitions ¶¶10b, 11, Attach. 11.)  
A settlement was reached pursuant to which Defendants Hudson Rose agreed to pay a total of $50,000.00.  (Petitions ¶10a, Attach.
11.)  The three minor Claimants will
receive a gross sum of $5,000.00 each, and the one adult Petitioner will
receive a gross sum of $35,000.00.  (Petitions ¶16(a), Attach. 11; Decl. of Chapman ¶7.)  The total amount of attorney’s fees for which
court approval is requested is $16,481.21 (or $1,160.65 per minor, and
$12,999.26 to Petitioner), calculated as twenty-five percent of the minor Claimants’
settlement total and forty percent to the adult Petitioner and is based on a
contingency basis.  (See Petitions
¶¶10(c), 16(c), Attach. 11; Decl. of Chapman ¶¶9, 11.)  The total amount of costs and expenses for
which court approval is requested is $3,574.08 (or $357.41 per minor, and $2,501.85
to Petitioner), calculated as twenty-five percent of the minor Claimants’
settlement total and forty perfect for the adult Petitioner, and is based on a
contingency basis.  (See Petitions ¶¶10(c),
13(a), 16(d), Attach. 11; Decl. of Chapman ¶¶9, 10.)  The net balance of proceeds to each minor Claimant
is $3,481.94.  (Petitions ¶¶15, 16(f),
Attach. 11; Decl. of Chapman ¶8.)  All
procedural requirements have been met, as Petitioner has completed a Judicial
Council form MC-350 on behalf of each minor Claimant, signed by the Petitioner,
as well as Form MC-351 on the minor Claimants’ behalf.  
 
II.               
Legal Standard
Compromises of disputed claims brought by minors are governed in
part by C.C.P. §372.  The statute allows
a guardian ad litem to appear in court on behalf of a minor claimant and gives
the guardian ad litem the power to compromise the minor’s claim “with the
approval of the court in which the action or proceeding is pending.”  A petition for court approval of a compromise
must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise or
covenant.  (CRC, Rule 7.950.)  CRC, Rule 7.952(a) requires the attendance of
the petitioner and claimant at the hearing on the compromise of the claim
unless the court for good causes dispenses with their personal appearance.
“Neither section 372 nor the California Rules of Court (rules
7.950 & 7.952) contemplates a noticed motion and adversary hearing when
court approval of a minor’s compromise is sought. Although we need not decide
the question, it would appear that a petition to approve or disapprove a
minor’s compromise may be decided by the superior court, ex parte, in
chambers.”  (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.)  
CRC, Rule 7.955(a) requires the Court to use “a reasonable fee
standard” when approving and allowing the amount of attorneys’ fees payable
from money to be paid for the benefit of a person with a disability and
requires that the Court “give consideration to the terms of any representation
agreement made between the attorney and the representative of the minor . . .
and evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances existing at the
time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the representative
of the minor . . . contemplated that the attorney’s fee would be affected by
later events.”  
CRC, Rule 7.955(b) sets forth fourteen nonexclusive factors the
Court may consider in determining a reasonable attorney’s fee.  CRC, Rule 7.955(c) requires that a petition
requesting Court approval and allowance of an attorney’s fee under 7.955(a)
must include a declaration from the attorney that addresses the factors listed
in 7.955(b) that are applicable to the matter before the Court. 
 
III.            
 Analysis
Petitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which minor
claimants would each receive $3,481.94. 
The amounts reflect payment amounts to each minor claimant after deduction
of attorneys’ fees representing 25% of each minor claimant’s settlement.  (See Petitions ¶16(f).)  
This is a habitability suit, in which minor claimants lived in
uninhabitable conditions, including but not limited infestations of cockroaches,
rats, and bed bugs, which caused injuries including bed bug bites, lack of
sleep, and allergies including running nose and coughs.  (Petitions ¶¶5-6.)  The minor claimants have recovered completely
from these injuries with no permanent injuries. 
(Petitions ¶8.)  
Petitioner’s counsel, Christofer R. Chapman, declares that the attorney
fees requested are based on a contingency basis if there was no recovery, there
would have been no attorney fee charge. 
(See Decl. of Chapman ¶9.) 
Chapman declares he represented Plaintiffs for approximately two years.  (Decl. of Chapman ¶2.)  Chapman declares that during the instant
litigation his firm propounded form request for production of documents to the
defendant on behalf of the adult and minors in this case.  (Decl. of Chapman ¶11.)  Chapman declares a set of supplemental form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for product of documents
was also propounded to update the defendants’ previous responses.  (Decl. of Chapman ¶11.)  The responses and documents produced were
reviewed and analyzed for their application to the prosecution of each Plaintiff’s
case or a defendant’s defense.  (Decl. of
Chapman ¶11.)  Defendants served a set of
form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of
documents for each of the adult and minor plaintiffs.  (Decl. of Chapman ¶11.)
Petitions include copies of agreements between Petitioner and her
counsel.  (Attachs. 17(a)(2).)  Each agreement identifies the names of the
individual who signed the submitted fee agreements on behalf of the minor
clients as well as a certified English translation of the original agreement,
which was executed in Spanish. As such, the submitted copies of the written legal
services agreement with minor claimants are sufficient and support the
attorneys’ fees request. 
Petitioners request this Court order the disposition of the minor
claimants’ balance of the settlements, in the amount of $3,481.94 per minor
claimant, be deposited in insured accounts with JP Morgan Chase, 401 E. Ocean
Blvd., Long Beach, CA 90802, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the
Court until the minor Claimants reach the age of majority.  (Petitions ¶18(b)(2), Attachs. 18(b)(2).)
Given the age of the minor claimants, the Court will only require
attendance at the hearing by the Petitioner to grant the petitions.  (CRC, Rule 7.952.)
 
IV.           
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the petitions to approve the minors’
compromise are granted.  The Court orders
the funds deposited in insured accounts with JP Morgan Chase, 401 E. Ocean
Blvd., Long Beach, CA 90802, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the
Court until the minor Claimants reach the age of majority.
The Court sets a hearing on an Order to Show Cause as to the
whereabouts of the Proofs of Deposit and Requests for Dismissal as to these
plaintiffs on January 13, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 71.  
Moving Party to give notice.
