 Hearing Date:  November 6, 2024



 
Moving Defendant
Cedar Construction & Development, Inc.’s motion to compel further responses
from Plaintiff Cesar Cruz to its Request for Production of Documents (Set Two)
is granted.  Cruz is ordered to provide
Code-compliant responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set Two), Request

of this ruling.
Moving
Defendant’s request for sanctions is granted against Plaintiff and his counsel

Defendant Cedar Construction & Development,
Inc. (“Cedar”) (“Moving Defendant”) moves to compel further responses from Plaintiff
Cesar Cruz (“Cruz”) (“Plaintiff”) to its Request for Production of Documents
(Set Two) (“RFP 2”), Request No. 27, and requests sanctions jointly and
severally against Plaintiff and his attorney of record, Employee Justice Legal
Group, P.C., in the amount of $2,460.00. 
(Notice Amended Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§2031.310, 2031.310(i).)
 
Meet and Confer
On September 6, 2024, the parties engaged in an
IDC before this Court, regarding Defendant’s RFP 2 and the issues were deemed unresolved.  (9/6/24 IDC Minute Order.)
 
Discussion
Having reviewed Moving
Defendant’s Amended Motion to Compel Further Responses from Plaintiff to Moving
Defendant’s RFP 2, the Court rules as follows:
          On June 25, 2024, Moving Defendant served RFP 2 on
Plaintiff.  (Decl. of Horowitz ¶3, Exh. 1.)  On
July 29, 2024, Moving Defendant received Plaintiff’s objection-only response.  (Decl. of Horowitz ¶3, Exh. 2.)   Moving Defendant now moves to compel further responses.  
          Moving Defendant’s motion to compel further Code-compliant
responses from Plaintiff to RFP 2, Request No. 27 is granted.  Plaintiff seeks to recover his attorneys fees
as an element of damages in this lawsuit thereby rendering documents concerning
such fees discoverable.  (Byers v.
Superior Court of Contra Costa County (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 1003, 1006, reh’g
denied (May 30, 2024).)  Moving
Defendant’s instant amended motion excludes confidential attorney work product
information from the document request by requesting further responses with
attorney work-product information redactions. 
(Decl. of Clayton ¶¶3-5, Exh. 4.)  Plaintiff is ordered to provide Code-compliant
responses to RFP 2, Request No. 27, subject to attorney work-product
information redactions, within 20 days of this ruling.
Moving Defendant requests
monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,460.00 against Plaintiff and his
counsel of record, Employee Justice Legal Group, PC.  The Court notes time spent meeting and
conferring, including preparing for and attending an IDC is not compensable on
an attorneys’ fees motion because meeting and conferring and attending an IDC
is required on this motion by statute and by the rules of this department,
respectively.
          The Court awards sanctions against Plaintiff and his
counsel pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.310(h) in the reduced amount of $1,110.00,
calculated as follows:
([2 hours to prepare instant
motion + 1 hour to review opposition and prepare reply + 0.5 hour to attend
hearing on motion] x $300.00/hour) + $60.00 filing fee = $1,110.00
The sanctions are payable,
jointly and severally, by Plaintiff and his attorney, Employee Justice Legal
Group, PC, within 20 days of this order.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
