 Case Number:  23STCV01612    Hearing Date:   July 25, 2024    Dept:  71 On June 25, 2024, in response to
Stylenquaza, LLC’s petition for a writ of mandate, the Court of Appeal issued
an Alternative Writ of Mandate ordering this Court to vacate this Court’s March
28, 2024 order denying petitioner’s motion to quash for lack of personal
jurisdiction and (2) enter a new order granting the motion on the ground that
real party in interest has not met its burden of proof on the threshold issue
of purposeful availment. 
 
Pursuant to Brown, Winfield &
Canzoneri, Inc. v. Superior Court (2010) 47 Cal.4th 1233, 1250- 51 , fn. 10,
this Court offered the parties an opportunity to brief the issue of this
Court’s intent to comply with the Court of Appeal’s order.  The Court
received no briefs on the issue.  
 
Therefore, the Court now grants
Stylenquaza, LLC’s motion to quash on the ground that Plaintiff did not meet
its burden of proof on the threshold issue of Stylequaza’a purposeful availment
of the benefits and protections of California’s law.
