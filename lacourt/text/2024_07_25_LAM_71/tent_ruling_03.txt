  et al.,
  
         vs.
 
STATE OF
  CALIFORNIA. 


 Case No.: 
  23STCV11294
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  July 25, 2024



 
Defendant California
Department of Housing and Community Development’s unopposed demurrer to Plaintiffs Kiavand LLC’s and
Shahrokh Zarrin’s 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th causes of action in their first
amended complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.  Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 2nd cause
of action as it is alleged by Kiavand against Defendant is sustained without
leave to amend.
Defendant California
Department of Housing and Community Development’s motion to strike portions of Plaintiffs’
first amended complaint is denied as moot.  
 
Defendant California Department of Housing and Community
Development (“HCD”) (“Defendant”) demurs unopposed to the first amended complaint
(“FAC”) of Plaintiffs Kiavand LLC (“Kiavand”) and Shahrokh Zarrin (“Zarrin”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) in its entirety, as well as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th causes of
action.  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs. 1-3;
C.C.P. §430.10.) 
Defendant also moves unopposed to strike portions of
Plaintiffs’ FAC.  (Notice of MTS, pgs.
1-2; C.C.P. §436.)
 
1.    
Demurrer
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the demurring party must meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed
the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the objections
to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a).)
The demurring party shall file and serve with the demurrer
a declaration stating either of the following: (A) The means by which the
demurring party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading subject
to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving the
objections raised in the demurrer. (B) That the party who filed the pleading
subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and confer request of the
demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
Defendant’s counsel declares that on May 10, 2024, he met
and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel via teleconference to discuss the
instant demurrer and motion to strike, and the parties were unable to reach a
resolution to the issues raised.  (Decl.
of Cherensky ¶¶4-5.)  Defendant’s
counsel’s declaration is sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a).  Therefore, the Court will consider Defendant’s
demurrer.
 
Procedural
Background
          Plaintiffs
filed their initial Complaint against the State of California on May 18,
2023.  Plaintiffs filed the operative FAC
against HCD on November 21, 2023, alleging four causes of action: (1) accounting:
failure to pay benefits under the CA COVID-19 Rent Relief; (2) intentional
infliction of emotional distress; (3) abuse of process; and (4) violation of
the 5th Amendment of the United States Constitution for taking.
Defendant filed the instant demurrer and accompanying
motion to strike on May 20, 2024.  As of
the date of this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Summary of Allegations
Plaintiffs allege Kiavand is the owner of property located
at 1006 N. Edinburgh Avenue, West Hollywood, CA 90046 (“Property”).  (FAC 1:29-2:1.)  Plaintiffs allege Kiavand applied under the CA
COVID-19 Rent Relief program for statutory benefits conferred on Kiavand under
SB 115 (“Application”).  (FAC 2:2-3.)  Plaintiffs allege the Application was assigned
Case ID 841905 and was filed March 15, 2022.  (FAC 2:4-5.) 
Plaintiffs allege the demand for benefits in the Application was $57,500
allowed by statute for the period April 202 to March 2022.  (FAC 2:6-7.) 
Plaintiffs allege that apparently benefits were conferred upon Kiavand
under the statute and an entitlement to benefits was created for $57,500
(“Entitlement”).  (FAC 2:8-9.)  
Plaintiffs allege Kiavand has not received any of the
benefits that were awarded and the entire Entitlement was not delivered by HCD
to Kiavand’s detriment.  (FAC 2:10-12.)  Plaintiffs allege HCD has since egregiously,
recklessly, and intentionally violated Kiavand’s rights despite its compliance
with the statute and SB 115.  (FAC
2:13-14.)  Plaintiffs allege despite many
calls to HCD, HCD has intentionally disregarded Kiavand’s rightful request to
receive the Entitlement.  (FAC 2:15-16.)
 
Summary of Demurrer
Defendant demurs to the entire FAC
on the basis Kiavand fails to establish that it is entitled to a benefit under
the Emergency Assistance Rental Program (“ERAP”).  (Demurrer, pgs. 9-10.)  Defendant demurs to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
on the basis the causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute
causes of action against it.  (Demurrer,
pgs. 10-14.)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Cause of
Action
Entire FAC
“To
have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an
abstract need or desire and more than a unilateral expectation of it.” (Hobbs
v. City of Pacific Grove (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 311, 320, as modified
(Nov. 14, 2022), citations and quotations omitted.)  Instead, the alleged benefit must “stem from
an independent source such as state law.” (Id.)  
ERAP,
enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is based on certain provisions of
the Federal Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“FCA”) and of the American
Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARP”). Both acts restrict the use of allocated funds,
generally, to provide financial assistance and housing stability services to
eligible households negatively affected by the pandemic, and define eligible
households as tenant households.  (See
FCA (Pub.L. No. 116-260, Div. N, tit. V, subd. A, §50l(k)(3)(A) (Dec. 27, 2020)
134 Stat. 2077); ARP (Pub.L. No. 117-2, tit. III, subd. B, §3201(f)(2) (Mar.
11, 2021) 135 Stat. 58 [“The term ‘eligible household’ means a household of 1
or more individuals who are obligated to pay rent on a residential dwelling.”];
see also State Rental Assistance Program Guidelines (September 27, 2021)
Department of Housing and Community Development (as of May 15, 2024), §8.1 [“Applications
may be submitted by tenants and landlords, though program eligibility is based
on the tenant household. Landlords who will be providing tenant information on
behalf of the tenant shall provide evidence that they have the tenant’s
authorization]; id. at §9.1 [“Under the Acts, the intended beneficiary
of rent relief funds is the tenant(s) of an Eligible Household. Therefore,
program eligibility is based on the applicant being or having been a renter of
a residence for which rent is owed.”].)
HCD,
or its agent, is authorized under law to implement ERAP.  (See Health & Safety Code
§50897.3(a)(1)(A).)  That implementation
includes developing “fraud protections and approval processes” to assess
incoming applications.  (See id.
at §50897.3(a)(l)(D)(i).)  “[R]ental
assistance is awarded in rounds of funding based on eligibility.”  (Id. at §50897.3
(a)(l)(D)(ii)(II).)  HCD, or its agent,
“shall provide notification to the landlord and tenant when either the landlord
or the tenant submits a completed application for rental assistance [and again]
once a final decision has been rendered.”  (Health & Safety Code §§50897.1(r)(l)-50897.1(r)(2).)
Here,
Plaintiffs fail to allege Kiavand is entitled to ERAP benefits by and through
its tenant, and the respective tenant is not joined as a necessary party in this
action.  (See State Rental
Assistance Program Guidelines (September 27, 2021) Department of Housing and
Community Development (as of May 15, 2024), §§8.1, 9.1.)  Further, Plaintiffs’ allegation that
Kiavand’s Application created a $57,500 Entitlement is not supported by law
based on the processes HCD must follow. 
(See Health & Safety Code §§50897.1(r)(l)-50897.1(r)(2).)
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to the entire FAC is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend.
 
Accounting (1st COA)
“A cause of action for an
accounting requires a showing that a relationship exists between the plaintiff
and defendant that requires an accounting, and that some balance is due the
plaintiff that can only be ascertained by an accounting.”  (Teselle v. McLoughlin (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 156, 179, internal
citations omitted.)  “An action for
accounting is not available where the plaintiff alleges the right to recover a
sum certain or a sum that can be made certain by calculation.”  (Id., internal citations omitted.)
Plaintiffs’ FAC seeks to recover
$57,500 pursuant to Kiavand’s Application and Entitlement.  (FAC 2:6-9, 3:3.)  However, a cause of action for an accounting
is not available for recovery of this sum certain.  (Teselle v. McLoughlin (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th at pg. 179.)
Accordingly, Defendant’s
demurrer to Kiavand’s 1st cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Intentional Infliction of Distress (2nd COA)
“A cause of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress [“IIED”] exists when there is ‘(1)
extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing,
or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2)
the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual
and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous
conduct.’ A defendant’s conduct is ‘outrageous’ when it is so ‘extreme as to
exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.’ And the
defendant’s conduct must be ‘intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the
realization that injury will result.’” (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050-1051.)
A business entity cannot bring a
claim for IIED.  (Huntingdon Life
Sciences, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1228,
1260.)
Here, Plaintiffs allege Kiavand
is a California limited liability company.  (FAC 1:28.)  Therefore, Kiavand cannot, as a matter of law,
assert a cause of action for IIED.  (Huntingdon Life
Sciences, Inc.,
129 Cal.App.4th at pg. 1260.)  Further,
Plaintiffs fail to allege facts supporting a cause of action by Zarrin against
Defendant; the FAC does not state any facts related to Zarrin.  (See FAC.) 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 2nd cause of action is sustained without leave to amend as to any claim
by Kiavand against Defendant and sustained with 20 days leave to amend as to any claim by Zarrin
against Defendant.
 
Abuse of Process
(3rd COA)
“The tort of abuse of process
arises when one uses the court’s process for a purpose other than that for
which the process was designed . . .. To succeed in an action for abuse of process,
a litigant must establish two elements: that the defendant (1) contemplated an
ulterior motive in using the process; and (2) committed a willful act in the
use of the process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceedings.”  (Braim v. Kennard (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 40, 44.)
Plaintiffs fail to allege any
facts stating that Defendant used the judicial process against Kiavand.  (See FAC.)  Plaintiffs solely allege
Kiavand submitted the Application to HCD and had an Entitlement.  None of these allegations relate to the use
of the judicial process.
Accordingly, Defendant’s
demurrer to the 3rd cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Violation of the 5th Amendment of the United States
Constitution for Taking (4th COA)
The state and federal Constitutions guarantee real property
owners “just compensation” when their land is “taken . . . for public use . .
..”  (Cal. Const., art. I, §19; U.S.
Const. amend. V; Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (2005) 544 U.S. 528, 537;
Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 12-13.) 
The Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause, made applicable to
the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, does not prohibit the taking of
private property, but instead places a condition on the exercise of that power.
 (Lingle, 544 U.S. at pgs. 536-537.)
 “In other words, it ‘is designed not to
limit the governmental interference with property rights per se, but rather to
secure compensation in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to
a taking.’”  (Id.)
Regulatory takings challenges are governed by the standards
set forth in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City (1978) 438 U.S.
104.  The Penn Central acknowledged
that it had hitherto been “unable to develop any ‘set formula’” for evaluating
regulatory takings claims, but identified “several factors that have particular
significance.”  (Penn Central Transp.
Co., 438 U.S. at pg. 124.)  Primary
among those factors are “[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the
claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulation has interfered
with distinct investment-backed expectations.”  (Id.)  In addition, the “character of the
governmental action”—for instance whether it amounts to a physical invasion or
instead merely affects property interests through “some public program
adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common
good”—may be relevant in discerning whether a taking has occurred.  (Id.)  “The Penn Central factors—though each
has given rise to vexing subsidiary questions—have served as the principal
guidelines for resolving regulatory takings claims that do not fall within the
physical takings or Lucas rules.”  (Lingle, 544 U.S. at pg. 539.)
Here, Plaintiffs fail to allege the character of the
governmental action—whether the alleged taking amounts to a physical invasion
or merely affects property interests.  (Penn
Central Transp. Co., 438 U.S. at pg. 124.) 
Further, Plaintiffs fail to allege the extent to which the alleged
regulation at issue interfered with distinct investment-backed
expectations.  (Id.)  Finally, and most importantly, as stated earlier,
Plaintiffs fail to allege a property interest in the ERAP benefits that is
recognized by law.  (See
State Rental Assistance Program Guidelines (September 27, 2021) Department of
Housing and Community Development (as of May 15, 2024), §§8.1, 9.1.)
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 4th cause
of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s unopposed demurrer to Plaintiffs’ entire FAC
is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
Defendant’s unopposed demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 1st, 2nd,
3rd, and 4th causes of action is sustained with leave to amend.  Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 2nd cause
of action as it is alleged by Kiavand against Defendant is sustained without leave to amend.
Moving Party to give notice.

Motion to Strike
In light of the Court’s ruling
on Defendant’s demurrer, Defendant’s motion to strike is denied as moot.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion to strike is
denied as moot.
