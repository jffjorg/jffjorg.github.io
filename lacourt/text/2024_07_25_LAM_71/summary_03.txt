The case is between Kiavand LLC and Shahrokh Zarrin (Plaintiffs) and the State of California, Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) (Defendant).

The Judge sustained HCD's demurrer to the entire complaint, with 20 days leave to amend, except for the second cause of action which was alleged by Kiavand against HCD and was sustained without leave to amend. The Judge also sustained HCD's demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action with 20 days leave to amend. The motion to strike was denied as moot. The Judge's ruling is based on the legal sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint and the standards set forth in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City.
