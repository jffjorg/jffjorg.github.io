And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in case number 23STCV01612, granting Stylenquaza, LLC's motion to quash the order denying the motion to quash. This ruling is based on the Court of Appeal's Alternative Writ of Mandate, which ordered the Court to vacate the previous order denying the motion to quash and enter a new order granting the motion. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff did not meet its burden of proof on the threshold issue of purposeful availment of California's law, and therefore grants the motion to quash. The Judge also references a previous case, Brown, Winfield & Canzoneri, Inc. v. Superior Court (2010) 47 Cal.4th 1233, 1250-51, fn. 10, which provides guidance on the Court's obligations in responding to the Court of Appeal's order.
