And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a tentative discovery plan proposed by plaintiff Jose Licea in his lawsuit against Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. under the California Invasion of Privacy Act. The plaintiff alleges that Hilton deploys spyware on its website, which accesses visitors' devices and installs tracking spyware without obtaining consent. The plaintiff seeks to conduct jurisdictional discovery to determine if Hilton has jurisdiction over him.

The court has approved the plaintiff's discovery plan, which includes conducting the deposition of Hilton's corporate designee(s) and propounding limited written discovery upon Hilton. The court has also continued the status conference and defendant's motion to quash service of summons to December 6, 2024.

The defendant has objected to the discovery plan, arguing that it is overly broad and that the answers to the questions posed in the plan will "unequivocally confirm that there is no basis for personal jurisdiction over Hilton Worldwide Holdings." The defendant has also requested that the court shift its fees and costs incurred in defending this matter or to award fees and costs if (and when) discovery again confirms there is no basis for jurisdiction over Hilton.
