And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion by the plaintiff, John M.E.L. Doe, to compel the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), to provide further responses to requests for production of documents and special interrogatories. The plaintiff is seeking information and documents related to his childhood sexual abuse by Vance Miller, a former employee of LAUSD.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the production of yearbooks predating the 1996-1997 school year, but has denied the motion to compel the disclosure of contact information of students in those yearbooks. The judge has found that the request for contact information is overly broad and burdensome, and has ordered the plaintiff to conduct his own investigation to identify specific individuals who may have witnessed or complained of Miller's conduct before revisiting the issue with the court.

The judge has also ordered LAUSD to produce yearbooks up to five years predating the 1996-1997 school year within 30 days of the order. The plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories is denied.
