Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' submissions and has made several findings. Firstly, the court notes that Lab Zero's defamation claim lacks minimal merit and that the company's request for discovery is untimely. The court also finds that the absence of argument on the Slack messages sent through the platform is a failure of the moving party to meet its burden to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on these allegations.

The court then turns to the Eighth Cause of Action for Intentional Interference with Contractual Relationships and finds that it is complex and difficult to analyze. The court notes that the language of the cause of action incorporates all of the prior paragraphs of the complaint and identifies very few facts in support of the cause of action.

The court also finds that the companies' press releases do not specifically refer to Cartwright's Tweet, but a fair inference to be drawn is that Cartwright's Tweet, recitation of events, and decision to leave Lab Zero played a part in the various companies' decisions to sever their relationship with Lab Zero.

Finally, the court denies Lab Zero's request to amend the complaint, citing the anti-SLAPP statute and previous case law. The court also strikes reference to defamation in support of the Eighth Cause of Action and finds that the Tweet is not stricken.
