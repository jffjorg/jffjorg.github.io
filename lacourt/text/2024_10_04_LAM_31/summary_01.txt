```
Case Number: 21STCV12297
Hearing Date: October 4, 2024
Dept: 31

Plaintiffs and Cross-Defendants:
- Mariel Cartwright
- Francesca Esquenazi
- Future Club, Inc.

Defendant and Cross-Complainant:
- Lab Zero, Inc.

Factual and Procedural Background:
- Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Lab Zero for retaliation in violation of FEHA and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.
- Lab Zero filed a cross-complaint against Cartwright, Esquenazi, and Future Club for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duties, misappropriation of trade secrets, conversion, intentional interference with contractual relations, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, defamation, and unfair business practices.

Legal Standard:
- The anti-SLAPP statute provides a procedure for weeding out meritless claims arising from protected activity.
- To establish a probability of prevailing on a claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment.

Analysis:

Prong 1: Lab Zero's Probability of Prevailing on Claims
- Lab Zero failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its claims.

Prong 2: Lab Zero's Defamation Claim (Tenth Cause of Action)
- The alleged defamatory statements concern Zaimont's sexual harassment of Cartwright and others, which relates to Lab Zero's affairs as a corporation.
- The statements are false because Cartwright did not welcome Zaimont's conduct and complained about it to him.
- Lab Zero's argument that Cartwright welcomed Zaimont's conduct lacks merit.
- The court finds that Zaimont is a limited public figure and actual malice must be shown.
- Lab Zero failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a probability of prevailing by clear and convincing evidence that Cross-Defendants published the Tweet with knowledge of or reckless disregard for its falsity.

Conclusion:
- The court grants Cross-Defendants' motion to strike Lab Zero's defamation claim (tenth cause of action) as to Cartwright and Esquenazi.
- The court denies Lab Zero's motion to strike the eighth cause of action (defamation) as to Cartwright.
- The court sets a supplemental briefing schedule for Lab Zero to address the merits of the motions as to the eleventh cause of action (unfair business practices).
