BACKGROUND
            On May 17, 2023, plaintiffs John
Yelusich and Donna Yelusich filed a complaint against Driftwood Healthcare
Center, Driftwood Healthcare & Wellness Center, LLC, Citrus Wellness
Center, LLC, Torrance Memorial Medical Center, Torrance Health Association,
Inc., Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center – Torrance, Providence

LEGAL AUTHORITY
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. 
Taylor v. City of Los Angeles
Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. 
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.”  SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.  “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747. 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case “with reasonable
precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the
defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of action.” Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal. App. 2d 636, 643-44.
The court may, upon a motion, or at
any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  CCP § 436(a). 
The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court.  CCP §436(b).  The grounds for a motion to strike are that
the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws.  CCP
§436.  The grounds for moving to strike
must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  CCP §437.
DISCUSSION
Demurrer
Defendants Providence demur to the 2nd
cause of action for elder abuse in the complaint on the ground that it fails to
state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.
            The complaint alleges that on March
10, 2022, plaintiff John Yelusich was taken by ambulance to the ER of defendant
Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center – San Pedro, after passing out
at home.  Complaint, ¶20.  At Providence, he was diagnosed with
hemiparesis of his left side.  An x-ray
was taken and defendant’s staff misdiagnosed and/or failed to ascertain that
plaintiff had suffered a T-10 compression fracture.  Plaintiff was given a shot of morphine and
just three pain pills (Vicodin).  After
his discharge from Providence, he continued to suffer excruciating pain.  Id., ¶21.
            Plaintiffs allege that on March 24,
2022, plaintiff who had been in extreme pain since his discharge from
Providence, suffered a stroke and was taken by paramedics to defendant Torrance
Memorial Medical Center.  Plaintiff had
suffered a hemorrhagic bleed stroke and became partially paralyzed.  Plaintiff suffered from facial droop, speech
issues, tongue maneuvering issues, paralysis in the left arm and hand, left leg
and drop toe.  He was left incontinent of
bowel and bladder.  Id., ¶22.  Plaintiff continued to complain of back
pain.  An x-ray of the thoracic spine
revealed a compression fracture at T-10. 
Id., ¶23.
            Plaintiffs further allege that on
April 15, 2022, plaintiff was discharged to defendant Driftwood Healthcare
Center for rehabilitation.  Upon
admission, plaintiff was still paralyzed and weak on the left side.  He continued to suffer from
incontinence.  Id., ¶24.  Plaintiff developed a pressure injury while
at Driftwood.  Plaintiff was unable to
swallow food properly (which Driftwood staff failed to diagnose and/or timely
diagnose), and he lost weight and became malnourished and/or dehydrated.  Plaintiff would need to swallow “10 times” in
order to swallow a bite of food and get something into his stomach.  Plaintiff’s weight dropped to 165 lbs.  Id., ¶25. 
On July 1, 2022, plaintiff was discharged home.  Id., ¶26.
            Plaintiff further alleges that he
had always had a big appetite and his wife could not understand why he was
eating so little.  She realized he had
swallowing issues and began feeding him small amounts of pureed food and
protein drinks.  Id., ¶27.
            Plaintiff also alleges that on
August 3, 2022, plaintiff was admitted to Providence because he was borderline
septic, he had a suspected UTI, he was not responding well, and he was
suffering from confusion.  Plaintiff was
malnourished no matter what his wife could get him to eat and he had lost
approximately 65 lbs. from March 10, 2022. 
Id., ¶28.  At Providence, a
swallowing evaluation was conducted and plaintiff’s ability was noted as
dysfunctional.  Plaintiff was given
hydration, antibiotics, and a new Foley catheter.  Id., ¶29. 
On August 9, 2022, plaintiff was discharged home with home care.  Id., ¶30.
            2nd cause of action
for elder abuse
In order to state a cause of action
under the Elder Abuse Act, “a plaintiff must allege conduct essentially
equivalent to conduct that would support recovery of punitive damages.” Covenant
Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal. 4th 771, 789.  
 “Neglect” is defined in section 15610.57 as
“(a). . . . (1) The negligent failure of any person having the care or custody
of an elder . . . to exercise that degree of care that a reasonable person in a
like position would exercise. . . .(b) Neglect includes, but is not limited to,
all of the following: . . . (2) Failure to provide medical care for physical
and mental health needs.”
“It is true that statutory elder
abuse includes 'neglect as defined in Section 15610.57,' which in turn includes
negligent failure of an elder custodian 'to provide medical care for [the
elder's] physical and mental health needs' (§ 15610.57(b)(2)). . . . '[N]eglect'
within the meaning of [section 15610.57] covers an area of misconduct distinct
from 'professional negligence.'  As used
in the Act, neglect refers not to the substandard performance of medical
services but, rather, to the 'failure of those responsible for attending to the
basic needs and comforts of elderly or dependent adults, regardless of their
professional standing, to carry out their custodial obligations.'  Thus, the statutory definition of 'neglect'
speaks not of the undertaking of medical services, but of the failure to
provide medical care.  Notably, the other
forms of abuse, as defined in the Act--physical abuse and fiduciary abuse
[§15657]--are forms of intentional wrongdoing also distinct from 'professional
negligence.'"  Covenant Care,
Inc., supra, at 783.
“[T]he facts constituting the
neglect and establishing the causal link between the neglect and the injury
‘must be pleaded with particularity,’ in accordance with the pleading rules
governing statutory claims.”  Carter
v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley (2011) 198 Cal. App. 4th
396, 407 (citing Covenant Care). 
“Allegations of misconduct directed against one defendant . . . do not
state a cause of action against another defendant against whom the allegations
of misconduct are not directed.”  Id.
at 410 (citation omitted).  “[W]hen a
plaintiff asserts a claim against a health care provider on a legal theory
other than professional negligence, courts must determine whether the claim is
nonetheless based on the health care provider’s professional negligence.”  Larson v. UHS of Rancho Springs, Inc.
(2014) 230 Cal. App. 4th 336, 347 (citation omitted).  Citing to the content of the definition of
“neglect” in Welf. and Inst. Code 15610.57(b), the Supreme Court stated,
“[w]hat they each seem to contemplate is the existence of a robust caretaking
or custodial relationship—that is, a relationship where a certain party has
assumed a significant measure of responsibility for attending to one or more of
an elder’s basic needs that an able-bodied and fully competent adult would
ordinarily be capable of managing without assistance.”  Winn v. Pioneer Medical Group, Inc.
(2016) 63 Cal. 4th 148, 58. 
“What seems beyond doubt is that the Legislature enacted a scheme
distinguishing between – and decidedly not lumping together – claims of
professional negligence and neglect.”  Id.
at 159.
            Plaintiffs allege that defendants
were responsible for the care or custody of plaintiff.  Complaint, ¶61.  Plaintiff was in a caretaking or custodial
relationship with defendants.  Id., ¶62.  Defendants had a substantial caretaking or
custodial relationship, involving ongoing responsibility for one or more basic
needs of plaintiff such as nutrition, hydration, hygiene, and/or medical care.  Id., ¶63. 
Defendants engaged in conduct which resulted in plaintiff being
subjected to “physical abuse,” “neglect,” “financial abuse,” “abandonment,”
“isolation,” and “abduction” as defined under Elder Abuse Act, Welf. &
Inst. Code §15600, et seq.  Id., ¶69.  Defendants neglected plaintiff by, in part,
failing to assist in personal hygiene and/or in the provision of food, clothing
or shelter, failing to provide medical care for plaintiff’s physical and mental
health needs, failing to protect from health and safety hazards, failing to
prevent malnutrition and/or dehydration, and/or failing to ensure adequate
supervision of plaintiff who was left unsupervised, unmonitored, and unassisted
on many occasions and who suffered the development and/or worsening of pressure
injuries.  Id., ¶70.  Defendants breached their duties to plaintiff
under the Elder Abuse Act and the duties owed under state and federal nursing
home regulations and failed to require others under their supervision and
control to do so, even though said laws/regulations are minimum standards of
care which were established to protect elderly patients in nursing homes from
unnecessary exposure to health and safety hazards.  Id., ¶72. 
Defendants’ staff knew that plaintiff’s pressure ulcers were getting
worse, but defendants continually failed to follow the patient care plan or
reassess his condition and implement a new care plan based on his worsening
condition.  Defendants failed to transfer
plaintiff to an appropriate medical facility trained to properly care for
plaintiff’s condition.  Id., ¶76.  
            Defendants Providence argue that the
complaint raises issues pertaining to medical services (subject to theory of
negligence), not custodial caretaking (subject to theory of abuse).  Citing to Winn, supra, defendants
argue that a theory of elder abuse is not available for medical services that
an able bodied person would not provide for themselves.  Defendants assert that plaintiff’s
allegations show that he relied on Providence the way a person would rely on a
hospital as a medical provider, as a person requiring hospitalization, and not
as a custodial caregiver attending to basic needs that an able-bodied adult
could manage without assistance.  See
also Kruthanooch v. Glendale Adventist Medical Center (2022) 83 Cal.
App. 5th 1109, 1131 (“We are not persuaded that a hospital
necessarily assumes a robust caretaking or custodial relationship and ongoing
responsibility for the basic needs of every person admitted.”) (citations
omitted).  Defendants further assert that
the allegations as to Providence-San Pedro do not suggest a custodial caretaker
relationship as plaintiff’s first encounter was on March 10, 2022 at the ER and
from August 3-9, 2022 when he was malnourished and where he received a
swallowing evaluation, hydration, antibiotics, and a new Foley catheter.  Also, plaintiff alleges that the pressure
injury occurred at Driftwood.  Defendants
further contend that plaintiff’s allegations refer to Providence hospitals’
acts or omissions as a hospital providing professional medical services, “the
sort of conduct triggering more conventional tort liability for medical
negligence.”  Also, defendants assert,
plaintiff allegations are improperly alleged generally against all the
defendants.  Defendants also point out
that there are no allegations as to Providence-Torrance.  Moreover, defendants argue, there are no
allegations of willful misconduct.
            There is no opposition.
            The court finds that the allegations
are insufficient to constitute a cause of action for elder abuse against the
Providence defendants for the reasons argued by defendants.  The allegations are insufficient that
Providence defendants were custodial caretakers of plaintiff.  Rather, plaintiff alleges that Providence
negligently provided medical services.  There
are also no allegations of willful misconduct as to the Providence defendants.
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND as to the 2nd cause of action.
            Motion to Strike
            The
Providence defendants request that the court strike the 2nd cause of
action for elder abuse/willful misconduct (paras. 59-135), allegations of
punitive damages and attorney fees in the 2nd cause of action
(paras. 94, 113, 121-122, 134), and prayer for relief at 1. For attorney’s fees
and 4. For punitive and exemplary damages.
Civil Code §3294 authorizes the
recovery of punitive damages in non-contract cases where “the defendant has
been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice . . . .”  The Court in Taylor v. Superior Court
(1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 894-95, found that “[s]omething more than the mere
commission of a tort is always required for punitive damages.  There must be circumstances of aggravation or
outrage, such as spite or ‘malice,’ or a fraudulent or evil motive on the part
of the defendant, or such a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests
of others that his conduct may be called willful or wanton.” 
“’Malice’ means conduct which is
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” 
Civil Code §3294(c)(1).   
As the Court noted in College
Hospital v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 713, Section 3294 was
amended in 1987 to require that, where malice is based on a defendant’s
conscious disregard of a plaintiff’s rights, the conduct must be both
despicable and willful.  The Court in College
Hospital held further that “despicable conduct refers to circumstances that
are base, vile, or contemptible.”  Id.
at 725 (citation omitted).  In order to
be entitled to the heightened remedies set forth in the Elder Abuse Act,
Welfare & Institutions Code §15657, the plaintiff must establish
“recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice in the commission of this abuse” by
“clear and convincing evidence.”
Defendants argue that the 2nd
cause of action fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action
for elder abuse against them.  Defendants
further argue that plaintiff has not alleged facts showing oppression, fraud,
or malice.  Defendants also contend that because
the allegations arise from alleged professional negligence, a claim for
punitive damages cannot be asserted without prior permission from the court
pursuant to CCP §425.13.  Defendants
further assert that because plaintiff has not alleged sufficiently a cause of
action for elder abuse, plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney’s fees.
In light of the ruling on the
demurrer as to the 2nd cause of action, the motion is GRANTED.
Moving defendants are ordered to
give notice of ruling.

In order to state a cause of action
under the Elder Abuse Act, “a plaintiff must allege conduct essentially

 “Neglect” is defined in section 15610.57 as

“[T]he facts constituting the

‘must be pleaded with particularity,’ in accordance with the pleading rules
governing statutory claims.”  Carter
v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley (2011) 198 Cal. App. 4th
396, 407 (citing Covenant Care). 
“Allegations of misconduct directed against one defendant . . . do not

“neglect” in Welf. and Inst. Code 15610.57(b), the Supreme Court stated,
“[w]hat they each seem to contemplate is the existence of a robust caretaking
or custodial relationship—that is, a relationship where a certain party has

“What seems beyond doubt is that the Legislature enacted a scheme

159.
            Plaintiffs allege that defendants
were responsible for the care or custody of plaintiff.  Complaint, ¶61.  Plaintiff was in a caretaking or custodial
relationship with defendants.  Id., ¶62.  Defendants had a substantial caretaking or
custodial relationship, involving ongoing responsibility for one or more basic
needs of plaintiff such as nutrition, hydration, hygiene, and/or medical care.  Id., ¶63. 
Defendants engaged in conduct which resulted in plaintiff being
subjected to “physical abuse,” “neglect,” “financial abuse,” “abandonment,”
“isolation,” and “abduction” as defined under Elder Abuse Act, Welf. &
Inst. Code §15600, et seq.  Id., ¶69.  Defendants neglected plaintiff by, in part,
failing to assist in personal hygiene and/or in the provision of food, clothing
or shelter, failing to provide medical care for plaintiff’s physical and mental
health needs, failing to protect from health and safety hazards, failing to
prevent malnutrition and/or dehydration, and/or failing to ensure adequate
supervision of plaintiff who was left unsupervised, unmonitored, and unassisted
on many occasions and who suffered the development and/or worsening of pressure
injuries.  Id., ¶70.  Defendants breached their duties to plaintiff
under the Elder Abuse Act and the duties owed under state and federal nursing
home regulations and failed to require others under their supervision and
control to do so, even though said laws/regulations are minimum standards of
care which were established to protect elderly patients in nursing homes from
unnecessary exposure to health and safety hazards.  Id., ¶72. 
Defendants’ staff knew that plaintiff’s pressure ulcers were getting
worse, but defendants continually failed to follow the patient care plan or
reassess his condition and implement a new care plan based on his worsening
condition.  Defendants failed to transfer
plaintiff to an appropriate medical facility trained to properly care for
plaintiff’s condition.  Id., ¶76.  
            Defendants Torrance contend that
according to the timeline of events alleged by plaintiffs, the alleged harm
suffered by plaintiff did not occur while at moving defendants’ facility.  Rather, plaintiffs allege that the pressure
ulcers occurred after discharge from moving defendants’ facility.  Also, defendants assert, the only specific
allegations attributed to moving defendants “suggest that Movants made
diagnoses related to Plaintiff’s stroke and spinal compression fracture,
treatment which is not complained of.”  Defendants
further argue that the allegations are conclusory and not specifically pled as
required under the Elder Abuse Act. 
Defendants contend that the allegations do not show that defendants had
a robust, custodial or substantial caretaking relationship.  Defendants assert that plaintiff’s care was
episodic and provided on a limited basis, such that he was admitted to movant’s
hospital for acute care related to his stroke and discharged within three
weeks.  There are also no allegations of
reckless, oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious conduct by moving defendants or
their affiliates.
            There is no opposition.
            The court finds that the allegations
are insufficient to constitute a cause of action for elder abuse against the Torrance
defendants for the reasons argued by defendants.  The allegations are insufficient that moving
defendants were in a “robust, custodial or substantial” caretaking
relationship.  The allegations also do
not support reckless, oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious conduct.  Rather, the allegations sound in medical
negligence only.
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND as to the 2nd cause of action.
            Motion to Strike
            The
Torrance defendants request that the court strike the 2nd cause of
action for elder abuse/willful misconduct (paras. 59-135) and allegations relating
to or supporting any award of punitive damages and attorney fees, including prayer
for relief at 1. For attorney’s fees and 4. For punitive and exemplary damages.
Civil Code §3294 authorizes the
recovery of punitive damages in non-contract cases where “the defendant has
been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice . . . .”  The Court in Taylor v. Superior Court
(1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 894-95, found that “[s]omething more than the mere
commission of a tort is always required for punitive damages.  There must be circumstances of aggravation or
outrage, such as spite or ‘malice,’ or a fraudulent or evil motive on the part
of the defendant, or such a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests
of others that his conduct may be called willful or wanton.” 
“’Malice’ means conduct which is
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” 
Civil Code §3294(c)(1).   
As the Court noted in College
Hospital v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 713, Section 3294 was
amended in 1987 to require that, where malice is based on a defendant’s
conscious disregard of a plaintiff’s rights, the conduct must be both
despicable and willful.  The Court in College
Hospital held further that “despicable conduct refers to circumstances that
are base, vile, or contemptible.”  Id.
at 725 (citation omitted).  In order to
be entitled to the heightened remedies set forth in the Elder Abuse Act,
Welfare & Institutions Code §15657, the plaintiff must establish
“recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice in the commission of this abuse” by
“clear and convincing evidence.”
Defendants argue that the 2nd
cause of action fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action
for elder abuse against them.  Defendants
further argue that plaintiffs have not alleged facts showing oppression, fraud,
or malice.  Defendants also contend that
CCP §425.13 precludes claims for punitive damages in medical negligence actions
absent prior court order.  Further,
defendants argue, plaintiffs have not alleged any intentional conduct by moving
defendants which caused plaintiffs’ harm.   
In light of the ruling on the
demurrer as to the 2nd cause of action, the motion is GRANTED.
Moving defendants are ordered to
give notice of ruling.
