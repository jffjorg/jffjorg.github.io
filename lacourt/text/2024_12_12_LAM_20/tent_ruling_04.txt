 Defendant Raul Eduardo Valdivia seeks to dismiss this action because he is not a necessary party and is irrelevant to Plaintiffs’ claims.  Defendant states that he “has never dealt with Plaintiffs and is not a part of [Defendant] Hogares Realty or Valdivia Tax Services (Declaration of Raul Eduardo Valdivia). In fact, Raul Eduardo Valdivia is not a real estate agent (Decl. of Valdivia, Exh. A). He is a history major at Cal State Fullerton (Decl. of Valdivia, Exh. B). Other than sharing a similar name to someone who may be a part of Hogares Realty/Valdivia Tax Services, Raul Eduardo Valdivia is not a relevant or proper party to this action.”Defendant cites CCP § 430.10(d), which relates to demurrers.The instant “motion to dismiss” is an improper summary judgment motion that does not meet the requisite procedural requirements.  Indeed, Defendant is attempting to use evidence to defeat the Complaint.Thus, the Motion is denied.  If Defendant has no involvement in the underlying controversy of this matter, then Plaintiffs should file a request for dismissal.  Moving party to give notice.
