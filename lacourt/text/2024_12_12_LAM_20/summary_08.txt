And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Dylan Perry as the plaintiff and Scott Marecek, MD as the defendant. The defendant had previously filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, which was sustained without leave to amend. The defendant has now moved for the plaintiff to post a $25,000 security due to the plaintiff being declared a vexatious litigant and having little chance of prevailing in the litigation. The judge has denied the motion as moot, stating that given the previous ruling on the demurrer, there is no reason for the plaintiff to furnish the security. As a result, the case will be dismissed.
