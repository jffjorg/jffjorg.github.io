 On August 13, 2024, Plaintiff Dylan Perry filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).On October, 14, 2024, the Court sustained Defendant Scott Marecek, MD’s demurrer to the SAC, without leave to amend. Defendant Scott Marecek, MD now seeks for Plaintiff to furnish a $25,000 security because he has been declared a vexatious litigant and has little chance of prevailing herein.  A defendant may move the court for an order requiring plaintiff to post a bond on the ground that plaintiff is a vexatious litigant and “there is not a reasonable probability that they will prevail in the litigation against the moving defendant.”  (CCP § 391.1(a).)If the motion is granted, the case is automatically stayed from the time the motion was filed until 10 days after plaintiff posts the required security.  (CCP § 391.6.)While the stay is in effect, the court may not proceed to rule on discovery motions including those seeking sanctions against the vexatious litigant.  (Hanna v. Little League Baseball, Inc. (2020) 53 Cal.5th 871, 876.)  If the bond is not posted, the action must be dismissed as to the defendant in whose favor the bond was ordered.  (CCP § 391.4.)Given the ruling on Defendant’s demurrer, there is no reason that Plaintiff would furnish a security.  This case will be dismissed. The Motion is denied as moot.Moving party to give notice.
