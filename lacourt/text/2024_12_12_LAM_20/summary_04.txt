And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Raul Eduardo Valdivia's motion to dismiss the action. Defendant claims he is not a necessary party and is irrelevant to Plaintiffs' claims, stating that he has no involvement in the underlying controversy and is not a real estate agent. The judge finds that Defendant's motion is an improper summary judgment motion and does not meet the requisite procedural requirements. Instead, if Defendant has no involvement in the matter, Plaintiffs should file a request for dismissal.
