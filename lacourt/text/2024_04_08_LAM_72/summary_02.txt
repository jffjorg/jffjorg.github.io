And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling imposing sanctions on both J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (J.G. Wentworth) and its attorney, James Felton. The sanctions are a result of J.G. Wentworth's ex parte application to advance a hearing date, which was supported by a false declaration by Felton. The declaration stated that the respondent had requested to advance the hearing date, when in fact the respondent had asked J.G. Wentworth to cancel the agreement. The court relied on this untrue statement and granted the ex parte relief, causing a burden to the court and the interests of judicial economy. As a result, the court imposes sanctions of $500 on both Felton and J.G. Wentworth, payable within 30 days.
