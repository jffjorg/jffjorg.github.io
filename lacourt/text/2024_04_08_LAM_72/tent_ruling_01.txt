ALICIA AVILA MARTINEZ, et al.,

 Case No: 
  22STCV39938
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  April 8, 2024
 Calendar Number:  2



 
 
 
Plaintiffs Alicia Avila Martinez, Gerardo Quiroz, Valeria
Gonzalez Martinez, Jose Guzman, Liczy Guzman, Hillary Tadeo Islas Gonzalez (by
and through her guardian ad litem Valeria Gonzalez Martinez), Vilma Lopez,
Edverth Lopez, Maria Lopez, Kimberly Lopez, Karicia Lopez, and Kevin Cardenas (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) seek default judgment against Defendants Ferman Ceja and Teresa
Ceja (collectively, “Defendants”).
 
Plaintiffs request damages in the amount of $8,500,000.00. 
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ request for default judgment as
currently requested.  Plaintiffs must
submit a Form CIV-100.  Moreover, the
current complaint does not support a default damage amount of $8,500,000.  Plaintiff may wish to change their request
for damages or amend the Complaint.
 
The Court sets a status conference re default judgment for
June 17, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.  Plaintiffs to
give notice.
 
Background
 
This is a landlord-tenant case. Plaintiffs lived at various
properties owned by Defendants at 1605, 1607, and 1607 1/2 W. 12th Street, Los
Angeles, California 90015 (collectively, the “Properties”).
 
Plaintiffs allege that the Properties suffered from a myriad
of issues, including bed bug, cockroach, and rat infestations, plumbing and
electrical problems, mold, crumbling walls and ceilings, heating issues,
unreliable water, broken windows, and unstable foundations. Since 2007, the Los
Angeles Housing Department (“LAHD”) has issued at least eight Notices and
Orders to Comply to Defendants for violations of housing and health and safety
laws at the Properties. 
 
Plaintiffs repeatedly complained of the conditions of the
Properties to Defendants, but Defendants did not resolve the problems.
Defendants and their agents also threatened to evict Plaintiffs, failed to give
proper notice of entry to Plaintiffs’ units, and screamed at Plaintiffs.
 
Plaintiffs filed this action on December 22, 2022. The
Complaint asserts 12 causes of action: (1) Negligence; (2) Breach of Implied
Warranty of Habitability; (3) Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; (4)
Nuisance; (5) Premises Liability; (6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress; (7) Violation of Civil Code Section 1942.4 (Collection of Rent on
Substandard Dwelling Units); (8) Willful Interruption of Services; (9) Retaliation;
(10) Harassment; (11) Violation of the Unfair Competition Law (Business and
Professions Code Section 17200 et seq.); and (12) Violation of Tenant
Anti-Harassment Ordinance (Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 45.30 et seq.).
 
Default was entered against Defendants on January 4, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7));
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
             
 
Discussion
 
As an initial matter, Plaintiffs have not submitted a Form
CIV-100 seeking default judgment. They must do so before the Court can grant default
judgment.
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
            On
August 17, 2023, the Court ordered service by publication as to both Defendants.
Plaintiffs filed proof of publication in the Los Angeles Daily Journal on
October 31, 2023.
 
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
On March 21, 2024 Plaintiff requested that the Doe
defendants be dismissed. 
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Laura Matter avers to Defendants’ nonmilitary status.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiffs provide a brief summary of the case. Plaintiffs
adequately pleads their causes of action in the Complaint.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 580 prohibits the entry of
a default judgment in an amount in excess of that demanded in the complaint.”  (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011)
201 Cal.App.4th 267, 286.) Moreover, “a statement of damages cannot be relied
upon to establish a plaintiff's monetary damages, except in cases of personal
injury or wrongful death.” (Ibid.) “In all other cases, when recovering
damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is limited to the damages
specified in the complaint.” (Ibid.) Moreover, a plaintiff must submit admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362.)
 
            Plaintiffs
request $8,500,000.00 in damages, as well as punitive damages in an amount that
they do not specify. The Complaint does not appear to demand this amount in
damages. While the Complaint request certain civil penalties on a
‘per-violation’ basis, it does not clearly demand a specific amount. Plaintiffs
are limited to the actual amount of damages demanded in the Complaint and must
therefore either amend and republish the Complaint or amend their request for
default judgment.
 
 
Interest
 
Plaintiffs do not request pre-judgment interest.
 
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiffs do not request costs.
 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiffs
do not request attorney’s fees.
 
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
            Plaintiffs
have submitted a proposed form of judgment as required.
 
 
Statement of Damages
 
Plaintiff does not need to submit a statement of damages
because this is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.
