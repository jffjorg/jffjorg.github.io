And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has found that the parties failed to follow the court's directions during the trial setting conference and failed to properly prepare the administrative record. The parties' counsel are admonished to follow the court's directions in future writs cases. The judge also rules that the Commission should not have considered Principal Frias' notes as evidence of a pattern of misconduct, as they were hearsay and not properly authenticated. The judge has not addressed the Commission's opposition regarding Sorensen's alleged unprofessional conduct, immoral conduct, and acts of moral turpitude.
