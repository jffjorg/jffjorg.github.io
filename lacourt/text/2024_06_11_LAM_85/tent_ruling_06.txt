Bank failed to provide the court with a courtesy copy of its opposition,
including its 82-page Request for Judicial Notice, in violation of the
Presiding Judge’s First Amended General Order on Electronic Filing.  Bank’s counsel is admonished to provide
courtesy copies in all future matters in this case.


[2] The courts look to the substance of an
injunction to determine whether it is prohibitory or mandatory.  Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. v.
Superior Court, (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 709, 713.  A mandatory injunction — one that mandates a
party to affirmatively act, carries a heavy burden: “[t]he granting of a
mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.”  Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v.
Furlotti, (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 187, 1493.


[3] However, a court may issue an injunction to
maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the complaint.  CCP §526(a)(3).

Bank’s request for judicial notice of Garner’s bankruptcy filings (Exs. 1-3) is
granted.  Evid. Code §452(d).


[5] The
parties address this standing argument by citing to federal cases without
providing hard copies to the court. 
While CRC 3.1113(i) does not mandate hard copies of non-California
authority without a court order, it is a good practice to provide them to the
court.


[6] Bank
notes (Opp. at 5-6) that a HOBR violation will not support a preliminary
injunction unless it is material.  Civil
Code §2924.12(a)(1).  A material
violation is one where “the alleged violation affected a plaintiff's loan
obligations or the modification process.” 
Cornejo v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, (E.D. Cal. 2015) 151
F.Supp.3d 1102, 1113.  Plainly, Bank’s
failure to act on Garner’s loan modification application before foreclosure is
a material violation.
