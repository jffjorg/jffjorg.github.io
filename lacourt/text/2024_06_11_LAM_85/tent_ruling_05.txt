Rasheeda Garner v. Bank of America N.A., et al.,
24STCV09252

Tentative decision on application for preliminary
injunction:  denied unless corrected by date
of hearing



 
 
Plaintiff Rasheeda Garner (“Garner”) applies for a
preliminary injunction enjoining Defendant Bank of America N.A. (“Bank”) from foreclosing
on the real property located at 2923 S Victoria Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90016 (“Property”).  
The court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition,[1]
and reply and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of the Case
1. Complaint
Plaintiff Garner commenced this proceeding on April 12, 2024.
 Garner filed the First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) on April 25, 2024, against Defendants Bank, Val-Chris Investments, Inc.
(“Val-Chris”), and California TD Specialists (“CA TD”), alleging causes of
action for violation of (1) Civil Code section 2923.6, (3) Civil Code section
2923.7, (3) Civil Code section 2924c, and (4) Bus. & Prof. Code sections
17200 et seq.  The verified FAC
alleges as follows.
On August 22, 2003, Plaintiff Garner inherited the Property
and has resided in it for over 20 years. 

On August 2, 2007, Garner took out a loan for $520,000 and
concurrently executed a Deed of Trust (“DOT”) as security for the note.  Defendant Bank is the servicer of the loan. 
On March 23, 2023, Garner took out a second position loan
for $430,000 with Defendant Val-Chris.  
In May or June 2023, Garner’s ability to pay the loans was impacted.
 She contacted Bank and requested
forbearance on its loan.  Bank granted
Plaintiff a three-month forbearance on her loan.  In September 2023, Garner called Bank to
request an extension to her forbearance period.  A representative from Bank informed Garner over
the phone that she would be approved for an extension.  She was later informed that she had been
denied an extension.
On August 15, 2023, Garner requested a reinstatement demand
from Val-Chris.  On November 30, 2023, a
Notice of Default (“NOD”) was recorded on the Property for the Val-Chris loan.  After the NOD was recorded, Garner asked Val-Chris
to refinance the loan.  She was informed
that Val-Chris would look into refinancing her loan, but eventually it refused.
On December 7, 2023, Bank recorded a NOD on the Property for
its loan.
In December 2023 or January 2024, Garner submitted a loan
modification application to Bank.  Since
then, Bank has been requesting documents periodically from Garner and she has
complied by sending more documentation.
On March 6, 2024, Garner secured a lender to refinance both
loans and received a letter of intent for a payoff.  However, on March 14, 2024, a Notice of Trustee’s
Sale (“NOS”) was recorded on the property for the Bank loan.  Garner was under the impression that she was
in active loan modification review with Bank.  After the NOS was recorded by Bank, the lender
Garner which had intended to refinance both loans backed out.
On March 20, 2024, Plaintiff received a reinstatement
calculation from Bank with an offer good through April 17, 2024.
On March 21, 2024, Defendant Val-Crhis recorded a NOS on the
Property.  Defendant CA TD is the
Trustee.
On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff sent a letter to Bank informing
it that she is in active modification review, has been responding to each
request for information, and that she would like to work out a loan
modification plan.  On April 5, 2024, Bank
requested more documentation, and she submitted the information on April 11,
2024.  To date, Garner has never received
a modification denial letter from Bank and has continuously been asked to
provide more documentation.
On April 15, 2024, Garner requested a second reinstatement
demand from Defendant Val-Chris to reinstate the loan.  She received a demand for payoff from Val-Chris
totaling $499,851.21 to be paid by April 30, 2024.  Garner’s agent informed Val-Chris that she was
requesting a reinstatement demand, not a payoff demand.  Val-Chris would not offer a reinstatement on
the loan because the sale was within five business days.
Deficiencies in Bank’s Loan Assistance Department have
deprived Garner of the chance to cure her loan’s delinquency and be evaluated
for a loan modification.  Deficiencies in
Val-Chris’ loan department have left Garner’s attempts at reinstatement have
gone unanswered.  As a result of both
failures, she stands to lose her home.
 
2. Course of Proceedings
On April 16, 2024, the court granted Garner’s ex parte application for temporary
restraining order (“TRO”) enjoining Bank’s trustee sale set to occur on April
18, 2024, and issued an order to show cause re: preliminary injunction (“OSC”).  
According to proofs of service on file, Bank was personally
served with the Summons and Complaint on April 15, 2024.  The moving papers were served on Bank via
email on April 17, 2024.  There are no
proofs of service on file for Defendants Val-Chris and CA TD.
On April 25, 2024,
Bank requested a continuance of the OSC hearing under CCP section 527(d)(4).  The request was granted and the OSC hearing
was continued to the instant date.
 
B. Applicable Law
An injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to
refrain from a particular act; it may be granted by the court in which the
action is brought, or by a judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may
be enforced as an order of the court. 
CCP §525.  An injunction may be
more completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to
perform or to refrain from performing a particular act.  See Comfort v. Comfort, (1941)
17 Cal.2d 736, 741. McDowell v. Watson, (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.[2]  It is an equitable remedy available generally
in the protection or to prevent the invasion of a legal right.  Meridian, Ltd. v. City and County of San
Francisco, et al., (1939) 13 Cal.2d 424.
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status
quo pending final resolution upon a trial. 
See Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc., (1988) 205
Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe v. Cortlandt Corp., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313,
1316; Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn., (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618,
623.  The status quo has been
defined to mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded
the pending controversy.  Voorhies v.
Greene (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995, quoting United Railroads v.
Superior Court, (1916) 172 Cal. 80, 87. 14859 Moorpark
Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp., (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.
A preliminary injunction is issued after hearing on a
noticed motion.  The complaint normally
must plead injunctive relief.  CCP
§526(a)(1)-(2).[3]  Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief.  See e.g. Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green, (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based on a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate,
facts.  See CCP §527(a).  For this reason, a pleading alone rarely
suffices.  Weil & Brown, California
Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group 2007).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
moving party.  O’Connell v. Superior
Court, (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481. 
A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence
of an adequate damages remedy at law. 
CCP §526(4); Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors,
(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307; Department of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood
Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.  The concept of “inadequacy of the legal
remedy” or “inadequacy of damages” dates from the time of the early courts of
chancery, the idea being that an injunction is an unusual or extraordinary
equitable remedy which will not be granted if the remedy at law (usually
damages) will adequately compensate the injured plaintiff.  Department of Fish & Game v.
Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.
In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction,
the trial court considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the
plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial (CCP §526(a)(1)), and (2) a
balancing of the “irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if
the injunction is denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely
to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s
Assn. v. VRT Corp., (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402; Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283; Davenport v.
Blue Cross of California, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446; Abrams v. St.
Johns Hospital, (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636.  Thus, a preliminary injunction may not issue
without some showing of potential entitlement to such relief.  Doe v. Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th
296, 304.  The decision to grant a
preliminary injunction generally lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.  Thornton v. Carlson, (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.
A preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect
unless and until the plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the
enjoined defendant may sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally
decides that the plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction.  See CCP §529(a); City of South San
Francisco v. Cypress Lawn Cemetery Assn., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.

2. Defendant Bank’s
Evidence[4]
Garner
filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy court on April 29, 2024.  RJN Ex. 1. 
Garner’s bankruptcy schedules were filed on May 13, 2024.  RJN Ex. 2. 
Garner’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan was filed on May 13, 2024.  RJN Ex. 3.
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff Garner seeks to enjoin Bank’s foreclosure sale of
the Property.  Bank opposes.
 
1. Standing
Bank cites federal bankruptcy law as follows.[5]  Opp. at 3-4. 
The ownership rights of the debtor in the property of the estate are
limited.  In re Aneiro, (Bankr.
S.D. Cal. 1987) 72 B.R. 424, 429-30  (citation omitted).  “As a general matter, upon the filing of a
petition for bankruptcy, ‘all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in
property’ become the property of the bankruptcy estate and will be distributed
to the debtor’s creditors. [11 U.S.C.] section 541(a)(1).”  Rousey v. Jacoway, (20050 544 U.S. 320,
325.  
A Chapter 13 debtor has concurrent standing with the
bankruptcy trustee to pursue state claims.  Calvin v. Potter, (ND. Ill. 2009) 2009
WL 2588884 at *2.  However, a Chapter 13
debtor has standing to prosecute legal claims only to the extent the debtor
brings those claims for the benefit of the estate, and not for the debtor’s
benefit.  Miller v. Greenleaf
Orthopaedic Assoc., (N.D. Ill. 2012) 2012 WL 4049409 at *6.  "A Chapter 13 debtor . . . has standing
to bring a claim in his own name for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate, but
not for his own personal benefit. Where, as here, a Chapter 13 debtor has not
disclosed legal claims in his bankruptcy proceeding, he cannot claim to be
bringing them for the benefit of his estate."  King v. Indiana Harbor Belt R.R. Co.,
(N.D. Ind. Mar. 30, 2018) 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54288, 2018 WL 1566821 at
*3.  
Bank argues that Garner’s Bankruptcy Plan does not reference
this lawsuit and does not specify that any non-exempt proceeds from the lawsuit
will be distributed among the unsecured creditors.  As such, Garner is attempting to pursue the claims
for her own benefit, rather than that of the estate.  Opp. at 3-4.
Garner replies that Rousey v Jacoway was a Chapter 7
bankruptcy case, and a Chapter 13 debtor has concurrent standing with the
bankruptcy trustee to pursue state claims. 
Calvin v. Potter, (ND. Ill. 2009) 2009 WL 2588884 at *2.  A Chapter 13 bankruptcy estate encompasses
all property, including legal claims, acquired after the petition is filed and
before the case is closed. Rainey v. United Parcel Service, Inc., (7th
Cir. 2012) 466 F. App'x 542, 544. Debtors have an ongoing duty to disclose and
schedule newly acquired assets while the bankruptcy case is open.  Id. at 544.  Reply at 2.
Under bankruptcy rules, a voluntary petition, list,
schedule, or statement may be amended by the debtor as a matter of course at
any time before the case is closed.  Garner’s bankruptcy case is open and can still
be amended.  On May 31, 2024, the 341(a)
Meeting of Creditors was continued to June 25, 2024. The schedules in Garner’s
bankruptcy case are in the process of being amended and there is no confirmed
plan yet. Therefore, Plaintiff has standing. 
Reply at 2-3.
Garner may have the right to amend her Schedules and
Bankruptcy Plan, but she has yet to do so. 
She also fails to explain why this case was not listed on them
initially.  As of right now, Garner lacks
standing to pursue a preliminary injunction.
 
2. Probability of Success
A preliminary injunction may not issue without some showing
of probability of success.  Doe v.
Wilson, supra, 57 Cal.App.4th at 304.  Garner asserts that Bank violated the Homeowners
Bill of Rights (“HOBR”) by recording a NOS before providing her with a written
determination on her loan modification application (Civil Code §2923.6) and failing
to provide her with a single point of contact (Civil Code §2923.7).  She further asserts that she is likely to
prevail on her unfair business practice claim (Bus. & Prof. Code §17200).  
 
a. Definition of HOBR Borrower
Bank argues that the HOBR does not apply to “[a]n individual
who has filed a case under Chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13 of Title 11 of the United
States Code and the bankruptcy court has not entered an order closing or
dismissing the bankruptcy case, or granting relief from a stay of
foreclosure.”  Civil Code
§2920.5(c)(2)(C).  Since Garner is
currently engaged in an active Chapter 13 bankruptcy, she cannot avail herself
to the protections of the HOBR.  Opp. at 6.
Garner replies that she can assert HOBR claims that arose
when she was not in bankruptcy.  In Morris
v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., (“Morris”) (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th
279, the court noted that, for HBOR to apply, the plaintiff would need to
allege that she was not in active bankruptcy during the relevant time because
section 2920.5(c)(2)(C) excludes an individual who is pursuing such a
proceeding from the definition of a “borrower” authorized to bring claims
asserting HBOR violations.  Id. at
289.  The court determined that the
borrower adequately alleged that she was a statutorily recognized “borrower”
under the HBOR because the bank’s violations occurred in between the borrower’s
second and third bankruptcies, and its resumption of the foreclosure process
and the loan servicer’s conduct of the sale took place after the stay was
lifted on the third bankruptcy.  Id.
at 297.  Reply at 5.
Garner filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on April 29, 2024,
three weeks after filing this lawsuit.  Bank’s violations occurred prior to her bankruptcy
filings, and she is protected under the HBOR. 
Reply at 5.
Garner in part miscites Morris, which was referring
to the trial court’s ruling when it stated that the plaintiff would need to
allege that she was not in active bankruptcy. 
Id. at 289.  Nonetheless, the
appellate court’s analysis supports Garner by stating that the HOBR provisions
apply to a borrower (Civil Code §3924.12(a)), the definition of a “borrower”
excludes a person in bankruptcy (Civil Code §2920.5(c)(1)), and the plaintiff
could make a HOBR claim for the periods she was not in active bankruptcy.  Id. at 298-99.  Based on Morris, if Garner has concurrent
standing with the bankruptcy trustee to pursue state claims, she can pursue
HOBR claims that arose when she met the definition of borrower under Morris.
 
b. Civil Code §2923.6
Civil Code section 2923.6 provides that if a borrower submits
a complete application for a first lien loan modification offered by the bank
or loan servicer, the bank may not record a notice of default, notice of sale,
or conduct a trustee’s sale while the application is pending.  Civil Code §2923.6(c).  An application is complete when all documents
required by the bank are submitted within a reasonable time frame specified by
the bank.  Civil Code §2923.6(h); Valbuena
v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1267,
1273.  Before proceeding with
foreclosure, the bank must make a written determination that the borrower is
not eligible for a loan modification and must give the borrower at least 30
days from the written denial to appeal and provide evidence that the
determination was in error.  Civil Code
§2923.6(d).  If there is an appeal, the
bank must deny the appeal and wait another 15 days to proceed with
foreclosure.  Civil Code
§2923.6(e)(2).  The anti-dual tracking
provisions do not apply to borrowers who have already been evaluated for a
modification unless the borrower documents a material change in financial
circumstances.  Civil Code §2923.6(g).
Garner presents evidence that she inherited the Property and
has resided there for 20 years.  She
submitted a complete loan modification package to Bank in December 2023 or
January 2024 and has been in active loan modification review since then.  She has received numerous requests for more
information and has provided the information requested.  She has yet to receive a denial of her loan
modification application.  Despite this
fact, Bank recorded an NOS on March 14, 2024. 
Garner concludes that this is a per se violation of Civil Code
section 2923.6.  App. at 4-5.
Bank responds that Civil Code section 2923.6 only applies to
a complete loan modification application and an application is not complete
until the borrower has supplied all required documents within a reasonable
timeframe.  Civil Code §2923.6(h).  Bank argues that Garner does not allege that
she submitted a complete loan application, and the fact that she is still
submitting documents indicates otherwise. 
Opp. at 4-5.
It is true that Garner does not expressly state that the
loan modification application she submitted in December 2023 or January 2024 was
complete.  The court would like to have
seen the application itself attached as an exhibit to evaluate its
completeness.  On the other hand, there
is no evidence or even an indication from Bank that the application is not
complete.  The fact that Bank has
periodically asked Garner for documents does not mean the application is
incomplete.  Lenders are notorious for
asking for the same documents repeatedly.[6] 
Although it is barely true, Garner has shown a reasonable
probability of success on the merits that she has a claim under Civil Code
section 2923.6.  
 
c. Civil Code §2923.7
Civil Code section 2923.7 requires that the mortgage
servicer establish a single point of contact for a borrower who requests a
foreclosure prevention alternative.  That
single point of contact is responsible for communicating the process,
coordinating receipt of all required documents, and having access to
individuals with the ability to stop foreclosure proceedings when
necessary.  
Garner asserts that she was never provided with a single
point of contact, both for her loan modification application and for all its
statutory duties. Mot. at 5.  She
provides no evidence on this issue.  Bank
argues that the active review of her loan application suggests otherwise.  Opp. at 5.
Garner has not shown a reasonable probability of success on
her claim under Civil Code section 2923.7. 

 
 
d. Unlawful Business Practice
Garner alleges a cause of action for violation of Business
and Professions Code section 17200.  This
section prohibits any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business practice.  Each of the three prongs is an independent
basis for relief.  Smith v. State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 700,
718.  Unlawful conduct is defined as any
practice forbidden by law.  Farmers
Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court, (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 383.  A business practice is unfair when it
violates the spirit of a law, or an established public policy.  People v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes,
Inc., (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 509, 530. 

Because Garner is likely to prevail on her claims under
Civil Code section 2923.6, she is also likely to prevail on her claim under the
unfair competition law.  Bank argues that
Garmer must establish injury-in-fact by the loss of money or property (Opp. at
7), but it is self-evident that she has done so because she will lose the
Property.
 
3. Balance of Harms
The court must balance the irreparable harm that Garner is
likely to sustain if the injunction is denied as compared to the harm that Bank
is likely to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s
Assn. v. VRT Corp., supra, 63 Cal.App.4th at 1402; Pillsbury,
Madison & Sutro v. Schectman, supra, 55 Cal.App.4th at
1283.  
Garner alleges that she will suffer irreparable harm if the
foreclosure sale is permitted to go forward because she stands to lose her
residence.  The law presumes that the
loss of a personal residence is irreparable harm.  App. at 7-8. 
Bank, on the other hand, will not suffer any loss beyond a delay in the
foreclosure should it prevail in the lawsuit. 

The balance of harms weighs in favor of a preliminary
injunction.  
 
E. Conclusion
The application for preliminary injunction is denied because
Garner lacks standing to present her claim. 
If she cures the defect in her bankruptcy before the hearing, the
preliminary injunction will be granted.  
If so, the court must impose a bond on Garner for the
preliminary injunction.  The purpose of a
bond is to cover the defendant’s damages from an improvidently issued
injunction.  CCP §529(a).  In setting the bond, the court must assume
that the preliminary injunction was wrongly issued.  Abba Rubber Co. v. Seaquist, (“Abba”)
(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1, 15.  The
attorney’s fees necessary to successfully procure a final decision dissolving
the injunction also are damages that should be included in setting the bond.  Id. at 15-16.  While Abba reasoned that the
plaintiff’s likelihood of prevailing is irrelevant to setting the bond, a more
recent case disagreed, stating that the greater the likelihood of the plaintiff
prevailing, the less likely the preliminary injunction will have been wrongly
issued, and that is a relevant factor for setting the bond.  Oiye v. Fox, (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th
1036, 1062.  The court has authority to
waive a bond if it determines that the principal is indigent and unable to
obtain sufficient sureties.  CCP
§995.240; Conover v. Hall, (1974) (court has the power to dispense with
bond requirements intended to protect an adversary’s financial interests).  If a bond is required, the court will discuss
the amount of the bond with the parties at the hearing.
