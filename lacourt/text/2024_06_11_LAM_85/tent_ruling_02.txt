[1] The
parties failed to follow the court’s direction at the February 1, 2024 trial
setting conference.  The parties prepared
a complete administrative record, but they failed to bates-stamp it from
beginning to end.  Rather, the reporter’s
transcripts of the three-day hearing are presented and cited separately.  
Additionally, Petitioner’s counsel failed to lodge a joint
appendix ten days before the hearing. 
When the clerk pointed this out and directed Petitioner’s counsel to
provide hard copies of all pages cited by the parties, counsel simply provided a
hard copy of the entire record.  Again,
this was improper.  Both parties’ counsel
are admonished to follow the court’s directions in future writs cases.

references are to the Education Code unless otherwise stated.


[3] For this reason, the
discussion in the Commission’s opposition that there was clear and convincing
evidence that Sorensen is guilty of unprofessional conduct, immoral conduct,
and acts of moral turpitude need not be addressed.  See Opp. at 11-13.  


[4] Sorensen
argues in reply that the Commission should not be able to rely on Principal
Frias’ notes -- a two-page document titled “Reported Concerns” (AR 158-59) -- to
establish a pattern of misconduct.  The
notes were not prepared by Principal Frias at the time of the meeting.  Principal Frias testified that he did not
create the notes; they came from “either our attorney or through our Department
of Human Resources.” RT Vol. I, p. 63.  The notes could not have been created on or
near November 4, 2019 since they reference an incident that occurred in January
of 2020. AR 160.  The Commission itself
considered the contents of the notes to be hearsay (AR 60) and should not have considered
them as evidencing a pattern of misconduct. AR 72 (citing AR 51-52, ¶20).  Reply at 7-8. 
This is a new issue raised in reply and has not been considered. Regency,
supra, 31 Cal.App.4th at 1333.
