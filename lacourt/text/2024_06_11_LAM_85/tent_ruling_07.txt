Inc. v. Caer, Inc.; 
24STCV10282

Tentative decision on application
for right to attach order: granted




 



Plaintiff Sensoryeffects Cereal Systems, Inc. (“SCSI”)
applies for right to attach order against Defendant Caer, Inc. dba Yumi (“Caer”).

The court has read and considered the moving papers (no
opposition was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint
Plaintiff SCSI commenced this action on April 24, 2024
against Defendant Caer, dba Yumi, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of
contract; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) breach of implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing; and (4) account stated. The verified Complaint alleges in
pertinent part as follows.
Plaintiff SCSI entered into an agreement with Defendant Caer
to manufacture and provide Defendant Caer with 50,000 pounds rice-free puffs in
the flavors of strawberry basil, apple and broccoli, and berry and sweet pea.  Compl., ¶¶2, 11-12.  Defendant Caer subsequently revised its
purchase order for 10,800 pounds rice-free puffs.  Compl., ¶¶2, 11-12.  Defendant Caer further requested that an
extra 10,000 pounds of the strawberry basil and apple broccoli flavors included
in the original order.  Compl., ¶¶2, 11-12.  
SCSI performed in accordance with the agreement.  Compl., ¶¶2, 13-16; Exs. A-B.  Caer has failed to remit payment on the
invoices despite benefitting from the receipt of the rice-free puffs by selling
the products for profit.  Compl., ¶¶3,
14-16.
On March 1, 2024, SCSI sent Caer correspondence regarding
Caer’s delinquent account and demanded immediate payment in the outstanding
amount owed.  Compl., ¶17, Ex. C.  On March 12, 2024, Caer sent email
correspondence acknowledging receipt of the March 1, 2024 email and demand
letter and did not dispute the amount demanded by SCSI.  Compl., ¶18, Ex. D.
Plaintiff SCSI seeks (1) $194,770.80 in unpaid invoices and
statutory interest from the date of breach at the maximum lawful rate, (2)
post-judgment interest at the maximum lawful rate, (3) reasonable attorney’s
fees, (4) costs of suit, (5) pre-judgment interest, and (6) other and further
relief the court deems just and proper. 
Compl., at 7:18-28; 8:1-18.
 
2. Course of Proceedings 
On April 30, 2024, this court denied SCSI’s ex parte
application for right to attach order and ex parte application temporary
protective order.
On  May 23, 2024,
Plaintiff SCSI filed a substitution of attorney.
A proof of service on file shows that Plaintiff SCSI served the
Summons, Complaint, and moving papers on Defendant Caer via personal service on
Defendant Caer’s authorized agent in Delaware on May 15, 2024.
 
B. Applicable Law
Attachment is a
prejudgment remedy providing for the seizure of one or more of the defendant’s
assets to aid in the collection of a money demand pending the outcome of the
trial of the action.  See Whitehouse
v. Six Corporation, (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 527, 533.  In 1972, and in a 1977 comprehensive
revision, the Legislature enacted attachment legislation (CCP §481.010 et seq.)
that meets the due process requirements set forth in Randone v. Appellate
Department, (1971) 5 Cal.3d 536.  See
Western Steel & Ship Repair v. RMI, (12986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1108,
1115.  As the attachment statutes are
purely the creation of the Legislature, they are strictly construed.  Vershbow v. Reiner, (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 879, 882.
A writ of attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred
dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the
amount due may be clearly ascertained from the contract and calculated by
evidence; the fact that damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v.
Super DVD, Inc., (“CIT”) (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540-41
(attachment appropriate for claim based on rent calculation for lease of
commercial equipment).
All property within
California of a corporation, association, or partnership is subject to
attachment if there is a method of levy for the property.  CCP §487.010(a), (b).  While a trustee is a natural person, a trust
is not.  Therefore, a trust’s property is
subject to attachment on the same basis as a corporation or partnership.  Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn &
Rossi v. Wilson, supra, 197 Cal.App.3d at 4.
The plaintiff may
apply for a right to attach order by noticing a hearing for the order and
serving the defendant with summons and complaint, notice of the application,
and supporting papers any time after filing the complaint.  CCP §484.010. 
Notice of the application must be given pursuant to CCP section 1005,
sixteen court days before the hearing.  See
ibid.
The notice of the
application and the application may be made on Judicial Council forms (Optional
Forms AT-105, 115).  The application must
be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented
would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.  CCP §484.030.  
Where the defendant
is a corporation, a general reference to “all corporate property which is
subject to attachment pursuant to subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure
Section 487.010” is sufficient.  CCP
§484.020(e).  Where the defendant is a
partnership or other unincorporated association, a reference to “all property
of the partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to
attachment pursuant to subdivision (b) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010”
is sufficient.  CCP §484.020(e).  A specific description of property is not
required for corporations and partnerships as they generally have no exempt
property.  Bank of America v. Salinas
Nissan, Inc., (“Bank of America”) (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.
A defendant who
opposes issuance of the order must file and serve a notice of opposition and
supporting affidavit as required by CCP section 484.060 not later than five
court days prior to the date set for hearing. 
CCP §484.050(e).  The notice of
opposition may be made on a Judicial Council form (Optional Form AT-155).  
The plaintiff may
file and serve a reply two court days prior to the date set for the
hearing.  CCP §484.060(c). 
At the hearing, the
court determines whether the plaintiff should receive a right to attach order
and whether any property which the plaintiff seeks to attach is exempt from
attachment.  The defendant may appear the
hearing.  CCP §484.050(h).  The court generally will evaluate the
attachment application based solely on the pleadings and supporting affidavits
without taking additional evidence.  Bank
of America, supra, 207 Cal.App.3d at 273.  A verified complaint may be used in lieu of
or in addition to an affidavit if it states evidentiary facts.  CCP §482.040. 
The plaintiff has the burden of proof, and the court is not required to
accept as true any affidavit even if it is undisputed.  See Bank of America, supra, at
271, 273.
The court may issue
a right to attach order (Optional Form AT-120) if the plaintiff shows all of
the following: (1) the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which
an attachment may be issued (CCP §484.090(a)(1)); (2) the plaintiff has established
the probable validity of the claim (CCP §484.090(a)(2)); (3) attachment is
sought for no purpose other than the recovery on the subject claim (CCP
§484.090(a)(3); and (4) the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater
than zero (CCP §484.090(a)(4)). 
A claim has
“probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
recover on that claim.  CCP §481.190.  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan
Electric Corp., (“Kemp”) (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.  The court does not determine whether the
claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not
affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
Except in unlawful
detainer actions, the amount to be secured by the attachment is the sum of (1)
the amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff, and (2)
any additional amount included by the court for estimate of costs and any allowable
attorneys’ fees under CCP section 482.110. 
CCP §483.015(a); Goldstein v. Barak Construction, (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 845, 852.  This amount must
be reduced by the sum of (1) the amount of indebtedness that the defendant has
in a money judgment against plaintiff, (2) the amount claimed in a
cross-complaint or affirmative defense and shown would be subject to attachment
against the plaintiff, and (3) the value of any security interest held by the
plaintiff in the defendant’s property, together with the amount by which the
acts of the plaintiff (or a prior holder of the security interest) have
decreased that security interest’s value. 
CCP §483.015(b); see also CCP §483.010(b) (“an attachment may not be
issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising
from agreement, statute, or other rule of law…However, an attachment may be
issued where the claim was originally so secured but, without any act of the
plaintiff or the person to whom the security was given, the security has become
valueless or has decreased in value to less than the amount then owing on the
claim).  A defendant claiming that the
amount to be secured should be reduced because of a cross-claim or affirmative
defense must make a prima facie showing that the claim would result in an
attachment against the plaintiff.
Before the issuance
of a writ of attachment, the plaintiff is required to file an undertaking to
pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful
attachment by the plaintiff in the action. 
CCP §489.210.  The undertaking
ordinarily is $10,000. CCP §489.220.  If
the defendant objects, the court may increase the amount of undertaking to the
amount determined as the probable recovery for wrongful attachment.  CCP §489.220. 
The court also has inherent authority to increase the amount of the
undertaking sua sponte.  North
Hollywood Marble Co. v. Superior Court, (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 683, 691.

On March 1, 2024,
SCSI sent Caer a formal demand letter for payment of the outstanding invoices
in full, which total $194,770.80, no later than March 6, 2024.  Dake Amended Decl., ¶8, Ex. F.  On March 12, 2024, Caer sent an email acknowledging
receipt of the March 1, 2024 demand letter and did not dispute the demanded

D. Analysis
Plaintiff SCSI
applies for a right to attach order against Caer for $205,557.03.  No opposition is on file.
 
1.     
A
Claim Based on a Contract and Which Attachment May Be Based
A writ of attachment may be issued only in an action on a
claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or
implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable
amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500).  CCP §483.010(a).  A claim is “readily ascertainable” where the
damages may be readily ascertained by reference to the contract and the basis
of the calculation appears to be reasonable and definite.  CIT, supra,
115 Cal.App.4th at 540-41.  The fact that
the damages are unliquidated is not determinative.  Id.  But
the contract must furnish a standard by which the amount may be ascertained and
there must be a basis by which the damages can be determined by proof.  Id.
(citations omitted). 
SCSI provides
evidence that, on or about September 5, 2023, it shipped 10,460 pounds of
organic strawberry basil rice-free puffs per Caer’s purchase order and shipping
instructions.  Dake Amended Decl., ¶5.  SCSI issued invoice number 5170 to Defendant
Caer in the amount of $103,972.40 with payment due on or before October 5,
2023.  Dake Amended Decl., ¶5, Ex. C.  On or about September 6, 2023, SCSI shipped another
10,720 pounds of organic apple and broccoli rice-free puffs per Caer’s purchase
order and shipping instructions.  Dake
Amended Decl., ¶6.  SCSI issued invoice
number 5173 to Caer in the amount of $90,798.40 with payment due on or before
October 6, 2023.  Dake Amended Decl., ¶6,
Ex. D.  Caer has failed to pay both invoices.  Dake Amended Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.
The purchase orders and invoices form a contract on which a
breach of contract claim may be based, and the amount owed of $194,770.80 is
readily ascertainable from the contract.
Additionally, SCSI seeks $9,890 in attorney fees and $896.23
in costs incurred to date.  Jaswal Decl.,
¶5.  Reasonable estimated attorney fees
may be included in an attachment.  CCP
§482.110.  The total readily
ascertainable amount is $205,557.03.
 
2.     
Probable
Validity of Breach of Contract Claim
A claim has
“probable validity” where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will
recover on that claim.  CCP
§481.190.  In determining this issue, the
court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective
parties.  Kemp, supra, 146 Cal.App.4th at
1484.  The court does not determine
whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial
and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order.  CCP §484.050(b).
When Carr failed to
pay the two invoices, SCSI sent an email to Caer requesting it pay the
outstanding amounts owed on invoice numbers 5170 and 5173.  Dake Amended Decl., ¶7, Ex. E.  On March 1, 2024, SCSI sent Caer a formal
demand letter for payment of the outstanding invoices totaling $194,770.80, no
later than March 6, 2024.  Dake Amended
Decl., ¶8, Ex. F.  On March 12, 2024,
Caer sent an email acknowledging receipt of the March 1, 2024 demand letter and
did not dispute the demanded amount. 
Dake Amended Decl., ¶9. 
SCSI has shown the
probable validity of its claim.
 
3.     
Attachment
Sought for a Proper Purpose 
Attachment must not be sought for a purpose other than the
recovery on the claim upon which attachment is based.¿ CCP §484.090(a)(3).  SCSI has shown a proper purpose for its
claim.
 
E. Conclusion
            Plaintiff SCSI’s
application for right to attach order against Defendant Caer in the amount of $205,557.03
is granted.  No writ may issue until SCSI
posts a $10,000 undertaking.  SCSI has
not filed a proposed right to attach order and must do so in the next two court
days or it will be waived.
