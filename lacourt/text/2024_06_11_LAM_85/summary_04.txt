And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has tentatively ruled that the City's request for judicial notice of certain documents is granted, except for the FAP and proofs of service, which can be reviewed in the court record. The court also noted that City Charter section 1017 contains requirements for a written claim for compensation, and that failure to comply with these requirements would bar compensation for a former employee, but would not be subject to demurrer. The court has also granted the City's request for judicial notice of exhibits A, I, C, and F. The court's tentative ruling is subject to change and will be finalized after further review and consideration."
