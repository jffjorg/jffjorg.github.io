And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's demurrer and denies the defendant's motion to strike. The plaintiff, Ivan Moore, filed a petition for writ of mandate after being discharged from his job by the City of Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA). The Commission upheld the discharge. Moore filed a Demand for Reinstatement and a claim for compensation, but the City argues that the allegations in the petition are inconsistent with the Demand and claim. The judge finds that the allegations are not inconsistent and that the City's remedy lies at trial, not in a demurrer.
