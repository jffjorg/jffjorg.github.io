REQUESTED
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiffs
were tenants of a single family welling at 32270 Saticoy Street, West Hills,
and allege unsanitary and/or unsafe conditions on the premises as a result of
improper maintenance and upkeep. 
 
On
October 17, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for Failure to Provide
Habitable Dwellings, Breach of Covenant of Right to Quiet Enjoyment and
Possession of the Property, Nuisance, and Negligence. Defendants answered the
complaint on February 23, 2023.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant, Samuel Welch moves to compel further responses to
request for production of documents, numbers 4, 9, and 12 from Plaintiff Derrick
Robinson. The responses consist of references to other items. 
 
Such responses
constitute an improper, factually incomplete answer. Responding Party may not
refer to prior discovery. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
783–784 [“Answers must be complete and responsive. Thus, it is not proper to
answer by stating, ‘See my deposition’, ’See my pleading’, or ‘See the
financial statement’”].)
 
The motion is therefore granted. Responding is ordered to
serve responses in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210-2031.240.
No sanctions requested. 
 
The court calendar shows eight remaining, scheduled motions
to compel further responses scheduled through July 22, 2024The motions appear
as a continuation of discovery issues addressed by the court in the 23 motions
to compel responses granted on November 22, 2023.
 
The court does not conduct any informal discovery conferences.
While the court understands the prior use and perhaps reliance on the IDC
system, the court finds the number of items on the court calendar through the
next three months presents a potentially inordinate burden. The court reserves
the right to set an OSC re: Discovery Referee in lieu of a hearing on any given
motion, and may take off any and all motions in lieu of the OSC hearing. The
court invites the parties to continue meeting and conferring, including the
provision of supplemental responses, when possible. 
 
Next
motions to compel further responses to request for production of documents and
form interrogatories from James Richardson scheduled for June 4 and 6, 2024, with
the next set addressing Noah Penn-El beginning on July 2, 2024.
 
Defendant
to give notice.
