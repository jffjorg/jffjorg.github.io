And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents. The defendant, Samuel Welch, had requested that the plaintiff, Derrick Robinson, provide further responses to requests 4, 9, and 12. The judge found that the plaintiff's responses were incomplete and factually inaccurate, citing the case of Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978). The judge ordered the plaintiff to serve responses in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.210-2031.240. The judge also reserved the right to set an OSC re: Discovery Referee in lieu of a hearing on any given motion, and may take off any and all motions in lieu of the OSC hearing.
