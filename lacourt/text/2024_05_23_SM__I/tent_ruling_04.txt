 Case Number:  22SMCV02357    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  I The court will CONTINUE THE MOTION for one week.  Plaintiff is ORDERED to be present at the
hearing (in person or by phone).  The
reason is that with the trial date coming, this withdrawal will prejudice
plaintiff.  The court needs to be sure
that plaintiff is aware of the upcoming FSC and trial dates and when plaintiff
was aware that counsel was going to withdraw. 
The court notes that counsel has declared that plaintiff was told of the
problem in 2023, which would mean that the prejudice is plaintiff’s fault.  But the court needs to get a better handle on
the time line to be sure that plaintiff was informed many months ago.  That said, at the end of the day the court
will ultimately grant the motion because counsel is no longer licensed.
