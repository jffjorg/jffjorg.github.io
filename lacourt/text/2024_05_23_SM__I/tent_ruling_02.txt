 Case Number:  22SMCV01328    Hearing Date:   May 23, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to strike the answer to the complaint is GRANTED;
the motion to strike the cross-complaint is DENIED.
 
Plaintiffs filed a breach of contract case against
defendant.  Defendant cross-complained in
November 2023, but did not file an answer. 
Defendant’s default was entered on 1/19/24 after which defendant
attempted to answer.  Plaintiff seeks to
strike the answer and the cross-complaint. 
The motion is not opposed.
 
Plaintiffs argue that there was no right to answer after
default was entered.  That is
correct.  Defendant must move to have the
default vacated (and win the motion) before filing an answer.  Therefore, the motion to strike the answer
must be GRANTED.  The cross complaint
issue is an odd one.  Generally a
cross-complaint is filed before or at the same time as the answer to the
complaint.  Thus, the statute is clear
that a cross-complaint may be filed before an answer.  (Code Civ. Proc. sec. 428.50.)  That is what happened here.  The cross-complaint was filed before the
default was taken, and it was therefore proper.
 
The court urges the parties to work together, at least on
procedure, rather than file or be forced to file motions such as these.  For example, the court anticipates a motion
to vacate the default and allow an answer to be taken.  Plaintiff should think long and hard about
whether there are really good grounds to oppose such a motion given
California’s strong public policy favoring resolutions on the merits.  If there is, then of course plaintiff can
oppose.  But if not, plaintiff ought to
consider allowing defendant to proceed by stipulation rather than forcing
defendant to file a motion and this court to work it up.
