And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the ex parte application to continue the trial made by CAIC. CAIC was recently added to the case and needs time to conduct discovery and potentially bring a summary judgment motion. The court finds that plaintiff's delay in naming and serving CAIC is a contributing factor in the request for a trial date change. The court grants the application and will discuss a new trial date with the parties.
