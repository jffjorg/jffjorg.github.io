The Judge's tentative ruling is to continue the motion to withdraw counsel for one week. The Plaintiff is ordered to be present at the hearing (in person or by phone) to ensure they are aware of the upcoming trial and FSC dates. The Judge notes that counsel declared the Plaintiff was informed of the problem in 2023, but the Judge needs to determine the timeline of when the Plaintiff was informed of the intended withdrawal. Despite this, the Judge intends to ultimately grant the motion due to counsel's lack of licensure.
