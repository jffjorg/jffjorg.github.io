And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to vacate default judgment against defendants Benson and Hicks. The motion is granted, but only to the extent that it is not moot. The default judgment was entered due to failure to serve the summons. However, the plaintiff re-served the defendants, restarting the clock and giving them the right to answer. The court believes that the defendants were not served and had no notice of the action. The defendants argue that they were not served due to the improper service at a We Works co-working space. The court grants the motion, but allows the defendants to file an answer within 2 court days.
