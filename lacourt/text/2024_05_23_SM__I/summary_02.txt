And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to strike the answer to the complaint and the cross-complaint. The motion to strike the answer is granted, as the defendant did not file an answer after the default was entered. The cross-complaint, however, is denied, as it was filed before the default and is therefore proper. The Judge urges the parties to work together and consider stipulating on procedure rather than filing motions.
