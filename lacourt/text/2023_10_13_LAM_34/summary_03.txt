And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to substitute Patricia Wondries as a defendant in place of Paul Wondries, who has died. The motion is denied without prejudice. The judge's decision is based on the requirement that Patricia Wondries must be served with the motion before the court can reach the merits of the case. The judge notes that there is no evidence that Patricia Wondries has been served with the motion, and therefore, the court cannot proceed with the motion at this time.
