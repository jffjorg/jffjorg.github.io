And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants the motion of the defendants, Big Bus Tours Los Angeles, Inc. and Open Top Sightseeing USA, to uphold the designation of a portion of a deposition transcript as "highly confidential". The motion was filed in response to the opposition of the plaintiff, Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc., which argued that the testimony at issue did not constitute highly sensitive financial information and that the designation was overly broad. The judge finds that the defendants designated the material as highly confidential in accordance with the timing allowed by the protective order and that release of the material would create a substantial risk of serious financial injury to the defendants if it was disclosed to a non-party, and this risk cannot be avoided by less restrictive means.
