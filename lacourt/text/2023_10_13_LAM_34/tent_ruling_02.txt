ANALYSIS:
 
        
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 gives
the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process. A court may impose terminating sanctions by
striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering
default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) A violation of a
discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions. (Collison
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating
sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's
orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795–796.)
 
A terminating sanction is a "drastic
measure which should be employed with caution." (Deyo, supra,
at p. 793.) 
 
"A decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v.
Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279–280.)
 
While the court has discretion to impose terminating
sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the dereliction and
should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party
entitled to but denied discovery." (Deyo, supra, 84
Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations." (Id.) Discovery sanctions are not to be
imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of
discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information. (See Midwife
v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as
stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971.)
 
"A trial court has broad discretion to
impose discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions . . . (1) absent unusual circumstances,
there must be a failure to comply with a court order, and (2) the failure must
be willful." (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1327; but see Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1291
["willfulness is no longer a requirement for the imposition of discovery
sanctions."].)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
A. 
    The
Parties’ Arguments
 
Defendant LA Valley Management, LLC moves the Court to dismiss
Plaintiff’s FAC and award monetary sanctions. (LAVM’s Motion, p. 8:16–20.)
Defendant LA Valley Management, LLC argues: (1) that the terminating sanction
requested is appropriate because Plaintiff failed to obey the Court’s Minute
Order dated July 17, 2023; and (2) that the monetary sanction is appropriate
for the costs and fees of filing its motion. (Id. at pp. 4:8–11,
5:24–28, 6:1–2, 8:9–14.)
 
Defendant Mayfair Square, LLC moves the Court to dismiss Plaintiff’s
FAC (or, in the alternative, to issue appropriate issue and evidentiary
sanctions), and impose monetary sanctions. (Mayfair Square’s Motion, p.
5:13–17.) Defendant Mayfair Square, LLC argues: (1) that these sanctions are
appropriate because Plaintiff has not served its further responses to discovery
or complied with the Court’s Minute Order dated July 17, 2023; and (2) that the
burden has now shifted from Defendant Mayfair Square, LLC, who has showed the
failure to obey the Court’s discovery order, to Plaintiff, who must establish a
satisfactory excuse. (Id. at pp. 3:2–4, 3:19–25, 5:6–8.)
 
        Plaintiff opposes the motions, arguing
as to both of them: (1) that terminating sanctions are only appropriate when a
party abuses discovery and willfully disobeys a court order, which did not
happen here; (2) that under the totality of circumstances, sanctions, and
especially terminating sanctions, are not appropriate; and (3) that Defendants’
unethical actions contributed to the delay of Plaintiff’s discovery responses.
(Opposition to LAVM’s Motion, pp. 5:6–7, 6:10–11, 8:1–2; Opposition to Mayfair
Square’s Motion, pp. 5:6–7, 6:10–11, 8:1–2.)
 
        In its Reply, Defendant LA Valley
Management, LLC argues: (1) that Plaintiff does not dispute that she failed to
comply with the Court’s discovery order; (2) that at no point did Plaintiff
serve Defendant LA Valley Management, LLC with a written request for a
continuance on her response deadline; (3) that terminating sanctions are
warranted against Plaintiff because she failed to comply with the Court’s
discovery order, which prejudiced Defendant LA Valley Management, LLC; and (4)
that there is no evidence indicating Defendant LA Valley Management, LLC’s
conduct was carried out for the purpose of preventing Plaintiff from complying
with the Court’s order. (Reply regarding LAVM’s Motion, pp. 3:2–3, 3:15–16,
4:14–16, 5:6–8.)
 
        In its Reply, Defendant Mayfair Square,
LLC argues that Plaintiff’s failure to participate in the litigation process is
prejudicial to Defendant Mayfair Square, LLC and hinders judicial efficiency.
(Reply regarding Mayfair Square’s Motion, p. 1:23–25.)
 
B. 
    Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel declares that the following discovery has occurred:
 
(1)      
On
September 8, 2023, Plaintiff produced, in an organized manner, a significant
amount of documents, including videos and photos; 
 
(2)      
On
September 12, 2023, Plaintiff served responses to Defendant LA Valley
Management, LLC’s special interrogatories and requests for production of
documents; 
 
(3)      
On
September 14, 2023, Plaintiff sat for her deposition, which was done in
accordance with the Court’s Minute Order dated July 31, 2023;
 
(4)      
On
September 18, 2023, Plaintiff served responses to Defendant LA Valley Management,
LLC’s form interrogatories; and
 
(5)      
On
September 19, 2023, Plaintiff served responses to Defendant Mayfair Square,
LLC’s discovery requests. 
 
(Decls. Darsky, ¶
6.)
 
        Given that
Plaintiff has substantially complied with all of the Court’s discovery orders,
the Court is satisfied that terminating sanctions are not appropriate. 
 
        As to
monetary sanctions, it is important to note that Plaintiff was unrepresented
from May 25, 2023 to August 16, 2023. (Minute Order dated May 25, 2023; Decls.
Darsky, ¶ 1.) To the pro per litigant,
“interrogatories, requests for admissions, law and motion proceedings, and the
like” are “baffling devices.”¿¿(Bruno v. Super. Ct. (1990) 219
Cal.App.3d 1359, 1363, quoting Burley v. Stein¿(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 752,
755, fn. 3.) “Providing access to justice for self-represented litigants is a
priority for California courts.”¿¿(California Rules of Court, rule 10.960(b).)
 
        Now that
Plaintiff is represented by counsel, to appears that she is complying with her
discovery obligations; further it appears that there has not been significant
prejudice to Defendants by her prior delay. Given these circumstances, monetary
sanctions are clearly inappropriate here.
 
        The
Court DENIES LAVM’s Motion. 
 
        The
Court DENIES Mayfair Square’s Motion. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
LAVM’s Motion is
DENIED. 
 
Mayfair Square’s
Motion is DENIED.
