Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motions of both Defendant LA Valley Management, LLC and Defendant Mayfair Square, LLC to dismiss Plaintiff Kristien Amer's First Amended Complaint with prejudice and to impose monetary sanctions. The Judge finds that while Plaintiff has failed to comply with some discovery orders, she has substantially complied with all of the Court's discovery orders and that terminating sanctions are not appropriate. The Judge also finds that monetary sanctions are not appropriate given that Plaintiff was unrepresented from May 25, 2023 to August 16, 2023 and that providing access to justice for self-represented litigants is a priority for California courts.
