And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents from Skydance Television, LLC and Potomac River Productions, LLC. The plaintiff, Dan Sackheim, is seeking an order compelling the defendants to provide further responses to his requests for production of documents, as well as monetary sanctions.

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel Skydance's further responses to requests for production of documents, numbers 8 and 17, because Skydance's assertions of compliance with the demands were incomplete and its representations of inability to comply were inadequate. However, the court has denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against Skydance.

The court has also granted the plaintiff's motion to compel Potomac's further response to request for production of documents, number 8, because Potomac's assertions of compliance with the demand were incomplete and its representations of inability to comply were inadequate. However, the court has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel Potomac's further responses to requests for production of documents, numbers 30 and 31, because Potomac's representations of inability to comply were not inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against Potomac. The court orders the defendants to serve further written responses to the plaintiff's requests for production of documents and to produce all responsive documents within 20 days of the date of this order.
