[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to deem requests for
  admission admitted
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Kimberlina Whettam
& Associates, Inc.      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Defendant Eric Bruget 
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc. (“Plaintiff”)
moves the court for an order (1) deeming admitted the matters specified in its
Requests for Admission, Set One, served on defendant Eric Bruget (“Defendant”),
and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $1,699. 
In opposition, Defendant has presented evidence of the Felony
Complaint filed against him on August 29, 2023, which alleges 33 counts of
grand theft by an employee or agent based on the allegations that Defendant
unlawfully took labor, money, and real and personal property from
Plaintiff.  (Bruget Decl., Ex. 1, pp.
1-15.)  Defendant asserts that he will be
moving to stay this action and for a protective order pending the conclusion of
the criminal proceedings.  Although
Defendant has not yet filed the motion to stay, counsel for Defendant has
reserved a hearing date of January 31, 2024 for his motion.  (Weinreb Decl., ¶ 5.)
The court exercises its discretion to continue the hearing on
Plaintiff’s motion to deem requests for admissions admitted to February 16,
2024, so that the court may first consider and rule on Defendant’s motion to
stay this action. 
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff Kimberlina Whettam & Associates, Inc.’s motion to deem requests
for admissions admitted is continued to February 16, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in
Department 53. 
            The court orders defendant Eric
Bruget to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 13, 2023
