The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with each
motion.  No reply papers were filed.
MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS FROM SKYDANCE TELEVISION, LLC
Plaintiff Dan Sackheim
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant Skydance
Television, LLC (“Skydance”) to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production of Documents, numbers 8 and 17, and (2) awarding
sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Skydance in the amount of $5,469.  (Nov. 29, 2023 Notice of Partial Withdrawal,
p. 2:6-9.)
The court grants Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Skydance’s further responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, numbers 8 and 17 because Skydance asserts both statements of
compliance with the demands, which are incomplete, and representations of its
inability to comply with the demands, which are inadequate.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subds. (a)(1),
(a)(2).)  Skydance is required to provide
a statement of compliance that complies with Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.220 or a representation of its inability to comply that complies with Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.230, but not both. 
The court finds that the
circumstances presented make the imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore
denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Skydance.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)

MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS FROM POTOMAC RIVER PRODUCTIONS, LCC
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling defendant Potomac River Productions, LLC (“Potomac”) to
provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents,
numbers 8, 30, and 31, and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Potomac in the amount of $5,469.
The court grants Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Potomac’s further response to Requests for Production of
Documents, number 8 because Potomac asserts both a statement of compliance with
the demand, which is incomplete, and a representation of its inability to
comply with the demand, which is inadequate. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subds. (a)(1), (a)(2).)  Potomac is required to provide a statement of
compliance that complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.220 or a
representation of its inability to comply that complies with Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.230, but not both. 
The court denies Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Potomac’s further responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, numbers 30 and 31 because Potomac’s representations of its inability
to comply with the demands are not inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2).) 
In light of the mixed results
of the court’s ruling on this motion, the court finds that the circumstances
presented make the imposition of sanctions unjust and therefore denies
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against Potomac.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd.
(h).)

Procedure sections 2031.210-2031.250, and (2) to produce to plaintiff Dan
Sackheim all documents and things in defendant Skydance Television, LLC’s
possession, custody, or control which are responsive to those requests, within
20 days of the date of this order. 
            The
court denies plaintiff Dan Sackheim’s request for monetary sanctions against
defendant Skydance Television, LLC. 
            The court grants in part plaintiff
Dan Sackheim’s motion to compel further responses to requests for production of
documents from Potomac River Productions, LLC as follows.

section 2031.310, the court orders defendant Potomac River Productions, LLC (1)
to serve on plaintiff Dan Sackheim a further written response to plaintiff Dan
Sackheim’s Requests for Production of Documents, number 8, which complies with Code of Civil Procedure sections
2031.210-2031.250, and (2) to produce to plaintiff Dan Sackheim all documents
and things in defendant Potomac River Productions, LLC’s possession, custody, or control which are
responsive to that request, within 20 days of the date of this order. 
            The
court denies plaintiff Dan Sackheim’s request for monetary sanctions against
defendant Potomac River Productions, LLC. 
            The court orders plaintiff Dan
Sackheim to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
