The court grants its own motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that it does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the First Amended Complaint because the causes of action alleged therein are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court. The court finds that the first through fourth, eighth, and ninth causes of action are based on Defendants' alleged actions in committing or assisting breaches of fiduciary duties to the Trust or the wrongful possession or misappropriation of Trust property, and therefore are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court.

The court notes that Plaintiffs did not specifically allege that the savings bonds constitute Trust property. The court finds that the burden is on the plaintiff to articulate how it can amend its pleading to render it sufficient, and that Plaintiffs have not met their burden to establish how they can amend their complaint to bring it within the jurisdiction of this court.
