Roles:
  - Judge: Edward B. Moreton, Jr.
  - Plaintiff: Aaron Celious
  - Defendant: City of Los Angeles, et al.
Significant Statements:
  - "A disappointed bidder, like Plaintiff or his company Maroon, cannot assert any tort or breach of contract claim arising out of the misaward of a public contract."
  - "The only possible cause of action for monetary relief available in the disappointed bidder context is a claim for promissory estoppel that seeks to recover the bid preparation costs of the disappointed bidder and does not include lost profits."
  - "Public entities are immune from liability unless such liability is expressly provided for by statute or by the constitution."
  - "Every alleged act by the City-Employee Defendants involves the award of a public contract and is therefore within their discretionary act immunity."
```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's claims for fraud, negligence, and violation of 42 U.S.C. §1983 are subject to demurrer. The judge also finds that the plaintiff cannot state a claim for promissory estoppel because the RFPs explicitly reserved the right to reject all bids and required the bidder to waive any right to recover pre-contractual costs. The judge further finds that the City-Employee Defendants are absolutely immune to liability under Government Code sections 820.2, 821, and 822.2.
