And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the motion to quash service of the summons and complaint filed by Jonathan S. Woo is granted. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to present evidence showing when, after filing the complaint, they discovered Jonathan Woo's identity, which prevents them from carrying their burden of proving the facts requisite to an effective service of process. The court also notes that the plaintiff knew Jonathan Woo's identity by December 20, 2023, but failed to amend the complaint to add him as a defendant until April 2, 2024. As a result, the court grants the motion and quashes service of the summons and complaint on Jonathan Woo. The court also sets an OSC re: dismissal of Defendant Jonathan Woo for failure to file proof of service of the summons and complaint on September 9, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
