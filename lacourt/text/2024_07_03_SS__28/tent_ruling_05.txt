considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as
follows.  
BACKGROUND 
On
November 1, 2022, Plaintiffs Jerry Guerra Jr. (“Guerra”) and Theresa Galvan
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Shirley Woo (“Shirley Woo”)
and Does 1-50 for negligence. 
On
September 7, 2023, the Court dismissed Guerra from the complaint with prejudice
at Plaintiffs’ request. 
On
November 7, 2023, Shirley Woo filed an answer. 
 On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to include Defendant Jonathan S. Woo as Doe 1 (“Jonathan Woo”). 
On
May 2, 2024, Jonathan Woo filed a motion to quash service of the summons and
complaint, to be heard on June 4, 2024. The Court continued the hearing to June
10, 2024. On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On May 29, 2024,
Jonathan Woo filed a reply. 
On
June 10, 2024, the Court issued a tentative ruling, heard argument, and
continued the hearing to July 3, 2024. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for September 23, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Jonathan
Woo, specially appearing, asks the Court to quash service of the summons and
complaint. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 474 provides in part: 
“When the plaintiff is ignorant of the name of a
defendant, he must state that fact in the complaint, or the affidavit if the
action is commenced by affidavit, and such defendant may be designated in any
pleading or proceeding by any name, and when his true name is discovered, the
pleading or proceeding must be amended accordingly . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 474.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 418.10 provides in part: 
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her
time to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause
allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following
purposes: 
“(1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack
of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10.
subd. (a)(1).) 
A
motion made under Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10 does not constitute an
appearance unless a court denies the motion. 
(See L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (Rutter 2023) (Cal. Practice Guide) ¶ 3:376, p. 3-116 [“If the
motion is denied, defendant is deemed to have made a general appearance –
waiving any jurisdictional objection – upon entry of the order denying the
motion” (emphasis omitted)].) 
“
‘Although a proper basis for personal jurisdiction exists and notice is given
in a manner which satisfied the constitutional requirements of due process,
service of summons is not effective and the court does not acquire jurisdiction
of the party unless the statutory requirements for service of summons are met.’
” (Engebretson & Co. v. Harrison (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 436, 443 (Engebretson),
quoting Schering Corp. v. Superior Court (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 737, 741.) 
DISCUSSION 
Jonathan
Woo argues that Plaintiff was not ignorant of his name when Plaintiff filed the
complaint on November 1, 2022.  At
Plaintiff’s April 23, 2024 deposition, Plaintiff acknowledged that after the
accident, Plaintiff interacted with Jonathan Woo for several minutes,
exchanging driver’s licenses, insurance paperwork, and phone numbers.  Based on this interaction, Plaintiff reached
conclusions about Jonathan Woo’s approximate age, ethnicity, and height.  Therefore, Jonathan Woo argues, Plaintiff has
known about his identity since the November 6, 2021 accident, including when
she filed the complaint. 
Jonathan
Woo also argues that, even assuming Plaintiff did not know his identity when
she filed the complaint, Plaintiff did not promptly amend the complaint upon
discovering his name.  He notes that
Plaintiff identified him as a “driver” and listed his address in Plaintiff’s
December 20, 2023 answers to Shirley Woo’s form interrogatories.  Nonetheless, Jonathan Woo contends, Plaintiff
did not amend the complaint to add him as a defendant until April 2, 2024,
which was more than two years after the November 6, 2021 accident and therefore
beyond the statute of limitations.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 335.1.) 
Plaintiff
opposes the motion, arguing that she did not know Jonathan Woo’s identity when
she filed the complaint.  Plaintiff does
not dispute Jonathan Woo’s contention that she knew his identity when she spoke
with him after the accident.  Instead,
she argues that she “had no recall of his identity” when she filed her
complaint.  (Opposition pp. 3-4.) 
To
support her argument, Plaintiff cites Balon v. Drost (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 483 (Balon), where the plaintiff was involved in a car
accident with the defendant, who gave the plaintiff a piece of paper with the
defendant’s name and other information. 
(Balon, supra, 20 Cal.App.4th at pp. 485-486.)  The plaintiff subsequently forgot about the piece of paper and the defendant’s identity.  (Id. at p. 486.)  The plaintiff filed a complaint naming the
owner of the vehicle the defendant was driving (“owner”) and Doe
defendants.  The plaintiff’s attorney did
not receive the accident report, which contained the defendant’s name, until
after statute of limitations had run.  (Ibid.)
The plaintiff’s attorney then filed an amendment to the complaint under Code of
Civil Procedure section 474 naming the defendant as a Doe defendant and
declaring that the plaintiff did not know the defendant’s identity when she
filed the original complaint. The defendant, specially appearing, filed a
motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. The trial court granted
the motion, finding the plaintiff did not comply with Code of Civil Procedure
section 474.  (Id. at pp.
486-487.) 
In a
divided decision, the Court of Appeal reversed, observing that under Code of
Civil Procedure section 474, a plaintiff has no duty “ ‘to exercise reasonable
diligence prior to filing the complaint to discover the defendant's identity.’
” (Balon, supra, 20 Cal.App.4th at p. 488, quoting Snoke v.
Bolen (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1427, 1432.) “ ‘Ignorance of the facts is the
critical issue, and whether it be due to misinformation or negligence is not
relevant.’ ”  (Ibid., quoting Munoz
v. Purdy (1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 942, 947.) 
“Clearly, if a plaintiff has no duty to exercise even ‘reasonable
diligence’ to discover a defendant's name [citation], he or she may act
unreasonably in failing to ascertain a defendant's name and still claim the
benefit of section 474.”  (Id. at
pp. 488-489.) 
The
record in Balon indicated that the plaintiff did not know the defendant’s
identity when she filed her complaint, even though the plaintiff may have acted
negligently when she forgot the defendant’s name and never inquired about it.  (Balon, supra, 20 Cal.App.4th
at p. 489.)  Therefore, “[t]he subsequent
amended complaint naming [the defendant]—which [the plaintiff] filed a mere two
weeks after the original complaint—. . . ‘relate[d] back to satisfy the statute
of limitations.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Streicher v. Tommy's Electric Co.
(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 876, 882.) 
In Woo
v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 169 (Woo), the Court of
Appeal distinguished Balon and also disagreed with Balon’s
holding.  First, in Balon, “the
complaint amendment adding a new defendant was made without delay after an
immediate effort by the plaintiff's attorney to determine the identity of the
new defendant, and the complaint amendment was correctly made in accordance
with the section 474 procedure.”  (Woo,
supra, 75 Cal.App.4th at p. 179.) In Woo, however, the plaintiff
“made no effort to promptly identify [the defendant] and did not correctly
follow the section 474 amendment procedure.” 
(Ibid.) 
Second,
the decision in Balon “establishes an undesirable rule for the ‘I knew
but forgot’ assertion under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 474.”  (Woo, supra,
75 Cal.App.4th at p. 179.)  The Court
of Appeal in Woo held that “when the plaintiff had actual knowledge of
the defendant's identity prior to filing a complaint, but has forgotten the
defendant's identity at the time of filing the complaint, the plaintiff must
review readily available information that discloses the defendant's identity to
invoke the section 474 relation-back doctrine; otherwise, the plaintiff is not
in good faith using section 474.”  (Id.
at p. 180.)  “In Balon, the readily available information was contained
in the public accident report.  In [Woo],
the readily available information was contained in [the plaintiff’s] medical
records in her possession . . . in which [the defendant’s] identity was . . .
set forth. In our view, [the plaintiff] did not avail herself of readily
available information that would have refreshed her recollection of [the
defendant’s] identity; and therefore she is not entitled to use [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 474 to amend her complaint after the statute of limitations
has run.”  (Ibid.) 
Here,
Plaintiff did not amend the complaint to add Jonathan Woo until April 2, 2024,
over a year after Plaintiff filed the complaint on November 1, 2022.  The facts of the case are therefore more
similar to the facts of Woo than the facts of Balon. 
In
addition, in her declaration opposing Jonathan Woo’s motion, Plaintiff states: “I
remembered speaking with a gentleman from the vehicle that hit me on the date
of the accident.”  (Galvan
dec. ¶ 3.)  However, Plaintiff asserts, “I had no recall of Mr. Woo's
identity at the time my suit was filed.” (Galvan
dec. ¶ 5.)  When, as here, “the plaintiff had actual knowledge of
the defendant's identity prior to filing a complaint, but has forgotten the
defendant's identity at the time of filing the complaint, the plaintiff must
review readily available information that discloses the defendant's identity to
invoke the section 474 relation-back doctrine; otherwise, the plaintiff is not
in good faith using section 474.”  (Woo,
supra, 75 Cal.App.4th at p. 180.) 
Plaintiff has presented no evidence that she reviewed any readily
available information that disclosed Jonathan Woo’s identity. 
Last,
it is undisputed that by December 20, 2023, Plaintiff knew Jonathan Woo’s identity
because on that date Plaintiff served interrogatory responses containing Jonathan Woo’s
name and address.  Yet Plaintiff
has never explained when or how she learned of (or remembered) Jonathan Woo’s
identity.  As a result, the Court does
not know when, between the time Plaintiff filed her complaint on November 1, 2022
and December 20, 2023, Plaintiff became aware of Jonathan Woo’s identity. 
“
‘When a defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process the burden is on the plaintiff to prove … the facts
requisite to an effective service.’ “ 
(Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 4:421.5, p. 4-72, quoting Summers
v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.)  The Court finds that Plaintiff’s failure to
present evidence showing when, after filing the complaint, Plaintiff discovered
Jonathan Woo’s identity prevents Plaintiff from carrying her burden of proving
the facts requisite to an effective service of process. The Court grants Jonathan Woo’s
motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS specially appearing Defendant Jonathan Woo’s motion to quash
service of the summons and complaint. 
The Court quashes service of the summons and complaint on Defendant
Jonathan Woo. 
The
Court sets an OSC re: dismissal of Defendant Jonathan Woo for failure to file
proof of service of the summons and complaint on September 9, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
