 Case Number:  23STCV06881    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND On  March 29, 2023, Plaintiff Ilya Zhekharev (“Plaintiff”) filed this action  against Defendants Sunworld Dynasty US Holdings, LLC, dba SLS Hotel  (“Sunworld”), Marriott International Inc., SBE Entertainment Group LLC, and  Does 1-100 for general negligence and premises liability.  On  August 18, 2023, Sunworld filed an answer.  On May  29, 2024, Sunworld moved for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.  Trial  is currently scheduled for September 25, 2024.  PARTY’S REQUESTS  Sunworld asks the Court to impose terminating and  monetary sanctions against Plaintiff.  LEGAL STANDARD  A.   Monetary, issue, evidentiary, and terminating  sanctions  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part:  “To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any  particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,  after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity  for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in  conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process:  “(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering  that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney  advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including  attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may  also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has  engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised  that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision  of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the  one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  “(b) The court may impose an  issue sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in  the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the  misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by  an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process  from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.  “(c) The  court may impose an evidence sanction by an order prohibiting any party  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated  matters in evidence.  “(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by  one of the following orders:  “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of  the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.  “(2) An order staying further proceedings by that  party until an order for discovery is obeyed.  “(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of  the action, of that party.  “(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against  that party.  “(e) The court may impose a contempt sanction by an  order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a contempt of court.  “(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), or any other  section of this title, absent exceptional circumstances, the court shall not  impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for failure to provide  electronically stored information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or  overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic  information system.  “(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter  any obligation to preserve discoverable information.  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2023.030.)          B.       Sanctions  for failure to comply with Court order to respond to demand for inspection            Code of Civil Procedure section  2031.300, subdivision (c), provides in part:  “If a party . . . fails to obey [an] order [under Code  of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (b)] compelling a response [to  a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling], the court may make  those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an  evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with  Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court may  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)                C.      Sanctions  for failure to comply with Court order to respond to interrogatories  Code of Civil  Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), provides in part:  “If a party then fails to obey an order [under Code of  Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b)] compelling answers [to  interrogatories], the court may make those orders that are just, including the  imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in  addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)           D.   Terminating sanctions for failure to comply with discovery orders  A  violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of terminating  sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th  1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in  disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d  771, 795-796 (Deyo).)  A  terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with  caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A  decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a  violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows  that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery  rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)  128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280 (Mileikowsky).)    DISCUSSION  On  February 21, 2024, the Court granted Sunworld’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s  responses to requests for production of documents, set one, and ordered  Plaintiff to provide verified code-compliant responses and to produce the  documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested  without objections by March 20, 2024.  Plaintiff  did not comply with the February 21, 2024 order.   On  March 18, 2024, The Court granted Sunworld’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s  responses to form interrogatories, set one, and ordered Plaintiff to provide  verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without  objections by April 17, 2024.  On  May 21, 2024, the Court denied Sunworld’s request for terminating sanctions  because Sunworld identified only one discovery order which Plaintiff had  violated (the February 21, 2024 order) and did not show that less severe  sanctions would be ineffective in producing compliance with the discovery  rules. (See Mileikowsky, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 279-280.)  After  the May 21, 2024 hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Sunworld’s counsel that  (1) Plaintiff permanently resides in Russia, (2) Plaintiff’s counsel has had no  communication with Plaintiff since February 2024, (3) discovery responses would  likely not be forthcoming, and (4) Plaintiff requested his file back in  February and stated he would seek other legal representation.  In Sunworld’s  renewed motion for terminating sanctions, Sunworld states that Plaintiff still  has not complied with the Court’s February 21, 2024 order and also has not  complied with the Court’s March 18, 2024 order.  The  Court grants Sunworld's motion for terminating sanctions.  The evidence shows that less severe sanctions  would not produce compliance with the discovery rules.  (See Mileikowsky, supra, 128  Cal.App.4th at pp. 279-280.)  Sunworld  asks the Court to impose $1,440.00 in monetary sanctions on Plaintiff based on  six hours of attorney time at a rate of $230.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing  fee.  Counsel spent three hours drafting  the motion and anticipated spending two hours to review any opposition and  draft a reply and one hour to attend the hearing.  The Court grants $750.00 in sanctions based  on three hours of attorney time and one filing fee.  CONCLUSION            The Court GRANTS Defendant Sunworld  Dynasty US Holdings, LLC, dba SLS Hotel’s motion for terminating sanctions and  dismisses Plaintiff Ilya Zhekharev's complaint against Defendant Sunworld Dynasty US Holdings, LLC, dba SLS Hotel with prejudice under Code of Civil  Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (d)(3).  The Court GRANTS Defendant Sunworld Dynasty US  Holdings, LLC, dba SLS Hotel’s request for monetary sanctions and orders Plaintiff  Ilya Zhekharev to pay Defendant Sunworld Dynasty US Holdings, LLC, dba SLS  Hotel $750.00 by August 2, 2024.  Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving party is ordered to file a proof of service of  this ruling with the Court within five days.
