And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has considered the motions, oppositions, and replies presented by the parties and has ruled as follows. The case involves a negligence and premises liability lawsuit filed by Vera Merhavi against several defendants, including Super Magnificent Coffee Company, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, Westfield Topanga Owner LLC, Westfield Corp, International Coffee & Tea, LLC, and West Valley Owner, LLC. The plaintiff claims that she tripped and fell on a dangerous condition at one of the defendants' premises and suffered damages as a result.

The plaintiff has moved for a protective order to prevent the defendants from taking her deposition or the deposition of her husband, Simon Merhavi, or restricting the defendants to deposing her guardian ad litem by written interrogatories. The plaintiff has also asked the court to prevent or restrict the defendants' ability to conduct her medical examination.

The court has denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff's assertions about her inability to understand the consequences of perjury or taking an oath of truth, her inability to recall historical information, and her inability to comprehend concepts and process information are not supported by the evidence. The court has also found that the plaintiff's husband's condition is not as severe as claimed, and that the plaintiff's counsel has not established personal knowledge of any facts or events that took place before or outside of his representation of the plaintiff.
