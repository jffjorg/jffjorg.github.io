And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is on a motion for good faith settlement determination filed by Cross-Defendant Dario Alvarenga. Alvarenga and Plaintiff Rosalio Cibrian, Jr. settled their claims, and Alvarenga is asking the Court to determine whether the settlement was made in good faith. The Court has consolidated two related cases, 22STCV26585 and 22STCV27761, and assigned them to Department 28. The parties have not filed an opposition to the motion, and the Court has reviewed the Tech-Bilt factors, which include a rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, and the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs. The Court finds that the settlement was made in good faith and grants the motion. The Court also dismisses all pending and future claims against Alvarenga by the parties served with this motion, including cross-complaints for equitable indemnity.
