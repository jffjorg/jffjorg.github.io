 Case Number:  22STCV13469    Hearing Date:   July 3, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
April 22, 2022, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Oscar Arnulfo Villanueva
(“Defendant”) and Does I-V for damages. 
The complaint demanded $32,519.09. 
On
August 16, 2022, the clerk entered Defendant’s default.  On September 6, 2022, the Court vacated the
default based on the parties’ stipulation. 
On
August 9, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
October 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
October 16, 2023, the Court found that this
case (number 22STCV13469) and case number 23STCV20434 are related within the
meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).  Case number 22STCV13469 became the lead case. The
cases were assigned to Department 28 at the Spring Street Courthouse for all
purposes. 
On
October 23, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation to dismiss the case based on
the parties’ settlement with a reservation of jurisdiction to vacate the dismissal
and enter judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 in the event of
a default. 
On
November 11, 2023, the Court dismissed the case without prejudice and retained
jurisdiction to enforce the settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6. 
On
April 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the dismissal and enter
judgment, to be heard on July 3, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently set. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subds. (a), (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
and Defendant stipulated that the Court would dismiss the action without
prejudice.  In return, Defendant agreed
to make specified monthly payments to Plaintiff until Defendant paid the amount he owed Plaintiff. 
Defendant
has violated his agreement to make payments to Plaintiff.  Plaintiff’s counsel
sent a default payment letter to Defendant on February 22, 2024 advising Defendant
that he was in default.  Defendant has
paid nothing to Plaintiff since Plaintiff sent the notice of default. 
Because
Defendant did not cure the default, Plaintiff asks the Court to enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor for $5,000.00,
representing the original amount owed of $14,742.14,
less $9,742.14 in payments by Defendant’s insurer.  The Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s motion
to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment. 
The Court vacates the November 11, 2023 dismissal and awards Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company $5,000.00
against Defendant Oscar Arnulfo Villanueva. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
