Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Sunworld's motion for terminating sanctions and dismissed Plaintiff Ilya Zhekharev's complaint against Sunworld with prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (d)(3). The court has also granted Sunworld's request for monetary sanctions and ordered Plaintiff to pay Sunworld $750.00 by August 2, 2024.

The court's decision is based on the Plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery orders, including the failure to provide responses to requests for production of documents and form interrogatories. Although the court previously denied Sunworld's request for terminating sanctions in May, the court has reconsidered the matter based on new information provided by Plaintiff's counsel, including the fact that Plaintiff permanently resides in Russia and has had no communication with Plaintiff since February 2024.

The court finds that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules and has therefore imposed the ultimate sanction of terminating the action.
