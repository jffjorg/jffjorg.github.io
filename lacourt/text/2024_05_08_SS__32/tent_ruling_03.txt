No opposition has been filed.    LEGAL  STANDARD    “To  the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method  or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected  party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may  impose…sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the  discovery process.” (Code Civ. Proc. section 2023.030.) The court may impose a  terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process by any of the  following: “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings  of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process; (2) An order  staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is  obeyed; (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that  party; (4) An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Code  Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(d).)  Failing to  respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery, or disobeying  a court order to provide discovery, constitutes a  misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).)     “The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse  ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the  party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the  propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the  discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390,  quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)      “Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be  made lightly.  But where a violation is  willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less  severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the  trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los Defensores,  supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)       “Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating  sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”  (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 citing Lang, supra, 77  Cal.App.4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson &  Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622 [terminating  sanctions imposed (by striking the defendant’s Answer and subsequently granting  default judgment) after defendants failed to comply with one court order to  produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231  Cal.App.3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997)  16 Cal.4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed against the plaintiff  for failing to comply with a discovery order and for violating various  discovery statutes].)     Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(c), “[i]f a party then  fails to obey an order compelling [interrogatory] answers, the court may make  those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an  evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with  Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).”     DISCUSSION   Discovery  was originally served on Plaintiff on July 27, 2022. (Gharzeddine Decl. ¶ 4.)  Throughout 2023, Defendant was promised responses, but none were served. (Id.  ¶ 5.) On February 20, 2024, the Court granted Defendant  Environmental Service Concepts, LLC’s unopposed motion to compel Plaintiff’s  responses to Form and Special Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff was ordered  to provide verified responses, without objections, within 15 days. (Min. Order,  2/20/24.) The Court also imposed $639.96 in monetary sanctions against  Plaintiff and her counsel of record.    On  February 21, 2024, Defendant filed and served notice of the ruling on  Plaintiff’s counsel.  Defendants contend that no responses have been  served complying with the Court’s order. (Gharzeddine Decl. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff  has not filed an opposition to this motion.    Therefore,  it appears that the discovery was first served in July 2022, and the motion to  compel was granted on February 20, 2024. Throughout this time, Defendant sought  to obtain responses through informal ways before ultimately obtaining an order  to compel. The delay in time also demonstrates that Defendants have been  prevented from mounting a defense against this case. Considering the above, the  fact Plaintiff did not oppose this motion nor the previous motion to compel,  and monetary sanctions have been ineffective, the Court finds Plaintiff’s  actions to be willful. Therefore, the motion for terminating sanctions is  granted.    CONCLUSION   Therefore,  Defendants’ motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. The only remaining  defendants are Doe Defendants who have not been named or served, and therefore  the Court  orders the complaint dismissed in its entirety with prejudice.   The Final Status  Conference and Jury Trial dates are advanced and vacated.    Defendants shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof  of service of such.
