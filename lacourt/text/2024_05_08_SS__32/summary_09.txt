Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute over a summary judgment motion. The plaintiffs had raised several arguments in opposition to the ex parte filing, but the defendants failed to address these arguments in their subsequent motion. The judge notes that Section 36 of the relevant law does not address the statutory 75-day notice requirement for summary judgment motions. The judge also finds that the defendants failed to explain their failure to seek relief earlier, request shorter compliance periods, or explain what discovery was necessary for the summary judgment motion. As a result, the judge concludes that the defendants did not timely file the motion and therefore do not have the statutory right to have their motion heard.
