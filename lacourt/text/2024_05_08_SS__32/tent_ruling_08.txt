  for a Trial Continuance or in the alternative, to Sever Parkwest from this
  Action

OPPOSING PARTY:


 



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On
June 29, 2022, Plaintiffs Vanessa Jung Tirman, Estate of Jonathan Dongin Jung,
Jung Sik Jung, and Insoon Jung (“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against
Defendants The Bicycle Casino, Inc. dba “The Bicycle Hotel & Casino” and
“Parkwest Bicycle Casino”, and Does 1 to 20 for the wrongful death of Decedent
Jonathan Dongin Jung (“Decedent”). Plaintiffs alleges that Defendant’s security
guards attacked Decedent and caused his death.¿¿
 
On
July 29, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint against Defendants
TBC, L.P., dba “The Bicycle Hotel & Casino” and “Parkwest Bicycle Casino”,
Parkwest Bicycle Casino LLC, and Does 2 to 20. 
 
On
December 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint against the same
Defendants.
 
On
January 24, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion to file a third amended
complaint to substitute Phillip Tirman, M.D. for Plaintiff Vanessa Jung Turman,
who had previously passed away. (Min. Order, 1/24/24.)
 
On January
29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the operative third amended complaint (“TAC”). On
January 31, 2024, Plaintiffs filed proof of service of the TAC on Defendants
TBC, L.P. and Parkwest Bicycle Casino LLC. Defendant TBC, L.P. received electronic
notice of the amended complaint while Parkwest Bicycle Casino LLC was served by
personal service on January 30, 2024. 
 
Also on
January 30, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a trial preference
under Code of Civil Procedure section 36(a). The Court then set trial in this
case for May 9, 2024. (Min. Order, 1/30/24.)
 
On April
19, 2024, the Court denied Defendants Bicycle Casino, LP and
Parkwest Bicycle Casino, LLC ex parte application to advance their motions for
summary judgment and to continue trial. The Court advised Defendants that they
had not provided a statutory basis for continuing the trial preference or a
basis to shorten the statutory notice period for a summary judgment motion.
(See Min. Order, 4/26/24.) 
 
On April 22, 2024, Defendants Bicycle Casino, LP and Parkwest Bicycle
Casino, LLC (“Defendants”) filed the instant motion to continue trial, or in
the alternative, sever Parkwest Bicycle Casino, LLC (“Parkwest”) from this
action and set a trial date at least 30 days after Parkwest’s summary judgment
hearing date of May 8, 2025. 
 
On April 26, 2024, the Court granted in part Defendants’ ex parte
application to advance the date of the instant motion. In denying the previous
ex parte application to continue trial, “[t]he Court indicated that Defendant
may file a noticed motion regarding the request to sever. Instead of doing so,
Defendant appears to have filed a motion raising all of the issues again.
Nonetheless, it appears that the motion to continue trial also contains a
request to sever.” The Court then set the instant motion for May 8, 2024, with
the opposition due by May 3, 2024. (Min. Order, 4/26/24.) 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
The Court has the discretion to order bifurcation in
furtherance of convenience, the economy and efficiency of handling the
litigation, or to avoid prejudice. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1048(b).) 
 
The court,
in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials
will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any
cause of action, including a cause of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or
of any separate issue or of any number of causes of action or issues,
preserving the right of trial by jury required by the Constitution or a statute
of this state or of the United States. 
(Code Civ.
Proc. § 1048(b).) 
 
The Court also has the power to sever in cases where one
action has joined multiple Plaintiffs or Defendants to protect any party from
embarrassment, delay, or undue expense. (Code Civ. Proc. § 379.5). The Court
can also sever issues prior to trial “when the convenience of witnesses, the
ends of justice, or the economy and efficiency of handling the litigation would
be promoted thereby.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 598.) 
 
If the court makes the requisite
finding of fact on a motion for preference under Code of Civil Procedure
section 36, subdivision (a), it has no discretion to deny the motion due to the
use of the word “shall” in the statute. (See Peters v. Superior Court (1989)
212 Cal.App.3d 218, 224-25; see also Rice v. Superior Court (1982) 136
Cal.App.3d 81, 89-94.) “Failure to complete discovery or other pre-trial
matters does not affect the absolute substantive right to trial preference for
those litigants who qualify for preference under subdivision (a) of section
36.” (Swaithes v. Superior Court (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1082, 1085 (“Swaithes”).)
“The trial court has no power to balance the differing interests of opposing
litigants in applying the provision.” (Ibid.) 
 
The courts have not decided on
the due process implications of Code Civ. Proc., section 36. (Peters v.
Superior Court (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 218, 227.) Although the Swaithes court
briefly acknowledged that trial preference may operate to truncate the
discovery rights of other parties, the provisions of section 36 remain
mandatory. (Swaithes, supra, 212 Cal.App.3d at p. 1086.) 
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Defendants first move to continue
trial in this case so that their summary judgment motions, currently scheduled
for January 8, 2025 and February 27, 2025 may be heard before trial. These
motions were served on April 9, 2024, while trial was set for May 9, 2024. Notice of a
summary judgment motion and supporting papers must be served on all other
parties at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(2).)¿ The motion must be heard no later than 30 days before
the date of trial, unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.¿ (Id.,
subd. (a)(3).)¿¿ A party that timely files a motion for summary judgment
under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c has a right to have their motion
heard before the start of trial. (Cole v. Superior Court¿(2022) 87
Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
 
Here,
Defendants do not provide a basis in statute or case authority for continuing
trial after the trial preference was granted. Therefore, their argument for
continuing trial based on the California Rules of Court is unpersuasive. Additionally,
the Court previously denied Defendants’ ex parte application on this basis and
instructed them to file a motion to sever. (Min. Order, 4/26/24.)
Instead, Defendants’ discussion of severance in this motion is limited and
provides no authority regarding a trial preference and the argument that
Parkwest first appeared in this case on February 20, 2024. 
 
Throughout
the motion, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs were dilatory in failing to
properly serve Parkwest until January 30, 2024 since they had informed
Plaintiffs of the proper entity earlier. They argue Parkwest has not had an
opportunity to depose Plaintiffs or engage in discovery. However, Defendants
are retained by the same counsel. They do not explain the relationship between
each other and how discovery by Parkwest would not be duplicative of the
discovery that has already occurred.[1] The complaint was filed on June 29, 2022.
On July 1, 2022, Defendant Parkwest was named as Doe 1. A proof of service was
filed on July 7, 2022. In any event, the provisions of section 36 remain mandatory even if they may
truncate the discovery rights of other parties.[2] (See Swaithes v. Superior
Court (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1082, 1086.) Therefore, Defendants have not met their burden in
showing that Parkwest should be severed from this trial. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Defendants’ motion for a Trial Continuance or in the
alternative, to Sever Parkwest from this Action is DENIED.
 
Defendants shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
