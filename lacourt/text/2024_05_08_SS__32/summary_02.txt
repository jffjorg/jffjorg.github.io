And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a motion to augment and amend the expert witness list. The defendant, Florence Lisa Hartigan, is seeking to substitute an expert radiologist, Lawrence Harter, for her original expert witness, Karthik Kumar, who retired. The plaintiff, Teresa Austin, has not opposed the motion. The court finds that the motion is procedurally defective because the defendant did not provide sufficient discussion regarding reopening discovery under section 2024.050. The court denies the motion and encourages the parties to meet and confer to stipulate about allowing the expert substitution.
