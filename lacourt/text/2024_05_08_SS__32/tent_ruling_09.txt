[1] This
argument was raised by Plaintiffs in their opposition to the ex parte filed on April
18, 2024. The Court gave Defendant the opportunity to have the matter heard as
a noticed motion. Yet Defendantsâ€™ motion filed on April 22, 2024 does not
address these arguments raised by Plaintiffs.


[2] Section
36 does not address the statutory 75-day notice requirement for summary
judgment motions. Although Defendants argue that Plaintiffs delayed in
responding to discovery, they do not explain their failure to seek relief
earlier, or to request shorter compliance periods, or explain what discovery was
necessary for the summary judgment motion. Section 36 appears to contemplate
that summary judgment motions will be promptly filed so that the party may
exercise their statutory right to have their motion heard. However, a party
that does not timely file the motion does not have the statutory right to have
their motion heard. Here, Defendant did not timely file the motion.
