And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to continue the trial and trial-related dates. The defendant, Guadalupe Dominguez, requests to continue the trial date to January 13, 2025, and all pretrial dates to be continued in accordance with the new trial date. The Judge finds that the continuance is warranted due to the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which is scheduled for December 5, 2024, and the current trial date of May 16, 2024. The Judge considers factors such as proximity of the trial date, previous continuances, length of the continuance, availability of alternative means to address the problem, prejudice to parties or witnesses, and whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial. The Judge also notes that the defendant's motion for summary judgment cannot be refused to be heard within the time limits of California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 437c. The new trial date is set for January 5, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., and all pretrial dates are continued in accordance with the new trial date. The Final Status Conference is continued to December __, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
