And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's counsel, Timothy M. Ghobrial, motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion was unopposed and was based on an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and/or communication, which rendered it unreasonably difficult for Ghobrial to continue representing the plaintiff. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw and must consider whether there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court found that the requisite forms were properly filed and served and that Ghobrial's grounds for withdrawal were proper. The motion is granted, and the next hearing is a Final Status Conference set for June 21, 2024.
