And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Gilbert Perez, III. The motion cites an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and/or communication, which has rendered it unreasonably difficult, if not impossible, for Plaintiff's counsel to continue representing Plaintiff. The Court finds that this breakdown is proper grounds for withdrawal and grants the motion, effective as of the date of Notice to Plaintiff. The next hearing is a Final Status Conference set for 10/21/24, and Plaintiff has sufficient time to retain new counsel or prepare to represent himself.
