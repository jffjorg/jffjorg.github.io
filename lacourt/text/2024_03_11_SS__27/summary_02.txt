Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The plaintiff, Audelino Abundis, failed to comply with multiple court orders regarding discovery obligations and sanctions payments, including failing to respond to discovery requests and failing to pay sanctions. Despite repeated warnings, the plaintiff persisted in their failure to comply, and the court has determined that lesser sanctions would not prevent further misconduct. The court has granted the motion for terminating sanctions and dismissed the plaintiff's action against the defendant without prejudice.
