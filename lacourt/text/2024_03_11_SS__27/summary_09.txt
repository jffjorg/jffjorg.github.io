The tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the court's October 17, 2023 order deeming Defendant's Requests for Admission (RFA), Set One, admitted. The court finds that the Plaintiff's law firm's mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect in missing all communications sent to Prior Counsel's email address warrants relief under CCP 473(b). The Plaintiff filed the present motion to vacate within the six-month timeframe mandated by CCP 473(b) and served responses to Defendant's RFA, Set One. The court denies Defendant's request to continue the trial, scheduled for July 1, 2024, and orders the parties to stipulate to a continuance or file a motion to continue.
