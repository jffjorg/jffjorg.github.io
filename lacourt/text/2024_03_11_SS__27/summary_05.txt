And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Plaintiff's counsel, Timothy M. Ghobrial, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was unopposed and was based on an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and/or communication. The judge found that the breakdown in the relationship was proper grounds for withdrawal. The Court notes that the next hearing is a Final Status Conference set for June 21, 2024, which should be sufficient time for Plaintiff to retain new counsel or be prepared to represent himself.
