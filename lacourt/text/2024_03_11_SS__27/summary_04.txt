Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel discovery responses from the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to serve timely initial responses to the defendants' Form Interrogatories Set One and Requests for Production Set One, and has not responded to the discovery requests at issue. As a result, the defendants' motions to compel are granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to provide discovery responses without objections within 30 days of the hearing date.
