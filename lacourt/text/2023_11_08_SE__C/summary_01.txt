And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to transfer venue filed by the defendants, Loma Linda University entities and employees. The motion was filed in April 2023, over two and a half years after the lawsuit began. The defendants argue that the motion is timely because of delays in serving all defendants and the illness of counsel. However, the Judge is not persuaded and finds that the motion is untimely. The reasons given by the defendants for granting the motion - most of the witnesses are healthcare workers who reside in San Bernardino County, the majority of relevant documents are located in San Bernardino County, and all of the events giving rise to the lawsuit occurred in San Bernardino County - are reasons that were apparent at the outset of the lawsuit. The Judge denies the motion to transfer venue.
