And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge regarding a motion to set aside a default judgment. The Plaintiff, American Express National Bank, had filed a complaint against the Defendant, Ilan Asherian, dba A to Z Textile, Inc., alleging a credit card debt of $62,560.72. The Plaintiff requested entry of default and later moved for default judgment, which was granted. The Defendant then moved to set aside the default judgment, citing incorrect proof of service and claiming he was never served with the Complaint.

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion, noting that the proof of service shows an incorrect address and that it is unclear whether the Defendant was served with the Complaint. The Judge also cites a strong public policy in favor of granting the motion, as the Defendant's motion is within the six-month period allowed by California law.

As a result, the default judgment is set aside, and the Defendant is ordered to file a proposed answer within 20 days.
