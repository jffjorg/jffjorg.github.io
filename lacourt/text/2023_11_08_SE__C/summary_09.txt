English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a personal injury action. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant, AVMGH Six-Thunderbird Villa Limited Partnership, is liable for their injuries because the defendant hired an unlicensed contractor who caused a work site fatality. The defendant demurs to the entire First Amended Complaint, arguing that the plaintiffs' claims are barred by the Worker's Compensation Act. The court sustains the defendant's demurrer, finding that the plaintiffs' claims are barred by the exclusivity provision of the Worker's Compensation Act. The court also finds that the defendant is the statutory employer of the unlicensed contractor and the workers he hired, which means that the plaintiffs can only pursue claims under workers' compensation. The court grants judicial notice of the existence of the documents, but not as to any hearsay statements contained therein. The court schedules a status conference for May 8, 2024, and stays proceedings in the case pending the outcome of the concurrent workers' compensation proceedings.
