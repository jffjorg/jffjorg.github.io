And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yvonne Marie Alarid and Jennifer Alarid versus General Motors, LLC. The defendants demurred to the first amended complaint's fifth cause of action for fraud and moved to strike the claim for punitive damages. The Judge has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike. The Judge found that the plaintiff's fraud cause of action is not barred by the statute of limitations and that the claim for punitive damages is supported by adequate allegations. The Judge also found that the defendant's arguments that the fraud cause of action fails to state a claim and that the claim for punitive damages should be struck from the complaint are without merit.
