Plaintiff’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED
and no costs are awarded.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff Fernando Arana moves for an order
taxing costs on Defendants Rodolfo Casasola and Teresa Casasola’s Memorandum of
Costs.
Background
The
Complaint alleges that “Plaintiff brought claims against his now-former
employer(s) [Defendants and Rudy’s Wholesale Corporation (Rudy’s)] for failure
to pay all wages due, provide meal breaks, provide rest breaks, and pay
overtime wages. (Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 21-NWCV-00797 (the 797
Case)). (Complaint, 2:57.) The 797 case is related to this case. “On January
18, 2022, the clerk of this county entered a default against RUDY’S and in
favor of PLAINTIFF for failure to answer or demurrer within the statutory
period in the 797 Case.” (Id., ¶ 20.) Defendant committed fraudulent transfer.
(Id., ¶ 43.) Based thereon, the Complaint asserts causes of action for: 
1.
Constructive Fraudulent Transfer 
2.
Intent to Hinder, Delay, or Defraud a Creditor.
On
June 8, 2023, the court granted Defendants’ Motion to Set Aside Default in the
797 Case.  On June 9, 2023, Plaintiff
voluntarily dismissed this case without prejudice.  
Legal
Standard
“
‘Prevailing party’ includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant
in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor
defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who
do not recover any relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other
than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing
party” shall be as determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the
court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion
costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules
adopted under Section 1034.” (CCP 1032(4).)
Discussion

On June 9, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed his
Complaint without prejudice as to the fraudulent conveyance pursuant to a
stipulation by the parties after Defendants’ Motion to Set Aside Default was granted
on June 8, 2023 in the underlying 797 case. Plaintiff argues that he intends to
refile his fraud claim once he obtains judgment in the 797 case. Further,
Plaintiff’s counsel states that he conducted the debtor examination of
Defendant Rodolfo Casasola on July 28, 2022 in the 797 case. (Sandoval Decl., ¶
7.) Mr. Casasola stated in the examination that he and Defendant Teresa
Casasola decided to dissolve Rudy’s and liquidate all its assets of
approximately $200,000 in January 2022. (Sandoval Decl., Ex. B 20:1-22:4.) Under
these circumstances, the Court determines that Defendants are not the
prevailing party at this time. Therefore, no costs are awarded.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED and no costs are awarded.
