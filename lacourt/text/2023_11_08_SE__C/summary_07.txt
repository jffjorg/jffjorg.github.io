  - "If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint in part, allowing the plaintiff to add Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky and Amazon.com as defendants, and to add causes of action for Strict Liability – Manufacturing and Design Defects, Negligence, and Failure to Recall against Amazon.com. The judge denies the plaintiff's request to add a Failure to Recall cause of action against the Toyota Defendants, finding that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this claim. The plaintiff is ordered to file an amended complaint within 20 days of the ruling, without the fourth cause of action for Failure to Recall as to the Toyota Defendants.
