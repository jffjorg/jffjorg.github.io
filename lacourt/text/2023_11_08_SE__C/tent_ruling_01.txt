  Case Number:  20STCV40546    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2023    Dept:  C Simpson v. Loma Linda, et al. CASE NO.:  20STCV40546   HEARING:  11/08/23 @ 10:30 a.m. Defendants Loma Linda University entities and  employees (Defendants) move for an order transferring venue to San Bernardino  County pursuant to CCP § 397(c). Background Plaintiff  Jesse Simpson (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint for personal injuries sustained on  October 24, 2018 at Defendant Loma Linda University Medical Center in San  Bernardino County. Plaintiff was asked to leave the hospital premises and  refused. He was then allegedly assaulted by security personnel when they  detained him. Procedurally, the hearing on this  motion has been continued several times since the motion was filed in April  2023.  In a minute order dated May 19,  2023, the court determined that this case is not a personal injury case, so it  vacated the May 23, 2023 hearing date for the motion and transferred the case  to the Southeast District.  On July 3,  2023, over Plaintiff’s objection, the trial setting conference was continued so  the Motion to Transfer Venue could be heard on October 4, 2023.  In a minute order dated September 27, 2023,  the court granted Defendants’ ex parte application to continue the October 4,  2023 hearing based upon newly discovered evidence. Trial has also been continued  several times.  Pursuant to stipulation,  trial was continued from April 21, 2022 to March 24, 2023.  On February 10, 2023, Defendants applied ex  parte to continue trial again due to former defense counsel’s health concerns  and retirement.  Despite opposition by  Plaintiff, the court granted the request and trial was continued to September  29, 2023.  In doing so, however, the  court noted, “The parties should not anticipate any further trial  continuances.  The 09/29/2023 is a firm  trial date and the Parties should be prepared and ready to proceed with trial  on said date.” (Minute Order, February 14, 2023.) Evidentiary  Objections Plaintiff’s  Objections Nos. 1-9 are overruled. Legal  Standard On a timely motion, the  court must order a transfer of an action when the court designated in the  complaint is not the proper court. (CCP § 396b.)  A motion for transfer under this section must  be made within the time permitted to plead. (Ibid.)   “The  court may, on motion, change the place of trial in the following cases … (c) When  the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the  change.” (CCP § 397.)  Although this  section contains no express time limitation, a motion for change of venue based  on convenience of witnesses must be made within a reasonable time after the  answer is filed. (Willingham v. Pecora (1941) 44 Cal.App.2d 289.)   Timeliness  The  operative complaint was filed on October 22, 2020.  The Motion to Transfer Venue was filed on  April 27, 2023.  Defendants argue the  motion is timely because there were delays associated with serving all  defendants and the illness of counsel.   Defendants argue that it became clear to them that a transfer of venue  was warranted only after reviewing voluminous medical records and the police  reports.  The court is not  persuaded.  The reasons given by  Defendants for granting the motion – i.e., most of the witnesses are healthcare  workers who reside in San Bernardino County, the majority of relevant documents  are located in San Bernardino County, and all of the events giving rise to the  lawsuit occurred in San Bernardino County – are reasons which were apparent at the  outset of this lawsuit.  Defendants have failed  to explain why they waited until April 2023, two and one-half years after this  lawsuit began, to file the Motion to Transfer Venue.  Since then, Plaintiffs have consistently  objected to Defendants’ requests to continue the motion hearing dates and trial.  Under the circumstances of this case, the  court determines that the motion is untimely.      Accordingly,  the Motion for Transfer of Venue is DENIED.
