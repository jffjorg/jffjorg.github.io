Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike and demurrer filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (Defendant) in a negligence lawsuit brought by Danny Trejo (Plaintiff), a minor, through his Guardian Ad Litem, Laura Trejo.

The court has granted the Defendant's motion to strike certain portions of the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC), including references to the California Constitution and Education Code, as well as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, because the Plaintiff has not pled facts to support a claim for discrimination or harassment.

The court has also overruled the Defendant's demurrer, ruling that the Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for negligence with particularity. The court has granted the Plaintiff leave to amend the FAC to address the stricken portions.

The Plaintiff has 20 days to file an amended complaint.
