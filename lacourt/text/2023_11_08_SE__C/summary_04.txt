And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Plaintiff's Motion to Tax Costs, but has not awarded any costs. The Plaintiff, Fernando Arana, brought claims against his former employer, Rudy's Wholesale Corporation, and its owners, Rodolfo and Teresa Casasola, for unpaid wages and overtime. The case was previously dismissed without prejudice, but the Plaintiff intends to refile the fraud claim once he obtains a judgment in a related case. The judge has determined that the Defendants are not the prevailing party at this time, as they have not obtained any relief, and therefore no costs are awarded.
