And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by attorney Nany Korompis to withdraw as counsel for defendants Breaking Barriers Developmentally Disabled Services and Benjamin Sacardi. The judge notes that the attorney has not provided sufficient information to support the motion, including a statement of the reason for withdrawal and confirmation of the client's last known address. The judge is inclined to grant the motion if the attorney addresses these issues, but requires additional information to be provided. The judge also notes that the attorney's declaration must state the reason for bringing the motion instead of filing a substitution of attorney. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after further consideration and argument at the upcoming hearing.
