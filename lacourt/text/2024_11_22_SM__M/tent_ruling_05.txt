CASE
NO.:                23SMCV06062
MOTION:                  Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel
HEARING
DATE:   11/22/2024

 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
The court may order that an
attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or
final determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice
from one to the other. (CCP § 284(2).) The attorney seeking to withdraw must
take “reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights
of the client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for
employment of other counsel.” (Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct, 3-700(A)(2). See,
e.g., Vann v. Shilleh (1975) [holding withdrawal prejudicial where
attorney withdraw from the representation of defendant on the Friday before
trial began the following Monday].) “The determination whether to grant or deny
a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th
1128, 1133.)  
 
An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (CRC 3.1362(a),
(c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all parties
that have appeared in the case.” (CRC, 3.1362(d).) When a client is
served by mail, the attorney’s declaration must indicate that the client’s
address was confirmed within the last 30 days and how it was confirmed. (Id.)
If the attorney is unable to confirm the client’s current address, the
declaration must state the reasonable efforts made within the last 30 days to
obtain the client’s current address. (Id.) 
 
Additionally, the declaration “must
state in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney client relationship why” a motion is brought instead of filing a
substitution of attorney. (CRC, 3.1362(c).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Counsel Nany Korompis moves to be
relieved as counsel of record for Defendants Breaking Barriers Developmentally
Disabled Services and Benjamin Sacardi. Counsel proffers that unspecific
“Circumstances have arisen which make it necessary for the foregoing attorney”
to withdraw. (MC-052, ¶ 2.) Counsel does not state, even in generic terms, that
there was an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Counsel
will have the opportunity to explain any breakdown in-camera at the hearing.
 
Counsel also does not state whether
the last known address was confirmed within the last 30 days. (MC-052 ¶ 3b.)  The declaration does not note the hearings on
calendar, including the January 29, 2025, case management conference and OSC. Counsel
must add these dates to the MC-053 form. 
 
            If Counsel
addresses the above issues, then the Court is inclined to grant the motion. Any
order will be effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the order on
the client. Until then, counsel remains counsel of record.
