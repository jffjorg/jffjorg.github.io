And here is the summary in English text:

**Case Number:** 23SMCV04864

**Plaintiff:** Whitmore

**Defendants:** High Tower Real Estate Holdings Inc. et al., Martin Appel

**Tentative Ruling:**

The Court has considered Defendant Martin Appel's demurrer and motion to strike the complaint, and has reached the following conclusions:

* The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, as the complaint does not contain sufficient allegations to support liability for nuisance against Appel.
* The motion to strike prejudgment interest is granted with leave to amend, as the complaint does not clearly state that the plaintiff seeks economic damages that are certain or capable of being made certain by calculation.

**Analysis:**

The Court has analyzed the allegations in the complaint and has concluded that the plaintiff must provide specific facts to support liability for nuisance against Appel. The complaint's allegations are too general and do not provide sufficient information to determine whether Appel contributed to the water leaks and damage.

The Court has also concluded that the plaintiff's allegations of deception and negligence are insufficient, and that additional allegations are required to support these claims.

**Facts:**

* The plaintiff entered a lease with the defendants.
* Appel leased an apartment above the plaintiff's unit.
* The property suffered from water damage and mold infestation.
* The defendants failed to maintain the property in a habitable condition.

**Laws:**

* California Civil Code section 3479
* California Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.30 and 430.70
