And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash subpoenas served by Defendants Yummy Foods LLC and Keenan Pressley on medical providers and insurance companies. The Judge finds that the subpoenas are procedurally improper because they were served without the required 5-day notice, as mandated by Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3. The Judge grants the motion to quash, but with certain conditions. The Judge requires the Plaintiff to pay an additional $1,860.00 in filing fees and notes that the Plaintiff has improperly combined 32 separate motions to quash. The Judge also addresses the substance of the subpoenas, finding that they are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of directly relevant evidence and do not invade the Plaintiff's right to privacy. The Judge would limit the subpoenas to a reasonable scope of time, but otherwise leave them intact, as the subpoenas seek consumer records, including personal financial information, which are directly related to the Plaintiff's personal injury claims.
