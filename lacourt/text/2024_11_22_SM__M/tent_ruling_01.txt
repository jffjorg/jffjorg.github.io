Legal
Standard
 
“[A] cause of action against a
decedent that survives may be asserted against the decedent’s personal
representative or, to the extent provided by statute, against the decedent’s
successor in interest.” (CCP, § 377.40.) After the death of a
defendant, the court, on motion, shall allow a pending action that does not
abate to be continued against the decedent’s personal representative or
successor-in-interest, “except that the court may not permit an action or
proceeding to be continued against the personal representative unless proof of
compliance with Part 4 (commencing with Section 9000) of Division 7 of the
Probate Code governing creditor claims is first made.” (CCP §
377.41.) Probate Code section 9370 sets forth the conditions that must be
satisfied before an action may be continued against the decedent’s personal
representative.
