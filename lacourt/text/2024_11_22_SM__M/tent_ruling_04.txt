LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant Martin Appel
demurs to the third and fifth causes of action and moves to strike prejudgment
interest. 
 
Demurrer - Nuisance and Negligence
 
“Anything which is injurious to health,
including, but not limited to, the illegal sale of controlled substances, or is
indecent or offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of
property, so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property
. . . is a nuisance.” (Civ. Code, § 3479.)¿To state a cause of action for
private nuisance, a plaintiff must allege a non-trespassory interference with
the private use and enjoyment of property. (Civ. Code, §§ 3479 – 3481; San
Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1996) 13 Cal.4th 893,
938.) Liability for private nuisance also requires two additional elements: (i)
substantial actual damage, which is (ii) unreasonable as to its nature,
duration, frequency or amount. (Id. at 937-938.)
 
Virtually
any disturbance of the enjoyment of property may amount to a nuisance, so long
as the interference is substantial and unreasonable. (Monks v. City of
Rancho Palos Verdes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 263, 302.) “ ‘There is perhaps
no more impenetrable jungle in the entire law than that which surrounds the
word “nuisance.” It has meant all things to all men, and has been applied
indiscriminately to everything from an alarming advertisement to a cockroach
baked in a pie.’ ” (Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903,
919.) Whether the interference is substantial and unreasonable is a question of
fact requiring determination of all the circumstances of the case. (Mendez
v. Rancho Valencia Partners, LLC (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 248, 263-64.)
 
A
nuisance claims sounds in negligence if the causes rely on the same facts about
lack of due care. (Melton v. Boustred (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 521, 542.) The
well-known elements of negligence are: 1) a legal duty owed to plaintiffs to
use due care; 2) breach of duty; 3) causation; and 4) damage to plaintiff.¿ (County
of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292,
318.) “Ordinarily, negligence may be alleged in general terms, without
specific facts showing how the injury occurred, but there are ‘limits to the
generality with which a plaintiff is permitted to state his cause of action,
and . . . the plaintiff must indicate the acts or omissions which are said to
have been negligently performed.¿ He may not recover upon the bare statement
that the defendant’s negligence has caused him injury.’ [Citation].”¿ (Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 527.)¿However, there is no requirement
that plaintiff identify and allege the precise moment of the injury or the
exact nature of the wrongful act.¿(Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)¿
 
Plaintiff
alleges that she entered a lease with Defendants Valentino
Holdings and High Tower Real Estate Holdings Inc. (“Landlord Defendants”) (Compl.,
¶¶ 2-3.) Appel leased apartment #17NE, the apartment directly above Plaintiff’s
Unit #16NE. (¶ 5.) Plaintiff’s and Appel’s properties are so situated that “any
damages from Appel’s unit would affect” Plaintiff’s property. (Id.) Upon
initially moving into the Property at the commencement of her lease, Plaintiff noticed
water damage in her unit’s ceiling (buckled wood). (¶ 15.) Unbeknownst to Plaintiff,
the Property had suffered from water damage which existed at the Property prior
to her move-in because the Landlord Defendants failed to maintain the Property
in a habitable condition. (¶ 16.) At some point, a Service Master was hired to
conduct a mold inspection on behalf of Valentino or Appel, and took photographs
specifically focusing on the ceiling and the buckled wood. (Id.) An insurance
adjuster for Appel was also there. (Id.) Valentino, the property manager, did
not properly address the issue and the subsequent mold infestation continued
causing health issues. (¶¶ 18-20, 29-34.) Plaintiff identifies the source of
water intrusion and mold as a failure to maintain “common areas” consisting of
the “Property’s roof, shared walls, ceilings and plumbing and exterior building
envelope.” (Compl., ¶¶ 52-59.)
 
Appel argues that there
are insufficient allegations stated against him to support liability for the
nuisance. In response, Plaintiff only cites generic allegations that “Defendants’”
conduct somehow allowed for wet/damp building materials and caused the presence
of high levels of toxic mold and bacteria in the subject unit, failed to act
reasonably and appropriately in response to the maintenance, repair and
conditions of the Property, and their inactions were a substantial factor in
causing Plaintiff’s harm. (Compl., ¶¶ 32-46, 73, 79, 91, 135, and 140.) Plaintiff
ignores the more specific allegations that Defendant Appel had no such duty to
maintain or repair the condition of the Property. (See Garton v. Title Ins.
& Trust Co. (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 365, 376 [specific allegations of a
complaint take precedence over general allegations].)  
 
Critically, the
Complaint alleges no specific facts suggesting that Appel owned, managed,
maintained, repaired or attempted to repair the Property. The complaint only
states that Appel’s unit was above Plaintiff’s unit and situated so that “any
damages from Appel’s unit would affect” Plaintiff’s property below, without explaining
how Appel contributed to those damages. (Compl., ¶ 5.) The Complaint states facts
concerning the other defendants, which reinforces the inference that Appel has
no ownership or duty over the subject Property or the source of the water leak.
Again, the Complaint defines Defendants Valentino Holdings and High Tower Real
Estate Holdings Inc. as the “Landlord Defendants.” (¶¶ 2-3.) Valentino is the
property manager for the Property. (¶ 4.) The Landlord Defendants
allegedly cause the nuisance water intrusion by failing to maintain the
Property in a habitable condition. (¶¶ 15-16.) The complaint posits no facts
showing Appel’s act or omission contributed to the water leaks/damage. More
specific facts on how Appel contributed to the nuisance are required. 
 
Plaintiff makes generic
allegations concerning Appel’s “deception” but is entirely unclear what
deception Appel committed. (Compl., ¶ 72.) If Plaintiff relies on such a “deception,”
then those allegations must be stated with high level of factual specificity. In
California, fraud, including negligent misrepresentation, must be pled with
specificity. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167,
184.) “The particularity demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino
v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.) The above allegations
do not meet this standard against Appel.  
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is SUSTAINED
with leave to amend.
 
Motion to Strike
 
Defendant moves to
strike prejudgment interest. Civil Code section 3287(a) provides that “[a] person
who is entitled to recover damages certain, or capable of being made certain
by calculation, and the right to recover which is vested in the person upon
a particular day, is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day.”
(Emphasis Added.) 
 
Where the amount of damages is in dispute
(i.e. cannot be resolved except by verdict or judgment), an award of prejudgment
interest is not appropriate. (Whisper Corp. v. California Commerce Bank
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 948, 960.) In a tort action, prejudgment interest cannot
be awarded on damages for personal injury. (Curtis v. State of California ex
rel. Dept. of Transportation (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 668, 686.) Prejudgment
interest cannot be awarded on damages for the intangible, noneconomic aspects
of mental and emotional injury because they are inherently nonpecuniary, unliquidated,
and not readily subject to precise calculation. (Greater Westchester Homeowners
Assn v. L.A. (1979) 26 Cal.3d 86, 102-103.)
 
Plaintiff cites authorities
that either stand for the above proposition, that certainty is required for
prejudgment interest, or completely inapposite authorities. (See Chesapeake
Industries, Inc. v. Togova Enterprises, Inc. (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 901,
906.) In any event, Plaintiff argues that certain damages are stated because
Plaintiff lost the use of the property and is out of pocket for housing
expenses. The complaint does not clearly state that Plaintiff seeks any such
damages. Plaintiff only references a passing allegation that she had to vacate
the premises and paid for mold remediation. (Compl., ¶¶72,
126.) Additional allegations are required to show that these
are economic damages which are certain or are capable of being made certain by
calculation. 
 
Accordingly, the motion
is GRANTED with leave to amend.
 
Plaintiff to file an
amended complaint within 20 days.
