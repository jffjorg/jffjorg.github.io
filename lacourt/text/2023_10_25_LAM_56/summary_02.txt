And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Los Angeles County Office of Education (LACOE) in the case of Mauricio Quinto against LACOE for religious discrimination. The judge has sustained the demurrer in its entirety without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff's claims are barred due to LACOE's immunity under the PREP Act and Government Code 855.4. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend, stating that there is no reasonable possibility of successful amendment. The motion to strike is moot since the demurrer has been sustained.
