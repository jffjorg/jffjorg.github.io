BACKGROUND -     
This
case arises out of allegations of religious discrimination. Mauricio Quinto
(“Plaintiff”) files suit against his employer, Defendant LACOE for violating
his right to religious freedom. Plaintiff identifies as a Christian. Plaintiff
is an experienced academic counselor and during the 2020-2021 school year was
employed by Defendant. (Complaint, 2:3 and 10-11.) During his employment,
Plaintiff elected not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine based on his religious
beliefs. (Complaint, 2:3-5.) 
 
On
August 10, 2021, the Superintendent issued an email informing staff of the
policy that all employees would be required to show proof of vaccination or
submit to weekly COVID-19 testing. (Complaint ¶ 16.) Defendant notified Plaintiff
on September 2, 2021 that because Plaintiff had not submitted proof of
vaccination, he would be required to begin weekly testing on September 7, 2021.
(Complaint, ¶ 17.) A subsequent policy, Policy 4060, promulgated by the
Superintendent regarding COVID-19 vaccination stated that Defendant would
consider exceptions to the policy on a case-by-case basis, which may include
accommodations in accordance with the subsequent Policy 4060. (Complaint, ¶
18.) Additionally, Policy 4060 stated that failure to submit proof of full
vaccination by the stated deadline would subject a LACOE staff member to unpaid
leave and/or remote work until proof of vaccination was submitted. (Id.
¶ 19.) Under Policy 4060, failure to provide proof of full vaccination by
November 30, 2021, even after unpaid leave, would subject a LACOE staff member
to discipline, up to and including being fired. (Id. ¶ 19.)
 
Plaintiff
requested a religious exemption and accommodation from the policy on September
24, 2021, based on his religious beliefs. (Complaint, ¶ 23.) That request was
denied. (Id. at ¶ 26 and ¶ 31.)   On
November 1, 2021, Defendant placed Plaintiff on an involuntary, indefinite
unpaid leave. (Id., ¶ 33.) On November 5, 2021, Plaintiff  met with LACOE officials and a union
representative. (Id., ¶ 34.) At this meeting, LACOE rejected each of
Plaintiff’s requested accommodations. (Id., ¶¶ 35-36.) On December 9,
2021, LACOE HR emailed Plaintiff that he had exhausted all his accrued sick
leave time. (Id., ¶ 51.) Defendant placed Plaintiff on unpaid leave,
during the months from November 1, 2021 to March 28, 2022. (Id., ¶ 53.) On
January 9, 2022, the staff of Renaissance PAU, the unit where Plaintiff was
employed, was informed that because of the rise in COVID-19 and infected
employees, all traveling support staff should work remotely until the end of
the month. (Id., ¶ 55.) Plaintiff asked to be included in those working
remotely in January, but his request was denied. (Id., ¶ 56.) On March
25, 2022, Defendant emailed Plaintiff that all unvaccinated employees were
required to return to work on Monday, March 28, 2022, with safety protocols in
place. (Id., ¶ 58.) Plaintiff did so.          
 
The initial Complaint was filed on May 11, 2023. The
instant Demurrer and Motion to Strike were filed on August 21, 2023 by
Defendant. Plaintiff filed their Opposition Papers on October 12, 2023.
Defendant filed their Reply Papers on October 18, 2023. 
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE            
Concurrently filed with their Opposition Papers is
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice of a summary judgment ruling in the
case Beverly Takala v. Healthnet of Cali., Inc. et al. with case number
22STCV07291. Defendant objects to the request citing four different grounds,
including, California Rules of Court Rule 8.1115(a) which prohibits this Court
from citing or relying on an opinion not certified for publication. Although
the document may be judicially noticeable under CEC § 452(d)(1), the California
Rules of Court make clear it is not to be relied upon. Moreover, as Defendant
points out, taking judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting
the truth of its contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its
meaning. (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374. Also see Gong v. City of Rosemead
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 363, 369-70 n. 1.) The Court declines to take judicial
notice of the opinion. 
 
The Court notes in addition that the Beverly
Takala case is inapposite.  It does
not involve a governmental entity that has immunity from suit as in the instant
case, and merely finds that the issue of whether a religious belief is
genuinely held was subject to summary judgment under the facts of that
case.  This Court’s decision is not based
upon this issue.
 
MEET AND CONFER – 
“Before filing a demurrer…the demurring party shall
meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading
that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement
can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”
(CCP § 430.41(a); see also CCP § 435.5 (imposing similar requirements for a
motion to strike).) Defense counsel states that they met and conferred with
Plaintiff’s counsel but did not reach a resolution. Therefore, the requirements
of CCP § 430.41(a) and CCP § 435.5 have been satisfied. The Court will now turn
to the merits of the Demurrer and Motion to Strike.
 
DISCUSSION - 
Legal Standard for
Demurrer – 
“[A]
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235
Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that
appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the
pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in
ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not
subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a
complaint are assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the
truth of conclusions of law. (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 


 
The Parties’ Arguments
Defendant is Immune Under the PREP Act of 2005
The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act
(“PREP Act”) was signed into law in 2005 and, among other things, provides
immunity from liability for claims of loss caused, arising out of, relating to,
or resulting from administration or use of countermeasures to disease, threats,
and conditions. (See generally, the PREP Act at hhs.gov. Also see 42 U.S.C. §
247(d) – 6(d).) Defendant argues that it, as a public entity, falls under the
act as “covered persons” and are therefore immune from suit. The Court agrees.
 
In his Opposition Papers, Plaintiff argues that the
PREP Act does not immunize Defendants from liability for employment
discrimination and that whether discrimination has in fact occurred is another
question of fact.  Plaintiff also argues
that the PREP Act was intended to protect against claims related to receiving a
vaccine. (Opposition Papers, 9:5-6.) However, the wording of the Act is more
expansive than Plaintiff’s reading: “a covered person shall be immune from suit
and liability under Federal and State law with respect to all claims for loss
caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the administration to
or the use by an individual of a covered countermeasure...” (42 U.S.C. §
247d-6d(a)(1).) 
 
As Defendant argues, the LACOE falls within the
definition of a “covered person” which includes a “program planner of such
countermeasure”. 42 U.S.C., § 247d-6d(i)(2)(B)(iii). A “program planner” is
further defined as “a State or local government, including an Indian tribe, a
person employed by the State or local government, or other person who
supervised or administered a program with respect to the administration,
dispensing, distribution, provision, or use of a security countermeasure or a
qualified pandemic or epidemic product, including a person who has established
requirements, provided policy guidance, or supplied technical or scientific
advice or assistance or provides a facility to administer or use a covered
countermeasure.” (42 U.S.C., § 247d-6d(i)(6).) Therefore, the immunity applies,
and Plaintiff’s claims are barred. 
    
Defendant is Immune Under Government Code 855.4, not
under 815.2.(b) 
Government Code § 855.4(a) provides: “Neither a
public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury resulting from the
decision to perform or not to perform any act to promote the public health of
the community by preventing disease or controlling the communication of disease
within the community if the decision whether the act was or was not to be
performed was the result of the exercise of discretion vested in the public
entity or the public employee, whether or not such discretion be abused.” (Gov.
C. § 855.4.) Plaintiff contends that the GCA provides immunity to individuals
under circumstances, not the public entities themselves, however, this
interpretation contradicts the very wording of the statute. 
 
Additionally,
Plaintiff argues that FEHA functions as an exception to the general grant of
immunity under the GCA, citing DeJung v. Superior
Court (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 533, 547. First,
the DeJung Court made this point specifically as to Government Code § 815.2(b), and not
to § 855.4 which is immediately at issue here. Next, it should be noted that
the context here, is very different from what the DeJung
Court encountered, namely, that the incidents of concern
here occurred during a pandemic where a public entity was attempting to
promulgate policies in order to control the spread of a deadly disease.
Finally, Defendant counters, arguing that when considering conflicting
statutes, one of which provides for immunity, and the other which imposes
liability, the statue for immunity prevails when no indication to the contrary
exists in the legislative intent. (See Bitner
v. Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1059 [“It is generally
recognized that a statutory governmental immunity overrides a statute imposing
liability.”].) 
With that being
said, the Court notes that Government Code § 855.4 specifically states that a
public entity is not liable for an injury when its decision is made to promote
the public health of the community by preventing disease and controlling the
spread of that disease. That is the exact situation the Court has in front of
it. The Court declines to extend that same immunity in Government Code § 815.2,
as 815.2 is more general. 
 
Leave to Amend
Leave to amend
must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to
amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment”]. Because the claims herein are based on a suit to which the
government entity Defendant is immune, there is no reasonable possibility of
successful amendment. Therefore, leave to amend is denied.
 
Motion to Strike
Because
the Demurrer is sustained as to the entirety of the Complaint, the Motion to
Strike is moot. 
 
CONCLUSION 
The
Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint filed by the Los Angeles County Office of
Education is SUSTAINED in its entirety without leave to amend.
The Motion to Strike is therefore MOOT. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
