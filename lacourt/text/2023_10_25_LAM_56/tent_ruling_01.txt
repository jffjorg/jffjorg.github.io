MOVING PARTY:                Defendant
Marcel Adrian Solero Filart 
 
RESPONDING PARTIES:    Plaintiffs
Emma Martin, Elizabeth Gagliano, and Kathryn Sessinghaus
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition, and reply papers.  
 


 
BACKGROUND
This
survivor action arises out of the death of Vincent Paul Martin (“Mr. Martin”).  Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Martin died from
COVID-19 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic while admitted at HPHC, a
nursing facility.  The operative fourth
amended complaint alleges: (1) violations of the Elder and Dependent Adult
Civil Protection Act (the “Elder Abuse Act”); (2) negligence; (3) wrongful
death; (4) fraudulent concealment; and (5) fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
On
September 29, 2023, Defendant Marcel Adrian Solero Filart (“Defendant”) filed
the instant motion, seeking an order expanding the page limit of the memorandum
in support of his motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary
adjudication. 
 
On
October 11, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their opposition, disagreeing that Defendant
needs 30 pages to brief his motion when there are triable issues of material
fact, but also arguing that if the Court decides to grant Defendant’s motion,
it should also expand Plaintiffs’ 20-page limit so that they may fully respond
to Defendant’s arguments. 
 
On
October 18, 2023, Defendant filed his reply, arguing (among other things) that discussing
whether a triable issue of fact exists is premature since he is only moving to
extend the page limit of his brief.  
 
DISCUSSION
            “In a summary judgment or summary
adjudication motion, no opening or responding memorandum may exceed 20 pages.  No reply or closing memorandum may exceed 10
pages.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1113(d).) 
            
“A party may apply to the court ex parte
but with written notice of the application to the other parties, at least 24
hours before the memorandum is due, for permission to file a longer memorandum.  The application must state reasons why the
argument cannot be made within the stated limit.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(e).)
 
A
memorandum for a motion, including a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication, “must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the
law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases,
and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(b).)
 
Here,
Defendant essentially argues that his brief cannot contain the content listed
above without expanding the 20-page limit under rule 3.1113(d).  Defendant argues that he needs at least 30
pages to address all claims in his alleged capacity as the decedent’s attending
physician and medical director of the Hollywood Premier Healthcare Center.  Further, the parties have engaged in
extensive investigation and discovery, and synthesizing that information
(including the decedent’s 8,000-page medical chart) will take a significant
portion of the motion.  An additional 10
pages, according to Defendant, is necessary to set forth the relevant facts,
legal rules, and fully brief all of the issues related to Plaintiffs’ claims and
Defendant’s immunity defenses, among other things.  Plaintiffs have not disputed the complexity
of the legal and factual issues involved. 
 
            The Court finds good cause to grant
the motion, but only to increase the page limit by five (5) pages. 
 
            The
Motion for an Order Expanding the Page Limit is GRANTED in part.  Defendant Marcel Adrian Solero Filart may
file a 25-page memorandum in support of his motion for summary judgment or, in
the alternative, summary adjudication.  Plaintiffs
may file a memorandum in opposition that is 25 pages long.  Defendant’s reply is to remain 10 pages long
as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(d). 
 
Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
