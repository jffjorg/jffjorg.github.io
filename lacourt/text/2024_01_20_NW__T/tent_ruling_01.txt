  Case Number:  23VECV00225    Hearing Date:   January 20, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV01062 Plancarte v GM
Tentative ruling on plaintiff’s motion to compel responses and production to RFP set. 1, nos.16, 19-32, 37- 41, and 45-46.  Granted in part.
Vehicle: 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 purchased 10/31/2020.
Objections are overruled except for attorney client privilege and attorney work product, most of which are frivolous.  GM did not file a motion for protective order, instead refusing to produce on the grounds that a protective order was required.  The responses are not Code compliant using the statutory language.  GM is ordered to provide verified, Code compliant responses to Nos. 16 (as to 2020 and 2021 only), 19 (regarding 2021 Chevrolet Silverados only), 20 (only as to vehicles purchased in California), 21 (only as to vehicles purchased in California), 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 37 (as to an index only as to the issues complained of by plaintiff in this case), 38 (as to an index only)within 15 days with a privilege log in accordance with the law if documents are being withheld pursuant to privilege, and production of documents, sequentially numbered with a key or log of which numbered pages are responsive to which numbered request.
Because the responses, failure to seek a protective order, and failure to produce documents to which there could be no reasonable objection, the court finds that defendant GM engaged in discovery abuse without substantial justification.  Defense counsel has vociferously supported the responses and, to quote counsel, “Plaintiff should not need one single page more from GM to pursuant his claims...Plaintiff has zero need for the documents sought in the requests at issue.”
It is not the purview of defendant to decide what plaintiff needs to prove its case.
Because the assertion of objections, and the failure to respond in a Code compliant manner, and the refusing to respond because of the absence of a protective order -- without seeking a protective order -- was discovery abuse without substantial justification which warrants monetary sanctions in the sum of $2,310.00 against Defendant GENERAL MOTORS, LLC, and its attorneys of record, The Erskine Law Group, PC pursuant to CCP sec. 2031.310 payable to the Client Trust Account of Erskine Law Group, 10250 Constellation Blvd., Suite 2500, Los Angeles, CA 90067 by 2/20/2024.
