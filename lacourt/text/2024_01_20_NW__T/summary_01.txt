And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel responses and production to the extent that defendant GM failed to respond in a Code compliant manner to certain discovery requests. GM is ordered to provide verified, Code compliant responses to certain requests within 15 days. The court finds that GM engaged in discovery abuse without substantial justification, and as a result, GM is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,310.00 to the plaintiff's attorneys. The court also notes that it is not the defendant's role to decide what the plaintiff needs to prove its case. GM's refusal to produce documents without seeking a protective order, and its failure to respond in a Code compliant manner, were deemed to be discovery abuse without substantial justification.
