And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Dr. Mitchell Goldstein's motion for determination of good faith settlement. The motion is denied without prejudice as premature. The judge explains that before a good faith settlement determination can be made, a petition for approval of a minor's compromise must be filed and approved by the court. Since no such petition has been filed, the motion is denied. The hearing on the motion is set for September 5, 2024.
