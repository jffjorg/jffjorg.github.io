And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants, Signature Healthcare Services, LLC and Aurora Charter Oak – Los Angeles, LLC, is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. The demurrer was filed in response to the plaintiff, Lori Keele's, First Amended Complaint, which alleges medical malpractice, assault, and battery against the defendants. The defendants argued that they are immune from liability under Welfare and Institutions Code section 5278, which provides immunity to individuals who detain and treat patients in accordance with the law. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims are based on the defendants' exercise of their statutory authority to detain and treat Keele against her wishes, and therefore are immunized by section 5278. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to allege any acts of negligence or intentional torts that occurred aside from the defendants' decision to detain and medicate Keele without her consent. As a result, the judge sustained the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend, giving the plaintiff an opportunity to replead the complaint.
