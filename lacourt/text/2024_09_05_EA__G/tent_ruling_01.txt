  Case Number:  20STCV36513    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  G Defendant Mitchell Goldstein, M.D.’s Motion for
Determination of Good Faith Settlement
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant Mitchell Goldstein, M.D.’s Motion for
Determination of Good Faith Settlement is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
BACKGROUND
This
is a medical malpractice action. In October 2019, Plaintiff Kendra Lamas was
born to Plaintiffs Stephanie Aguilera and Anthony Lamas at Defendant Emanate
Health Queen of the Valley Hospital (EHQVH). At birth, Kendra Lamas was
diagnosed with brain damage and other neurological injuries. The Lamases allege
Kendra Lamas’s injuries were caused by the negligence of Defendants Julius
Kpaduwa, M.D.; EHQVH; and Mother & Child Health Center (M&CHC).
On September
24, 2020, Kendra Lamas, by and through guardian ad litem Aguilera; Aguilera;
and Anthony Lamas (collectively, the Lamases) filed a complaint against Dr.
Kpaduwa, EHQVC, M&CHC, and Does 1-50, alleging two causes of action for
general negligence.
On
November 23, 2020, the Lamases filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against
the same defendants alleging causes of action for (1) medical malpractice and
(2) general negligence.
On
October 28, 2022, the Lamases amended the FAC to replace Doe 1 with Defendant
Zaid Q. Chaudry, M.D. and Doe 2 with Defendant Altamed Health Services
(Altamed).
On
September 18, 2023, B.R. filed a notice of settlement and the present motion. A
hearing on the motion is set for November 8.
On
March 23, 2023, the Lamases dismissed Anthony Lamas from the present action.
On
April 11, 2023, Kendra Lamas and Aguilera dismissed Altamed from the present
action.
On
October 25, 2023, Kendra Lamas and Aguilera amended the FAC to replace Doe 3
with Defendant Mitchell Goldstein, M.D.
On
July 30, 2024, Dr. Goldstein filed a notice of partial settlement.
On
August 8, 2024, Dr. Goldstein filed the present motion. A hearing on the
present motion is set for September 5, 2024, along with a post-mediation status
conference/trial setting conference.
ANALYSIS
Dr.
Goldstein moves for a determination of good faith settlement with Kendra Lamas
and Aguilera. Before the court can make such a determination, however, Kendra
Lamas, as a minor plaintiff, must petition the court for approval of a minor’s
compromise. (See Anderson v. Latimer (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 667, 676
[holding court approval of minor’s compromise is prerequisite to valid
settlement].)
Because
no such petition has been filed and approved by the court, Dr. Goldstein’s
motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE as premature.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Dr.
Goldstein’s motion for a determination of good faith settlement is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
