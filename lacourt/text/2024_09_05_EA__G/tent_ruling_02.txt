 Case Number:  24PSCV00719    Hearing Date:   September 5, 2024    Dept:  G Defendants Signature  Healthcare Services, LLC and Aurora Charter Oak – Los Angeles, LLC’s Demurrer  to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint Respondent: Plaintiff Lori  Keele TENTATIVE RULING The Demurrer by Defendants  Signature Healthcare Services, LLC and Aurora Charter Oak – Los Angeles, LLC to  Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to amend. BACKGROUND This  is a personal injury action arising from injuries sustained at a psychiatric  hospital. From March 9, 2023, to March 13, 2023, Plaintiff Lori Keele was  admitted to and received care at a psychiatric hospital operated by Defendants Signature  Healthcare Services, LLC (Signature) and Aurora Charter Oak – Los Angeles, LLC  (Aurora). During this time, Keele alleges staff sedated Keele without Keele’s  consent. Keele also alleges staff used force to restrain Keele which resulted  in Keele suffering a concussion and broken nose. On  March 8, 2024, Keele filed a complaint against Signature, Aurora, and Does  1-100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) medical malpractice, (2)  assault, and (3) battery. On  July 29, 2024, Keele filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same  defendants alleging the same causes of action. On July  30, 2024, Signature and Aurora filed the present demurrer. Prior to filing, Signature  and Aurora’s counsel attempted to met and confer telephonically with Keele’s  counsel. (Charles Decl., ¶ 5.) A hearing  on the demurrer is set for September 5, 2024. ANALYSIS Signature  and Aurora demur to Keele’s entire FAC on the grounds that they are immune from  liability pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 5278. For the  following reasons, the court SUSTAINS their demurrer with leave to amend. Legal Standard Demurrer A  party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts  sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.  (e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn  v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering  demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT  Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding,  the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial  notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,  994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other  extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face  of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court  (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing  is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,  states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.) Section 5278 Immunity Pursuant  to Welfare and Institutions Code section 5278, “[i]ndividuals authorized under  this part to detain a person for 72-hour treatment and evaluation pursuant to  Article 1 (commencing with Section 5150) or Article 2 (commencing with Section  5200), or to certify a person for intensive treatment pursuant to Article 4  (commencing with Section 5250) or Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 5260)  or Article 4.7 (commencing with Section 5270.10) or to file a petition  for post-certification treatment for a person pursuant to Article 6 (commencing  with Section 5300) shall not be held either criminally or civilly liable for  exercising this authority in accordance with the law.” “The  protected conduct is confined to the exercise of statutory authority to  detain, evaluate and treat against the patient’s wishes, and does not extend to  the manner in which evaluation and treatment are carried out. In other  words, liability arising from negligent evaluation or treatment is not  liability arising from the ‘exercis[e of] this authority in accordance with the  law.’” (Gonzalez v. Paradise Valley Hospital (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 735,  741-742 (Gonzalez), quoting Welf. & Inst. Code, § 5278.) “Thus,  immunity under section 5278 does not extend to ‘negligent acts, intentional  torts, or criminal wrongs committed during the course of the detention,  evaluation, or treatment.’” (Julian v. Mission Community Hospital (2017)  11 Cal.App.5th 360, 393, quoting Gonzalez, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th  at p. 742 (Julian).) Discussion In  this case, Keele’s claims of medical malpractice, assault, and battery are  based on the allegations that Signature and Aurora’s staff unnecessarily and  forcibly sedated Keele without Keele’s consent. (FAC, ¶ 31, 37, 45-47.) Because  these allegations involve Signature and Aurora’s exercise of their authority to  detain and treat Keele against Keele’s wishes, they constitute the type of  conduct immunized by Welfare and Institutions Code section 5278. In opposition,  Keele attempts to avoid the application of immunity by noting immunity does not  extend to negligent, intentional, or criminal acts committed during detention,  evaluation, or treatment. (Opp., p. 8:1-11.) The court finds, however, that the  FAC fails to allege any acts of negligence or intentional torts that occurred  aside from Signature and Aurora’s decision to detain and forcibly medicate  Keele without Keele’s consent. In other words, the mere fact that Signature and  Aurora acted without Keele’s consent is insufficient to avoid the application  of immunity as Keele failed to allege there was misconduct with regards to the manner  in which Keele was treated and restrained. To  the extent Keele categorizes Signature and Aurora’s decision to medicate Keele  as medical malpractice, the decision to medicate or not medicate Keele is  immunized by Welfare and Institutions Code section 5278. (See Cruze v.  National Psychiatric Services, Inc. (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 48, 57 [holding  if immunity did not apply to decisions to medicate, every detention could give  rise to malpractice claims and immunity would be erased].) And to the extent  Keele challenges the underlying decision to detain Keele for treatment and  evaluation, the court finds Keele failed to allege facts that establish  Signature and Aurora lacked the probable cause to do so. (See Jacobs v.  Grossmont Hospital (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 69, 79 [noting plaintiff did not  dispute that hospital had probable cause for detention].) Accordingly,  Signature and Aurora’s demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Signature  and Aurora’s demurrer to Keele’s FAC is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days  leave to amend.
