MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Tiffany Summer
Kjenstad 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Unopposed
(1)  
Motion
to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories
(2)  
Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories
(3)  
Motion
to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
On March 25, 2024, defendant
Tiffany Summer Kjenstad (“Defendant”) filed the pending  (1) motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories, (2) motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, and
(3) motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents, moving
the court for orders compelling plaintiff Austin Hammesfahr (“Plaintiff”) to
serve responses to Defendant’s discovery. 
On March 27, 2024, the court
issued an order (1) granting in part Defendant’s ex parte application and (2) advancing
the hearing date on Defendant’s motions to May 6, 2024.  (Mar. 27, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.)  Defendant was ordered to give notice of the
court’s order.  (Ibid.)  However, Defendant did not file a notice of
ruling or proof of service establishing that Plaintiff and nonmoving defendant
Luke Miler Kjenstad have been given notice of the new hearing date on
Defendant’s motions.  Thus, it appears that
Plaintiff has not been given notice of the May 6, 2024 hearing date on
Defendant’s motions to compel his discovery responses. 
The court therefore exercises
its discretion to continue the hearing on Defendant’s motions to compel
Plaintiff’s responses to discovery to ensure that Plaintiff and all other
parties who have appeared in this action receive notice of the hearing date on
Defendant’s motions.
ORDER
            The court orders that the May 6,
2024 hearing on defendant Tiffany
Summer Kjenstad’s (1) motion to compel responses to special interrogatories,
(2) motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, and (3) motion to
compel responses to requests for production of documents is continued to June
24, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders defendant Tiffany
Summer Kjenstad (1) to give notice of this ruling to plaintiff Austin Hammesfahr and to all other parties who have appeared in
this action, and (2) to file with the court the notice of ruling and a proof of service of the notice of
ruling establishing that plaintiff
Austin Hammesfahr and all other parties who have appeared in this action have been served with the notice
of ruling no later than May 20, 2024. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  May 6, 2024
