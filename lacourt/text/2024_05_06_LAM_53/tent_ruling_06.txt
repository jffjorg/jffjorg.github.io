The court notes that Plaintiff has submitted her declaration, in which she
states that she does not recall seeing or signing an arbitration
agreement.  (Gonzalez Decl.,
¶ 6.)  To the extent that Plaintiff
contends that this evidence identifies a factual dispute as to the Arbitration
Agreement’s existence, the court finds that Defendant has met its ultimate
burden of proving that an agreement to arbitrate exists by submitting the declaration
of a Manager with its Talent Management Department, who states that, in order
for Plaintiff to have signed the Arbitration Agreement, she was required (1) to
log onto Defendant’s onboarding platform with the auto-generated passcode that
she was provided in a welcome email, which could not have been completed by
anyone who did not have her private log-in credentials, and (2) to review the
document, close the file, and type her full legal name.  (Wignal Decl., ¶¶ 1, 4-5.)  Thus, even if Plaintiff had met her burden to
identify a factual dispute as to the existence of the Arbitration Agreement,
the court finds that Defendant submitted evidence establishing its existence by
a preponderance of the evidence.

While the court acknowledges that the Arbitration Agreement also allows a
prevailing defendant to recover attorney’s fees upon a finding that the claim
was “patently frivolous,” which is consistent with Government Code section
12965, the recovery of attorney’s fees upon a finding that the claim was
brought for purposes of harassment is not and therefore is substantively
unconscionable.
