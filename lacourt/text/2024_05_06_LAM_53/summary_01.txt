The court disagreed, finding that the government claims fairly set forth the factual bases for the plaintiffs' claims against the defendant. The court also found that the defendant had not met its burden to show that the plaintiffs did not comply with the Government Claims Act. As a result, the court has denied the defendant's motion to strike and has ordered the defendant to file an answer to the Fourth Amended Complaint within 10 days.
