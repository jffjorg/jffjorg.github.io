  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to
  special interrogatories
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Angela Zoreh Farsad
Nezhad           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories
Plaintiff Angela Zoreh Farsad Nezhad (“Plaintiff”) filed the pending
motion to compel responses to special interrogatories on February 26, 2024,
moving the court for an order (1) compelling defendant Alliance Health Choice,
Inc. (“Defendant”) to serve responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories,
and (2) awarding sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
amount of $2,460.
Also on February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application
requesting that the court advance the hearing on her motion because it was set
for hearing after trial.  (Pl. Feb. 26,
2024 Ex Parte App., pp. 1:24-2:3.)  
On February 28, 2024, the court issued an order (1) granting
Plaintiff’s ex parte application, (2) ordering that the hearing on Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Defendant’s responses to special interrogatories was advanced
from November 19, 2024 to May 6, 2024, and (3) ordering Plaintiff to give
notice of this order.  (Feb. 28, 2024
Order, pp. 1:25-2:1, 2:10.)  However,
Plaintiff has not filed a proof of service with the court establishing that
Plaintiff has given Defendant and all other parties who have appeared in this
action notice of the new hearing date on this motion.  Thus, it appears that Defendant has not
received notice of the May 6, 2024 hearing date on Plaintiff’s motion to compel
its responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories. 
The court therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing
on Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to special interrogatories to ensure
that Defendant receives notice of the hearing date on the motion. 
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
plaintiff Angela Zoreh Farsad Nezhad’s motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories is continued to June 13, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53.

            The court orders plaintiff Angela
Zoreh Farsad Nezhad (1) to give notice of this ruling to defendant Alliance
Health Choice, Inc. and to all other parties who have appeared in this action,
and (2) to file with the court the notice of ruling and a proof of service of
the notice of ruling establishing that defendant Alliance Health Choice, Inc. and
all other parties who have appeared in this action have been served with the
notice of ruling no later than May 13, 2024. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  May 6, 2024
