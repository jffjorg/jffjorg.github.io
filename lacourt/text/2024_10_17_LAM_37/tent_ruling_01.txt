Background
 
On December 5,
2022, Jacob Shaw (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Honda Performance
Development, Inc.; Experis US, Inc.; Experis US, LLC; Manpower Group US, Inc.
(collectively “Defendants”) and Does 1 to 50.  On May 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint.  
 
On July 7, 2023, the parties stipulated to allow Plaintiff to file
the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”). 

 
On October 4, 2023, the court granted Plaintiff’s
Motion for Leave to file a Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”). The TAC alleges
fifteen causes of action for: (1)
disability discrimination, (2) failure to engage in the interactive process,
(3) failure to accommodate disability, (4) retaliation in violation of Gov.
Code § 12940(m)(2), (5) violation of the California Family Rights Act, (6)
failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, (7) violation of Labor
Code section 233 and 234, (8) wrongful termination in violation of public
policy; (9) failure to pay overtime wages; (10) failure to provide meal
periods, (11) failure to authorize and permit rest periods, (12) failure to pay
all wages due upon separation, (13) failure to furnish accurate itemized wage
statements, (14) failure to maintain required records, and (15) unfair and
unlawful business practices. On November 15, 2023,
the demurrer with motion to strike the first to seventh and ninth through
fifteenth cause of action of the TAC was sustained with leave to amend. 
 
On December 15, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the Fourth Amended Complaint (“4AC”) alleging the same fifteen
causes of action as the TAC. Defendants demurred solely to Plaintiff’s eighth
cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of statute and public
policy and moved to strike the request for punitive damages. On April 30, 2024,
the court sustained the demurrer and granted the motion to strike.
 
On June 28, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the operative Fifth Amended Complaint (5AC) alleging the same
fifteen causes of action as the 4AC. 
 
On July 26, 2024,
Defendants Experis US, LLC and Manpower Group, Inc. filed a demurrer to the
ninth cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy
with a motion to strike the 5AC’s punitive damages. Plaintiff opposed the
motion and Defendants Experis US, LLC and ManpowerGroup, Inc. submitted a
reply. The matter is now before the court. 
 
discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP, § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th
861, 872.)¿For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the
demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does
not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) The complaint does
not need to be a model pleading, as the policy of the law is to construe
pleadings liberally so that “cases will be tried on their merits rather than
disposed of on technicalities of pleadings.” (Porten v. University of San
Francisco (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 825.)
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) “It is an abuse of discretion to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a
reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.” (Ross v. Creel
Printing & Publ'g Co. (2002) 100 Cal. App. 4th 736, 748.) 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Ninth Cause of Action: Wrongful
Termination in Violation of Statute and Public Policy
 
“The elements of a
claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy are (1) an
employer-employee relationship, (2) the employer terminated the plaintiff’s
employment, (3) the termination was substantially motivated by a violation of
public policy, and (4) the discharge caused the plaintiff harm.” (Yau v.
Allen (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 144, 154.) To support a tortious discharge
claim, the policy must be “supported by either constitutional or statutory
provisions. Second, the policy must be ‘public’ in the sense that it ‘inures to
the benefit of the public’ rather than serving merely the interests of the
individual. Third, the policy must have been articulated at the time of the
discharge. Fourth, the policy must be ‘fundamental’ and ‘substantial.’” (Stevenson
v. Superior Court (1997) 16 Cal.4th 880, 889–890 [footnote omitted].)
 
In addition to
wrongful termination, Plaintiff pleads that “Defendants…and/or constructively
wrongfully terminated Plaintiff’s employment.” (5AC ¶ 157.) A constructive
discharge occurs when there is (1) an employer-employee relationship, (2) the
employee is subjected to working conditions that violate public policy, (3) the
employer intentionally created or knowingly
permitted these
working conditions, (4) the conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable
person in the employee’s position would have no reasonable alternative except
to resign, (5) The employee did resign because of the conditions, (6) the
employee was harmed, and (7) the working conditions were a substantial factor
in causing the employee’s harm. (CACI No. 2432; See also Turner v.
Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1238, 1245.)
 
First, Defendants are
correct in that Plaintiff cannot claim wrongful termination in violation of
public policy for his employment contract not being renewed. “Decisional law
does not allow a plaintiff to sue for wrongful termination in violation of public
policy based upon an employer's refusal to renew an employment contract.” (Touchstone
Television Prods. v. Super. Ct. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 676, 680.)
The 5AC alleges that Plaintiff was a contract employee with Defendants Honda,
Experis and Manpower, as they were his joint and/or single employers. (5AC, ¶¶
8, 19, 24, 25.) In or about June 2022, Plaintiff was informed that his contract
would not be renewed for the coming year. (Id., ¶ 46.) Much like
the decision in Touchstone to not renew the plaintiff’s contract
potentially being motivated by complaints about working conditions, here
Plaintiff’s contract not being renewed potentially because of his inability to
travel does not change the principle that refusing to renew a contract set to
expire is not actionable in tort. (Touchstone Television Prods., at p.
682; 5AC, ¶¶ 33, 34.)
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff redirects the court’s attention to the constructive wrongful
termination claim also housed in the ninth cause of action. The 5AC alleges
that following the decision to not renew Plaintiff’s contract with Defendant
Honda, Defendants Manpower and Experis continued to employ him but chose not to
place him in another position even though he believes he was eligible. (5AC, ¶
51.) As a result, Plaintiff was put “in a position where he would earn no
income indefinitely.” (Id. ¶ 52.) Plaintiff reasons that this position
of earning no income indefinitely is tantamount to a long unpaid suspension
that is so intolerable it forced him to resign. (Opposition, at p. 5:22-24.) 
 
In reply, Defendants
suggest that since Plaintiff alleged in prior complaints that “Defendants”
refers to all named defendants, including Honda, Manpower, and Experis, it is
contradictory to now allege that “Defendants” terminated his employment, but he
remained employed by Manpower. (Reply, at p. 2:10-22.) The court finds the
argument unpersuasive as the 4AC did allege that it was Defendant Honda who
decided not to renew Plaintiff’s contract with Defendant Honda while also
alleging that “Plaintiff continued to be an employee of Defendants Manpower and
Experis…” (4AC, ¶ 43.) Here, the 5AC similarly states: “After Defendants’
wrongful refusal to renew Plaintiff’s contract with Defendant Honda, Plaintiff
continued to be an employee of Defendants Manpower and Experis and believed he
was eligible to be placed with other clients of Defendants Manpower and Experis.”
(5AC, ¶ 51.) Accordingly, Defendants position that there is a contradiction in
the pleadings is unsupported and not evidence of a sham pleading. 
 
Defendants also argue
that Plaintiff analogizing his situation to an unpaid suspension is
insufficient because deprivation of pay generally doesn’t support a
constructive discharge claim. Defendants cite Vazquez v. Franklin Mgmt. Real
Est. Fund, Inc., which concluded that a driver not being properly
reimbursed by his employer for milage expenses that reduced his pay to below
minimum wage pled sufficient facts to support intolerable working conditions. (Vasquez
v. Franklin Management Real Estate Fund, Inc. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th
819, 828-829.) Here, the 5AC alleges Plaintiff continued to be employed by
Manpower, and received no pay as Manpower did nothing to place him in a new
position. (5AC, ¶¶ 51, 52.) No pay at all is far less tolerable than
sub-standard pay, therefore the intolerable working conditions element has been
properly pled. Moreover, the 5AC alleges that Plaintiff endured discrimination
and retaliation due to his disability, allegations that are sufficient to find
that working conditions were intolerable. (5AC, ¶¶ 41, 52, 60, 99, 159.) 
Finally, the 5AC
alleges that Plaintiff was “forced to seek other employment options.” (5AC, ¶
52.) “Constructive discharge occurs when the employer's conduct effectively
forces an employee to resign.” (Turner v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (1994)
7 Cal.4th 1238, 1244.) The employee resigning is a key element to the claim,
which has not been pled on the face of the 5AC. The 5AC fails to specify that
seeking other employment options, Plaintiff did resign from working with
Defendants. Therefore, taking the allegations in the 5AC as true, Plaintiff has
sufficiently pled all but the resignation element of his constructive discharge
claim. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike
 
Defendants maintain that Plaintiff fails
to plead sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages against
Defendants. Accordingly, Defendants move to strike the following portions of
the 5AC: 
 

Paragraphs 66-67, 79-80,
     93-94, 104-105, 127-128, 136-137, 152-153, 163-164;
Page 39, Prayer
     for Relief, Paragraph 5: “For punitive … damages where available by law;”

 
To state a claim for
punitive damages under Civ. Code § 3294, a plaintiff must allege specific facts
showing that the defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud. (Smith
v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿ The basis for
punitive damages must be pled with specificity; conclusory allegations devoid
of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Ibid.)¿¿“Malice” is defined
in Civ. Code, § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with
a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” “Oppression”
is defined as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust
hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code §,
3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in the case law as actions
that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative
Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) Fraud
means “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material
fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of
thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing
injury.” (Civ. Code, § 3294(c)(3). 
 
When the defendant is
a¿corporation, “the oppression, fraud, or malice must be perpetrated,
authorized, or knowingly ratified by an officer, director, or managing agent of
the¿corporation.” (Wilson v. Southern California Edison Company (2015)
234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164; see Civ. Code, § 3294(b).) Furthermore, a managing
agent includes “only those corporate employees who exercise substantial
independent authority and judgment in their corporate decision making so that
their decisions ultimately determine corporate policy.” (White v. Ultramar,
Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 564, 566-667 (White).) Here,
Plaintiff’s 5AC alleges that his supervisors were “officers, directors, or
managing agents of Defendants who were acting on behalf of Defendants. (5AC ¶¶ 67, 80, 94, 105, 118, 128, 137,
153, 164.) The Manpower employees the 5AC identifies are Business Development
Manager Grey Warren, Consultant Services Manager Sarah Hughes, and Vice
President of Sales and Operations Anthony Del Preto. (5AC ¶¶ 25, 27, 36, 46.)
However, Plaintiff does not specifically allege facts showing that these
employees exercised substantial independent authority and judgment in their
corporate decision-making so that their decisions ultimately determine
corporate policy. 
 
The 5AC does not allege that Anthony Del
Petro, by virtue of being the Vice President of Sale and Operations, was a
managing agent of Defendants who “exercise substantial discretionary authority
over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy.” (White, supra,
21 Cal.4th at p. 577.) “In order to demonstrate that an employee is a true
managing agent under section 3294, subdivision (b), a plaintiff seeking
punitive damages would have to show that the employee exercised substantial
discretionary authority over significant aspects of a corporation's business.”
(Id., at p. 577.) Here, the 5AC must specifically allege that Del Petro
exercised substantial discretionary authority. Moreover, the 5AC fails to state what prompt corrective measures
Del Petro could have taken as Vice President of Sales and Operations. The 5AC
also fails to allege that Del Petro acted with malice, fraud, or oppression in
failing to take non-specified corrective measures. “ ‘Rather, the
critical inquiry is the degree of discretion the employees possess in making
decisions that will ultimately determine corporate policy.’ ” (Kelly-Zurian
v. Wohl Shoe Co. (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 397, 421.) 
 
The 5AC merely states that Ms. Hughes was
Plaintiff’s contact at Manpower who had authority to sign contracts related to
Plaintiff’s employment. (5AC ¶ 25.) The 5AC does not state that she had the
discretionary authority to determine corporate policy, thus making her a
managing agent of Defendants. Even if Hughes was a managing agent, her alleged
conduct is insufficient to show that she acted with malice, oppression, or
fraud. Similarly, Plaintiff fails to allege that Greg Warren, as the Business
Development Manager had discretionary authority to determine corporate policy. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that
Manpower/Experis, including Hughes, Warren, and Del Preto, did nothing to stop
Honda’s illegal conduct in spite of their obligation to do so, and failed to
take prompt corrective measures within their control. (5AC, ¶ 36.) However,
Plaintiff alleges nothing to indicate that Hughes and Del Preto had the legal
authority to stop or remedy Honda’s conduct or force Honda to renew Plaintiff’s
contract. Additionally, Warren’s failure to place Plaintiff with a new Manpower
client does not sufficiently indicate a willful and conscious disregard of
Plaintiff’s rights or cruel and unjust hardship. 
 
Plaintiff has now had five opportunities
to amend his pleadings, and the court has granted Defendants’ request to strike
Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages on November 15, 2023, April 30, 2024,
and June 18, 2024. Given that Plaintiff has had four opportunities to amend the
pleadings, the court is not persuaded that Plaintiff can successfully amend the
pleadings to allege a claim of punitive damages. Therefore, the Defendants’
motion to strike punitive damages is granted without leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’
demurrer to the ninth cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of
public 
policy
is sustained with 10 days leave to amend. Defendants’ motion to strike punitive
damages
 is granted without leave to amend. The
court sets a Non-Appearance OSC RE: Amended 
Complaint for November 6, 2024, at 8:30
a.m. Moving parties to give notice.
