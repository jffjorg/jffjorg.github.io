Here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge denied the motion for summary judgment filed by Auto Buyline Systems Inc., ABS Auto Auctions, Thomas Harmon, Annette Harmon, Digital Auctions LLC, and E Inc. The motion argued that the defendants are not parties to the lease agreement and therefore cannot be held liable for the breach of the lease. However, the judge found that there are triable issues of material fact that prevent summary judgment. Specifically, the judge noted that there is a dispute over whether the defendants signed the lease and whether they are responsible for the breach. The judge also found that the defendants' argument that they did not sign the lease is based on the premise that they did not occupy the property, but the judge noted that the lease agreement lists the tenant as "ABS Auto Auctions, Inc." and Thomas Harmon's initials are on the lease.

The judge also denied the motion for summary adjudication, finding that the defendants did not meet their burden of showing that there is no triable issue of fact as to the alter-ego allegations. The judge noted that the defendants argued that ABS was a legitimate company, but the judge found that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether ABS was inadequately capitalized.

The judge granted the plaintiffs' request for judicial notice and noted that the case has been pending for several years and that the parties' briefs are not models of clarity. The judge requested that the parties at argument state their positions clearly and succinctly.
