[TENTATIVE RULING   - DEMURRER WITH MOTION TO STRIKE]
RELIEF REQUESTED
Defendant, Glendale French Bakery dba Papillon (Defendant, Movant, or Papillon),
demurs to the third (premises liability), fourth (assault and battery), fifth
(loss of consortium), sixth (intentional infliction of emotional distress), and
seventh (aiding and abetting assault and battery) causes of action in
Plaintiffs’ TAC on grounds of failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action and uncertainty.
BACKGROUND
An
initial Complaint was filed in this action on 9/19/2023. There was no demurrer
hearing as to the initial Complaint. 
The FAC was filed on 2/2/2024. 
On May 3, 2024, this Court heard three demurrers to
the FAC, and the Minute Order noted that the Court took the matters under
submission. 
On May 6, 2024, the Court ruled on the submitted
matters.
On May 22, 2024, the Minute Order for the Case
Management Conference indicated that the Court removed misnamed party Liana
Yozalyan. Further, the 5-22-2024 Minute Order indicated that “Discovery stay
remains in place.” 
On 6/4/2024, Plaintiffs filed their SAC. 
On 8/9/2024, this Court ruled on Defendant Elvis
Madatyan’s demurrer to the fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action to SAC. The
Court overruled the demurrer as to the fifth cause of action and sustained with
leave to amend as to the sixth and seventh causes of action.
The instant action surrounds allegations that several
Defendants, and Elda, plotted to physically harm Plaintiff (Robert) because
Robert discovered that Elda (not presently sued because Elda is a debtor in
bankruptcy) was embezzling money from a business that Robert had substantial
interests in.
Plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint (TAC) on
8/29/2024. 
This hearing pertains to Papillon’s demurrer to the
TAC.

Meet and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  “The
parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
Defendant’s counsel alleges that a meet and confer occurred. (Hobson Decl. ¶
8.)
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s]
the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper
judicial notice.  (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
Demurrer – Uncertainty
A special demurrer for
uncertainty, CCP section 430.10(f), is disfavored and will only be sustained
where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e.,
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
Third
Cause of Action – Premises Liability
The third cause of
action for premises liability is alleged against Defendant Papillon, and Papillon
demurs to this cause of action.
Plaintiffs’
TAC alleges that “Elda and defendants Liana, Papillon, and Does 1 through 100
knew or should have known that Edgar intended to assault Robert at the premises
of Papillon.” (TAC ¶ 32.)
Papillon
argues that Plaintiffs did not allege facts sufficient to constitute the action
because Plaintiffs did not allege Papillon’s ownership or control of the
premises.
As
stated in Kesner v. Superior Court:
The elements of a negligence claim and a premises liability claim
are the same: a legal duty of care, breach of that duty, and proximate cause
resulting in injury. (Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp (2013) 220
Cal.App.4th 994, 998, 163 Cal.Rptr.3d 637; see Ladd v. County of San
Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917, 50 Cal.Rptr.2d 309, 911 P.2d
496 [negligence cause of action]; **301 Ortega v. Kmart Corp.
(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200, 1205, 114 Cal.Rptr.2d 470, 36 P.3d 11 [cause of
action for premises liability].) Premises liability “ ‘is grounded in the
possession of the premises and the attendant right to control and manage the
premises’ ”; accordingly, “ ‘mere possession with its attendant right to
control conditions on the premises is a sufficient basis for the imposition of
an affirmative duty to act.’ ” (Preston v. Goldman (1986) 42 Cal.3d
108, 118, 227 Cal.Rptr. 817, 720 P.2d 476, italics omitted, quoting Sprecher
v. Adamson Companies (1981) 30 Cal.3d 358, 368, 370, 178 Cal.Rptr.
783, 636 P.2d 1121.) But the duty arising from possession and control of
property is adherence to the same standard of care that applies in negligence
cases. (Rowland, supra, 69 Cal.2d at p. 119, 70 Cal.Rptr.
97, 443 P.2d 561 [“The proper test to be applied to the liability of the
possessor of land ... is whether in the management of his property he has acted
as a reasonable man in view of the probability of injury to others....”];
accord, Alcaraz v. Vece (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1149, 1156, 60
Cal.Rptr.2d 448, 929 P.2d 1239.) In determining whether a premises owner owes a
duty to persons on its property, we apply *1159 the Rowland factors.
(See, e.g., Thai v. Stang (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1264, 1271,
263 Cal.Rptr. 202 [Rowland analysis applies to premises
liability cases].) Indeed, Rowland itself involved premises
liability. (Rowland, at p. 110, 70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561.)
(Kesner
v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158-59.)
Further,
CACI 1000 lists the elements of premises liability as: (1) That defendant
owned/leased/occupied/controlled the property; (2) That defendant was negligent
in the use or maintenance of the property; (3) That plaintiff was harmed; and
(4) That defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff’s
harm. (CACI 1000.)
Here,
Papillon’s argument is availing because Plaintiffs’ TAC did not allege
possession and control of the premises by Papillon. 
TENTATIVE RULING THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION PREMISES LIABILITY
Papillon’s demurrer to
the third cause of action for premises liability is SUSTAINED for failure to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Leave to amend is
GRANTED.
Fourth Cause of Action – Assault and Battery
The fourth cause of
action for assault and battery is alleged against Edgar, Liana, and Papillon.
As
a preliminary matter, although Plaintiffs label this as a cause of action for
assault and battery, Plaintiffs do not in fact appear to be alleging that Liana
or Papillon committed assault and battery directly themselves, but Plaintiffs
appear to be trying to hold Liana and Papillon liable for assault and battery
based on the actions of Edgar. Instead, Plaintiffs appear to be attempting to
hold Liana and Papillon liable for Edgar’s assault and battery allegations via
the theory of conspiring to commit assault and battery. “Plaintiff allege that
Elda and defendants Edgar, Liana, Elvis and DOES 1-100 each conspired and
agreed to have Edgar assault and batter Robert with weapons, physical force,
and verbal threats and harassment and/or to murder him, thereby causing Robert
the injuries and damages as hereinabove and described.” (Compl. ¶ 36.)
“It
has long been established that in ruling on a demurrer, the trial court is
obligated to look past the form of a pleading to its substance. Erroneous or
confusing labels attached by the inept pleader are to be ignored if the
complaint pleads facts which would entitled the plaintiff to relief.” (Saunders
v. Cariss (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 905, 908.)
As
stated in City of Industry:
Civil conspiracy is not an independent tort. Instead, it is “a
legal doctrine that imposes liability on persons who, although not actually
committing a tort themselves, share with the immediate tortfeasors a common
plan or *212 design in its perpetration. [Citation.] By participation
in a civil conspiracy, a coconspirator effectively adopts as his or her own the
torts of other coconspirators within the ambit of the conspiracy. [Citation.]
In this way, a coconspirator incurs tort liability co-equal with the immediate
tortfeasors.” (Applied Equipment Corp. v. Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994)
7 Cal.4th 503, 510–511, 28 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 869 P.2d 454.) The elements of
a civil conspiracy are (1) the formation of a group of two or more persons who
agreed to a common plan or design to commit a tortious act; (2) a wrongful act
committed pursuant to the agreement; and (3) resulting damages. (Ibid.) We
construe the fifth count for fraud and the tenth count for conspiracy together
as a single count for fraud.
(City
of Industry v. City of Filmore (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 191, 211-212.)
Here,
Papillon argues that there are no facts to suggest that Papillon assaulted or
battered Robert.
Papillon’s
argument is not on point. Plaintiffs are alleging that Papillon conspired to
commit assault and battery.
Papillon
also argued that the allegations of the agreement are conclusory and do not
demonstrate an agreement between Edgar, Elvis, Papillon, and Liana. Papillon
argues that the allegations are speculative and conclusory. 
Here,
the Court does not find Papillon’s arguments availing. Plaintiffs do not have
to demonstrate an agreement at the pleading stage; they just have to allege it.
Papillon
also argues that Plaintiffs did not allege that the actions of Elda were done
in the scope of her employment.
As
to this, the Court finds this argument availing.
The
general rule of respondeat superior is as follows, “an employer is
vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of
the employment.” (Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital (1995)
12 Cal.4th 291, 298.)
Here,
even if Plaintiffs alleged facts sufficient for Liana and Elda to be liable for
assault and battery via conspiracy, Plaintiffs have to have a theory under
which they can hold Papillon liable for conspiring to commit assault and
battery. Plaintiffs are attempting to hold Papillon liable via the actions of Elda
(President and CEO of Papillon) and Liana (managing agent of Papillon). However,
Plaintiffs fail to allege that Elda and Liana did all the actions that the TAC
alleges within the course and scope of their employment.
TENTATIVE RULING FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION ASSAULT AND BATTERY
Papillon’s demurrer to
the fourth cause of action for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action is SUSTAINED. Leave to amend is granted.
Fifth Cause of Action – Loss of Consortium
The
fifth cause of action for loss of consortium is alleged against Liana, Elvis,
Edgar, and Papillon.
The
elements for loss of consortium are: (1) a valid and lawful marriage between
the plaintiff and the person inured at the time of the injury; (2) a tortious
injury to the plaintiff’s spouse; (3) loss of consortium suffered by the
plaintiff; and (4) the loss was proximately caused by the defendant’s act. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 746, fn. 2.)
Plaintiffs
allege that “As a direct and proximate result of the acts alleged against
Defendants and Elda, and the resulting injuries sustained by Robert, Marina has
suffered a loss of consortium, including the loss of love, companionship,
comfort, are, assistance, society, moral support and affection of Robert.
Marina has also suffered the loss of enjoyment of her sexual relations with
Robert.” (TAC ¶ 44.)
Here,
this cause of action suffers the same problems that the fourth cause of action
suffered. Plaintiffs are basing their liability for Papillon on the actions of Papillon’s
employees Liana and Elda; however, Plaintiffs did not allege that Liana and
Elda’s actions were committed within the course and scope of their employment.
The
general rule of respondeat superior is as follows, “an employer is vicariously
liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of the
employment.” (Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital (1995) 12
Cal.4th 291, 298.)
TENTATIVE RULING FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION LOSS OF CONSORTIUM
Papillon’s demurrer to
the fifth cause of action for loss of consortium is SUSTAINED. Leave to amend
is granted.
TENTATIVE RULING SIXTH AND SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Plaintiffs allege a
sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and a
seventh cause of action for aiding and abetting assault and battery against
Papillon. 
However,
as the Court discussed with respect to the fourth and fifth causes of action,
Plaintiffs are basing Papillon’s liability on the actions of their employees
Liana and Elda.
The
general rule of respondeat superior is as follows, “an employer is vicariously
liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of the
employment.” (Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital (1995) 12
Cal.4th 291, 298.)
Here,
Plaintiffs did not allege that Papillon’s employee’s actions were committed within
the course and scope of employment.
Papillon’s
demurrer to the sixth and seventh causes of action is SUSTAINED. Leave to amend
is granted.
TENTATIVE RULING MOTION TO STRIKE
Papillon moved to strike
all references to claims for punitive damages against Papillon. 
Papillon’s
motion to strike is GRANTED, because in all the causes of action in the TAC
that were alleged against Papillon, the Court sustained Papillon’s demurrer;
therefore, no causes of action were sufficiently alleged against Papillon.
Leave to amend is granted to Plaintiffs.
