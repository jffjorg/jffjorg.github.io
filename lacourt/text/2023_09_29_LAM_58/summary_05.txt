And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues in a case involving the Plaintiff and Defendant. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant's demurrer fails because the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) is not a public agency. However, the Judge disagrees, citing a previous court case that states that CDCR is indeed a public entity. Additionally, the Judge notes that Labor Code section 6312 is relevant to the case, as it provides for the filing of complaints with the Labor Commissioner.
