## English Summary:

The Judge is considering a demurrer filed by the Defendants in a case brought by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff's argument against the demurrer focuses on the Defendants' failure to prove that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) is a public agency.  The Judge disagrees with this argument, citing the case of Bitner v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1066, which clearly states that CDCR is a public entity.  

The Judge also highlights the relevance of Labor Code section 6312, which allows employees who believe they have been discriminated against in violation of Labor Code sections 6310 and 6311 to file complaints with the Labor Commissioner. This suggests that the Judge is leaning towards allowing the Plaintiff's claim to proceed.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendant and has issued a tentative ruling. The plaintiff argues that the demurrer fails because the defendant has not demonstrated that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is a public agency. The judge disagrees, citing a previous case (Bitner v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation) that states that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is indeed a public entity. The judge also notes that Labor Code section 6312 is relevant to the case, as it allows employees to file complaints with the Labor Commissioner if they believe they have been discharged or discriminated against in violation of Labor Code sections 6310 or 6311. The judge will issue a final ruling after considering the parties' responses to the tentative ruling.
