 
            This action
arises out of an employment dispute. Plaintiff Lynette Whiting (Plaintiff) alleges that, while working for Defendants California
Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and California Correctional Health
Care Services (Defendants), she was discriminated
against, harassed, and retaliated against because of her membership in several
protected status groups.  She further
alleges that Defendants failed to accommodate her disability. 
 
On January 12, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a Complaint. On July 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint alleging
causes of action for (1.) discrimination based on FEHA, (2.) harassment based
on FEHA (3.) retaliation based on FEHA, (4.) failure to engage in the
interactive process under FEHA, (5.) failure to accommodate under FEHA, (6.)
failure to prevent discrimination and harassment, (7.) a violation of Labor
Section 1102.5, and (8.) violation of Labor Code section 6310.  
 
On July 19, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed
her seventh cause of action. 
 
Defendant California Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation and the California Correctional Health Care
Services (jointly, CDCR) demur to the eighth cause of action based on
Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Government Tort Claims Act (ACT). Defendants
also move to strike certain allegations underlying the discrimination and
harassment claim. Plaintiff filed an opposition to both the demurrer and the
motion to strike.  
 
            The
demurrer to the eighth cause of action is sustained without leave to amend. The
motion to strike is granted without leave to amend. 
 
Legal Standard for
Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the complaint
or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a
pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley v. Harvey (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a pleading, for the
purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed,
with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
. . . .” ’ ”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518,
525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally construes the
complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been stated. (Picton
v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
Eighth
Cause of Action – Violation of Labor Code section 6310
 
             Defendants demur to the eighth cause of action
on the ground that Plaintiff failed to plead facts demonstrating she complied
with the requirements of Government Tort Claims Act (Act). 
 
Government
Code section 945.4 states: “[N]o suit for money or damages may be brought
against a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required to
be presented ... until a written claim therefor has been presented to the
public entity and has been acted upon by the board, or has been deemed to have
been rejected by the board....” The Government Tort Claims Act requires that a
plaintiff present a tort claim for money or damages within six months before
filing a lawsuit against certain public entities. (Gov. Code, §§ 900.4, 900.6,
905, 911.2; see DiCampli-Mintz v. County of Santa Clara (2012) 55
Cal.4th 983, 991.) Failure to present a timely claim bars litigation against
the public entity. (Gov. Code, § 945.4.)
 
Here, the
eighth cause of action alleges violation of Labor Code section 6310, which
prohibits the firing of an employee who complains to a governmental agency
having responsibility for regulating safety in the relevant industry. Based on
the FAC, Plaintiff is seeking compensatory damages under this claim. (See FAC ¶ 67; id., Prayer for
Relief, ¶ 1.) Plaintiff does not, however, allege in her FAC that she presented
a claim for damages to her public entity employer before she commenced this
action.
 
Plaintiff does not dispute that the
FAC lacks allegations that she complied with Government Code section 945.4. Instead,
Plaintiff argues she was not required to comply with the requirements of the
Act, citing Kappelman v. City & County of San Francisco (N.D. Cal.,
Oct. 27, 2015, No. 14-CV-04434-MEJ) 2015 WL 6471184.
 
The sole issue in this demurrer is
whether Plaintiff was required to submit a government tort claim under
Government Code section 945.4 prior to filing suit against her government employer
for violation of Labor Code section 6310.
 
In support of its demurrer,
Defendant cites the following cases: Le Mere v. Los Angeles Unified
School Dist. (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 237, E.M. v. Los Angeles Unified
School District (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 736, State of
California v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, City of Stockton v. Superior
Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, and Phillips v. Desert Hospital
Dist. (1989) 49 Cal.3d 699.
 
In response, Plaintiff argues that these
authorities do not specifically pertain to her retaliation claim under Labor
Code section 6310.[1] 
 
Plaintiff relies on the federal
district court opinion in Kappelman v. City & County of San Francisco (N.D. Cal.,
Oct. 27, 2015, No. 14-CV-04434-MEJ) 2015 WL 6471184.
There, the court determined that
a government employee’s retaliation claim under Labor Code section
6310 was not barred by his failure to file a claim under the Government
Claims Act because Section 6310 is silent as to administrative
remedies. The federal court relied on a 2014 amendment to the Labor Code that
was codified in Labor Code section 244. 
 
Labor
Code section 244, subdivision (a), provides in part that “[a]n individual is
not required to exhaust administrative remedies or procedures in order to bring
a civil action under any provision of this code, unless that section under
which the action is brought expressly requires exhaustion of an administrative
remedy.” Labor Code section 244 eliminates confusion on whether a litigant must
exhaust administrative remedies and only requires such action where the specific
Labor Code statute requires it. 
 
For
example, in Sheridan v.
Touchstone Television Productions, LLC
(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 508, the court examined whether there was a
requirement to comply with the administrative remedies in bringing a claim
under Labor Code sections 98.7 and 6312.[2]
The court explained:
 
“Before the 2013 amendments, sections 98.7 and 6312
permitted but did not require plaintiffs to resort to administrative
procedures. The California Supreme Court had not settled the issue, and Lloyd
had held that exhaustion under section 98.7 was not required before filing suit
under section 1102.5. (Satyadi, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 1032, 182
Cal.Rptr.3d 21.) Thus, exhaustion of the remedy provided by section 98.7 was
not required, and the 2013 enactments simply clarified this point. (Ibid.)
The same reasoning applies to section 6312, which, like section 98.7, does not
require administrative exhaustion and had not been “finally and definitively
interpreted.” (McClung, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 473, 20 Cal.Rptr.3d 428,
99 P.3d 1015.) Sheridan therefore was not required to exhaust her
administrative remedies before filing suit for a violation of section 6310.” (Id.
at 517.)
 
However, the question on this demurrer is
whether Labor Code section 244, which concerns whether administrative remedies
must be exhausted, applies to the claim presentation requirement of Government
Code section 945.4.  Are these two
pre-suit procedures identical?  Kappelman
seems to assume they are, but California cases have never treated them as one
and the same.
 
Cases that have analyzed Labor Code section
244 have repeatedly explained that it did not change existing law but merely
“clarified” it. (See Terris v. County of Santa Barbara (2018) 20
Cal.App.5th 551, 556 [Section 244 “merely clarifies existing law”]; see also Satyadi
v. West Contra Costa Healthcare Dist. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 1022, 1032
[same].) 


Here, there
is no argument that the claim presentation requirement of Government Code
section 945.4 applied to claims like this one before enactment of Labor Code
section 244. 
 
In
contrast, the ruling in Kappelman (which is not binding on this Court)
would have the effect of changing the law by removing an undisputed pre-suit requirement
that parties seeking money damages from a governmental entity present tort
claims. This result is contrary to the intent of Section 244, which the Court of
Appeal indicated applied “only to claims before the Labor Commissioner.” (Terris v. County of Santa Barbara (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 551, 553.)
 
The requirement of pre-suit claim presentation has
been affirmed in analogous cases. Le Mere v. Los Angeles Unified School District (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 237, held
that a claimant must comply with the Government Claims Act to assert a whistleblower
retaliation cause of action under Labor Code section 1102.5. (Id. at
245-257.)  In contrast, Satyadi v.
West Contra Costa Healthcare Dist. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 1022, held
that a plaintiff was
not required to exhaust her remedy before the Labor Commissioner prior to
filing suit under Labor Code section 1102.5. (Id. at 1033.) These
decisions demonstrate that it is incorrect to equate the filing of a tort claim
with administrative exhaustion. 
 
Defendant cites other case
authority distinguishing compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act with administrative
exhaustion procedures. (See Lozada v. City and County of San Francisco (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 1139, 1153 [requiring compliance with the Government Tort Claims
Act in the context of a POBRA claim while acknowledging that Government Code section
3309.5 eliminated the requirement that a party to comply with any
administrative remedies prior to filing an action in court].) 
 
Accordingly, Labor Code section 244 offers no exception
to Plaintiff’s
requirement to submit a timely claim under Government Code section 945.4 before
filing this action. The demurrer to
the eighth cause of action is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
Legal Standard for
Motions to Strike
 
            “The court may, upon a
motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an
order of the court.”¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 436.) “Immaterial” or “irrelevant”
matters include allegations not essential to the claim, allegations neither
pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or a demand for
judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the complaint.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 431.10, subds. (b)(1)-(3).)
 
Allegations of Other FEHA Violations 
 
            Defendants
also move to strike certain allegations underlying the discrimination and
harassment causes of action. 
 
            Specifically,
Defendant moves to strike portions of Paragraph 25  “… refusal to provide,
offer and/or consider reasonable accommodation, refusal to engage in the interactive
process, refusal to prevent, investigate and/or correct violations of the FEHA
…” and portions of Paragraph 30, “… forcing Plaintiff to make repeated requests
for accommodation and attempts to invoke the interactive process, failing to
engage in the interactive process, providing inadequate restroom facilities . .
..”
 
            To support her discrimination claim,
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to accommodate her and engage in the
interactive process, and refused to prevent, investigate, and/or correct FEHA
violations, which amounted to adverse employment actions. (FAC ¶ 25.)
Similarly, Plaintiff alleges that she suffered harassment because Defendant
failed to accommodate her and engage in the interactive process. (FAC ¶ 30
[“Defendants’ unwarranted harassing conduct included without limitation,
forcing Plaintiff to make repeated requests for accommodation and attempts to
invoke the interactive process, failing to engage in the interactive process,
providing inadequate restroom facilities ….”].)
 
            Citing Brown
v. Los Angeles Unified School District (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 1092,
1106-1107, Defendant argues these allegations cannot support the discrimination
or harassment claim as a matter of law. 
 
            The court
in Brown explained that:
 
“the
FEHA scheme prohibits specific unlawful employment practices by covered
employers, e.g., discrimination, retaliation, failure to make reasonable
accommodation, failure to engage in the interactive process with the employee.
We conclude that the commission of one specific prohibited employment practice
does not, in and of itself, constitute commission of all other prohibited
employment practices under the broad rubric of policies or practices affecting
the “terms, conditions or privileges of employment.” Such an interpretation
would be contrary to the whole point of specifically separating conduct
into individual unlawful employment practices.” (Id.
at 1106.)
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that Brown is distinguishable from the
facts here because she has alleged that her employer’s failure to accommodate her or
engage in the interactive process was motivated by animus towards her due to
her race and/or sex. In contrast, the Brown court
specifically noted that: “Brown has not alleged she was the target of disparate
treatment.” (Id. at 1107.) 
 
            While
the Brown court found other defects that also supported its decision, it
also separately concluded that a failure to
reasonably accommodate an employee’s disability—which is a separate cause of
action under FEHA (§ 12940, subd. (m))—cannot qualify as the adverse action
underlying a discrimination or support a harassment claim. (Brown v. Los Angeles Unified School District (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 1092, 1106; Doe v.
Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 721,
736.) As in Brown, the FAC improperly conflates an adverse employment
action for discrimination under FEHA with allegations that form a separate
cause of action under FEHA.
 
            The motion to strike is granted. The
Court denies Plaintiff’s request for leave to “amend the complaint to include more
detailed references to Defendants’ harassing and discriminatory conduct,
including more details about how Defendants’ were hostile towards Plaintiff
regarding her disability and the harassment Plaintiff experienced, and the
impact these actions had on her work environment.” (Opp. 4:14-17.) Allowing
this amendment will not salvage Plaintiff’s improper reliance on Defendant’s
failure to accommodate her and failure to engage in the interactive process as
a basis for her discrimination claim or harassment claim. Thus, Plaintiff has
not demonstrated likelihood of success in amending to address the specific
issue the court decided on this motion to strike. 
 
Conclusion
 
The demurrer to the eighth cause of
action is sustained without leave to amend. The motion to strike is granted
without leave to amend.
