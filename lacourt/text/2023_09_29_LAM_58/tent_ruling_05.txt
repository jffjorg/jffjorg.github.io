that Defendants’ demurrer fails because Defendant has not demonstrated that the
California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is a public agency.

is highly relevant to Labor Code section 6310; Labor Code section 6312 provides

otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of Section 6310 or
6311 may file a complaint with the Labor Commissioner pursuant to
Section 98.7.” [emphasis added]
