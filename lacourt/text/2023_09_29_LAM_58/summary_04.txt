Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Defendant in a case alleging employment discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. The Plaintiff, Lynette Whiting, alleges that she was discriminated against, harassed, and retaliated against because of her membership in several protected status groups while working for the Defendant, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and California Correctional Health Care Services. The Defendant demurred to the eighth cause of action, alleging that the Plaintiff failed to comply with the Government Tort Claims Act, which requires a written claim to be presented to the public entity within six months before filing a lawsuit. The Judge sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the Plaintiff's failure to present a timely claim bars her lawsuit. The Defendant also moved to strike certain allegations underlying the discrimination and harassment claims, which the Judge granted without leave to amend, finding that the allegations are improper and do not support the Plaintiff's claims.
