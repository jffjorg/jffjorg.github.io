English summary:
This tentative ruling arises from an employment dispute between Plaintiff Lynette Whiting and Defendants California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and California Correctional Health Care Services. Plaintiff alleges discrimination, harassment, retaliation, failure to accommodate her disability, and failure to prevent discrimination and harassment. Defendants demurred to the eighth cause of action based on Plaintiff's failure to comply with the Government Tort Claims Act by not presenting a tort claim for damages to her public entity employer before commencing the action. The court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and granted the motion to strike without leave to amend. The sole issue was whether Plaintiff was required to submit a government tort claim under Government Code section 945.4 prior to filing suit against her government employer for violation of Labor Code section 6310. Plaintiff argued that she was not required to comply with the Act, citing a federal district court opinion in Kappelman v. City & County of San Francisco, while Defendants cited several California cases in support of their demurrer. The court found that Labor Code section 244 did not apply to the claim presentation requirement of Government Code section 945.4, as these two pre-suit procedures were not identical. Therefore, Plaintiff was required to submit a timely claim under Government Code section 945.4 before filing this action. Additionally, Defendants moved to strike certain allegations underlying the discrimination and harassment causes of action, arguing that failure to accommodate or engage in the interactive process does not qualify as adverse employment actions for these claims. The court granted the motion to strike, as a failure to reasonably accommodate an employee's disability cannot qualify as the adverse action underlying a discrimination or harassment claim.
