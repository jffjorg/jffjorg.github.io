And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel the Defendant to produce its person most qualified to testify at deposition and to produce documents. The Defendant had objected to the deposition notice, claiming that the requests for production of documents and things at deposition sought proprietary and confidential business information. However, the Judge finds that the Defendant did not seek a protective order to avoid producing the requested information. The Judge also declines to award sanctions to the Plaintiff as compensation for attorney fees and costs, citing that the Plaintiff was aware of the Defendant's intention not to produce its most knowledgeable person at the deposition and the Defendant had recently retained new counsel. However, the Court will revisit the issue of sanctions if the Defendant fails to comply with the order.
