COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: Default Judgment
  
                        



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff's default judgment application is valid in all respects except: 
1.         Plaintiff does not attach a
copy of the underlying rental agreement, although the Complaint specifies that
it was written. This is necessary to establish liability of the Defendants and
the liability of each Defendant since Plaintiff seeks judgment against multiple
Defendants.
 
2.         Plaintiff does not explain
or show calculations for attorney’s fees. It seeks $1,000 in attorney’s fees.
Had it calculated attorney’s fees per the Local Rule 3.2 schedule, the amount
would have come out to $1,678.99.
 
 
Plaintiff's default judgment application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
