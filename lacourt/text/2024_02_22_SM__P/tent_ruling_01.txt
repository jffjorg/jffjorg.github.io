Ryan Ghods v.
Coldwell Banker Commercial NRT et al., Case No. 19SMCV01622
Hearing Date
February 22, 2024 
Kailah Pink’s
Motion for New Trial; Permissive Joinder and Civil Complaint 
 
Plaintiff Pink
filed a document entitled “Motion for New Trial, Permissive Joinder and Civil
Complaint” on January 16, 2024. Substantively, the document is a
cross-complaint alleging new causes of action, some of them against parties in Ghods
v. Pink, some of them alleged against new defendants. 
 
The document does
not include a supporting memorandum of points and authorities, in violation of
Cal. Rule of Court 3.1112. It also lacks any citations to relevant authority or
argument justifying a new trial. It also fails to comply with the notice
requirements in Cal. Rule of Court Rule 3.1600 and Cal. Code of Civ. Proc.
§659.
 
Pink cites the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure in support of her attempt to join new parties and
allege new causes of action (see, e.g., Motion pg. 2). This is a California
state court case, so the federal rules are inapplicable. She provides no
relevant state authority granting her the right to file a new cross-complaint
and join new parties after trial has concluded, nor has she moved for or been
granted leave to file a new cross-complaint asserting new claims. DENIED.
Pink’s purported new cross-complaint is STRICKEN.
