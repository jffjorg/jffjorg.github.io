And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ryan Ghods vs. Coldwell Banker Commercial NRT et al. (Case No. 19SMCV01622). Kailah Pink, the defendant, filed a motion for new trial, permissive joinder, and civil complaint on January 16, 2024. However, the motion lacks a supporting memorandum of points and authorities, citations to relevant authority, and compliance with notice requirements. The judge finds that the federal rules of civil procedure are not applicable in this California state court case, and Pink has provided no relevant state authority to support her request to file a new cross-complaint and join new parties. As a result, the judge denies Pink's motion and strikes her purported new cross-complaint.
