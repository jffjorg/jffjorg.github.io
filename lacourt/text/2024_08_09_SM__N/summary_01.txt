And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the judgment. The Plaintiff, Victoria Marie McGrath, had moved to set aside the judgment due to a mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect. The Plaintiff claimed that her counsel received information that the Defendants' per person liability insurance limits were $25,000.00, but was later informed by defense counsel that this was not the case. The Plaintiff argued that this mistake led to the voluntary dismissal of the action with prejudice.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff's counsel's mistake was not excusable, as they failed to conduct discovery to learn the policy limits, failed to confirm the amount of the policy limits before filing the dismissal, and chose to rely on a policy search company that failed to confirm the policy limits. The Judge also noted that the company's disclaimer advised against relying solely on the information provided.

As a result, the Judge denied the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the judgment, finding that discretionary relief was not warranted.
