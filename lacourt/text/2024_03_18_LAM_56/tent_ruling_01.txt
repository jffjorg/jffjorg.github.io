On November 19,

Defendants (the “Judgment”).  On February
16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for an assignment order (the “Motion”)
directing Charlene Yan aka Jie Yan aka Jie E. Yan aka Cecilia Yan (“Judgment
Debtor”), and any of third-party obligors to assign any to the Judgment
Creditor, Judgment Debtor’s rights to payment due from the subject lawsuits and
litigation, to the extent necessary to fully pay and satisfy the judgment in
favor of Judgment Creditor, with all accrued interest and post-judgment costs in
order to satisfy the $663,364.54 of the Judgment, inclusive of post-judgment
interest, fees, costs, and credits that remains unsatisfied. 
 
DISCUSSION
CCP section
708.510, subdivision (a) states, in relevant part: Except as otherwise
provided by law, upon application of the judgment creditor on noticed motion,
the court may order the judgment debtor to assign to the judgment creditor or
to a receiver appointed pursuant to Article 7 (commencing with Section 708.610)
all or part of a right to payment due or to become due, whether or not the
right is conditioned on future developments, including but not limited to the
following types of payments: 
1.    
Wages due from the federal government that are not
subject to withholding under an earnings withholding order. 
2.    
Rents. 
3.    
Commissions. 
4.    
Royalties. 
5.    
Payments due from a patent or copyright. 
6.    
Insurance policy loan value. 
 
(CCP 708.510, subd. (a).) 
 
CCP section 708.510, subdivision (c) provides: In determining
whether to order an assignment or the amount of an assignment pursuant to
subdivision (a), the court may take into consideration all relevant factors,
including the following: 
1.    
The reasonable requirements of a judgment debtor who is
a natural person and of persons supported in whole or in part by the judgment
debtor.
2.    
Payments the judgment debtor is required to make or
that are deducted in satisfaction of other judgments and wage assignments,
including earnings assignment orders for support.
3.    
The amount remaining due on the money judgment. 
4.    
 The amount being
or to be received in satisfaction of the right to payment that may be
assigned. 
 
(CCP § 708.510, subd. (c).) 
 
Under CCP section
708.510, subdivision (d), the court may order the assignment of property only
to the extent necessary to satisfy the money judgment.  (CCP § 708.510,
subd. (d).)  The motion must include sufficient facts to permit the court
to make a determination that the payment is assignable to the judgment
creditor.  (Kracht v. Perrin (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1019, 1023.)
 
In support of the
Motion, Plaintiff provides evidence that the principal of the Judgment remains unsatisfied,
and post-judgment interest, costs and fees have accrued.  (See Declaration of Jerry Jen (“Jen
Decl.”) ¶¶ 9-12.)  Plaintiff has learned
that Judgment Debtor is a plaintiff in a separate lawsuit (Jie “Charlene” Yan
v. Ruiying Liu, et. al. (Case # 30-2023-01321325-CU-BT-CJC), and that she is
also a judgment creditor of a civil judgment (Shino Jin v. Jie Yan, et. al.
(LASC Case # 23STCV13341). (Id. ¶¶ 4-5, Exhibs. B-C.)  Plaintiff has learned that Judgment Debtor is
related to, controls, and/or serves as a director, officer, or has ownership
interest in numerous third-party entities, including the potential rights to
payments and/or distributions of funds and assets from such third-party
lawsuits.  (Id. ¶¶ 6-9, Exhibs.
D-F.)  
 
Plaintiff has
sufficiently demonstrated a right to an assignment order to assign Judgment
Creditor’s payment rights to satisfy the Judgment.  For this reason and because it is unopposed,
the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) 
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar. 
 
         Dated this 18th day of March 2024
