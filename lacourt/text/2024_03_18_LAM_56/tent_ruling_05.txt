BACKROUND
Plaintiff Mural Media, LLC 401K Plan (“Plaintiff”)
filed a verified complaint for unlawful detainer on October 20, 2023 against
Defendants Linda J. Maultsby (“Maultsby”), All Unknown Occupants, Tenants, and
Subtenants, and Does 1 through 25. 
 
On January 31, 2024, Maultsby filed the instant
demurrer without motion to strike. On February 5, 2024, Maultsby filed a
request for judicial notice. 
 
On February 13, 2024, the Court denied Maultsby’s
motion to transfer venue without prejudice. 
 
On February 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition
to the demurrer. 
On March 11, 2024, Maultsby filed a reply. 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Maultsby requests that the Court take judicial
notice of the unlawful detainer complaint filed September 1, 2023 in Mural
Media, LLC 401K Plan v. Maultsby (23STCV21446).
(RJN, Exh. A.) 
 
Maultsby’s request is GRANTED, as Exhibit A is a
record of the courts of this state. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of the pleading at
issue as a matter of law. (City of Chula Vista v. County of San Diego (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1713, 1719.) A demurrer may be sustained where the complaint fails
to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).)
The ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also
Shields v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [“On demurrer,
pleadings are read liberally and allegations contained therein are assumed to
be true.”]) However, the Court does not assume the truth of allegations
expressing conclusions of law or allegations contradicted by the exhibits to
the complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken. (Vance v.
Villa Park Mobilehome Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.)   
 
Additionally, a special demurrer to a complaint may
be brought on the ground the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or
unintelligible. (CCP § 430.10(f); Beresford Neighborhood Assn. v. City of San
Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) A demurrer based on uncertainty is
disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the pleading is uncertain
in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th
612, 616.) A demurrer for uncertainty may be sustained when a defendant cannot
reasonably determine to what he or she is required to respond. For example,
when a plaintiff joins multiple causes of action as one, fails to properly
identify each cause of action, or fails to state against which party each cause
of action is asserted if there are multiple defendants, a complaint is
uncertain. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135,
139, fn. 2.) 
 
If the demurrer is sustained, plaintiff “has the burden
of proving the possibility of cure by amendment.” (Czajkowski v. Haskell &
White, LLP (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 166, 173 [citing Grinzi v. San Diego Hospice
Corp. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 72, 78-79.]) Leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successfully stating a cause of action.
(Schulz v. Neovi Data Corp. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 86, 92.) 
 
DISCUSSION
Maultsby demurs to the complaint on the grounds
that 1) there is another action pending between the Plaintiff and Defendant on
the same cause of action, 2) Plaintiff does not have legal capacity to sue, 3)
the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
and is uncertain, and 4) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because
Maultsby was not served with any of the pre-requisite notices to quit and the
pre-requisite notice is fatally defective on its face. The Court finds that
demurrer is appropriate based on the fact there is another action pending
between the parties based on the same causes of action. 
 
Maultsby contends Plaintiff filed a separate
unlawful detainer action against Maultsby based on the same dwelling (5109 Westhaven St., Los
Angeles, CA 90016) and the same
notice to vacate premises from August 24, 2023. Maultsby contends that this
action is still pending. 
 
The demurrer statutes provide that demurrer may be
sustained on the grounds that there is another action pending on the same cause
of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (c).)
 
Here, the action in 23STCV21446 is between the same parties, is also for unlawful
detainer, and seeks identical relief in the prayer for relief. Therefore, § 430.10, subd. (c) applies. Maultsby’s demurrer is therefore
SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
