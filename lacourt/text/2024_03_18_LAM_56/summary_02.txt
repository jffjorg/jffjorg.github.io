This tentative ruling addresses discovery motions filed by the plaintiffs against the defendant, Centaurus Financial, Inc. The plaintiffs seek to compel further responses to requests for admissions and special interrogatories, and request evidentiary and monetary sanctions due to the defendant's failure to comply with discovery obligations. The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and finds that the defendant's responses are insufficiently compliant with the standards set forth by the California Code of Civil Procedure. The Court orders the defendant to provide full and complete amended verified responses to the plaintiffs' requests for admissions and special interrogatories. The Court also grants the plaintiffs monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,600 per motion, which represents four hours preparing the moving papers at a rate of $400 per hour.
