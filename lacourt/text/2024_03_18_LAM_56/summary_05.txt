And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendant Linda J. Maultsby. The demurrer alleges that there is another action pending between the parties based on the same causes of action, that the plaintiff does not have legal capacity to sue, that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain, and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Maultsby was not served with any of the pre-requisite notices to quit.

The judge finds that the demurrer is appropriate based on the fact that there is another action pending between the parties based on the same causes of action. The judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be able to amend the complaint to fix the defects pointed out by the demurrer. The judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (c), which allows a demurrer to be sustained if there is another action pending on the same cause of action.
