Background
 
On December 21,
2023, Quetzal Salcido as administrator of Patricia Salcido-Alvonistis’s Estate
(“Plaintiff”) filed an Unlawful Detainer (UD) Complaint against Eric
Martirosyan and E & E Ristorante Group, Inc. (collectively “Defendants”). 
 
On February 26,
2024, Defendants filed a demurrer to the UD Complaint. Plaintiff filed opposing
papers. The matter is now before the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
Defendants demur to
the Complaint on the based that the “Five Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit
Premises” for the commercial Lease at issue fails to strictly comply with the
requirements of CCP § 1161(2) by failing to include a telephone number of the
person to whom the rent shall be made to cure the claimed default. Defendants
further assert that the Five Day Notice is deficient because the amount due is
uncertain since the notice states that rent due includes “common area
maintenance charges” that are not included in the Lease and “fees and costs all
in the approximate sum of $119,805.23” representing the total unpaid rent from
the last (12) months” but no exact date is given other than “October.”  (UD Compl. ¶ 9(b)(2), ¶ 19(g); Ex. 1, 2.) 
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff alleges that they seek possession not based on the failure to pay
rent but based on the expiration of a fixed term lease and because
Defendants have not paid rent. (Opp. at p.2:12-13.) Plaintiff asserts that
reference to “October” in Paragraph 19(g) was merely “a scrivener’s error (and
can be amended according to proof at trial” and asserts that “No notice was
required, the Notice served substantially complies with Code of
Civil Procedure section 1161(2) and the amount of rent sought in the Notice is
a reasonable estimate.” (Opp. at p. 2:25-27.) In other words, Plaintiff asserts
that because they substantially complied with the notice requirements under
section 1161, the demurrer should be overruled. However, the Unlawful Detainer
statute is strictly construed. (See Briggs v. Electronic Memories &
Magnetics Corp. (1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 900, 905; Attenello
v. Basilious (2022) 88 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1, 11.) 
 
Plaintiff further
asserts that no notice is required because Paragraph 11 of the UD action states
that Plaintiff seeks possession based on expiration of a fixed term lease.
(Compl. UD ¶ 11.) The Lease states the Lease term ended on July 14, 2023, but
in Paragraph 9(b), Plaintiff lists the date of forfeiture as November 20, 2023.
(UD Compl. ¶ 9, Ex. 1.) When a lease term ends and the tenant continues to
retain possession, a tenancy at will is created. (Borden v. Stiles
(2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 337, 347–348.) Here, it appears that after the expiration
of the term on July 25, 2023, a tenancy at will was created. 
 
For a UD action based
on possession after the expiration of a term lease under section 1161(1), a
30-day notice is required under Civ. Code § 789 for a tenancy at will. (See Alves v. Rodrigues (1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 333, 336
[requiring a 30-day notice for a tenancy at will].) If a month-to-month lease
was created, then a 30-day notice is required under Civ. Code § 1946. (See Miller & Desatnik Management Co. v. Bullock (1990)
221 Cal.App.3d Supp. 13, 18.) Here, the Lease at issue requires also requires a
30 day notice by the landlord under the “RENEWAL TERMS” of the Lease.
(UD Compl. Ex. 1.) The “RENEWAL TERMS” states as follows” 
 
The Lessee (Tenant) shall have the
option to renew for an additional period of One (1) Five (5) Year Term, unless
the Landlord gives written notice of termination no later than 30 days prior to
the end of the term at which time the Landlord shall pay to the Tenant a
onetime payment of $200,000. The lease term during such renewal term shall be
the same as those contained in this Lease. 
 
(UD Compl. Ex. 1.) 
 
Lastly, as to the assertion
that the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, as codified in Civil Code § 1946.2 does
not apply, the UD Complaint states that it does not apply (UD Compl. ¶ 7(a)).  Section 1946.2 only applies to residential
real property, not commercial properties such as the one at issue here. (Civ.
Code, § 1946.2.) 
 
“A 30–day or 3–day notice is valid and
enforceable only if the lessor has strictly complied with these statutorily
mandated requirements for service.” (Losornio v. Motta (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 110, 114.) “Absent evidence the requisite notice was properly
served pursuant to section 1162, no judgment for possession can be obtained.” (Id.
at p. 53.) Based on the above, the court finds that Plaintiff failed to
strictly comply with the notice requirements under CCP §§ 1161(1) and (2),
Plaintiff's notice is deficient, and the demurrer is sustained without leave to
amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ demurrer is sustained
without leave to amend. The action is dismissed.
