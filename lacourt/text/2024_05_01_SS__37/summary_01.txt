Here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants is sustained without leave to amend, and the action is dismissed. The plaintiff's notice was found to be deficient, and the court finds that the plaintiff failed to strictly comply with the notice requirements under CCP § 1161(1) and (2). The court also notes that the plaintiff's notice was deficient because it failed to include a telephone number of the person to whom the rent shall be made to cure the claimed default. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's notice is deficient and the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
