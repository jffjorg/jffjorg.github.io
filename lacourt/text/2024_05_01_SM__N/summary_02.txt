And here is the English-text summary:

Judge's Tentative Ruling: The Defendant's motion to quash the service of summons is granted. The Defendant, Alex Baranov, argues that the Plaintiff, Rima Azatyan, failed to serve him in a code-complaint manner. The proof of service shows that the Defendant was served by substituted service on October 5, 2023, at 6:48 p.m. at 7101 Matilija Avenue in Van Nuys. However, the Defendant's insurance carrier retained a private investigator who could not find the Defendant at the address, and a female inhabitant of the address stated she does not know the Defendant and no one with that name has lived at the address. The court finds that the Plaintiff failed to prove that the Defendant was served in a code-complaint manner and grants the Defendant's motion to quash the service of summons.
