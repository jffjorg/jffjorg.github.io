This tentative ruling discusses a motion by Defendant Amy Goldman to compel further responses to special interrogatories from Plaintiff Appleton Way, LLC. The court grants the motion, requiring Plaintiff to provide code-compliant responses to special interrogatories 1-9 without objection within 30 days of the order. The court also denies Defendant's request for monetary sanctions. The court notes that this may be the beginning of several planned discovery motions and advises the parties to resolve their disputes informally to avoid the costs of a discovery referee.
