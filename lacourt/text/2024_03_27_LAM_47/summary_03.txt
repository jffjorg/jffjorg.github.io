The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case Elkana Aharoni v. Berkshire Hathaway & Gussman Czako Estates, et al. (Case No. 23STCV08045). The case involves an action for fraud, wherein the plaintiff, Elkana Aharoni, alleges that the defendants fraudulently induced him to purchase a parcel of real property for $3,000,000 by misrepresenting the square footage of the property. The plaintiff has demurred to the answer of Heather Gussman, one of the defendants. However, on November 21, 2023, the plaintiff filed a request for dismissal without prejudice as to Heather Gussman, and the dismissal was entered on November 22, 2023. Consequently, the plaintiff's demurrer to the answer of Heather Gussman is now moot. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of this tentative ruling.
