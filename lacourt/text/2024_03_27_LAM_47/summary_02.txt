And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the Second Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Defendants West Pointe Homes, Inc. and James Stephen Rasmussen. The motion seeks to strike paragraphs 25 and 26 of the Cross-Complaint, which allege that the proposed contract between the parties did not comply with the requirements of Business and Professions Code §7159 and that the contract is not valid. The Judge has denied the motion, finding that the allegations are not irrelevant or improper. The Judge also noted that the parties' arguments concerning the sophistication of the Cross-Complainants are irrelevant and that the authorities cited by Cross-Defendants do not support their position. The Judge's ruling is subject to modification or reversal at the hearing scheduled for May 7, 2024.
