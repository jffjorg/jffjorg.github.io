And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel Plaintiff Mihailo Stanic's psychological examination, which was scheduled for August 30, 2023, and September 1, 2023. The examination was initially set to take place in California, and Plaintiff was required to be physically present in the state for the telehealth evaluation. However, Plaintiff failed to appear for the examination and asserted that he would appear remotely from Serbia, where he claims to have moved in April 2023. The Court finds that Plaintiff has waived any objection to the location of the examination and grants the motion to compel. The Court also denies the request for sanctions as procedurally defective. Plaintiff is ordered to appear at a psychological examination within 30 days and provide notice of the Court's order and file proof of service of such.
