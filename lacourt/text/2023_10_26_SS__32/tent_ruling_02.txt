Plaintiff asserts in response that Defendants hired NRG, NRG entered into a
subcontractor agreement with Icon, and Icon hired Plaintiff to perform the
roofing work. (Pl. Resp. to UMF 7.)

Court does not reach questions regarding whether Plaintiff may sue NRG or Icon
in tort due to exclusions from workersâ€™ compensation coverage (see, e.g., Mendoza
v. Brodeur (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 72) because those issues are not the
subject of this motion for summary judgment.
