And here is the English summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel for the defendants, Ara Karapetian and Narine Petrossian. The motion is granted conditionally pending the filing and service of updated proposed orders. The court finds that there is a valid reason for the withdrawal, citing the lack of communication and breach of the retainer agreement by the clients. However, the court orders the counsel to file amended forms MC-053 within 5 calendar days of the hearing, which should include information about all future hearings and proceedings noticed by any party, or ordered by the court. The court also requires the counsel to serve the signed orders within 10 days of the date of the order, and file proofs of service of such.
