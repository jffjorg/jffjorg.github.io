And here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to deem admitted a set of requests for admissions. The Plaintiff, Mary Ann Cuevas, served the requests on December 6, 2022, and granted an extension to respond until February 13, 2023. The Defendant, Marla Barraza Beltran, failed to respond until September 19, 2023, when her new counsel served responses. The Court finds that the motion to deem admitted is denied as moot since responses were served before the hearing. The Court grants the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the Defendant and her counsel of record in the reduced amount of $561.65, payable within 30 days.
