[1] Although
Plaintiff appears to fault Defendants for not raising the travel issue,
Plaintiff provides no explanation for how Defendants were to know that
Plaintiff permanently resides in Serbia. Moreover, for purposes of this motion,
Plaintiff has not provided a declaration under penalty of perjury that he
resides in Serbia.
 
Plaintiff further argues that Plaintiff opposed the
motion “in its entirety,” and therefore “had no reason to address any line-item
content or specific terms within Defendants’ Demand for Psychological
Examination.” (Opposition at p. 8.) Plaintiff’s position results in an
inefficient use of court time and a waste of resources.


[2] The
title of the motion itself requests sanctions in the alternative to the motion
to compel.
