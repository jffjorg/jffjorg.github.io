Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel the forensic digital device examination of Defendant Mickey Vasquez's cellular phones. The Court finds that Plaintiff has provided sufficient justification for the inspection, as it could provide evidence of Vasquez using his phones while driving and therefore failing to see the stopped cars ahead. The Court also finds that Plaintiff has met and conferred in good faith and that the proposed stipulation governing the inspection of the two cell phones addresses most of Vasquez's objections. The Court notes that Vasquez's privacy interests will be protected because Plaintiff has agreed to make the report available to Vasquez before Plaintiff and that Vasquez can direct the withholding and redaction of information on the basis of privilege or protection. The Court also limits the time frame of extraction from 5:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. on the day of the accident, unless Plaintiff can demonstrate good cause.
