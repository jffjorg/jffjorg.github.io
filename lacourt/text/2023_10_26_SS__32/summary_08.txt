And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Catherine Rodriguez's motion for sanctions against Defendant Office Depot. The plaintiff had requested a continuance to file a reply after the court denied their initial motion to deem admitted against the defendant. The judge has found that the plaintiff does not have sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant's failure to respond was willful. The judge is requiring counsel for the defendant to confirm at the hearing that they were unaware of the Requests for Admissions until July 24, 2023. The judge has declined to award sanctions to the plaintiff and is encouraging the parties to meet and confer to determine if a resolution can be reached.
