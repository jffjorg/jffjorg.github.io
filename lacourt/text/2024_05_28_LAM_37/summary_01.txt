And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the defendants' motion to strike punitive damages from the First Amended Complaint. The defendants, Sitcoproperties, Inc., Simicha Borenstein aka Sam Borenstein, and LA Housing Outreach LLC, moved to strike the punitive damages claim, arguing that the plaintiff, James Borrelli, failed to plead sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to show malice, fraud, or oppression towards him, which are necessary to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge concludes that the defendants' conduct, including repeatedly telling the plaintiff that the building would undergo major renovations, which was false, and cutting off the plaintiff's access to parking, was intended to induce the plaintiff to give up his rent-stabilized tenancy.
