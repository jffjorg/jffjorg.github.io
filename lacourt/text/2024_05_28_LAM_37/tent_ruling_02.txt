Pursuant
to CCP § 435.5(a), Defendants’ counsel submitted a declaration attesting to
Defense counsel’s meet and confer effort. (Zakaria
Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. C.) No response was provided by Plaintiff’s counsel. “Any determination by the
court that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to
overrule or sustain a demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).) As the failure to meet
and confer does not constitute grounds to overrule a demurrer, the court will
consider the merits of the demurrer.
