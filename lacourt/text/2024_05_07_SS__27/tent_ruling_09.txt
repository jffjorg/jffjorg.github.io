Legal Standard¿and Analysis
 
Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.¿(CRC Rule 3.1332(c).)¿The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance.¿(CRC Rule
3.1332(c).) The Court may look to the following factors in determining whether
a trial continuance is warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether
there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of
the continuance requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address
the problem that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or
witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial
counsel is engaged in another trial.¿(See
generally, CRC Rule 3.1332(d)(1)-(11).)¿Additional
factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s excused inability to
obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite
diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; and any
other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.¿(CRC Rule 3.1332(c), (d).)
 
On
November 29, 2022, Plaintiff filed the present premises liability case against
Defendant Union Rescue Mission. Defendant filed its answer on April 4, 2023.
The current trial date is set for May 28, 2024. Plaintiff filed the present
case to continue the trial date in order to conduct further discovery. The
parties have filed a stipulation to continue the trial to September 23, 2024. Based
on the fact that Defendant appeared only recently and the stipulation by both
parties, the Court finds the Parties' need for additional time to conduct
discovery and request for continuance reasonable. Thus, the present motion is
GRANTED.
 
The new trial date is set for September ____,
2024, at 8:30 a.m. and all pretrial dates are continued in accordance
with the new trial date.¿ The
Final Status Conference is continued to _____, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.
