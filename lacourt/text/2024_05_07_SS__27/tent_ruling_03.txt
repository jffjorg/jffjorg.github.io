Case No./Name.:         21STCV00938 ESHRAT HAROUNIAN vs CITY OF
BEVERLY HILLS
Motion Name:                MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET
ONE, AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS 
Moving Party:                 Defendant MAHI RASTEGAR
Responding Party:      Plaintiff
Notice:                                Sufficient 
 
Ruling:                               MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET
ONE, AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE DENIED.
 
On January 11, 2021, Plaintiff filed the
present premises liability case. On March 26, 2024, Defendant moves the court
to compel Plaintiff to provide further responses to her Form Interrogatories,
Set One. Defendant has not scheduled or participated in an Informal Discovery Conference
on the discovery responses at issue prior to filing the present motion.
 
Personal Injury Hub Courts will not entertain
Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses until the parties have
participated in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). (Eighth Amended
Standing Order For Procedures In The Personal Injury Hub Court at p. 7.) The
Court may either deny or continue a Motion to Compel Further Responses to
discovery if the parties do not schedule and complete an IDC prior to the
hearing date set for a Motion to Compel Further Responses to Discovery. (Id.) 
 
The parties are required to participate in an
Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) to attempt to resolve any outstanding
discovery disputes before a motion to compel further can be heard. No IDC has
been held or scheduled prior to the hearing or filing of the present motion,
Thus the present motion is denied without prejudice.
