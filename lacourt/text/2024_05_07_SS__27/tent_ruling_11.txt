Background
On May 12, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the present auto accident case. On October 10, 2023, Plaintiff
served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Jun Liang. Defendant served
verified responses on December 7, 2023. The parties have met and conferred and attended
an IDC but were unsuccessful in resolving the discovery dispute. Consequently,
on January 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One, specifically Nos. 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 13.1, 13.2,
15.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7, 16.9, and 16.10.
Preliminary Issue
This motion was timely
filed within 45 days of Defendant’s discovery responses. Plaintiff has met his
meet and confer requirement and the parties have attended an IDC prior to this
hearing. On April 19, 2024, Defendant served further responses to Form Interrogatories
Nos. 13.1, 13.2, 15.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, and 16.7. Currently, only
Form Interrogatories Nos. 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 16.9, and 16.10 remain at issue.
Form Interrogatories Nos. 7.1, 7.2 And
7.3
Form Interrogatory 7.1
states “Do you attribute any loss of or damage to a vehicle or other property
to the INCIDENT? If so, for each item of property…”
Form Interrogatory 7.2
states “Has a written estimate or evaluation been made for any item of property
referred to in your answer to the preceding interrogatory? If so If so, for
each estimate or evaluation state…”
Form Interrogatory 7.3
“states Has any item of property referred to in your answer to interrogatory
7.1 been repaired? If so, for each item state…”
Defendant responded
"NO" to Interrogatory No. 7.1, indicating that he does not attribute
any loss of or damage to a vehicle or other property to the incident. Defendant
answered "not applicable" to Interrogatories Nos. 7.2 and 7.3, which
request information relating to estimates and repairs for the damage claimed in
No. 7.1. Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses by introducing purportedly
contradictory evidence suggesting that Defendant did attribute damage to his
vehicle to the incident.
Form Interrogatory 7.1
requires a yes or no response. Defendant answered “No” and this response is
responsive, complete, and non-evasive. If Plaintiff believes that Defendant’s
deposition contradicts this response, Plaintiff can use it to impeach Defendant
or as grounds for sanctions. However, as stated in Holguin v. Superior Court
(Hoage) (1972) 22 CA3d 812, 820, "[A] court [cannot] force a litigant
to admit any particular fact if he is willing to risk a perjury prosecution or
financial sanctions by denying them." Thus, Defendant’s response to No.
7.1 is code complaint and the Court has no grounds to compel defendant to
answer “Yes” when they have provided verified responses stating “No”.
Interrogatories Nos.
7.2 and 7.3 only need to be answered if Defendant had answered "Yes"
to 7.1. Since Defendant answered "No" to 7.1, his response that Nos.
7.2 and 7.3 are not applicable is appropriate.
Form Interrogatories Nos.16.9 and 16.10
Form Interrogatory No. 16.9
states “Do YOU OR ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF have any DOCUMENT (for example,
insurance bureau index reports) concerning claims for personal injuries made
before or after the INCIDENT by a plaintiff in this case? If so, for each
plaintiff state….”
Form Interrogatory No. 16.10
states “Do YOU OR ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF have any DOCUMENT concerning the
past or present physical, mental, or emotional condition of any plaintiff in
this case from a HEALTH CARE PROVIDER not previously identified (except for
expert witnesses covered by Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.210-2034.310)?
If so, for each plaintiff state…”
To both Form
Interrogatories Nos. 16.9 and 16.10, which elicit a yes or no response,
Defendant answered "No." These responses are therefore code
compliant. Again, if Plaintiff suspects that Defendant’s responses are
untruthful, they can be used to impeach Defendant. As established in Holguin
v. Superior Court (Hoage) (1972) 22 CA3d 812, 820, "[A] court [cannot]
force a litigant to admit any particular fact if he is willing to risk a
perjury prosecution or financial sanctions by denying them." Thus, there
is no basis for compelling further responses to these interrogatories.
Conclusion
Plaintiff's motion to
compel further responses is denied. Since the motion to compel further is
denied, sanctions are likewise denied, as discovery responses allegedly
contradicted by Defendant's testimony are not proper grounds for a motion to
compel further.
