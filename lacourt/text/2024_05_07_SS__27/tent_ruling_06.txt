Background
 
On May 24, 2022, Plaintiff Carlos Quezada
filed the present case regarding an automobile accident that occurred on June
25, 2021. Case 22STCV18295 is a related case arising out of the same accident.
Plaintiff Quezada is a defendant in the related case. 
On October 28, 2022, a Doe amendment naming
Zeno King, Jr. as a defendant was filed in the related case. On June 12, 2023,
Zeno King, Jr. was served with the Doe Amendment in the related case. On
November 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Doe amendment naming Zeno King, Jr. as a
defendant in the present case. Defendant Zeno King, Jr. now demurs to
Plaintiff’s complaint on the basis that he was brought into this case on
November 3, 2023, two years after the statutory deadline.
Legal Standard
 
As
a preliminary matter, the Court notes that Defendant asserts the Doe Amendment
is barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations. However, given that
the complaint was filed within the statute of limitations and named Doe
defendants, the issue here is not whether the action against Defendant is
barred by the statute of limitations. (See McOwen v. Grossman (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 937, 943.) Rather, the issue is whether Plaintiff has met the
requirements for amending the complaint to name Defendant as a responsible
party. (See id.)  
 
CCP
section 474 “allows a plaintiff in good faith to delay suing particular persons
as named defendants until he has knowledge of sufficient facts to cause a
reasonable person to believe liability is probable.” (McOwen, supra, 153
Cal.App.4th at 943.) Whether the plaintiff had knowledge of sufficient facts at
the time of filing is generally a question of fact. (See id. at
945.)  
 
“Section
474 provides a method for adding defendants after the statute of limitations
has expired, but this procedure is available only when the plaintiff is
actually ignorant of the facts establishing a cause of action against the party
to be substituted for a Doe defendant.” (McClatchy v. Coblentz, Patch,
Duffy & Bass, LLP (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 371-72.) “‘Ignorance of
the facts giving rise to a cause of action is the ignorance required by
section 474, and the pivotal question is, ‘did plaintiff know facts?’
not ‘did plaintiff know or believe that [he] had a cause of action based on
those facts?’” (Id. at 372 (quoting General Motors Corp. v.
Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 580, 594).) “‘Although it is true
that a plaintiff’s ignorance of the defendant’s name must be genuine (in good
faith) and not feigned [citations] and that a plaintiff need not be aware of
each and every detail concerning a person’s involvement before the plaintiff
loses his ignorance [citations], it is equally true that the plaintiff does not
relinquish [his] rights under section 474 simply because [he] has a suspicion
of wrongdoing arising from one or more facts [he] does know.’” (Id.
(quoting General Motors, supra, 48 Cal.App.4th at 594-95).) “The
fact that the plaintiff had the means to obtain knowledge is irrelevant.” (General
Motors, supra, 48 Cal.App.4th at 594.) “In short, section 474 does not
impose upon the plaintiff a duty to go in search of facts she does not actually
have at the time she files her original pleading.” (Id. at
596.) “A plaintiff may use section 474 whenever he has no actual knowledge
of the defendant; constructive or legal knowledge will not deprive the
plaintiff of the remedy.” (Sobeck & Associates, Inc. v. B&R
Investments No. 24 (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 861, 867; see also Balon v.
Drost (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 483, 488 (quoting Sobeck & Associates,
Inc., supra, 215 Cal.App.3d at 867).)
 
Analysis
King, Jr. contends that the Doe amendment naming him as a
defendant in a related case on October 28, 2022, along with the subsequent
service of this amendment on June 12, 2023, demonstrates Plaintiff’s prior
knowledge of King Jr.'s identity and involvement in the incident. Consequently,
King Jr. contends Plaintiff’s filing of King Jr.’s Doe amendment in the present
case on November 2, 2023, is not made in good faith. 
In the opposition, Plaintiff argues that he only learned of King
Jr.'s involvement on October 27, 2023, when he received discovery responses
from King Jr., including a police report that identified Zeno King Jr. as an
involved party. On November 2, 2023, shortly after receiving the police report,
Plaintiff filed a Doe Amendment naming Zeno King Jr. as a Defendant in this
action.
Defendant’s
evidence, including the Complaint, Doe amendment and service of the Doe
amendment in the related case (Exhibit A, Exhibit E and Exhibit F) are devoid
of factual details concerning Defendant Zeno King Jr.'s involvement in the accident.
Thus, without providing any additional evidence, Defendant failed to
demonstrate that Plaintiff had knowledge of sufficient facts that would lead a
reasonable person to believe King Jr.’s liability is probable, as required by McOwen
v. Grossman (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 937, 943.
Furthermore,
as to Defendant’s allegation of prejudice, the type of prejudice the court
should be concerned with when amending the complaint is something beyond simply
having to cope with a potentially successful new legal theory of recovery that
has been revealed during discovery. (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal.App.3d 486.) As noted above, Plaintiff amended the complaint soon after
acquiring the police report showing Defendant’s involvement in the incident and
was not tardy in seeking amendment.
 
Thus,
Defendant’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.
