And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories, set one, and requests for sanctions. The reason for the denial is that the parties have not participated in an informal discovery conference (IDC) prior to filing the motion. The judge notes that the Personal Injury Hub Courts will not entertain motions to compel further discovery responses until the parties have participated in an IDC. The judge has set a hearing date for May 7, 2024, and has instructed the parties to submit any objections to the tentative ruling by email.
