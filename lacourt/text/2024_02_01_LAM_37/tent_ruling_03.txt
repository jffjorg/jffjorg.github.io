Background
 
on
May 15, 2023, Kou Family Irrevocable Grantor Trust (“Plaintiff”) filed an
unlawful detainer action against Stanford Mart, L.P. (“Defendant”) and Does 1
to 100. 
 
On September 14, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) asserting the same single
cause of action for unlawful detainer. 
 
On September 25, 2023, the
Defendant filed a demurrer to the FAC. The Plaintiff opposes the demurrer.  
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Discussion
 
Defendant demurs to
the FAC on the basis that (1) Plaintiff lacks standing to bring an unlawful
detainer action because they are not the original Landlords under the Lease,
(2) the Landlord breached section 12.1 of the Lease by failing to provide
Notice of Change in Ownership (3) Section 12.2 also gave Defendant the Right of
First Refusal (“ROFR”) in case the Premises was put on Sale, and (4) The Notice
to Quit (“NTQ”) was invalid as it was not properly served on Defendants. 
 
Whether the Landlords
breached sections 12.1 and 12.2 of the Lease is not at issue as the remedies
Defendant seeks should be brought by filing a complaint for breach of contract.
The relevant issue is whether the NTQ was properly served. 
 
The UD Complaint
states that the Plaintiff is a trust and that “Plaintiff’s interest in the
premises is as owner” and that the rent due, at the time the NTQ was served,
was  $613,023.78. (UD ¶¶ 4, 12.) The
proof of service attached to the NTQ, shows that it was served via substitute
service on a Sierra Velasco, with a copy mailed to the address of the Premises,
807 E. 12st. Ste. 401. (UD Ex. 3.) 
 
CCP § 1161 states
that when a tenant continues to remain on the premises “without the permission
of the
landlord, or the
successor in estate of the landlord, if applicable, after default
in the payment of rent, pursuant to the lease or agreement under which the property
is held, and three days' notice” the notice must be served in writing before
the filing of an unlawful detainer action. (CCP § 1161(2).) Nothing in
section 1161 requires the NTQ be served by the landlord rather than the
successor in interest. (See Lee v. Kotyluk
(2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 719, 734 [“Plaintiffs, as Haynes' successors in interest,
could rely on her notice and file an unlawful detainer action against defendant
after perfecting title”].) 
 
The
right to maintain an action by ‘the successor in estate of his landlord’ is
expressly conferred by section 1161 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Moreover,
section 821 of the Civil Code provides: ‘A person to
whom any real property is transferred or devised, upon which rent has been
reserved, or to whom any such rent is transferred, is entitled to the same
remedies for recovery of rent, for nonperformance of any of the terms of the
lease, or for any waste or cause of forfeiture, as his grantor or devisor might
have had.’


(Plummer v. Agoure (1912) 20 Cal.App. 319, 321; see also Lee
v. Kotyluk, supra, 59 Cal.App.5th at p. 734.)
 
Here, the Complaint
alleges that Plaintiff is a Trust and is the owner of the Premises. (UD ¶¶ 2,
4.) “Unlike a corporation, a trust is not a legal entity. Legal title to
property owned by a trust is held by the trustee, and common law viewed the
trustee as the owner of the trust's property.” (Galdjie v. Darwish
(2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1343.) Accordingly, under Lee v. Kotyluk (2021)
and Plummer v. Agoure (1912), the Plaintiff as the trustee has legal
title of the Premise and has standing to bring an unlawful detainer action
because they are the “owner” or successors in interest in the Premises. (UD ¶¶
2, 4.) 
 
However, CCP § 1161
requires that NTQ be made “pursuant to the lease or agreement under which the
property is held[.]” Defendant points out that under Paragraph 17.1, Plaintiff
was required to serve the NTQ to Defendant at Stanford Mart, LP 3540 Wilshire
Blvd., Ste 1215 Los Angeles, CA with a copy being sent to Ralph B. Kostant,
12650 Riverside Drive. Ste. 100, North Hollywood. CA 91607. (UD Ex. 3 § 17.1.)
Nothing in the proof of service for the NTQ shows that Plaintiff complied with
the notice requirements as required by the Lease. “In
commercial leases the landlord and commercial tenant may lawfully agree to
notice procedures that differ from those provided in the statutory provisions
governing unlawful detainer. [Citation.] Thus, if the lease contains service
requirements for the notice to quit at variance with the requirements in the
unlawful detainer statutes, the lease provisions control.” (Culver Center Partners East #1, L.P. v. Baja Fresh Westlake
Village, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 744, 750.) Therefore,
according to section 11611 and the terms of the Lease, the NTQ was not served
“pursuant to the lease or agreement under which the property is held,” otherwise
the notice is invalid. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff
asserts that the original notice information for Defendant on the Lease was
provided over 20 years ago such that the fax line for Mr. Kostant no longer
works and the legal address maintained by Mr. Kostant is no longer the address
on the Lease. Moreover, under section 17.1 of the Lease, Defendant is obligated
to provide notice of any changes to its address. If Defendant failed to provide
an updated address as to where the notice of the NTQ was to be served,
Defendant may have waived or be estopped from asserting that notice was invalid
under the Lease. 
 
Defendant failed to file a meet
and confer declaration and failed to negate Plaintiff’s assertion that Mr.
Kostant’s address was no longer valid or that Mr. Kostant is no longer
Defendant’s counsel. Accordingly, triable issues of fact exist as to whether
Plaintiff was required to serve the NTQ in accordance with the Lease and
whether Defendant failed to provide an updated address for service of notice.
“On a demurrer a court's function is limited to testing the legal sufficiency
of the complaint. [Citation.] ‘A demurrer is simply not the appropriate
procedure for determining the truth of disputed facts.’ [Citation.]” (Fremont
Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 113-114.)

 
If Defendant can prove that the
address for serving the NTQ remains valid then Defendant will be able to show
that the NTQ was not properly served such that no judgment for possession can
be obtained. (See Palm Property Investments, LLC v. Yadegar
(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419, 1425.) However, a demurrer lies only where the
defect appears on the face of the complaint or from matters outside the
pleading that can be judicially noticed. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
 
As Defendant fails to show that
defects in the Complaints appear on its face, the demurrer is overruled. 
 
Conclusion
 
defendant’s
demurrer is overruled. Defendant to give notice.
