Background
 
On May 7, 2021, Shana
Anglin, Christopher Dean Ebersole, and minors Elijiah Makar and Rozlynn Makar
through their guardian ad litem Shana Anglin (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed
a Complaint against Patrice Loraine Burton, Alex Villanueva in his official
capacity as Sheriff of Los Angeles County, and Does 1 to 20. Doe 1 was named as
Sheriff’s Deputy Justin Meng, Doe 2 was named as Sheriff’s Deputy Derek
Clotworthy, and Doe 3 was named as Sheriff’s Deputy Jose Hurtado. 
 
The Complaint alleges
five causes of action for:
 
(1) Violation of the Tom Bane Civil
Rights Act, against Defendant Burton and Does 7 and 8. 
 
(2) Violation of the Civil Rights Act
of 1871 against Defendant Burton and Does 1 through 5, 11 through 20.  
 
(3) Violation of the Civil Rights Act
of 1871 (42 U.S.C § 1983) against Defendant Alex Villanueva in his official
capacity and Does 9 and 10. 
 
(4) Violation the Civil Rights Act of
1871 (42 U.S.C § 1983) (Monell liability) against Defendant Burton and
Does 6 through 8. 
 
(5) Violation of Civ. Code § 789.3
against Defendant Burton and Does 6 through 8. 
 
The Plaintiffs allege
that they resided in a 4-unit apartment complex (the “Complex”) located in
Carson, CA that was owned by Patrice Loraine Burton (“Burton”). (Compl.  ¶ 11.) The Plaintiffs were allowed to live in
a unit in the complex in exchange for taking care of the Complex, but Burton
changed her mind and decided to evict the Plaintiffs illegally, causing
Plaintiffs to become homeless. (Compl. ¶¶ 11, 17.) The Complaint alleges that
when Burton changed the locks on the Complex and did not allow Plaintiffs to
enter the Complex, Los Angeles Sheriff’s Deputies were called but they refused
to assist Plaintiffs. (Compl. ¶¶ 14, 15.) 
 
On April 3, 2023, Deputies
Hurtado, Meng, and Clotworthy and the County of Los Angeles filed a
Cross-Complaint against Burton for (1) Apportionment of Fault, (2)
Indemnification, and (3) Declaratory Relief. 
 
On October 2, 2023, Deputy
Justin Meng (“Meng”) filed a Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the
alternative, for Summary Adjudication. Plaintiffs oppose the Motion. The matter
is now before the court. 
 
motion for summary judgment or summary ADJUDICATION
 
I.         Legal
Standard
 
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”¿ (Aguilar v. Atl. Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision
(c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) Summary adjudication may be granted as to one or more
causes of action within an action, or one or more claims for damages. (CCP §
437c(f).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
A defendant moving for summary judgment bears two burdens:
(1) the burden of production – presenting admissible evidence, through material
facts, sufficient to satisfy a directed verdict standard; and (2) the burden of
persuasion – the material facts presented must persuade the court that the
plaintiff cannot establish one or more elements of a cause of action, or a
complete defense vitiates the cause of action. (CCP § 437c(p)(2);¿Aguilar,¿supra,
25 Cal.4th at p. 850-851.) A defendant may satisfy this burden by showing that
the claim “cannot be established” because of the lack of evidence on some
essential element of the claim.¿¿(Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995) 31
Cal.App.4th 574, 590.)¿¿Once the defendant meets this burden, the burden shifts
to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to that cause of action or defense thereto.”¿(Ibid.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
“On ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court is to
‘liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.’” (Cheal
v. El Camino Hospital¿(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 736, 760.) On a summary
judgment motion, the court must therefore consider what inferences favoring the
opposing party a factfinder could reasonably draw from the evidence. While
viewing the evidence in this manner, the court must bear in mind that its
primary function is to identify issues rather than to determine issues.
[Citation.]” (Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.¿(1999) 75
Cal.App.4th¿832, 839.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
Defeating summary judgment requires only a single disputed
material fact. (See CCP § 437c(c) [a motion for summary judgment “shall be
granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a
matter of law”] [italics added].) Thus, any disputed material fact means the
court must deny the motion – the court has no discretion to grant summary
judgment. (Zavala v. Arce (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 915, 925, fn. 8; Saldana
v. Globe-Weis Systems Co. (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1505, 1511-1512.)¿¿¿¿
 
II.        Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The
court may take judicial notice of “official acts of the legislative, executive,
and judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452(c), (d), and (h).) “Taking
judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its
contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin
v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
Plaintiffs request
judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)    
Section 205 of the City of Carson City
Charter dated September 3, 2020, a true and correct copy of which is attached
hereto as EXHIBIT A. 
 
2)    
Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department
Newsletter Volume 06 Number 04 dated February 5, 2016, a true and correct copy
of which is attached hereto as EXHIBIT B.
 
3)    
California Department of Justice
Division of Law Enforcement Information Bulletin No. 2022-DLE-05 dated July 13,
2022, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as EXHIBIT C. 
 
While the court may take
judicial notice of Exhibit A as it is an official act, the Plaintiffs fail to
show that Exhibits B and C are proper subjects of judicial notice as the facts
asserted therein are subject to dispute. “ ‘Judicial notice is
the recognition and acceptance by the court, for use by the trier of fact or by
the court, of the existence of a matter of law or fact that is relevant to an
issue in the action without requiring formal proof of the matter.’ [Citation.]”
(Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz &
McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 882.) The court may only take
judicial notice when there is no question as to the truth of those statements.
(Starkman v. Mann Theatres Corp. (1991)
227 Cal.App.3d 1491, 150.) 
 
Therefore, Plaintiffs’ request
for judicial notice is granted as to Exhibit A and denied as to Exhibits B and
C. 
 
III.      Evidentiary
Objections
 
Plaintiffs
submit evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Deputy Justin Meng: 
 
Objections Nos. 8, 9, and 13 are overruled.   
 
Objections Nos. 10, 11, and 12 are sustained.  
 
Defendant
Meng’s Objections to Plaintiff’s Expert Opinion
 
Objections Nos. 1 2, 3, and 5 are sustained.   
 
Objections Nos. 3 and 4 are overruled. 
 
IV.       Plaintiffs’ Objections to
Defendant’s Separate Statement
 
Plaintiffs also object to Defendant Meng’s Separate
Statement on the basis that it fails to comply with Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1350 by failing to identify separately each cause of action and affirmative
defense and corresponding material fact. The court finds that Rule 3.1350 was
not violated because the separate statements pertain to only one single cause
of action and one single affirmative defense such that the separate statement
hinges on the same facts. Therefore, the court declines to strike Defendant Meng’s
Separate Statement.  
 
V.        Discussion
            
            A.        Statement of Facts 
 
The following facts
are undisputed unless the fact is supported by citation to the evidence.
Patrice Burton (“Burton”) was the landlord and resided in a house connected to
a 4-unit apartment complex located in Carson, CA (the “Residence”). (Undisputed
Material Fact (“UMF”) 1.) On or about May or June 2020, the Plaintiffs entered
into a verbal agreement with Burton whereby they would reside in the Residence
in exchange for doing landscaping and repair work around the complex. (UMF 1,
2.) 
 
In June 2020, a dispute between
Plaintiff Christopher Ebersole (“Ebersole”) and his girlfriend arose and
resulted in Burton getting involved.  She
later served Ebersole with a restraining order on or about July 10, 2020. (UMF
3, 4.) Burton then decided to evict Plaintiffs illegally. (UMF 5.) In June
2020, Burton told Plaintiffs that she wanted them to move out of the Residence
so that she could move others in. (UMF 6.) Burton also had the water shut off
in the Residence, two weeks before the lockout occurred. (UMF 7.) 
 
On July 17, 2020,
Burton called Plaintiffs to inform them that she was changing the locks to the
door to the Residence. (UMF 8.) At 10:00 pm, Plaintiffs arrived at the
Residence and saw Burton with a locksmith kneeling to change the locks on the
door. (UMF 8.) Plaintiff Shana Anglin (“Anglin”) confronted Burton who stated
that “it’s her property and she could do what she wanted.” (UMF 9; Defendant’s
Compendium of Evidence (“DCOE”) Ex. G. [Anglin Depo. at p. 43:13-20].) Anglin called
the police. (UMF 10.) The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD)
received the call at 10:21 pm regarding a landlord-tenant disturbance. (UMF
11.) Several units responded to the call. (UMF 12.) 
 
The 911 call was
assigned to Deputy Derek Clotworthy (“Clotworthy”) and a Deputy Chacon but Deputy
Justin Meng (“Meng”) along with two other deputies assigned themselves to the
call to assist. (Plaintiffs’ Compendium of Evidence (“PCOE”) Ex. C [Meng Depo.
at p. 14:11-16], Ex. L [Clotworthy Depo. at pp. 13:24-14:5, 14:9-15, 15:24-16:3].  At his deposition,
Deputy Clotworthy stated that many officers may respond to a landlord-tenant
dispute depending on various factors, including whether the neighborhood was
recognized as being dangerous, whether the deputies are available to assist,
and the day and time of the call. (Clotworthy Depo. at p. 14:20-15:11.) 
 
Deputy Meng arrived
at the Residence at 10:25 pm and left the location at 10:58 pm. (UMF 14.)
Deputy Meng spoke with Plaintiff Ebersole because he had a restraining order. (UMF
19; PCOE Ex. C [Meng Depo. at p. 19:3-20:17].) At his deposition, Plaintiff
Ebersole testified that Meng ran his information on the Department Computer: 
 
Q: Did they tell you what happened
after they ran your name? 
 
A: The last thing I remember is they
told us, go ahead and stay gone for the night and come back in the morning. 
 
Q: So they ran your name and they told
you just to leave for the night? 
 
A: Leave for the night, let things
settle down and come back in the morning. 
 
Q: And that was said directly to you,
correct? 
 
A: Yes, Ma’am
 
(PCOE Ex. J [Ebersole
Depo. at pp. 39:22-40:6; DCOE Ex. E [Meng Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. F.) Deputy Meng
determined that no crime had been committed that informed Plaintiff Ebersole
that he needed to stay away from the Residence and abide by the restraining
order or he could be arrested. (UMF 21.) Before leaving, Deputy Meng also
recalls speaking with Deputy Clotworthy and making the determination that the
dispute was a civil matter. (Meng. Depo. at p. 18:6-19:1.) At his Deposition,
Deputy Meng stated that he spoke to Burton but did not recall the conversation
and that he left things to Deputy Clotworthy, as the handling unit, to resolve
the incident. (Meng Depo. at pp. 17:18-10, 21:14-25, 22:1-3; 25:17-20.) When
Deputy Meng left, the landlord and tenants were still at the Residence. (UMF
29.)
 
The parties do not
dispute that LASD has a unit trained and dedicated to the service of process,
levies, and performing evictions but that unit did not respond to this
incident. (UMF 31.) In responding to the July 17, 2020, call, Deputy Meng made
no arrests, he did not handcuff or detain anyone, and he had no further
interactions with Plaintiffs. (UMF 33, 34.) 
 
Plaintiffs brought this action against
Deputy Meng for violation of 42 U.S.C § 1983. Defendant Meng now moves for
summary judgment, or in the alternative, for summary adjudication. 
 
B.        Second
Cause of Action - Violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C § 1983
 
42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides: “Every person
who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of
any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be
subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction
thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by
the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at
law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . .” (42 U.S.C.
§ 1983.) “There are two essential elements of a claim under section 1983,
(1) the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of
state law; and (2) the conduct deprived the plaintiff of a right, privilege or
immunity secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.” (McAllister
v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1198, 1207 (McAllister).)
 
Defendant Meng asserts that Plaintiffs’
Section 1983 claim fails because there is no evidence of state action. “Action
taken by private individuals may be ‘under color of state law’ where there is
‘significant’ state involvement in the action.” (Howerton v. Gabica (9th
Cir. 1983) 708 F.2d 380, 382 [citations omitted].) For the offending conduct to
be attributable to the State, the private actor must have “acted together with
or has obtained significant aid from state officials, or because his conduct is
otherwise chargeable to the State.” (Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.,
Inc. (1982) 457 U.S. 922, 923 [102 S.Ct. 2744, 2746, 73 L.Ed.2d
482].) Defendant Meng asserts that Plaintiffs cannot show that he acted
together with Burton to evict the Plaintiffs or that Burton received
significant state aid from Deputy Meng in evicting the Plaintiffs.  Alternatively, Defendant Meng asserts that he
is immune from liability under qualified immunity. (See Julian v. Mission Community Hospital (2017) 11
Cal.App.5th 360 (Jullian).) 
 
“The term ‘evict’ means ‘[t]o expel ...
by legal process; put out’; ‘[t]o force out; eject; dispossess’; ‘[t]o recover
(property, for example) by a superior claim or legal process.’ [Citation.]
These dictionary definitions comport with the commonly understood meaning of
the word—an eviction requires that a person first be in actual possession of
real property, and then be removed from that property.” (Cunningham v.
Universal Underwriters (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1149.)  The legal
definition of an eviction is the same: an ‘eviction’ is ‘[t]he act or process
of legally dispossessing a person of land or rental property.’ ” (Ibid
citing Black's Law Dict. (7th ed. 1999) p. 575, col. 2.) 
Defendant Meng asserts
that he did not evict the Plaintiffs because there is no evidence to show that he
changed the locks or that he ordered the locksmith to change the lock at the
Residence, or that he forcefully removed the Plaintiffs from the Residence.
Deputy Meng asserts that there is no evidence to show he aided or abetted Burton
in locking Plaintiffs out of the Residence or that he prevented Plaintiffs from
reentering the Residence. At his deposition, Plaintiff Ebersole testified that
Deputy Meng only told him to leave and come back in the morning. (PCOE Ex. J [Ebersole Depo. at pp.
39:22-40:6]; DCOE Ex. E [Meng Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. F].) 
 
Deputy Meng asserts that he had no
authority to instruct Burton to allow Plaintiffs to return to the Residence.  As the dispute was a civil matter, the proper
course of conduct was to instruct the parties that the dispute needed to be
handled by the courts. (DCOE Ex. C [Meng Decl. ¶¶ 10, 11.) Deputy Meng does not
recall if he instructed the parties about the matter being a civil dispute, but
he did recall that he left the matter to be handled by Deputy Clotworthy. (Meng
Depo. at pp. 17:18-10, 18:6-19:1, 19:3-6, 21:14-25, 22:1-3; 25:17-20.) Moreover,
Deputy Meng asserts that he had no knowledge of Penal Code § 418 and that he
had no constitutional obligation to arrest Burton for illegally evicting
Plaintiffs. (Meng Depo. at p. 22:22-25.) “There is no constitutional right to
be arrested.” (Hoffa v. U.S. (1966) 385 U.S. 293, 310 [87 S.Ct. 408, 417, 17 L.Ed.2d 374].) Consequently,
Deputy Meng asserts that his conduct on July 17, 2020, is insufficient to show
that he aided Burton in illegally evicting the Plaintiffs. 
 
Deputy Meng further asserts that even if
there was evidence of state action, he is entitled to qualified immunity. The two-prong
test for qualified immunity first “‘analyzes whether a constitutional right was violated, which
is a question of fact. The second examines whether the right was clearly
established, which is a question of law. Step two serves the aim of refining
the legal standard and is solely a question of law for the judge.’ ” (Julian,
supra, 11
Cal.App.5th 360 at p. 385, citing Tortu v. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police
Dept. (9th Cir. 2009) 556 F.3d 1075, 1085.) 
‘ ‘[C]ourts have discretion to decide which of the two prongs
of qualified-immunity
analysis to tackle first.’ ” (Julian, at p. 386 citing Ashcroft v. al-Kidd (2011) 563 U.S. 731, 735.)
 
Deputy Meng states he is entitled to
qualified immunity because he did not violate the Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendments by depriving Plaintiffs of their property without due process, nor
did he seize their persons, house, paper or effects. (Mot. at p. 20:13-15.)
During the time Deputy Meng handled the call, no arrests or detentions were
made. (UMF 33.) Deputy Meng asserts there is evidence to show that he violated
a clearly established constitutional right by failing to act or prevent Plaintiffs’
eviction. 
 
The court finds that Defendant Meng has
met his initial burden and the burden shifts to Plaintiffs to show that triable
issues of material fact exist. 
 
C.        Plaintiffs’ Opposition
 
                        i.          No Evidence of State Action
 
Plaintiffs argue that there are triable issues of fact as to
whether Deputy Meng provided sufficient aid to the landlord such that the
illegal lockout took on the character of state action. (Opp. at p. 11:21-22.) However,
Plaintiffs fail to cite admissible evidence in support of this proposition. Plaintiffs
assert that Deputy Meng should have arrested Burton because she violated Penal
Code § 418. However, the Plaintiffs fail to establish that Deputy Meng knew
about Penal Code § 418. (PCOE Ex. C [Meng Depo. at p.
22:22-25].) 
 
In addition, Plaintiffs
fail to show that Deputy Meng had a constitutional obligation to arrest Burton for
violating Penal Code § 418. (See Hoffa, supra, 385 U.S. 293 at p.
310 [“There is no constitutional right to be arrested”].)
Plaintiffs cannot rely on the California Department of
Justice Bulletin that was issued to all California Sheriffs that tenants may
only be evicted by a court order because it was issued on July 13, 2022, two
years after the lockout. (Plaintiffs’ RJN Ex. C.) Therefore, Plaintiffs cannot show
Deputy Meng knew or should have known about the Justice Bulletin. (See Hope
v. Pelzer (2002) 536 U.S. 730,
741 [The relevant question is whether the relevant law gave “fair warning” to
the state actor that their conduct was unconstitutional].) 
 
“When a police officer is involved in a
private party's repossession of property, there is no state action if the
officer merely keeps the peace, but there is state action if the officer
affirmatively intervenes to aid the repossessor enough that the repossession
would not have occurred without the officer's help.” (Moore v. Carpenter (8th Cir. 2005) 404 F.3d 1043,
1046.) Here, that Deputy Meng did not instruct Burton to allow the Plaintiffs
to enter the Residence and did not arrest Burton for violating Penal Code § 418
is evidence of inaction, not affirmative conduct by Deputy Meng sufficient to
support a finding of state action. In other words, Plaintiffs fail to cite case
law where an officer's inaction or omissions were construed by a court to be
sufficient evidence of state action to support a Section 1983 claim. 
 
In Howerton v. Gabica (9th Cir.
1983) 708 F.2d 380, the Ninth Circuit found sufficient evidence of state action
because the “Police were on the scene at each step of the eviction.” (Id.
at p. 384.) The landlord testified “that the police presence gave him the
feeling he had the right to cut off the utilities.” (Ibid.) This was
because when the landlord warned the plaintiffs that “their water and power
services would be disconnected if the Howertons did not leave immediately” the
landlord was “accompanied by Randy Baldwin, a police officer” who was “in
uniform and on duty.” (Id. at p. 381.) The visit by the police was
“unsolicited” and “[t]here is indication that on another occasion, when Officer
Baldwin responded to a call from Mrs. Gabica reporting a domestic disturbance
at the Howerton residence, he inquired whether the tenants had found a new
rental.” (Id. at p. 384.) “Moreover, the police officer actively
intervened—he privately approached the Howertons and recommended that they
leave the trailerhouse.” (Ibid.) Specifically, “Officer Baldwin returned
alone to the Howerton residence” and “informed them that the Gabicas were using
proper eviction procedures and advised them to quit the premises.” (Id.
at p. 381.) Taking these actions in total, the Ninth Circuit found that “[t]he
actions of Officer Baldwin created an appearance that the police sanctioned the
eviction.” (Id. at p. 384.)
In contrast to the
officer’s affirmative conduct in Howerton, Deputy Meng only had a single
interaction with the Plaintiffs on July 17, 2020. (UMF 34.) Moreover, the visit
from Deputy Meng was not completely unsolicited as Plaintiff Anglin called 911.
(UMF 10.) Plaintiffs failed to cite evidence that it was unusual for several
deputies to respond to a call involving a landlord-tenant dispute, given the
circumstances of when the call was made. (PCOE Ex. L [Clotworthy Depo. at p.
14:20-15:11].) Two weeks before the July 17, 2020, 911 call, Burton had already
shut off the water to the Plaintiffs’ Residence. (UMF 7.) Furthermore, Deputy
Meng did not tell Plaintiff Ebersole to permanently leave the Residence, but
instead instructed him to leave for the night and come back in the morning.
(PCOE Ex. J [Ebersole Depo. at pp. 39:22-40:6].) Apart from Deputy Meng’s
interactions with Ebersole, the Plaintiffs fail to show that Deputy Meng
actively aided Burton in evicting the Plaintiffs. Moreover, Plaintiffs cite no
evidence to show that Deputy Meng knew that the locksmith remained on the
premises or that Deputy Meng had interactions with the locksmith. 
 
Therefore, the court
finds that Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of showing that Deputy
Meng’s conduct or inaction constituted state action sufficient to support a
1983 claim. 
 
ii.         Plaintiffs Fail to Show that Deputy
Meng is Not Entitled to Qualified Immunity
 
Even if Deputy Meng’s
failure to instruct Burton to allow the Plaintiffs to reenter the Residence and
his failure to arrest Burton can be construed as sufficient evidence of state
action, the Plaintiffs fail to show that Deputy Meng is not entitled to
qualified immunity. First, Plaintiffs fail to show that Deputy Meng violated a
clearly established constitutional right. (See Carroll v. Carman (2014)
574 U.S. 13, 16 [135 S.Ct. 348, 350, 190 L.Ed.2d 311] [“A right is clearly
established only if its contours are sufficiently clear that ‘a reasonable
official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.’
[Citation.]”.)
 
Although Plaintiffs present evidence that
LASD deputies should be familiar with Penal Code § 418[1], Plaintiffs
fail to show that the failure to arrest someone under Penal Code § 418 is a
constitutional violation of the Plaintiffs’ right. (See Hoffa, supra,
385 U.S. 293 at p. 310 [“There is no constitutional right to be arrested”].) Plaintiffs
also fail to show that the LASD’s Newsletter, noting that a tenant may not be
evicted without an unlawful detainer action, is an official LASD policy that
Deputy Meng was obligated to know or follow. (Plaintiffs’ RJN Ex. B.) The
Newsletter states:
 
Deputies
should advise the landlord to permit the tenant back into the dwelling and
proceed with an unlawful detainer lawsuit.
 
(Plaintiff’s RJN Ex. B at p. 4.) Plaintiffs
fail to show that Deputy Meng knew of this Policy and that his failure to
inform Burton that she was engaging in an illegal eviction and that she should
permit the tenants to reenter the Residence was a clear violation of the
Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. The relevant inquiry is not whether Deputy Meng failed to
arrest Burton for illegally evicting the Plaintiffs, but whether his inaction
was a violation of a constitutional right, not a LASD’s departmental policy. (See
Cousins v. Lockyer (9th Cir. 2009) 568 F.3d 1063, 1070 [“[T]he remaining defendants
are entitled to qualified immunity from the federal claims because state departmental regulations do not establish
a federal constitutional violation”] [italics original]; see also
Case v. Kitsap County Sheriff's Dept. (9th Cir. 2001) 249 F.3d 921, 930.) 
 
“Qualified immunity gives government
officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open
legal questions. When properly applied, it protects ‘all but the plainly
incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.’ [Citation.]” (Ashcroft, supra,  563 U.S. at p. 743.) Here, Plaintiffs fail to show that at the time the Plaintiffs were
locked out, LASD had a clear established procedure on how landlord-tenant
disputes are to be handled and that Deputy Meng deviated from the said
procedure and said deviation was a clear violation of the Plaintiffs’
constitutional rights. The Plaintiffs also fail to cite case law holding
that the failure to advise a landlord that they should permit the tenant to
reenter a property is a clear violation of a tenant’s constitutional rights. 
 
In sum, the Plaintiffs
fail to show that Deputy Meng’s failure to instruct Burton that Plaintiffs
could only be evicted with a court order and his failure to arrest Burton were clear
constitutional violations of the Plaintiffs’ rights such that “in the light of
pre-existing law” it should have been “apparent” to Deputy Meng that said
conduct was unlawful.” (Hope v. Pelzer (2002) 536 U.S. 730, 739 [122 S.Ct.
2508, 2515, 153 L.Ed.2d 666].)
 
For the reasons set forth above, Deputy Meng’s motion for
summary judgment is granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant
Meng’s motion for summary judgment is granted. Defendant to give notice.
