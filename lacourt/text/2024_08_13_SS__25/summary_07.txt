Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment against the defendants, Daniel Centeno and Luiz Lopez. The plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, seeks to enforce a settlement agreement that was entered into between the parties on October 7, 2022. Under the agreement, the defendants agreed to make monthly payments to settle the matter, but they have since defaulted on those payments. The plaintiff mailed a default letter to the defendants on May 1, 2024, and since payment was not made within 14 days, the plaintiff is entitled to have the dismissal set aside and judgment entered. The judgment amount is $1,145.00, which includes damages of $700.00 and costs of $445.00. The court finds that it has authority to enforce the settlement agreement and that the parties entered into a valid and binding agreement.
