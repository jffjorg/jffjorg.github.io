The court has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration, for the court to pick an arbitration forum, and request for stay. The motion was unopposed, but the court finds that the notice of the motion is improper because the defendant, Romo's Auto Sales LLC, has not yet been served with the summons, complaint, or the motion. As a result, the court will not consider the motion at this time. The defendant must be served with the necessary documents before the court can proceed with the motion.
