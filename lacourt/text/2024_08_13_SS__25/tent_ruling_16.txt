 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from the sale of an allegedly defective used
2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee (the “Subject Vehicle”). On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff Antonio
Penaloza Salazar (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Romo’s Auto
Sales LLC (“Romo”), Westlake Services, LLC dba Westlake Financial Services
(“Westlake”), Hudson Insurance Company (“Hudson”) (collectively “Defendants”),
and DOES 1 through 40, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Violation
of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act; (2) Violation of California Business and
Professions Code § 17200, et seq.; (3) Violation of Civ. Code § 1632 et
seq.; (4) Claim Against Dealer Bond; and (5) Violation of CCP §§ 1281.97
and 1281.99. 
 
The Complaint alleges the following: on or about April 9,
2021, Plaintiff went to Defendant Romo’s place of business to purchase the
Subject Vehicle. (Complaint, ¶ 16.) Prior to selling the Subject Vehicle,
Defendant Romo made representations as to the history, safety, open recall
and/or repair condition of the Subject Vehicle. (Complaint, ¶ 17.) At the time
of sale, the Subject Vehicle had at least one open recall. (Complaint, ¶ 18.) Based
on the representations of Defendant Romo as to the condition and value of the
Subject Vehicle, Plaintiff agreed to purchase the Subject Vehicle and executed
a Retail Installment Sales Contract (the “RISC”) and took delivery of the
Subject Vehicle. (Complaint, ¶ 25; Exh. 1.) Subsequent to Plaintiff’s purchase
of the Subject Vehicle, Plaintiff has discovered that the value of the Subject
Vehicle is substantially diminished as a result of the true condition of the
Subject Vehicle. (Complaint, ¶ 31.) Subsequent to the sale, the RISC was
assigned to Defendant Westlake and Defendant Westlake accepted the RISC and
payments under the RISC. (Complaint, ¶ 40.) By virtue of accepting the RISC,
Defendant Westlake is liable for the claims and defenses pursuant to the RISC.
(Complaint, ¶ 41.) 
            
            On
April 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration and
for the Court to Pick the Arbitration Forum (the “Motion”). Pursuant to the
Motion, Plaintiff also requests a stay of this action pending the completion of
arbitration. Plaintiff moves to compel Defendants Romo and Westlake to
arbitration.  
 
            On
June 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service indicating that Defendant
Westlake was served with the summons, complaint, and the instant motion on May
1, 2024 by personal service. 
 
            Also,
on June 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service stating that Defendant
Hudson was served with the summons, complaint, and the instant motion by
personal service on May 1, 2024. 
 
            On
June 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Non Service Report showing that service of the
summons and complaint and the instant motion was attempted on Defendant Romo on
May 3, 2024 at 401 S. Atlantic Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90022 (the “Atlantic
Address”). However, the process server was told that the business and agent
have moved out of such location and now there is a new business at the Atlantic
Address. (06/25/24 Non Service Report.) 
 
            Also,
on June 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a second Non Service Report showing that service
of the summons, complaint, and instant motion was attempted on Defendant Romo
on June 14, 2024 at 462 S. Hillview Ave., East Los Angeles, CA 90022 (the
“Hillview Address”). The process server was told that Defendant Romo is not
located there and the agent for service does not live there. (06/25/24 Non
Service Report.) 
 
            On
July 1, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court continued the hearing on
the Motion to August 13, 2024, so that Defendant Romo could be served with the
summons, complaint, and the motion to compel arbitration. (07/01/24 Minute
Order at pp. 5-6.) 
 
            On
July 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served a Notice of Continuance as to the
Motion. 
 
            On
August 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served an application for an order to serve
Defendant Romo through the California Secretary of State.
 
            As
of August 12, 2024, the Court has not entered an order on Plaintiff’s
application to serve Defendant Romo through the California Secretary of State.
Also, as of August 12, 2024, no opposition has been filed as to the Motion and
Defendant Romo has not been served with the summons, complaint, or the Motion. 
 
            Any
opposition to the Motion was required to have been filed and served at least
nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP § 1005(b).) 
 
 
 
 
MOVING PARTY

arbitration pursuant to the RISC.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Compelling
Arbitration and Staying the Action   
A.               
Legal Standard 
“A party who claims that
there is a written agreement to arbitrate may petition the superior court for
an order to compel arbitration” pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.2. Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court (1998) 62
Cal.App.4th 348, 356. “California law, like federal law, favors enforcement
of valid arbitration agreements.” Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97. “On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate
that controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel
arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for
rescission of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.) Parties may be
compelled to arbitrate a dispute upon the court finding that: (1) there was a
valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties; and (2) said agreement covers
the controversy or controversies in the parties’ dispute. Omar v. Ralphs
Grocery Co. (2004)¿118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961. 
A party opposing a
petition to compel arbitration “bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.” Banner Entertainment,
Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356. Where a petition
to compel arbitration is granted, a court “shall, upon motion of a party to
such action or proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration
is had in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as
the court specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.4.)
“[T]here is no policy
compelling persons to accept arbitration of controversies which they have not
agreed to arbitrate.” DMS Services, LLC v. Superior Court (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 1346, 1352. “[G]enerally one must be a party to an arbitration
agreement to be bound by it or invoke it.” Ibid. “However, both
California and federal courts have recognized limited exceptions to this rule,
allowing nonsignatories to an agreement containing an arbitration clause to
compel arbitration of, or be compelled to, arbitrate a dispute arising within
the scope of that agreement.” Id. a p. 1353. “Even the strong public
policy in favor of arbitration does not extend to those who are not parties to
an arbitration agreement or who have not authorized anyone to act for them in
executing such an agreement.” Suh v. Superior Court (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th
1504, 1512. “A nonsignatory can be compelled to arbitrate when a
preexisting relationship existed between the nonsignatory and one of the
parties to the arbitration agreement, making it equitable to compel the
nonsignatory to arbitrate as well.” JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court
(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1240. “Additionally, a nonsignatory can be
compelled to arbitrate when it is suing as a third-party beneficiary of the
contract containing the arbitration clause.” Ibid. 
B.        Discussion  
In support of the motion, Plaintiff’s
counsel, Kasra Sadr (“Sadr”), provides a declaration. Counsel attaches a copy
of the RISC to her declaration. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. 2.) On or around January
19, 2024, counsel’s office filed for arbitration via the AAA on behalf of
Plaintiff and against Defendants Romo and Westlake. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 8.) However,
because Defendants Romo and Westlake failed to pay the required fees to AAA, AAA
was required to close the case. (Sadr Decl., ¶¶ 8-11; Exhs. 4-6.) 
The Court has reviewed the
RISC. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. 2.) The RISC was entered into between Plaintiff
and Defendant Romo. (Id.) The RISC contains an arbitration provision
therein which states that either Plaintiff or Defendant Romo may choose to
resolve any claim or dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise, which
arises out of or relates to the purchase or condition of the Subject Vehicle,
the RISC, or any related transaction, occurrence, or relationship, by neutral,
binding arbitration. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 5; Exh. 2 at p. 6.) The arbitration
provision provides that Plaintiff or Defendant Romo may elect for the AAA or
JAMS to conduct the arbitration. (Id. at pp. 6-7.) 
The Court finds that there
is a valid arbitration agreement between Defendant Romo and Plaintiff, and that
the arbitration agreement covers the claims alleged in the Complaint. The Court
notes that the Court can compel Defendant Westlake to arbitrate as the
Complaint alleges that Defendant Westlake was assigned the RISC and is
the holder of the RISC. (Complaint, ¶¶ 40-41.) Defendant Westlake has failed to
oppose the motion and therefore the Court finds that Defendant Westlake has
conceded to Plaintiff’s argument that it can be compelled to arbitration as
“[c]ontentions are waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned
argument and citations to authority.” Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo
(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215. 
            The
Court, however, cannot grant the Motion at this time due to Defendant Romo not
being served with the summons, complaint, or the instant motion to compel
arbitration. “[D]ue process requires a party to be fully advised of the issues
to be addressed and be given adequate notice of what facts it must rebut in
order to prevail.” Fenn v. Sherriff (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1481.  
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, the Court therefore
CONTINUES the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Arbitration to Tuesday, October
8, 2024 at 10:00 AM in this department, so that Defendant Romo can be served
with the summons, complaint, and motion to compel arbitration, and to allow the
Court sufficient time to review and rule upon Plaintiff’s application to serve
Defendant Romo via the California Secretary of State.  
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
