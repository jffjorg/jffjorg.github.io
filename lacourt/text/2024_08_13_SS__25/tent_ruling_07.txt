 
BACKGROUND
 
On February
11, 2021, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for Subrogation against Defendants Daniel
Centeno (“Centeno”), Luiz Lopez (“Lopez”) (collectively, the “Defendants”), and
DOES 1 to 10. The complaint arises from Defendant Centeno colliding with the
vehicle of Plaintiff’s insured. 
 
On June
7, 2021, Defendants filed a joint Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On August
8, 2022, Plaintiff filed and served a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case.  
 
On October 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation for Dismissal
with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon Breach (the “Stipulation”).
The Stipulation provides that the action shall be dismissed without prejudice.
(Stipulation, ¶ 1.) According to the Stipulation, “Defendant shall pay
Plaintiff $4,568.33 (the settlement amount) in full settlement of this action .
. . .” (Stipulation, ¶ 2.) “An initial payment of $3068.33 shall be made by
Defendant’s Insurance Carrier on or before October 01, 2022; then, beginning
October 01, 2022, seven (7) monthly payments of $50.00 shall be made;
[b]eginning May 01, 2023, six (6) monthly payments of $75.00 shall be made;
[f]inally, beginning on November 01, 2023, six (6) monthly payments of $100.00,
for a total of $1,500.00, shall be made with all subsequent payments being due
on the same day of each month thereafter until the settlement amount is paid in
full.” (Stipulation, ¶ 2.) 
 
The Stipulation provides that “[i]f defendant fails to make
a timely payment, said failure is a material breach. In such event, plaintiff
will mail defendant a letter advising that a payment has not been received.”
(Stipulation, ¶ 3.) “If the payment is not made within 14 days, then plaintiff
will be entitled to have any dismissal in this action set aside and judgment
entered for the settlement amount, minus credit for payments received, plus any
costs associated with entering the judgment not to exceed $500.” (Stipulation,
¶ 3.) The Stipulation states that the parties stipulate that the Court shall
retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6 to enforce the agreement.
(Stipulation, ¶ 3.) 
 
On October 11, 2022, the Court entered an Order (the
“Order”), pursuant to the Stipulation, which dismissed this action without prejudice
in its entirety but allowed the Court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the
Stipulation pursuant to CCP § 664.6. (10/11/22 Order.) 
 
On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate
the Dismissal and Enter Judgment (the “Motion”). The Motion was served on Defendants
on June 6, 2024 via U.S. Mail. Defendants are self-represented. 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks an order vacating the dismissal and entering judgment in this action
pursuant to CCP § 664.6. The Motion is made on the grounds that the parties
entered into the Stipulation and Defendants have defaulted on payments.  
 
            As
of August 12, 2024, the Motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the Motion was
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the
hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Setting
Aside the Dismissal and Entering Judgment    
A.               
Legal Standard 
“Code of Civil Procedure
section 664.6 provides a summary procedure to enforce a settlement agreement by
entering judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.
“[I]f the parties to pending litigation enter into a settlement either in
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court, the court, upon a
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Ibid.
“The court retains jurisdiction to enforce a settlement under the statute even
after a dismissal, but only if the parties requested such a retention of
jurisdiction before the dismissal.” Ibid. “Such a request must be made
either in writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.” Ibid.

“A court ruling on a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 must determine whether the
parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.” Ibid. “A
settlement is enforceable under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all
material settlement terms.” Ibid. “The court ruling on the motion may
consider the parties’ declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms
the parties agreed to.” Ibid. “If the court determines that the parties
entered into an enforceable settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a
formal judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.” Ibid. Code
Civ. Proc. § 664.6 “expressly provides for the court to enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement.” Id. at p. 1183. “It is widely recognized that the courts are
not at liberty to revise an agreement under the guise of construing it.” Series AGI Est Linn of Appian Group Investors
DE, LLC v. Eves (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 156, 164. A prevailing party is entitled to its costs in
any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b).) A prevailing party is a party with a
net monetary recovery. (CCP § 1032(a)(4).) 
B.        Discussion  
In support of the motion, Plaintiff’s
counsel, Harlan M. Reese, Esq. (“Reese”), provides a declaration. Counsel
attests that the parties entered into the Stipulation on October 7, 2022, in
which Defendants agreed to make monthly payments to settle this matter. (Reese
Decl., ¶ 2; Ex. A.) Subsequently, on October 11, 2022, the instant action was
ordered dismissed with reservation to vacate and enter judgment upon breach
pursuant to CCP § 664.6. (Reese Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. B.) Defendant’s insurance
carrier made a one-time payment in the amount of $3,068.33. (Reese Decl., ¶ 4.)
Defendants made monthly payments pursuant to the Stipulation in the amount of
$800.00; however, Defendants have since defaulted on payments. (Reese Decl., ¶
5.) 
On or about May 1, 2024,
Plaintiff mailed Defendants a default letter regarding the missed payments.
(Reese Decl., ¶ 6; Ex. C.) Pursuant to the terms set forth in the Stipulation,
since payment was not made within 14 days, Plaintiff is entitled to have any
dismissal in this action set aside and judgment entered, minus credit for
payments received. (Reese Decl., ¶ 7.) According to counsel, “Plaintiff now
seeks to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment in the amount of $4,568.33,
less the later payments of $3,868.33, plus court costs Plaintiff has incurred
of $445.00 consisting of: $225.00 Complaint filing fee, [$]160.00 service of
process fee, and $60.00 motion fee, for a total judgment in the amount of
$1,145.00.” (Reese Decl., ¶ 8.) 
The Court
finds that it has authority to enforce the Stipulation pursuant to Hines v.
Lukes, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182. Plaintiff and
Defendants signed the Stipulation. The Court also has jurisdiction to enforce
the Stipulation as the parties explicitly requested—and furthermore agreed—that
the Court would retain jurisdiction to enforce such agreement. The Court
furthermore determines that the parties entered into a valid and binding
agreement. The declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel sets forth the terms of the Stipulation
and indicates that Defendants have breached the Stipulation. The Court also finds
that Plaintiff is entitled to its costs. (Stipulation, ¶ 3.) 
 
 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside
the Dismissal Entered on 10/11/2022 and to Enter Judgment Pursuant to CCP 664.6
is  GRANTED. 
 
Judgment by
Court on Stipulation (CCP 664.6)  is
entered in favor of Plaintiff and against the Defendants Daniel Centeno and
Luis Lopez in the Total amount of $1,145.00, calculated as follows:
 
Damages in

Costs in the
amount of $445.00
 
            Moving party is ordered to give
