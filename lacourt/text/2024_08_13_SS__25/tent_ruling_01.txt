ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
            On August 13, 2018, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Keon Ellison (“Ellison”)
for subrogation, stemming from an automobile collision between Defendant, on
the one hand, and an individual insured by Plaintiff’s automobile insurance
policy, on the other hand.  (Compl.)  Plaintiff compensated the insured for claimed damages
in the amount of $13,978.33 and filed the instant claim against Defendant for
allegedly causing the damages.  (Ibid.
pp. 2-3.)  On July 16, 2019, Defendant
filed an Answer.
 
On April 14, 2020, Plaintiff filed
a Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon
Breach (“Stipulation”), signed by both parties, to dismiss the action on the
premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for the settlement amount of $10,161.57.  On the same day, the Court dismissed the
entire case without prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation.
 
On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Enter Judgment (“Motion”).  Plaintiff has submitted the motion on the
moving papers and will not appear at the hearing.  (Mot. p. 2.)
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
Code of Civil Procedure, Section
664.6, provides a summary procedure that enables judges to enforce a settlement
agreement by entering a judgment pursuant to the terms of the parties’
settlement.  In particular, the statute
provides:
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed by a
party if it is signed by any of the following:
 
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is authorized
in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf.
 
(Code of Civil
Procedure § 664.6, subds. (a)-(b) (emphasis added).)
 
III.             
Discussion
 
A. Retention of Jurisdiction
 
“‘[V]oluntary
dismissal of an action or special proceeding terminates the court’s
jurisdiction over the matter.’  (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867) [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 142.) ‘If
requested by the parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce [a] settlement until performance in
full of the terms of the settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)”  (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of Los
Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) 
“‘Because of its summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements
of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a
settlement agreement.’”  (Ibid.
(quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc.
(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for
the trial court to retain jurisdiction under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the
same three requirements which the Legislature and the courts have deemed
necessary for section 664.6 enforcement of the settlement itself: the request
must be made (1) during the pendency of the case, not after the case has been
dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the parties themselves, and (3) either in a
writing signed by the parties or orally before the court.’”  (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002)
97 Cal.App.4th 429, 440).)  “The ‘request
must be express, not implied from other language, and it must be clear and
unambiguous.’” (Ibid. (quoting Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at
440).)
 
Here, the
parties signed a Stipulation for Dismissal with Reservation to Vacate and Enter
Judgment Upon Breach (“Stipulation”) containing the parties’ agreement for the
Court to retain jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, Section 664.6
to enforce the terms of the stipulation and enter judgment in the event of
default.  (Stipulation ¶ 3.)  Prior to the dismissal of this action, the
Stipulation was signed by the parties and submitted to the Court.  (Ibid. at p. 3.)  The Court dismissed the entire case without
prejudice pursuant to the Stipulation and expressly stated that it “shall
retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP § 664.6.” 
(Stipulation p. 4.)
 
The Court finds
that the Stipulation complies with Section 664.6 requirements and the Court has
retained jurisdiction to enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ Stipulation in
this action.
 
B. Entry of Judgment
 
The Stipulation
Agreement filed on April 14, 2020, provides that Plaintiff and Defendant agreed
to dismiss the action on the premise that Defendant would compensate Plaintiff for
the settlement amount of $10,161.57. 
(Stipulation ¶ 2.)  Pursuant to
the Stipulation, Defendant’s insurance carrier, Alliance United, would make an
initial payment of $6,161.57, and starting on March 28, 2020, Defendant would
make monthly payments of $50 on the last day of each month, until the
settlement was paid in full.  (Ibid.)
 
The Stipulation
also provides that in the event Defendant fails to make timely payments,
Plaintiff will mail a letter to Defendant regarding the default.  (Ibid. at ¶ 3.)  If Defendant does not remedy the default
within 14 days of receiving notice, “then plaintiff will be entitled to have
any dismissal in this action set aside and judgment entered for the settlement
amount, minus credit for payments received, plus any costs the court requires
to enter judgment or costs associated with any procedure to have the judgment
entered.”  (Ibid.)  The declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel shall
be sufficient proof for judgment to be entered. 
(Ibid.)
 
On June 6, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for an order to vacate the dismissal and
enter judgment against Defendant.  (Memo.
p. 1.)  According to Plaintiff’s counsel,
Defendant made payments totaling $2,150 and subsequently, stopped making
payments.  (Reese Decl. ¶ 4)  Around March 14 and April 23, 2024, Plaintiff
mailed Defendant letters regarding the missed payments; however, Defendant has
not made any additional payments.  (Ibid.
at ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. C.)
 
Plaintiff seeks
to have the dismissal set aside and judgment entered against Defendant in the
amount of $2,359.50 follows: $10,161.57 (settlement amount), minus $8,311.57 (payments
made by Defendant and Defendant’s insurance carrier), plus $509.50 (court costs).  (Ibid. at ¶ 7.)  The court costs consist of $370 complaint
filing fee, $79.50 service of process fee, and $60.00 motion fee.  (Ibid.)
 
The Court finds the
Stipulation to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Proc. § 664.6.  Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant defaulted
on payments and has not made any additional payments after Plaintiff sent
notice.  Thus, a valid
and signed stipulation agreement was breached and the Court retained
jurisdiction to enter judgment upon breach.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment is GRANTED.  Dismissal entered on April 14, 2020, is
vacated, and judgment is entered for Plaintiff and against Defendant for $2,359.50
as follows: principal amount of $1850.00 plus court costs of $509.50.
 
IV.             
Conclusion
& Order
 
For the foregoing reasons,
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Set
Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment is GRANTED. 
Dismissal entered on April 14, 2020, is vacated, and judgment is entered
for Plaintiff and against Defendant for $2,359.50 as follows:
principal amount of $1850.00 plus court costs of $509.50.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
