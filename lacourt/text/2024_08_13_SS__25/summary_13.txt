And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Covina Hills MHC (Petitioner) vs. Michael Pergl, Kenneth Huie, and DOES 1-10 (collectively, "Defendants"). The Petitioner seeks a judgment of abandonment under California Civil Code §798.61, alleging that the mobile home in question has been abandoned for over 60 days and that no rent has been paid. The Judge notes that the Petitioner has failed to provide evidence showing the cost of $225.00, which is unclear. Additionally, the Judge points out that the Supplemental Declaration by Sofia Lopez states that the mobile home is not permanently affixed to the land, but the space in dispute is space 354, not space 333. The Judge therefore denies the Petition for Judicial Declaration of Abandonment of Mobile Home without prejudice.
