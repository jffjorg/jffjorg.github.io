And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for attorney's fees filed by Video Symphony, LLC, the prevailing party in the action. The motion was filed after judgment was entered in favor of Video Symphony, LLC on May 10, 2024, and seeks attorney's fees in the amount of $16,787.50. The judge finds that the hourly rate and time spent on the matter are reasonable and awards attorney's fees to Video Symphony, LLC. The judge also rejects the defendants' arguments that the plaintiff is not entitled to attorney's fees because it is a corporate alter ego of Michael Flanagan, the president of Video Symphony, LLC. The judge notes that the defendants have not presented any evidence to support this argument and that the instant matter is distinguishable from Trope v. Katz, which held that an attorney who chooses to litigate as a self-represented party in an action to enforce a contract may not recover attorney's fees.
