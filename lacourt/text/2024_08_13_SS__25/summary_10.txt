And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case brought by Maxwell + Bessie, Inc. (Plaintiff) against Michael Onagbesan (Defendant) regarding a breach of contract. The Plaintiff had filed a motion for evidence sanctions against the Defendant for failing to comply with discovery orders, including serving a non-descriptive pile of documents in response to the Plaintiff's request for production.

The judge notes that while the Plaintiff has withdrawn its motion for evidence sanctions as to certain documents, the Plaintiff is still seeking to prohibit the Defendant from introducing certain evidence at trial. The judge finds that the Defendant's failure to comply with discovery orders warrants the imposition of sanctions, but that the evidence sanctions sought by the Plaintiff are too broad and would eliminate the Plaintiff's burden to prove its case.

The judge therefore continues the Plaintiff's request for evidence sanctions to August 22, 2024, and schedules an Order to Show Cause as to why the Defendant should not be sanctioned up to $1,400 for failing to obey the Court's previous orders. The judge orders the Defendant to comply with the Court's April 18, 2024 order within the next 10 days.
