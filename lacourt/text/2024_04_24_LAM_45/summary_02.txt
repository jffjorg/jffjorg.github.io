Here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motions to relieve counsel for Plaintiff Bac Tran, Plaintiff B&P Investment Groups LLC, and Cross-Defendant Phoung Ma. The court finds that the parties have breached the terms of the retainer agreement and it is unreasonable for counsel to continue to represent them. The court also notes that a corporation, such as Plaintiff B&P, cannot appear in court without an attorney. Therefore, the court orders that Plaintiff B&P retain new counsel and sets a hearing to ensure compliance.
