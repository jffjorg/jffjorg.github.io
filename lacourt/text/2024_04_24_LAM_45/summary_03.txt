Summary: The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' demurrer to the second amended complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, SLW Holdings, LLC, invested $4,240,000 in two cannabis business ventures, which were Gain Green Corporation and Genetixs LLC. The defendants, including Julio Jones and Sharod "Roddy" White, made fraudulent misrepresentations to the plaintiff and failed to disclose material information. The plaintiff alleges fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and other causes of action. The court assumes the truth of the plaintiff's allegations and finds that the defendants owed the plaintiff a fiduciary duty in their capacities as officers, directors, and manager of SLW Holdings, LLC. The court denies the defendants' demurrer to the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action.
