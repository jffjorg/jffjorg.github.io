Motion
for Issue and Monetary Sanctions
The Court
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply. 
Background
            On
January 13, 2023, Plaintiff Ben Myerson Candy Co., Inc. dba Wine Warehouse
(“Plaintiff”) filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against
Defendant Devoto-Wade LLC dba Golden State Cider (“Defendant”), and DOES 1-10,
inclusive for: (1) Breach of Contract and (2) Common Count in Quantum Meruit. 
            The
SAC alleges the following: On January 21, 2016, plaintiff Wine Warehouse and
defendant Golden State Cider entered into a written Distributor Sales and
Equity Agreement, appointing Wine Warehouse as the exclusive wholesale
distributor of Golden State Cider brand products in California. (SAC, ¶ 5.)
Defendant sent Plaintiff a letter on June 26, 2019 stating that, pursuant to
Section 3 of the parties’ agreement, Defendant was terminating Plaintiff as its
exclusive distributor for 14 California counties, effective August 1, 2019. (Id.
at ¶ 8.) Defendant followed up with another notice of this termination to
Plaintiff on August 1, 2019. (Id. at ¶ 9.) Defendant failed to provide
90 days’ advance written notice of termination, which is required under Section
3(c) of the subject agreement. (Id. at ¶ 10.) Defendant failed to
satisfy any of the conditions for terminating the subject agreement without
advance notice under Section 3(b). (Id. at ¶ 11.) Defendant failed and
continues to fail to pay any material portion of the FMV Termination Fee,
required under Sections 3(c) and 4(c). (Id. at ¶ 12.) 
            Golden
State Cider filed a Cross-Complaint against Wine Warehouse on October 3, 2019,
alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Fraud; (3)
Defamation; (4) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (5)
Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; and (6) Unjust Enrichment/Restitution. 
            The
Cross-Complaint alleges that cross-defendant Wine Warehouse represented to
cross-complaint Golden State Cider during negotiations leading up to the
subject agreement that it had the adequate resources, personnel, and business
organization to distribute its cider products through California.
(Cross-Compl., ¶ 7.) Cross-Complainant relied upon these representations before
executing the subject agreement, only to later learn that Cross-Defendant did
not maintain the distribution and sales organization to distribute its product
across the entire state. (Id. at ¶ 7.) Cross-Complainant adequately
notified Cross-Defendant of its purported breaches of the contract, but Wine
Warehouse met Golden State Cider’s concerns with apathetic interest, which left
Cross-Complainant essentially stuck with an underperforming wholesaler. (Id.
at ¶ 12.) Cross-Complainant terminated for cause on August 1, 2019
Cross-Defendant’s exclusive distributorship of Golden State Cider due to Wine
Warehouse’s continuing failure to perform its duties pursuant to the subject
agreement. (Id. at ¶ 13.) 
 
On December 22,
2023, Plaintiff and Cross Defendant Ben Myerson Candy Co., Inc. dba Wine
Warehouse filed this instant Motion for issue and monetary sanctions. On April
11, 2024, Defendant Golden State Cider filed an opposition. On April 17, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a reply.  
Legal
Standard
            Where
a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose
terminating, issue, evidence, or monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010(d), (g), 2023.030; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) 
            Code
of Civil Procedure § 2030.040 requires that “[a] request for a sanction shall,
in the notice of motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against
whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type of sanction sought.” 
Furthermore, the notice of motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points
and authorities, and accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts
supporting the amount of any monetary sanction sought.  (Code of Civ.
Proc. § 2030.040.) 
            Monetary
sanctions may be imposed “ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct…unless [the Court] finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. §
2030.030(a).) 
            Issue
sanctions may be imposed “ordering that designated facts shall be taken as
established in the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely
affected by the misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an
issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from supporting or opposing designated claims or
defenses.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(b).) 
Discussion
            Plaintiff and Cross Defendant Ben Myerson
Candy Co., Inc. dba Wine Warehouse (“Plaintiff”) seeks monetary
sanctions in the amount $21,756.00 jointly and severally against Defendant and
its counsel Ronald Fisher for alleged discovery abuses and moves for an order
imposing issue sanctions pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §
2023.030.  Specifically, Plaintiff
requests the Court impose the following issue sanctions: a. an order precluding
Defendant from arguing, or contending, that Wine Warehouse’s conduct caused a
loss of enterprise value to Defendant; b. an order establishing that Sonoma
Craft did not pay less for its acquisition of Defendant due to any acts or
omissions by Wine Warehouse; c. an order instructing the jury
that Defendant does not claim lost enterprise value; d. an order instructing
the jury that Wine Warehouse did not cause any loss in Defendant’s value. 
            Plaintiff
argues that issue sanctions are appropriate because Defendant willfully
violated (1) the January 2023 Order; (2) the March 2023 Order and (3) the May
2023 Order. Further, Defendant failed to produce a sufficiently prepared PMK
witness, and its counsel improperly instructed its witness not to answer
questions based on illusory privilege assertions at two Court ordered
depositions. Moreover, since PMK Chris Lacey (“Lacey”) failed to recall any
specifics as to the two emails Plaintiff asked about, the contemporaneous
writings show that there is no evidence that Sonoma Craft would have paid more
money, and no evidence that Sonoma Craft took the position that the business
was worth less because of Wine Warehouse. Plaintiff also argues that
Defendant’s discovery abuses such as the violation of this Court’s May 31, 2023
Order and failure to produce two e-mails and sit for a deposition warrant
monetary sanctions. 
            In
opposition, Defendant and Cross Complainant argues that Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions constitutes an improper request for reconsideration because its
second motion for sanctions “arises from a violation of the court’s second
order requiring Defendant to make its PMQ, Chris Lacey, available for a further
deposition.” (Mot. at 4 (citing Leonida Decl., Ex. 1, 5/31/23 Order).)
Defendant further argues that Plaintiff’s motion separately fails because
Plaintiff cannot request discovery sanctions in this Court without first
raising the issue before the Discovery Referee, who was present at the
deposition at issue. This Court has referred the parties to a discovery referee
“for all discovery purposes in the action.” (Leonida Decl., Ex. 10 at 2.)
Moreover, the issue sanctions Plaintiff seeks are not relevant or proportional
to the discovery that they sought because the testimony related to the two emails
have no relevance to the enterprise value of Golden State Cider’s assets that
were sold. Additionally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions fails because Golden State Cider’s conduct is not sanctionable, and
Plaintiff seeks monetary sanctions for costs that are not directly tied to the
alleged discovery abuse.
            In
reply, Plaintiff argues that it was not required to bring this motion before
the Discovery Referee because the stipulation and order appointing the
Discovery Referee explicitly holds, “[n]othing in this order shall preclude the
Court from hearing and deciding discovery matters…if the Court so orders.” (Ex.
10 to Leonida Decl., p. 118 of Leonida Decl.) Moreover, these matters are “intertwined
with trial and evidentiary issues.” (Ex. 8 to Leonida Decl. in support of
Opposition, p. 2.) Plaintiff also disputes Defendant’s argument that the motion
seeks reconsideration for a prior ruling because it seeks sanctions in
connection with Lacey’s misconduct at Lacey’s December 2023 PMK deposition but
neither the Discovery Referee nor the Trial Court have issued a ruling on this
matter.
            Based
on the above, the Court finds that imposing issue sanctions would be improper
because Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently show how the two emails are
relevant to enterprise value. However, the Court finds that monetary sanctions
may be warranted because of discovery abuse.  Plaintiff seeks $21,756.00 which includes $14,063.60
for Wine Warehouse’s reasonable fees expended in connection with drafting this
motion; and $7,692.40 for Wine Warehouse’s reasonable fees expended in
connection with the December 2023 Deposition. For instance, Defense counsel
Ronald Fisher instructed his client not to answer questions over the discovery
referee’s rulings several times and the PMK was again unprepared for the
December 2023 deposition. The second Notice of Deposition lists the topics of
examination as “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS concerning the MAY 2022
ACQUISITION of GOLDEN STATE CIDER.” 2. GOLDEN STATE CIDER'S COMMUNICATIONS with
any PERSON that RELATE TO the MAY 2022 ACQUISITION. 3. GOLDEN STATE CIDER'S
COMMUNICATIONS with any PERSON that RELATE TO the MAY 2022 ACQUISITION in which
WINE WAREHOUSE is mentioned or discussed.” (Bitan Decl. ¶ 20; Exhibit O, p.4.)
It was not limited to bank records and text messages as Defendant claims.
Therefore, the PMK was unprepared by only using text messages and bank records
to prepare. 
            Plaintiff
seeks fees for 21.2 hours of attorney time spent on the instant motion for
sanctions, and an additional 4 hours for preparing the reply and attending the
hearing, and for preparing for and taking Mr. Lacey’s deposition in December
2023. (Bitan Decl. ¶¶26-30.) Eliana A. Fields is an associate attorney where
she assisted in preparing the moving papers. Ms. Fields is a fifth-year
attorney whose billing rate is $425.00 per hour. (Id. at ¶ 26.) Ms.
Fields spent 12.6 hours ($5,368.60) conducting research in connection with this
motion and drafting the same. Ms. Fields anticipates spending an additional
three (3) hours preparing the reply to Defendant’s opposition to this motion
($1,275.00) ($6,643.60) total. (Id.) Efrat Cogan is a senior counsel and
she reviewed and edited the same with a billing rate of $750.00. Ms. Cogan
spent 7.4 hours ($5,550) reviewing and revising the motion. (Id. at ¶
27.) Oren Bitan is a partner with an hourly rate of $850.00 and spent 1.2 hours
($1,020) reviewing and revising this motion and drafting his declaration. (Id.
at ¶ 28.) Oren Bitan anticipated an additional hour attending the hearing on
the same ($1,870) total. (Id.) In connection with the December 7, 2023
deposition, Ms. Fields spent approximately 9.1 hours ($3,867.50) preparing for
the deposition, in addition to three hours ($1,275.00) taking Mr. Lacey’s
deposition ($5,142.40 total). (Id. at ¶ 29.) In addition, Mr. Bitan
spent three hours attending Mr. Lacey’s deposition ($2,550). (Id.) 
            The
Court finds the amount it took the attorneys to draft, review, and prepare this
motion to be excessive. Therefore, the Court reduces each amount by half - Ms.
Fields (7.8 hours for a total of $3,315), Ms. Cogan (3.7 hours for a total of
$2,775), and Mr. Bitan (0.6 hours for a total of $1,122).  Therefore, the Court grants a reduced amount
of monetary sanctions in the total amount of $12,345.40 (Motion
$7,212/Deposition $5,142.40).
Therefore, the
motion for issue and monetary sanction is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.
Plaintiff’s request for issue sanctions is DENIED. Plaintiff’s request
for monetary sanctions is GRANTED in a reduced amount of  $12,345.40 against Defendant and its counsel
of record, jointly or severally. Defendant and/or its counsel of record are
ordered to pay Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of  $12,345.40 twenty (20) days from this
order.  
            It
is so ordered.
