And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Ning Sun's motion to stay the proceedings pending arbitration. Ning Sun is seeking to stay the action against Allied Physicians of California IPA pending the outcome of an arbitration between Ning Sun and Health Net of California, Inc. regarding delays in treatment. However, the judge found that Ning Sun did not present sufficient evidence demonstrating an overlap of issues between this action and the arbitration with Health Net. Additionally, the judge agreed with Allied Physicians of California IPA that Ning Sun did not present evidence of an agreement between the parties concerning the issues in this case, nor did Plaintiff present any prior order compelling arbitration of issues pending in this case that would warrant staying the proceedings. As a result, the judge has denied Ning Sun's motion and ordered Allied Physicians of California IPA to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of the order.
