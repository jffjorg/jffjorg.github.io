  Case Number:  24PSCV00194    Hearing Date:   November 21, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Edgar  Carrillo v. Online Cargo Express, et al.  Defendants’  Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court OVERRULES Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s First  Amended Complaint. Defendants must file an answer to the First Amended  Complaint within 10 days of the Court’s order.              Defendants are ordered to give  notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is an employment action. On January 17, 2024, plaintiff Edgar  Carrillo (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Online Cargo Express,  Steve Jung (Jung) (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 20, alleging  causes of action for failure to pay wages, failure to provide overtime  compensation, failure to provide rest breaks, failure to provide meal breaks,  waiting time penalties, failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements,  failure to produce employee file, disability discrimination, race  discrimination, work environment harassment, retaliation, failure to prevent  harassment, discrimination and retaliation, retaliation (second count), failure  to provide reasonable accommodation, failure to engage in good faith  interactive process, unfair and unlawful business practices, and wrongful  constructive termination in violation of public policy.  On September 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended  Complaint (FAC) against the same Defendants, alleging causes of action for failure  to pay wages, failure to provide overtime compensation, failure to provide rest  breaks, failure to provide meal breaks, waiting time penalties, disability  discrimination, race discrimination, work environment harassment, retaliation  (Gov. Code, § 12940(h)), failure to prevent harassment, discrimination and  retaliation, retaliation (Labor Code, §§ 98.6, 1102.5), failure to provide  reasonable accommodation, failure to engage in good faith interactive process,  and unfair and unlawful business practices.  On October 22, 2024, Defendants demurred  to the FAC. On November 7, 2024, Plaintiff opposed the demurrer. On November  14, 2024, Defendants replied.  LEGAL  STANDARD              A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of  other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or  content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or  cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian v.  Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function  of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for  purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are  assumed to be true. (Id.)  A  demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the  pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially  noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,  supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be  considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,  881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting  demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862, disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal  v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287 [error to consider  contents of release not part of court record].)  A  demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete  or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.  v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of  the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are  incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.  Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s  Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as  surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”])  A demurrer  can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner  v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of  Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108  Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) OBJECTIONS  The Court OVERRULES Defendants’ evidentiary objections, as the  Court does not rely on that evidence in reaching its decision herein. DISCUSSION  Meet and Confer  Per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), Defendants  were  required to meet and confer in  person, by telephone, or by video conference before bringing this demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The Court finds Defendants’ efforts to  meet and confer sufficient. (Hsu Decl., ¶ 2.)  Prior Demurrer – Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, and  Thirteenth Causes of Action  Although not mentioned directly in Plaintiff’s opposition, the  Court notes that Defendants demur to many causes of action that the Court previously  overruled in Defendants’ prior demurrer, such as the causes of action for disability  discrimination, work environment harassment, failure to prevent harassment,  discrimination, and retaliation, retaliation (Labor Code §§ 98.6, 1102.5), failure  to provide reasonable accommodation, and failure to engage in good faith  interactive process. (Order re Tentative Ruling (9/5/24).) This is sufficient  grounds to overrule the demurrer as to the Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, Eleventh,  Twelfth, and Thirteenth Causes of Action of the FAC.  Statute of Limitations  “While a demurrer based on statute of  limitations lies where the dates in question are shown on the face of the  complaint, if those dates are missing, there is no ground for a general  demurrer. [Citation.]” (United W. Med. Centers v.  Superior Ct. (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 500, 505.) The statute of  limitations for a claim under Government Code section 12960 is three years.  (Gov. Code, § 12960.) The statute of limitations for claim based upon a statute  other than a penalty or forfeiture is three years. (Code Civ. Proc., § 338,  subd. (a).)  Defendants demur to the Sixth through Thirteenth Causes of Action  of the FAC on the grounds that they are time-barred. Defendants contend they  are barred under the three-year statutes of limitations for Government Code  section 12960 and Code of Civil Procedure section 338. Defendants contend the  FAC contains no factual allegations showing discrimination, harassment,  retaliation, failure to prevent, failure to accommodate, or failure to engage  in interactive process that was continuous after Plaintiff’s return following  his bout with Covid-19 in December 2020. Defendants contend the Labor Code does  not have a grace period for one year to file the complaint after receiving a  Right to Sue notice, and that the resignation occurred on January 15, 2021.  In opposition, Plaintiff contends his claims are not time-barred  because constructive discharge is the event that triggers the running of the  statute of limitations, which in this case was January of 2021. Plaintiff  contends the FAC demonstrates sufficiently continuous misconduct occurred up  until the date Plaintiff was constructively discharged, such as the  mistreatment received following his tuberculosis and Covid-19 diagnoses,  including reduced hours or taken off schedule for days due to the need to take  meal breaks to take medication or not getting paid his earned commissions.  Plaintiff contends he has alleged a continuous pattern of discrimination  against non-Asian employees. Plaintiff contends the FAC has new allegations  explaining how soon after Plaintiff complained to Jung the alleged adverse  employment action or actions happened, such as being sent home for the day and  not called back to work for a couple days after he would complaint to Jung  about Jung’s discrimination towards Hispanics and African Americans and  failures to accommodate Plaintiff’s accommodations following his medical  problems. Plaintiff contends his Right-to-Sue letter does not state he resigned  on January 15, 2021, but rather that was the last day he worked before  resigning in or around January of 2021.  The Court finds Defendants’ demurrer not well taken. First, although  not mentioned in Plaintiff’s opposition, the Court notes that Defendants did  not demur to these causes of action in the prior demurrer on the grounds that  they were time-barred. (Order re Tentative Ruling (9/5/24).) “A party demurring  to a pleading that has been amended after a demurrer to an earlier version of  the pleading was sustained shall not demur to any portion of the amended  complaint, cross-complaint, or answer on grounds that could have been raised by  demurrer to the earlier version of the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (b).) The Court does not find any new  allegations in the FAC that would excuse Defendants’ failure to raise these  issues in the prior demurrer, as the original complaint alleged the exact same  dates. (See Compl., ¶¶ 22, 26, 29, Ex. A; FAC, ¶¶ 22, 27, 30, Ex. A.)  Second, even if Defendants had properly raised these  issues previously, the Court would still overrule the demurrer. None of the  dates mentioned in the FAC clearly demonstrate that Plaintiff’s claims are  time-barred. The Right-to-Sue letter mentions that, “on or about January  15, 2021, respondent took the following adverse actions…” (FAC, Ex. A, p. 43 of  pdf, italics added.) Language of “on or about” is sufficient to overcome a  general demurrer based on the statute of limitations, as it is enough that the  claim may be timely. (Childs v. State of California  (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 155, 160, italics added.) Plaintiff also correctly notes  that the Right-to-Sue letter does not state the resignation occurred on January  15, 2021; rather, it says the resignation occurred in or around January of  2021. (FAC, Ex. A, p. 46 of pdf.) As for the date of December of 2020, the FAC  only indicates that Plaintiff contracted Covid-19 then. (FAC, ¶ 22.) It does  not clearly indicate when the alleged misconduct in connection with that  medical condition occurred. “[T]he limitations period set out in the FEHA  should be interpreted so as to promote the resolution of potentially  meritorious claims on the merits. [Citation.]” (Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc.  (2001) 26 Cal.4th 798, 819.)  Based on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the  demurrer.  CONCLUSION  The Court OVERRULES Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s First  Amended Complaint. Defendants must file an answer to the First Amended  Complaint within 10 days of the Court’s order.
