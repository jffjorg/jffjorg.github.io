Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Virginia Pech-Torres v. Windsor Cheviot Hills, LLC, et al. The case involves claims of employment-related injuries and discrimination by the plaintiff against the defendant Windsor Cheviot Hills, LLC, CPE HR, Inc., and individual defendants Kevin Jones, Jeff Huang, Nancy Rosas, and modern HR, Inc. and Today's HR, Inc.

The court found that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties and that the arbitration agreement covers the controversy at issue. The court also found that the individual defendants Kevin Jones and Jeff Huang waived their right to compel arbitration by refusing to participate in arbitration and forcing the court to lift the stay.

However, the court granted the motion to compel arbitration and stay the action as to the newly added defendants Nancy Rosas, Modern HR, Inc., and Today's HR, Inc. because they have not waived their right to seek arbitration under the agency exception.

The court ordered the parties to arbitrate their disputes and set a Post-Arbitration Status Conference for February 28, 2025.
