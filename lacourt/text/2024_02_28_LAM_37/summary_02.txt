Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that Defendant Daleyn's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) is sustained with 10 days leave to amend. The court has also set a Non-Appearance OSC Re: Amended Complaint for March 22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and ordered Defendant Daleyn to give notice.

The judge's ruling is based on the following grounds:

* The FAC is devoid of facts to show standing, and Defendant Daleyn's demurrer to the entire FAC is granted with leave to amend.
* The FAC fails to allege a fixed sum in the conversion cause of action, and the demurrer to that cause of action is granted with leave to amend.
* The FAC fails to allege specific provisions of the contract between BFFB and Daleyn that show Daleyn understood and accepted to act as a financial fiduciary to Plaintiff BFFB and Yenawine, and the demurrer to the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action is granted with leave to amend.
* The FAC fails to state the specific provisions of the contracts breached by Daleyn in the breach of contract cause of action, and the demurrer to that cause of action is sustained with leave to amend.

The judge has also denied Defendant Daleyn's request for judicial notice of Exhibit A, which is a declaration submitted by Tad Yenawine, because it is disputed as to whether Yenawine validly removed Koons as a corporate officer.
