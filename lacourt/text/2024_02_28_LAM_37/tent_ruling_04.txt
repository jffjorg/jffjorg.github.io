Background
 
On April 24, 2023, Joseph Nguyen, D.C.
Chiropractic, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Southwest Legal
Group (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 100, alleging a single cause of action for
conversion. 
 
On October 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), again alleging a single cause of
action for conversion. Defendant now demurs to the FAC and moves to strike
Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages. Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The
matter is now before the court. 
 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For purposes
of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the
truth of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally granted
to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Conversion
 
To
plead a cause of action for conversion, one must allege (1) the plaintiff’s
ownership or right to possession of personal property; (2) defendant’s
disposition of the property inconsistent with plaintiff’s rights; and (3)
resulting damages. (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp.(2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.) “Money may be the subject of conversion if the
claim involves a specific, identifiable sum . . . .” (WelcoElectronics, Inc.
v. Mora (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 202, 209.) 
 
The
FAC alleges that Plaintiff entered into agreements with Defendant’s clients to
provide medical services to Defendant’s clients. (FAC ¶ 5.) Each client gave
Plaintiff a lien against any proceeds received by Defendants on the clients’
behalf and Defendants had notice of the liens and agreed to hold and maintain
Plaintiff’s money in trust until the liens were discharged. The Plaintiff
billed a total of $193,735 for services rendered. (Compl. ¶¶ 6, 10.) Defendants
used the bills provided by Plaintiff to settle personal injury cases. (Compl. ¶
6.) 
 
Defendant
demurs to the conversion claim on the basis Plaintiff failed to allege dates as
to when the services were provided in order to see if the three-year statute of
limitation has run on Plaintiff’s claims. (CCP § 338(c)(1).) Defendant further
asserts that the FAC fails to identify the names of clients, the dates of
treatment, and the bills in question. The court agrees that Plaintiff must
provide dates as to when the liens were signed so that Defendant to assess if
Plaintiff’s claims are barred. 
 
The
demurrer to the conversion cause of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike
 
Defendant
moves to strike Paragraph 16 from the FAC which alleges: 
 
Plaintiff
is informed and believes and on the basis of said information and belief
alleges that Defendants’ conduct was taken with the intent to injure Plaintiff,
or with a willful and conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and property.
Plaintiff is informed and believes and on the basis of said information and
belief alleges that such fraudulent conduct constitutes clear and convincing
evidence of despicable, outrageous, oppressive, and malicious conduct pursuant
to California Civil Code §3294. As such, Plaintiff is entitled to punitive
damages and exemplary damages against Defendants herein for the sake of example
and to punish Defendants for their unlawful conduct.

(FAC ¶ 16.)
 
To state a claim for punitive damages
under Civ. Code § 3294, a plaintiff must allege specific facts showing that the
defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression or fraud. (Smith v. Superior
Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿ The basis for punitive damages
must be pled with specificity; conclusory allegations devoid of any factual
assertions are insufficient. (Id.)¿¿ “Malice” is defined in Civ. Code §
3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury” or
“despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” “Oppression” is defined
as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).) The
term “despicable” has been defined in the case law as actions that are “base,”
“vile,” or “contemptible.” (Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales
& Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) Fraud means “an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”
(Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).)¿
 
As the demurrer to the conversion claim
has been sustained with leave to amend, the motion to strike is granted with
leave to amend. Moreover, the court notes that Plaintiff fails to plead facts
sufficient to show that Plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages. Plaintiff
must allege facts to show that Anthony Lopez, as a managing agent of Defendant,
acted or ratified conduct that was done with malice, oppression, or fraud in
interfering with Plaintiff’s liens. Plaintiff must also allege what the
specific “interfering” conduct was and state facts that the conduct was
intentional or done with conscious disregard for the Plaintiff’s rights. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to strike
is granted with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 10
days leave to amend. Defendant’s motion to strike is 
granted
with 10 days leave to amend. A Non-Appearance OSC re: Amended Complaint is set
for 
March
22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The Case
Management Conference is taken off calendar.
  
Defendant
