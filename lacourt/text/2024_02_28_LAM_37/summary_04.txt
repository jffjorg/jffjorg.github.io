Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Joseph Nguyen, D.C. Chiropractic, Inc. v. Southwest Legal Group. The case involves a conversion claim by Plaintiff against Defendant and a demurrer by Defendant to Plaintiff's conversion claim, as well as a motion to strike by Defendant to Plaintiff's request for punitive damages.

The judge has sustained Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's conversion claim with 10 days leave to amend. The judge has also granted Defendant's motion to strike with 10 days leave to amend. A Non-Appearance OSC re: Amended Complaint is scheduled for March 22, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.

The judge's ruling is based on the following findings:

* Plaintiff failed to allege dates as to when the services were provided in order to see if the three-year statute of limitation has run on Plaintiff's claims.
* Plaintiff failed to identify the names of clients, the dates of treatment, and the bills in question.
* Plaintiff's conversion claim does not allege specific facts showing that Defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud.
* Plaintiff's request for punitive damages is based on conclusory allegations devoid of any factual assertions.

The judge has granted Defendant's motion to strike Paragraph 16 from the FAC, which alleges that Plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages based on Defendant's alleged fraudulent conduct. The judge has also noted that Plaintiff must allege facts to show that Anthony Lopez, as a managing agent of Defendant, acted or ratified conduct that was done with malice, oppression, or fraud in interfering with Plaintiff's liens.
