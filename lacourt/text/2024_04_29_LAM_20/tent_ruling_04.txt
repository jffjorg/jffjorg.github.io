Plaintiff Catamount Properties 2018, LLC seeks a default judgment against Defendant Andrew Truesdale.  While Plaintiff requests $331,000 in damages, the FAC fails to make any specific request for damages against Truesdale; rather, Plaintiff states that it “has been damaged in an amount which will be proved at the time of trial, representing the difference between the market value of the entirety of the Subject Property and the fair market value of a 50% interest in the Subject Property.”This is problematic as “[t]he relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 580.)  Further, phrases such as “in an amount not less than” do not give notice for the purposes of Code Civ. Proc. § 580.  (Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173-1174.)  Code Civ. Proc. § 580 applies even when a defendant has defaulted after having filed an answer and having participated in discovery.  (See Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 828; Elec. Funds Sols., LLC v. Murphy (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1175.)  Thus, Plaintiff can either accept the jurisdictional minimum of $25,001 in damages or else amend the FAC’s allegations as to damages, which would be a material change opening Defendant’s default.  (Cole v. Roebling Const. Co. (1909) 156 Cal. 443; Leo v. Dunlap (1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 24, 27-28.) Accordingly, the Default Judgment Application is denied without prejudice. Plaintiff to give notice.
