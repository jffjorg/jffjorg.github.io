This is the Judge's tentative ruling regarding the default judgment application filed by Plaintiff Catamount Properties 2018, LLC against Defendant Andrew Truesdale. The Plaintiff seeks a default judgment for $331,000 in damages, but has failed to specify the amount of damages in the complaint. The Judge finds that this is problematic, as the relief granted to the Plaintiff cannot exceed what was demanded in the complaint. The Judge cites California law and case precedents to support this finding. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff must either accept the jurisdictional minimum of $25,001 in damages or amend the complaint to specify damages. The Default Judgment Application is denied without prejudice, and the Plaintiff is given notice.
