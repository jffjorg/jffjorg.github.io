 Allen Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory & Natsis LLP seeks to be relieved as counsel for Defendants MM Enterprises USA, LLC, The MedMen Foundation, and Desert Hot Springs Green Horizons, Inc. Plaintiff Amanda Tran opposes the Motions because Defendants have already frequently changed counsel and a further withdrawal will result in delays with respect to a MSC and the July 29, 2024, trial.  “The determination whether to grant or deny an attorney's motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case. (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406, 74 Cal.Rptr. 197.) ‘It is generally recognized that the failure or refusal of a client to pay or secure the proper fees or expenses of the attorney after being reasonably requested to do so will furnish grounds for the attorney to withdraw from the case.’ ”  (Lempert v. Superior Ct. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.)The Motions meet all requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362.  Further, it is not ideal to force Allen Matkins to act as counsel for 3 months of trial preparation and then a trial.  The Court, in the exercise of its discretion, grants the Motions.The Court sets an OSC re: Defendants’ retention of counsel for May 29, 2024.Moving parties to give notice.Attorney is relieved as counsel of record for client effective upon the filing of the proof of service for the Court order (form MC-053) upon the client.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
