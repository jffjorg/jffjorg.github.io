And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting defendant Adelaide's motion to compel arbitration and staying the instant action pending arbitration. The judge found that the arbitration agreement signed by the parties in 2021 is enforceable and that the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA) does not apply to the case. The judge also rejected the plaintiff's arguments that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable, finding that the agreement was not excessively one-sided and that the plaintiff impliedly consented to the agreement by continuing her employment after signing it. The judge noted that California law favors arbitration as an efficient alternative to litigation and that the doctrine of unconscionability has both procedural and substantive elements. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further argument and evidence presented at the hearing scheduled for December 9, 2024.
