### English Text Summary
The tentative ruling by the Judge in the case of Wilber Gomez Diaz vs. Tricolor California Auto Group, LLC, grants the Plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees in the reduced amount of $70,021.50, and costs in the reduced amount of $4,005.43, for a total of $74,026.93. The Plaintiff had requested a total of $96,644.30 in attorneys' fees and costs. The Judge found the hourly rates of the Plaintiff's counsel reasonable and reduced the fees requested due to excessive and unnecessary billing. The court also reduced the costs requested, as some expenses were not recoverable by statute. The Plaintiff is the prevailing party, having obtained their litigation goals under the Consumers Legal Remedies Act and the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Defendant did not dispute the Plaintiff's status as the prevailing party. The Judge applied the lodestar method to calculate the attorneys' fees, considering factors such as the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, the skill displayed in presenting them, and the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys. The court's decision is based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws, including the Song-Beverly Act and the Consumers Legal Remedies Act.
