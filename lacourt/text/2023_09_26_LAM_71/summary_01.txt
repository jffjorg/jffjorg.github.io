Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied BMW's motion for summary judgment against Plaintiff's complaint. BMW had argued that it did not owe a duty to Plaintiff to use ordinary care, and that it was absolved of respondeat superior liability when it relinquished control to Staff Pro. However, the judge found that Staff Pro had raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether BMW owed Plaintiff a duty to use ordinary care, and that BMW had a special employment relationship with Staff Pro.

The judge also denied BMW's motion for summary adjudication on Issues 1 and 2. As to Issue 1, the judge found that Staff Pro had raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether BMW had control over the premises. BMW had argued that it did not own, lease, occupy or control the property, but the judge found that Staff Pro had presented evidence that BMW had control over the premises.

The judge's ruling means that the case will proceed to trial, where the parties will have the opportunity to present evidence and arguments to a jury.
