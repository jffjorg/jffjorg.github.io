         vs.
 
AL
  MALAIKAH AUDITORIUM COMPANY, et al.


 Case No.:  20STCV00965
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  September 26, 2023



 
Defendant BMW Nationwide Security, Inc.’s motion for summary
judgment against Plaintiff’s complaint is denied.  
 
Defendant BMW Nationwide Security, Inc.’s motion in the
alternative for summary adjudication against Plaintiff’s complaint is denied as
to Issue Nos. 1 and 2. 

 
Defendant BMW Nationwide Security, Inc. (“BMW”) (“Defendant”) moves
for summary adjudication of Plaintiff Edna Herrarte-Giron’s (“Herrarte-Giron”)
(“Plaintiff”) complaint (“Complaint”) on the basis BMW did not have a duty to
Plaintiff, BMW is protected under the special employee relationship, BMW had no
notice of a dangerous condition, and BMW’s actions were not the proximate cause
of Plaintiff’s injury.  (Notice of
Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §437c.)
In the alternative, BMW moves for summary adjudication on the
following issues: (1) the premises liability cause of action (2nd COA) is not
applicable to BMW as the issue of ownership, possession, and control of the
premises has been proven as a matter of law and BMW is entitled to judgement on
this cause of action because the premises where the alleged incident took place
was not owned, controlled, maintained, or in the possession of BMW [Issue
No. 1]; and (2) the issue of a special relationship between BMW and
Defendant Staff Pro Inc. (“Staff Pro”) (“Defendant”) has been proven as a
matter of law, specifically, because Staff Pro retained exclusive control over
the borrowed Guards, including Jesus Aceves [Issue No. 2].  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §437c(f).)
 
          Evidentiary Objections
BMW’s 8/24/23 evidentiary objections
to Plaintiff’s evidence are overruled as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4
(only as to Exh. 1, Plaintiff’s Depo 180:4-8), 5, 6, 7, and 8; and sustained as
to No. 4 (only as to Exh. 1 Plaintiff’s Depo 164:20-165:21). 
BMW’s 8/24/23 evidentiary objections to Staff Pro’s evidence are
overruled a to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
BMW’s 8/24/23 evidentiary objections to Goldenvoice’s evidence are
overruled as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.
 
Background
On January 8, 2020, Plaintiff Edna Herrarte-Giron (“Herrarte-Giron”)
(“Plaintiff”) filed her personal injury complaint in the instant action against
Defendants Staff Pro, Al Malaikah Auditorium Company (“Al Malaikah”),
and Goldenvoice LLC (“Goldenvoice”) (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging two
causes of action: (1) negligence; and (2) premises liability, arising from an
incident on February 8, 2019, during which Plaintiff tripped and fell at the
Shrine Auditorium, suffering injuries to her right foot (“Incident”).  (See Complaint.)  The causes of action are based on allegations
that Defendants negligently maintained the premises by failing to properly
inspect and/or manage the premises in order to prevent injury to visitors.  
On February 26, 2020, Staff Pro filed its initial cross-complaint against
Al Malaikah, Goldenvoice, and BMW.  On October 8, 2021, Staff Pro filed its
operative first amended cross-complaint against Al Malaikah, Goldenvoice, and
BMW for three causes of action: (1) equitable indemnity [against all
Cross-Defendants]; (2) declaratory relief [against all Cross-Defendants]; and
(3) express contractual indemnity [against
Cross-Defendant BMW].  On July 13, 2023,
this Court granted BMW’s motion for summary adjudication of Staff Pros’ first
initial cross complaint only on the issue that BMW owes Staff Pro a duty of
defense regarding Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
(7/13/23 Minute Order, pg. 7.)
BMW filed the instant motion on June 13, 2023.  Plaintiff filed her opposition on August 10,
2023.  Staff Pro filed its opposition on
August 15, 2023.  Goldenvoice and Al
Malaikah filed their opposition on August 15, 2023.  BMW filed its replies to Plaintiff, Staff
Pro, and Goldenvoice and Al Malaikah on August 24, 2023.
 
Legal Standard
A motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers
submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  (C.C.P.
§437c(c).) 
A party moving for summary adjudication of a cause of action must
show that no material issues of fact remain as to each element of that cause of
action.  (C.C.P. §437c(p)(l).)  A party moving for summary adjudication must
completely dispose of the particular issue of duty.  (C.C.P. §437c(f)(l); Linden Partners v.
Wilshire Linden Association (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 508, 519, 521-522.)
 
          Negligence (1st COA)
A
cause of action for negligence requires the following elements: (1) legal duty
owed to plaintiff to use due care; (2) breach of duty; (3) causation; and (4)
damage to plaintiff.  (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318; Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12
Cal.4th 913, 917; McGarry v. Sax (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 983, 994
[focusing on duty to avoid causing unreasonable risk of injury in Civil Code
§1714].) 
“Everyone
is responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also
for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or
skill in the management of his or her property or person.”  (Civ. Code §1714(a); see Cabral v. Ralphs
Grocery Co. (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 764, 771 [“The general rule in California is
that ‘[e]veryone is responsible . . . for an injury occasioned to another by
his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his or her
property or person.’”].)
Employers
are held vicariously liable for the torts of their employees.  (See, e.g., Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo
Newhall Memorial Hospital (1995) 12 Cal.4th 291, 296-297 [“The rule of
respondeat superior is familiar and simply stated: an employer is vicariously
liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of the
employment.”].)
i.                  
Duty owed to
Plaintiff
          BMW argues it did not owe a duty to
Plaintiff because its duties prohibited its employees from ushering and
illuminating Plaintiff’s path.  BMW
submitted evidence that upon arriving at Opera Box H, Plaintiff spoke with Jesus
Aceves (“Aceves”), who was stationed exclusively as a crew member, and not an
usher, at the entrance curtain.  (BMW’s
Disputed Separate Statement of Fact [“BMW-DSSF”] 48; BMW-COE, Exh. B at 65:22-66:1,
67:3-68:8, 75:18-76:3; Exh. C at 68:10-14.) 
BMW failed to submit evidence that it did not owe Plaintiff a duty to
use ordinary care.
          Assuming, arguendo, BMW met its
burden to submit evidence that it did not owe Plaintiff a duty to use ordinary
care, Staff Pro met its burden to raise an issue of material fact as to whether
Aceves owed Plaintiff a duty to use ordinary care.  Specifically, Staff Pro submitted evidence
that Aceves had a duty to use ordinary care in illuminating Plaintiff’s path arising
from Aceves’ special relationship with Plaintiff.  Staff Pro submitted evidence that Aceves had
special training with respect to safety and event services.  (Staff Pro’s Additional Material Facts
[“SP-AMF”] 1.)  Staff Pro submitted
evidence that Aceves was trained as a guard by BMW and certified with a guard
care.  (Staff Pro’s Undisputed Material
Facts [“SP-USSF”] 21.)  Staff Pro
submitted evidence that Aceves was instructed by his supervisor to use his
flashlight to “guide [patrons] to their seat on the floor so [patrons] won’t .
. . miss a step.”  (SP-AMF 4.)  Staff Pro met its burden to raise a triable
issue of material fact as to whether BMW owed Plaintiff a duty of ordinary
care.
ii.                
Special Employment
Relationship [Issue 2]
“When
a[] . . . ‘general’ employer lends an employee to another employer and
relinquishes to a borrowing employer all right of control over the employee’s
activities, a ‘special employment’ relationship arises between the borrowing
employer and the employee. During this period of transferred control, the
special employer becomes solely liable under the doctrine of respondeat
superior for the employee’s job-related torts.”  (Marsh v. Tilley Steel Co. (1980) 26
Cal.3d 486, 492, citing Welborn v. Dalzell Rigging Co. (1960) 181
Cal.App.2d 268, 275, and Doty v. Lacey (1952) 114 Cal.App.2d 73, 78.)
“The
special employment relationship and its consequent imposition of liability upon
the special employer flows from the borrower’s power to supervise the details
of the employee’s work. Mere instruction by the borrower on the result to be
achieved will not suffice. Moreover, California courts have held that evidence
of the following circumstances tend to negate the existence of a special
employment: The employee is (1) not paid by and cannot be discharged by the
borrower, (2) a skilled worker with substantial control over operational
details, (3) not engaged in the borrower’s usual business, (4) employed for
only a brief period of time, and (5) using tools and equipment furnished by the
lending employer.” (Id., citing Kowalski v. Shell Oil Co. (1979)
23 Cal.3d 168, 176-177, and McFarland v. Voorheis-Trindle Co. (1959) 52
Cal.2d 698, 705, 343 P.2d 923.) 
BMW
argues that it was absolved of respondeat superior liability when it
relinquished all control to Staff Pro, with whom it had a “special employment
relationship.”  BMW submitted evidence
that it had no authority, control, or supervision over the guards once they
arrived at the Shrine Auditorium.  (BMW-DSSF 36; BMW-COE, Exh. C at 25:6-12, 19-23; Exh. D
at 27:13-18, 29:19-21, 80:24-25, 81:1-4, 83:25-84:5, 120:5-19, 121:1-3; Exh. F;
Exh. G.)  BMW submitted evidence that Staff
Pro’s PMK conceded the BMW guards were under the direct control and supervision
of Staff Pro and were required to wear Staff Pro uniforms.  (BMW-DSSF 37; D-COE, Exh. C at 25:6-12,
25:19-23.)  BMW submitted evidence that
Aceves’ direct supervisor on the night of the Incident was Kendra McDonald, a
dedicated Staff Pro employee.  (BMW-USSF
43.)  BMW met its burden to demonstrate it
had a special employment relationship with Staff Pro that absolved BMW of
respondeat superior liability, shifting the burden to an opposing party to
raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether BMW had
a special employment relationship with Staff Pro.
Staff Pro met its burden on raise a
triable issue of material fact as to whether BMW had a special employment
relationship with Staff Pro.  Specifically, Staff Pro submitted evidence
that Aceves admitted BMW paid him for his work on the night of the
Incident.  (SP-AMF 2.)  Staff Pro submitted evidence that Aceves was
under Staff Pro’s alleged control for only a brief time—the night of the incident.  (SP-AMF 2.) 
Staff Pro submitted evidence that under BMW’s and Staff Pro’s Service
Agreement, BMW was to supply its guards with tools to perform their duties,
including flashlights.  (SP-AMF 1.)  Staff Pro met its burden on raise a triable
issue of material fact as to whether BMW had a special employment relationship
with Staff Pro.
Staff
Pro further submitted evidence raising a triable issue of material fact as to
whether Aceves breached his duty to illuminate Plaintiff’s path and caused
Plaintiff’s fall.  Specifically, Staff
Pro submitted evidence of Plaintiff’s testimony that Aceves did not illuminate
her path, which resulted in her fall. 
(SP-AMF 6.)
          Accordingly, BMW’s
motion for summary judgment is denied. 
Alternatively, BMW’s motion for summary adjudication of Issue 2 is
denied.
 
          Premises Liability (2nd COA) [Issue
1]
A
cause of action for premises liability requires the following elements: (1) defendant
owned, leased, occupied or controlled the property; (2)
defendant was negligent in the use, maintenance or management of premises; (3)
plaintiff was harmed; and (4) defendant’s negligence was a substantial factor
in causing plaintiff’s harm.  (Brooks
v. Eugene Burger Management Corp. (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1611, 1619
[premises liability is a form of negligence]; see also Barnes v. Black
(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1473, 1478 [“A landowner owes a duty to exercise
reasonable care to maintain his or her property in such a manner as to avoid
exposing others to an unreasonable risk of injury.”].)
BMW
argues it did not own, possess, or control the subject premises where the
Incident took place.  BMW submitted
evidence that Al Malaikah and Goldenvoice respectively owned, controlled, and
possessed the Shrine Auditorium at the time of the Incident.  (BMW-USSF 9.) 
BMW submitted evidence that it did not have authority, control, or
supervision over the guards once they arrived at the Shrine.  (BMW-DSSF 12; BMW-COE, Exh. C at 25:6-12, 25:19-23;
Exh. D at 27:13-18, 29:19-21, 80:24-25, 81:1-4, 83:25-84:1-5, 120:5-19,
121:1-3; Exh. F; Exh. G.)  BMW met its
burden to demonstrate it did not own, lease, occupy or control the property,
shifting the burden to an opposing party to raise a triable issue of material
fact.
Staff
Pro met its burden to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether BMW
had control over the premises. 
Specifically, Staff Pro submitted evidence of Aceves’ deposition
testimony stating that he was employed by BMW on the night of the Incident
and paid by BMW and was provided by BMW to Staff Pro as personnel for ushering
services at the 2Cellos concert at the Shrine Auditorium.  (SP-AMF 2.)  Staff Pro submitted evidence of Aceves’
deposition testimony stating that he was stationed outside of the entry curtain
for Opera Box H, and he was tasked with controlling entry to the Opera Box by
reviewing tickets and only permitting guests with the appropriate tickets or
with other authorization.  (SP-AMF 3.)  Staff Pro met its burden to raise a triable
issue of material fact as to whether BMW has control over the premises.
Accordingly,
BMW’s motion for summary adjudication of Issue 1 is denied.
 
 
Conclusion
 
BMW’s
motion for summary judgment of Plaintiff’s Complaint is denied.
BMW’s
motion in the alternative for summary adjudication is denied as to Issues 1 and
2.
