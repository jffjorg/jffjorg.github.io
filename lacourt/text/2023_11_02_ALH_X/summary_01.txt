And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the order compelling arbitration and lift the stay of the case. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant, Koulax Enterprises, had failed to pay arbitration fees in a timely manner, which was in material breach of the arbitration agreement. The judge found that the defendant's failure to pay was unintentional and not the result of gamesmanship by the plaintiff. The judge also granted the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1. The judge noted that the legislature intended section 1281.98 to be strictly enforced and that the court must apply the statute strictly, even when nonpayment is inadvertent. However, in this case, the judge did not impose the full amount of sanctions requested by the plaintiff, as the failure to pay was due to mistakes by both parties.
