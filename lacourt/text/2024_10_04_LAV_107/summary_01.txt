And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the City of Los Angeles' motion to compel Damian Carmona's compliance with its demand for a physical examination. The City served two demands for a physical examination, which Carmona did not object to, and Carmona failed to appear for both examinations. As a result, Carmona has waived any objections to the demands and the City is entitled to an order compelling response and compliance with the demand. The judge also declined to impose sanctions on Carmona's counsel, who paid the no-show fee for the missed appointments.
