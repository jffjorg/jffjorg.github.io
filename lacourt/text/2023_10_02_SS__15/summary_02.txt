And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding various motions in limine filed by the defendants. The defendants had requested to exclude certain evidence and arguments from the trial, including references to the relationship between Union Carbide and Dow Chemical, damages amounts, asbestos-cement pipe, working conditions, the 1989 proposed EPA ban, J-M Manufacturing documents, successor liability, lobbying activities, and bankruptcy. The judge has denied most of these motions without prejudice, meaning that the defendants can still object to the evidence and arguments at trial. The judge has granted two motions, one to bifurcate punitive damages and one to exclude evidence of incidents not involving asbestos. The judge has also deemed certain motions made and denied, including motions to exclude evidence of post-sale failure to warn and failure to conduct a recall or post-sale warning campaign.

**English Summary:**

The judge is tentatively ruling on several motions filed by the defendants to exclude certain evidence from being presented at trial. The judge finds many of the motions are too vague and denies them without prejudice to objections at trial. This means the defendants can still object to the evidence at trial, but they need to be more specific about their objections. 

The judge does grant the motion to bifurcate the trial on the issue of punitive damages. This means the trial will be divided into two parts: one to determine liability and the other to determine the amount of damages, if any. The judge also grants the motion to exclude reference to the bankruptcies of John-Manville Corporation and Certainteed Corporation.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motions in limine filed by the defendants and has tentatively ruled on each one. The motions seek to exclude certain evidence and arguments from the trial.

The judge has denied without prejudice the motions to exclude evidence of Union Carbide's relationship with Dow Chemical, references to damages amounts in voir dire and opening statements, and evidence of working conditions at J-M Manufacturing's facilities. The judge has also denied without prejudice the motion to exclude evidence of asbestos exposure at the facilities, which could be relevant to knowledge or notice.

The judge has granted the motions to exclude references to incidents where people died or were injured as a result of Union Carbide's chemicals other than asbestos, and evidence of lobbying activities. The judge has also granted the motion to exclude evidence of working conditions at J-M Manufacturing's facilities, which is too vague.

The judge has denied the motion to exclude evidence of a post-sale failure to warn, as this is a relevant topic. The judge has also denied the motion to exclude evidence of successor liability, as this is a matter for the trial court to decide.

The judge has granted the motion to bifurcate punitive damages, and has denied the motion to exclude evidence of a 1989 proposed EPA ban that never went into effect.

The judge has denied the motion to exclude testimony and videos from William Longo and Richard Hatfield about work simulations, as these are relevant to the case. The judge has also denied the motion to exclude evidence of J-M Manufacturing's compliance with 1972 OSHA labeling regulations, as this is relevant to the case.

The judge has denied the motion to exclude evidence of John-Manville Corporation's and Certainteed Corporation's bankruptcies, as this is a relevant topic. The judge has also denied the motion to exclude reference to John-Manville Corporation's and Certainteed Corporation's liabilities, as this is relevant to the case.

The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer on a stipulation regarding J-M Manufacturing's liability for products sold before 1983.
