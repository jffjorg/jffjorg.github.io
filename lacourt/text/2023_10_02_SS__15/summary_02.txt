And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding various motions in limine filed by the defendants. The defendants had requested to exclude certain evidence and arguments from the trial, including references to the relationship between Union Carbide and Dow Chemical, damages amounts, asbestos-cement pipe, working conditions, the 1989 proposed EPA ban, J-M Manufacturing documents, successor liability, lobbying activities, and bankruptcy. The judge has denied most of these motions without prejudice, meaning that the defendants can still object to the evidence and arguments at trial. The judge has granted two motions, one to bifurcate punitive damages and one to exclude evidence of incidents not involving asbestos. The judge has also deemed certain motions made and denied, including motions to exclude evidence of post-sale failure to warn and failure to conduct a recall or post-sale warning campaign.
