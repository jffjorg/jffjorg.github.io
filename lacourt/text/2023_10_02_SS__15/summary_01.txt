english:
This tentative ruling addresses several motions in limine filed by the defendant, HCR Manorcare, Inc., in a case scheduled for hearing on October 2, 2023. The motions seek to exclude the testimony of various witnesses based on a lack of foundation, speculation, or failure to disclose hypotheticals.

In the motion regarding Arnold Brody, the defendant argues that Brody's testimony about causation should be excluded because he did not review any materials from the case. However, the plaintiff's counsel has stated that she will ask the witness to assume certain foundation facts at trial. The motion is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.

The motion regarding Gerald Markowitz argues that he should be excluded because he is a historian and lacks the expertise to opine on science and scientific articles. The plaintiff argues that Markowitz is an expert in the field of public health and his testimony about the history of asbestos as a known danger falls within his education, career, and expertise. The motion is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.

The motion regarding Barry Horn argues that his testimony should be excluded as speculative because he did not review any industrial hygiene materials and has no information about the plaintiff's dose. The plaintiff argues that the defendant did not show good cause to depart from the July 8, 2022 CMO. The motion is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.

The motion regarding Marty Kanarek argues that his testimony about causation should be excluded as speculative and lacking foundation because he testified that he does not know of any epidemiological studies concerning asbestos exposure from lab equipment. The plaintiff argues that the defendant does not cite any law that an epidemiological study is a necessary prerequisite to a causation opinion. The motion is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.

The motion regarding Keith Garza seeks to exclude his testimony that the defendant's products used by the plaintiff contained asbestos and released asbestos fibers as speculative. However, Garza testified that he read the plaintiff's deposition about the products she used from the defendant and the requirement at her school that the products be made from asbestos. The motion is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.

The motion regarding James Millette argues that his opinions should be excluded because he could not refer to any epidemiological study concerning asbestos exposure from lab equipment and he has no information about the plaintiff's exposure from the defendant's lab products. The plaintiff argues that the defendant does not cite any law that an expert cannot testify about causation without an epidemiological study. The motion is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.

The motion regarding Allan Smith argues that his testimony should be excluded as speculative because he could not refer to any epidemiological study concerning asbestos exposure from lab equipment and he has no information about the plaintiff's exposure from the defendant's lab products. The plaintiff argues that Smith has reviewed the plaintiff's deposition transcripts and will not be testifying about any particular brand of product she used or that lab equipment might contain asbestos. The motion is denied without prejudice to objections at trial.

In all cases, the defendant is instructed to give notice of the ruling.
