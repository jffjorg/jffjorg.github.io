Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on various motions filed by the defendant, HCR Manorcare, Inc. The motions seek to exclude the testimony of several expert witnesses, including Arnold Brody, Gerald Markowitz, Barry Horn, Marty Kanarek, Keith Garza, James Millette, and Allan Smith. The court denied the motions without prejudice to objections at trial, finding that the expert witnesses had disclosed the general substance of their testimony and had a legitimate basis for their opinions. The court also rejected the defendant's arguments that the expert witnesses' opinions were speculative or lacked foundation.
