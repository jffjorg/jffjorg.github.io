And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Kerry Bensinger's tentative ruling denies Bradley A. Cosman's initial application to appear pro hac vice due to non-compliance with California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40. However, after Cosman filed a proof of service by mail of a copy of the application on the California State Bar, the Court granted the unopposed application. The Court finds that Cosman's application now complies with the requirements of Rule 9.40, allowing him to appear as counsel pro hac vice for the purpose of representing the court-appointed receiver in this action.
