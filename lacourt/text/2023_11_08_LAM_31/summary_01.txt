And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with the discovery order dated May 18, 2023. The defendant, General Motors LLC, failed to provide verified responses to the plaintiff's requests for production and failed to produce all responsive documents. The judge finds that the defendant's further supplemental responses are not code-compliant and are confusing. The judge orders the defendant to provide verified, code-compliant responses and to produce all responsive documents within 10 days of the order. If the defendant fails to comply, the plaintiff may bring a motion for imposition of daily monetary sanctions of $250 per day for each day of non-compliance.
