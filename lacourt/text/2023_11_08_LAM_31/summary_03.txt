And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendant and has reviewed the plaintiff's declaration and opposition. The plaintiff claims that the defendant propounded discovery too early in an attempt to harass and intimidate them. However, the judge notes that the Civil Discovery Act allows defendants to propound discovery at any time after the action is initiated. The judge also takes into account the plaintiff's age (90 years old) and the fact that the money at issue was allegedly loaned to the defendants to purchase a house, suggesting that the money was intended for the defendants' benefit, not the plaintiff's. The judge is tentatively ruling that the demurrer will be denied and that the case will proceed.
