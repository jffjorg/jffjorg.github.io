DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Jennifer O. Oh
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Joanne
Pak
 
 
I.          FACTUAL AND
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
            This action arises from the alleged breach of an oral
contract.  Plaintiff, Joanne Pak, a
self-represented litigant, alleges that between August 22, 2013 to February 6,
2020, she personally loaned the total sum of $65,945.00 to Defendants, Jennifer
O. Oh and Younhee Cho, so that Defendants could purchase a house.  In return, Defendants promised to repay
Plaintiff with interest by October 30, 2020 without any intention to repay the
loan.  Defendants have not repaid the
loan.  Promissory notes, written in
Korean and English, as well as personal checks issued by Defendants to
Plaintiff are attached as exhibits to the Complaint.  
 
            On November
22, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in pro per against Defendants for (1)  Financial Elder Abuse, (2) Breach of Contract,
and (3) Money Had and Received and Account Stated.  
 
            On June 20,
2023, Defendant, Jennifer O. Oh, filed this Demurrer to the Complaint. 
 
            On July 5,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Declaration Re: Abuse of Process.[1]  On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
Opposition.  
 
            On October
26, 2023, Defendant filed a Reply.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER  
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].)  Allegations are to be liberally construed.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations, the court is to give
effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent
general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial Corporation of America
v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.)   
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,
subd. (e).)  “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where
a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)  Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)  
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
A.  Meet and Confer

 
“Before filing a demurrer…the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) 
 
Defense counsel has complied with the meet and confer
requirement.  (See Declaration of Dale J. Park, ¶ 3.)
 
B.  Application
 
Defendant demurs to each cause of action.  The Court addresses each in turn 
 
First Cause of Action for Financial Elder Abuse
 
To state a cause of action
for financial elder abuse under The Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil
Protection Act (Welf. & Inst. Code, §15600 et seq.), a plaintiff must allege the following elements: (1)
defendant took/hid/appropriated/or retained plaintiff’s property, or assisted
in taking/hiding/appropriating or obtaining plaintiff’s property; (2) plaintiff
was 65 years of age or older at the time of conduct; (3) defendant
took/hid/appropriated/or retained the property, or assisted in
taking/hiding/appropriating or obtaining the property for wrongful use or with
the intent to defraud or by undue influence; (4) plaintiff was harmed; and (5)
defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff’s harm. 
One way a plaintiff can prove that defendant took/hid/appropriated/obtained/ or
retained the property for a wrongful use is by proving that defendant knew or
should have known that their conduct was likely to be harmful to
plaintiff.  (CACI No. 3100.) 
 
Defendant argues the First Cause of Action for
Financial Elder Abuse fails for four reasons: (1) there is no allegation
indicating that Plaintiff was at least 65 years of age at the time of the
alleged conduct (second element); (2) there is no allegation that the money was
taken for a wrongful use or with the intent to defraud or by undue influence
(third element); (3) the statute of limitation may bar the claim; and (4) the
cause of action is uncertain.  
 
Upon review, the Court finds the First Cause of
Action is sufficiently pleaded.  First, the
Complaint alleges that Plaintiff loaned Defendants the money sometime between
2013 and 2020 and that Plaintiff was 89 years old.  (See Complaint, ¶ 6.) Although it is unclear
whether Plaintiff was 89 years old at the time of the filing of the Complaint[2] or was 89 years old in
2013, if the former, Plaintiff would have been 80 years old in 2013.  As such, Plaintiff adequately pleads that she
was at least 65 years old as of 2013. 
The second element of a financial elder abuse claim is sufficiently
alleged.  
 
Second, the third element is also sufficiently
pleaded. The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff believed Defendant’s
“extraordinary” reason for soliciting money from Plaintiff (Complaint, ¶¶ 7,
9), that Defendants promised to repay the loan with interest (Complaint, ¶ 8),
that Defendants issued their own check to Plaintiff to support their oral
promise to repay the loan (Complaint, ¶ 10), and that Defendants did not plan
to repay the loan (Complaint, ¶ 11). 
Construed liberally, these allegations taken together sufficiently show
that Defendant intended to defraud Plaintiff by providing a false basis for the
loan (purchasing a home), provided security in the form of a check to secure
the loan, all without the intent to repay the loan.  
 
Third, the claim is not barred by the statute of
limitations.  “An action for damages
pursuant to [Welfare and Institutions Code] Sections 15657.5 and 15657.6 for
financial abuse of an elder or dependent adult, as defined in Section 15610.30,
shall be commenced within four years after the plaintiff discovers or, through
the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered, the facts
constituting the financial abuse.”  (Welf.
& Inst. Code, § 15657.7.)  Here, the
Complaint alleges that Defendants promised to repay the loan with interest by
October 30, 2020.  (Complaint, ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff filed the Complaint less than three
years later on November 22, 2022.  The
Complaint is timely.  
 
Last, Defendant argues that the exhibits
attached to the Complaint render uncertain the First Cause of Action.  In support, Defendant points out that Plaintiff
has attached a Promissory Note, dated 07/17/2022, which is typed in the Korean
language, another handwritten note in Korean, dated 08/22/2013, and photocopies
of personal checks issued by Defendants in 2013, 2015, 2019, and 2022, which
show that the parties may have entered into a novation.  Defendant further argues that none of the
exhibits are sufficiently described in the Complaint to show how they relate to
the alleged contract and any alleged breach. 
This argument fails for two reasons. 
First, Defendant draws the inference that the parties may have entered
into a novation based on a promissory note written in Korean.  (See Demurrer, pp. 6:23-7:9.)  Defendant provides a translation of the note
but that translation is neither authenticated nor does it appear on the face of
or as an attachment to the Complaint.  In
short, the Court cannot tell from the Complaint itself whether the exhibits
render the financial elder abuse claim uncertain. Rather, as discussed above,
Plaintiff has alleged each element to state a cause of action for financial
elder abuse, notwithstanding the exhibits. 
Indeed, the exhibits are not incorporated by reference in the Complaint.
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer to the First Cause of
Action is OVERRULED.
 
Second Cause of Action for Breach of Contract
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of
action are: (1) the existence of a valid contract between the plaintiff and the
defendant, (2) the plaintiff’s performance, (3) the defendant’s unjustified
failure to perform, and (4) damages to the plaintiff caused by the defendant’s
breach.  (CACI No. 303; Careau & Co. v. Security Pacific Business,
Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1388 (Careau); Otworth v.
Southern Pac. Transportation (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458.)  “[T]he
complaint must indicate on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or
implied by conduct.”  (Otworth, supra, 166 Cal.App.3d at pp.
458-459.)  The elements of a breach of
oral contract claim are the same as those for a breach of written contract.  (Careau, supra, 222 Cal.App.3d
at p. 1388.)
 
Defendant argues the Second Cause of Action
fails because (1) it does not allege any of the elements of a breach of
contract claim, and (2) the claim is untimely.
 
Defendant’s first argument
lacks merit.  First, the Complaint indicates
that the parties entered into an oral contract (see Complaint, ¶¶ 10, 19, 22),
that Plaintiff personally loaned $65,945.00 to Defendants between 08/22/2013 to
02/06/2020, (Complaint, ¶ 6), that Defendants promised to repay the loan with
interest until 10/30/2020 (Complaint, ¶ 8), that Defendants did not repay the
loan (Complaint, ¶ 11), and that Defendants’ conduct harmed Plaintiff by
depriving her of a property right (Complaint, ¶ 13).  The Second Cause of Action is sufficiently
pleaded.
 
However, Defendant is correct that the statute of
limitations bars Plaintiff’s Second Cause of Action.  An action based upon the breach of an oral contract
claim must be filed within two years of discovery of the loss or damage
suffered by the aggrieved party.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 339, subd. (1).)  Here, the
Complaint alleges that Defendants promised but did not repay the loan by
October 30, 2020.  Plaintiff filed her
Complaint on November 22, 2022—more than two years later.  Plaintiff’s Second Cause of Action for breach
of oral contract is barred by the statute of limitations.  
 
Plaintiff contends the claim is not time-barred
because Defendants continuously excused repayment of the loan.  However, as alleged, the parties orally
agreed that Defendants would repay the loan by October 30, 2020.  Their failure to do so means Defendants
breached the contract on October 31, 2020. 
Consequently, Plaintiff’s breach of oral contract claim accrued on
October 31, 2022.  There is only one
alleged violation.  As such, the Second
Cause of Action is deficient.  It is not
clear how Plaintiff can cure this defect. 
However, given that Plaintiff has yet to file an amended pleading, the
Court will grant leave to amend.
 
The Demurrer to the Second Cause of Action is
SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
Third Cause of Action for Money Had and Received
and Account Stated
 
 “A cause of action for money had and
received is stated if it is alleged [that] the defendant ‘is indebted to the
plaintiff in a certain sum “for money had and received by the defendant for the
use of the plaintiff.” ’ ...” (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin, supra,¿53
Cal.App.4th at p. 460, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 707, quoting¿Schultz v. Harney¿(1994)
27 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1623, 33 Cal.Rptr.2d 276.)  The claim is viable “ ‘wherever one person has
received money which belongs to another, and which in equity and good
conscience should be paid over to the latter.’ ” (Gutierrez v. Girardi¿(2011)
194 Cal.App.4th 925, 937, 125 Cal.Rptr.3d 210, quoting¿Weiss v. Marcus¿(1975)
51 Cal.App.3d 590, 599, 124 Cal.Rptr. 297.)  As juries are instructed in CACI No. 370, the
plaintiff must prove that the defendant received money “intended to be used for
the benefit of [the plaintiff],” that the money was not used for the
plaintiff's benefit, and that the defendant has not given the money to the
plaintiff.  (Avidor v. Sutter’s Place, Inc. (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th
1439, 1454.)  
 
Defendant argues the Third Cause of Action for
Money Had and Received is barred by the statute of limitations.[3]  Defendant is correct.  Here, the Complaint makes clear that the
Third Cause of Action is based upon Defendants’ failure to repay the $65,945
loan on October 30, 2020.  (See
Complaint, ¶¶ 32, 33.)  As with a breach
of an oral contract, a claim for money had and received must be filed within
two years of the date of discovery.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 339, subd. (1).)  And, as discussed
above, Plaintiff filed her Complaint more than two years after her breach of
contract claim accrued.  
 
Plaintiff’s cause of action for accounts stated
is similarly time-barred.  “An account
stated is an agreement, based on prior transactions between the parties, that
the items of an account are true and that the balance struck is due and owing.
[Citation.] To be an account stated, ‘it must appear that at the time of the
statement an indebtedness from one party to the other existed, that a balance
was then struck and agreed to be the correct sum owing from the debtor to the
creditor, and that the debtor expressly or impliedly promised to pay to the
creditor the amount thus determined to be owing.’ [Citation.]” (Maggio, Inc.
v. Neal (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 745, 752.)
 
“The essential elements of an account stated
are: (1) previous transactions between the parties establishing the
relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement between the parties,
express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to the creditor; (3) a
promise by the debtor, express or implied, to pay the amount due. [Citations.]”
 (Zinn v. Fred R. Bright Co.
(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 597, 600.)  “[A]ny
claim for indebtedness not founded upon a writing is barred by the two-year
statute of limitations.”  (Leighton v.
Forster (2017) 8 Cal. App. 5th 467, 493; Code Civ. Proc., § 339, subd. (1).)
 
In sum, the Demurrer to the Third Cause of
Action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
