APPLICATION
TO BE ADMITTED PRO HAC VICE



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Applicant
Bradley A. Cosman
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On September 21, 2023, Applicant, Bradley A. Cosman, filed this
application to appear pro hac vice on behalf of the court-appointed receiver in
this action.
 
            This
application was heard on October 25, 2023. 
The Court found that Cosman’s application did not comply with the
requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 9.40 because there was no proof
of service by mail of a copy of the application and notice of hearing on the California
State Bar at its San Francisco office.  As such, the Court continued the hearing.
 
            On October
25, 2023, Cosman filed a proof of service by mail of a copy of this application
on the California State Bar.  
 
            The application
is unopposed.
                     
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
            California
Rules of Court, rule 9.40 provides that an attorney in good standing in another
jurisdiction may apply to appear as counsel pro hac vice in the State of
California by filing a verified application together with proof of service by
mail of a copy of the application and notice of hearing on all parties who have
appeared in the case and on the State Bar of California at its San Francisco
office, with payment of a $50.00 fee, so long as that attorney is not a
resident of the State of California, and is not regularly engaged in
substantial business, professional, or other activities in the State of
California.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 9.40.) 
 
            The
application must state: (1) the applicant’s residence and office addresses; (2)
the courts to which the applicant has been admitted to practice and the dates
of admission; (3) that the applicant is a member of good standing in those
courts; (4) that the applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred in any
court; (5) the title of each court and cause in which the applicant has filed
an application to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this state in the preceding
two years, the date of each application, and whether or not it was granted; and
(6) the name, address, and telephone number of the active member of the State
Bar of California who is attorney of record in the local action.  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 9.40(d).) 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Bradely A.
Cosman seeks a court order allowing him to appear as counsel pro hac vice to
represent the court-appointed receiver in this action. 
 
            Upon
review, the Court finds Cosman has corrected the defect noted in the Court’s
previous order.  Specifically, Cosman has
filed a proof of service by mail of this application on the California State
Bar.  The application now complies with California
Rules of Court, rule 9.40.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            Accordingly,
the unopposed application is GRANTED.  It
is ordered that Bradley A. Cosman be admitted to appear as counsel pro hac
vice for the purpose of representing the court-appointed receiver in this
action.  Applicant shall be subject to all applicable rules of this Court.
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
