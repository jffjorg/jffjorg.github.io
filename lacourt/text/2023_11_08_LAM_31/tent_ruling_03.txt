[1] Plaintiff’s Declaration indicates
that Defendant propounded discovery on Plaintiff prior to filing this
Demurrer.  Plaintiff suggests that the
reason for propounding discovery prior to demurring to the Complaint is to
harass and intimidate Plaintiff. 
However, under the Civil Discovery Act, a defendant is authorized to
propound discovery at any time after the action is initiated.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.020, subd. (a);
2031.020, subd. (a); 2033.020, subd. (a) [“A defendant may [propound
interrogatories/make a demand for inspection/make requests for admission] by a
party without leave of court at any time.”].)


[2] Plaintiff’s opposition indicates
she is presently 90 years of age. 
(Opposition, p. 5.)


[3] Defendant also argues that the
“intended for the plaintiff’s benefit” element is not sufficiently alleged.  Defendant points out that Plaintiff allegedly
loaned the money to Defendants so that Defendants could purchase a house.  Under these allegations, the money at issue
was intended for Defendants’ benefit, not Plaintiff’s.
