And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a decision by Judge Kerry Bensinger in a case between Certain Underwriters at Lloyds, London and SHBR Holdings LLC regarding the appointment of an insurance appraisal umpire. The case arises from a fire that damaged a commercial building owned by SHBR Holdings LLC, and the company made a claim against the insurer for losses. The insurer and SHBR Holdings LLC each appointed an appraiser, but the appraisers could not agree on the amount of damage or the selection of an umpire. The insurer filed a petition to appoint an umpire, and the court granted the petition. The court selected five nominees for umpire, including Larry Arnold, Esq., Bryan Phillips, Hon. Joe Hilberman, Adrian D. Filip, A.R.M., and Leslie Steven Marks, Esq. The parties are ordered to select an umpire from the list of nominees within five days, and if they fail to agree, the court will appoint an umpire from the list.
