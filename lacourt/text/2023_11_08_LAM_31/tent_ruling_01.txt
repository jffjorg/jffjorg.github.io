MOTION
TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH DISCOVERY ORDER



 
MOVING PARTY:                     Plaintiff Yuriria Cerez Torres
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant
General Motors LLC 
 
 
I.          Background
 
            This is a “lemon law” action concerning powertrain defects
in a 2020 Chevrolet Traverse (the “Vehicle”).  On August 19, 2021,
Plaintiff, Yuriria Cerezo Torres, filed a Complaint against Defendant, General
Motors LLC, after Defendant failed to repair the Vehicle pursuant to written
expressed warranty for the Vehicle and did not honor its obligations under the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act. 
 
            On May 18,
2023, the Court granted in part Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
further verified responses and documents to Request for Production of Documents,
Set One, Nos. 16 and 19.  Pursuant to
that order, on June 27, 2023, Defendant served unverified further responses and
further produced documents.  Plaintiff
took issue with the further responses and document production and sent
Defendant a meet and confer letter.
 
            On July 27,
2023, after not having received a response to her meet and confer letter,
Plaintiff filed this motion to compel Defendant’s compliance with the Court’s
May 18, 2023, discovery order.  Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions against Defendant.
 
            On October
26, 2023, Defendant filed an opposition. 
The opposition indicates that Defendant served further supplemental
responses on September 14, 2023 that are code compliant.  As such, Defendant contends the motion is
moot.
 
            On November
1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a reply. 
 
                        
II.        Legal Standard
 
            If
a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280
thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying testing, or sampling in
accordance with that party’s statement of compliance, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling compliance.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320,
subd. (a).)   
 
            The
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
Misuses of the discovery process include failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd.
(d).)   
 
III.      Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
is entitled to an order compelling Defendant’s compliance with the Court’s May
18, 2023 discovery order for three reasons. 
First, Defendant did not provide verified further responses on June 27,
2023 (see Motion, Liu Decl., Ex. 2) or September 14, 2023 (see Opposition,
Pappas Decl., Ex A).  “Unsworn responses
are tantamount to no responses at all.”  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
 
            Second,
Defendant did not produce all documents as required by the Court’s May 18, 2023
order.  Generally, a court is at a
tremendous disadvantage in determining whether all responsive documents have
been produced.  Here, however, Plaintiff
provides compelling evidence that responsive documents have not been
produced.  For example, Plaintiff points
out that Defendant produced lists of two engineering works orders concerning
the powertrain defect, but Defendant did not produce the work orders themselves
in their supplement production. 
Plaintiff also argues that Defendant served illegible documents.  Defendant does not counter these points in
their opposition.  
 
            Finally,
Defendant’s further supplemental statement of compliance is not
Code-compliant.  A statement of
compliance under section 2031.220 has two parts: (1) the responding party
“shall state that the production, inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,
and related activity demanded, will be allowed either in whole or in part,” and
(2) “that all documents or things in the demanded category that are in the
possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no objection is
being made will be included in the production.”¿¿¿ Here, in response to
Request for Production, Nos. 16 and 19, Defendant confusingly states that “it
has complied ... in whole” and “that it has complied in part” with the Requests.  Defendant’s further supplemental response
does not state that “all documents or things in the demanded category that are
in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to which no objection
is being made will be included in the production.”  If what Defendant wanted to say was that it
produced all responsive documents and then identified all responsive documents,
it should have done so.  Defendant did
not.  Instead, Defendant’s response is
confusing and not code compliant.
 
IV.       Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED.  Defendant General Motors LLC is ordered to provide
verified, Code-compliant responses and to produce all responsive documents to
Request for Production Nos. 16 and 19 within 10 days of this order.  
 
            Should
Plaintiff assert that Defendant failed to comply within the 10 day period, Plaintiff
may bring a motion for imposition of daily monetary sanctions of $250 per day
for each day of non-compliance.  However,
Plaintiff’s motion must be grounded on specific and discernable grounds, such
as failure to provide verification.      
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
