```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the issue of whether an employee who has a contract that requires them to devote their entire time and attention to their employer's business can recover contractual compensation if they take occasional short absences. The judge cites a California Jurisprudence text and a 1928 court case, Charles T. Powner Co. v. Smith, to support the conclusion that such a contract is not breached by occasional short absences that do not affect the efficiency of the employee's work or result in loss or injury. The judge is tentatively ruling that the employee's occasional short absences do not constitute a breach of contract and therefore, the employee is not entitled to contractual compensation.
