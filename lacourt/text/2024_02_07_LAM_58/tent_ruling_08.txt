            This
action arises from a breach of commercial lease. Plaintiff Maple DTLA, LLC 
(Plaintiff) sued Defendant Shohel
Rana Chuwdry (Defendant) asserting a single cause of action for a breach of contract.
Plaintiff alleges Defendant now owes $98,750.
            
            The
Complaint was filed on June 5, 2023. On August 29, 2023, default was entered against
Defendant Chuwdry. Does 1-30 have been dismissed.
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for entry of default judgment against Defendant. The request for
entry of default judgment is denied. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $144,896.92, which includes $42,316.22 in
interest, $965.70 in costs, and $2,865 in attorney fees. 
 
            Plaintiff
avers that, on June 26, 2015, it entered into a written Standard
Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease (Lease) with Defendant for rental of certain
real property located at 1331 and 1333 Maple Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90015. (Parsakar
Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. A.) Thereafter, starting in January 2020, Defendant fell behind
on the required monthly payments and the total amount of $98,750 is now owed by
Defendant on the Lease. (Parsakar Decl., ¶ 9.) Plaintiff has submitted
sufficient evidence to support the breach of the Lease and the resulting
damages.
 
However, again, the
Court is inclined to find that the calculated pre-judgment interest is inaccurate.
Plaintiff continues to seek interest on the amount of $98,750, accruing at 10% from the date of January 1, 2020 (date of the first breach
of the rental payment) to January 31, 2024. (Shakouri Decl., ¶ 13.) 
 
As a preliminary
matter, the Court agrees that it has “no discretion” in awarding pre-judgment
interest and must do so pursuant to Section 3287, subdivision (a). However, the
full amount of $98,750 was not owed on January 2020, but only became due after
failing to also pay the rents owed from that date up to May 2022. (Parsakar
Decl., ¶ 9.) 
 
In support of its
interest request, Plaintiff cites several cases:  North Oakland Med. Clinic v. Rogers
(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 824, Maurice L. Bein, Inc. v. Housing Authority of
City of Los Angeles (1958) 157 Cal.App.2d 670, and Children's Hosp. and Medical Center v. Bonta (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 740. However, none of these cases address
when interest begins to accrue on the certain amounts. 
 
Instead, the correct
interest calculation begins to accrue when each amount becomes due.
(See Rabinowitch v. California Western Gas Co. (1967) 257 Cal.App.2d 150, 161 [“And when a lease provides for rent in
a certain amount, interest is to be allowed thereon from the due date.”]; Chambers
v. Security Commercial & Sav. Bank (1920) 46 Cal.App. 32, 34.) 
 
For example, Plaintiff
is entitled to interest on $1,800 at 10% from the date of January 1, 2020 (date
of the breach) to January 31, 2024. (Parsakar Decl., ¶ 9 [Line 1].) Plaintiff
is entitled to interest on $4,000 at 10% from the date of January 1, 2020 (date
of the breach) to January 31, 2024. (Parsakar Decl., ¶ 9 [Line 1].)
 
Thus, this
interest calculation posited by Plaintiff is incorrect.
 
Plaintiff also requests
attorney fees in the amount of $2,865, which complies with LASC 3.214. (Shakouri
Decl., ¶ 11.) 
 
Lastly, Plaintiff
substantiates the request for reasonable costs in the amount of $965.70, which
includes $560.70 in clerk’s filing fees, and $405 in service of process fees. (Shakouri
Decl., ¶ 12.)
 
The request for
entry of default judgment is denied.  In
the alternative, the Court will give Plaintiff until February 21, 2024 to submit
a request for interest with all calculations shown in accordance with this
order and the Court will determine whether default judgment may be entered including
interest so calculated.
