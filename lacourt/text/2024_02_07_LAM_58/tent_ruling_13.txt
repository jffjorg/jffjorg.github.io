sentences following this citation state: “An employee whose contract
provides that the employee will devote the employee's entire time and
attention to the employer's business cannot recover contractual compensation
unless the employee has substantially performed this covenant. Such a contract,
however, is not breached by occasional short absences, which occur when the
employee is not needed and which do not affect the efficiency of the employee's
work or result in loss or injury.” (29 Cal. Jur. 3d Employer and Employee § 32
[emphasis added] [footnotes omitted].) Moreover, the secondary
source cited Charles T. Powner Co. v. Smith (1928) 91 Cal.App. 101, 102 involved
a case where the respondent employee’s “work of running the store kept him in
the store from opening to closing time with the exception of an hour off for
lunch. Appellant [employer] brought this action for damages and accounting,
charging that the respondent, in violation of his duties and obligations as an
employee, engaged in buying and selling books on his own account in competition
with and to the neglect and damage of the business and profits of appellant.” (Charles
T. Powner Co. v. Smith (1928) 91 Cal.App. 101, 102.)
