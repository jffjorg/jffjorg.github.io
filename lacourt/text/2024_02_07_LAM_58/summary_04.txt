And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion to strike certain allegations in the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Nejadpour. The motion was granted in part and denied in part. The judge struck allegations that the Plaintiff is a "violent spousal abuser", that the Plaintiff has admitted to making false claims to advantage himself in civil cases, and that the Plaintiff has threatened criminal charges to obtain an advantage in a civil dispute. The judge found these allegations to be irrelevant to the underlying altercation. The Judge denied the Cross-Complainant's request for judicial notice of certain items and did not grant leave to amend the Cross-Complaint.
