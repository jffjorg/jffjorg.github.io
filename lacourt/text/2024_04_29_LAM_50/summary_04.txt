The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the FAC filed by GM. The Court notes that many of the arguments made by GM were already addressed in the Court's December 13, 2023 minute order on GM's demurrer to the original Complaint. Additionally, the Court declines to consider new arguments raised for the first time in GM's reply briefs, citing the principle that such consideration would deprive the opposing party of an opportunity to counter the argument.
