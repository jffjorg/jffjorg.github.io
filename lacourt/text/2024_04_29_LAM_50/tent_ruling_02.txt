that the subject Resident – Facility Arbitration Agreement contains
a blank space in Article 2 of the agreement. (Mi Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.)


[2]In Flores, “Evergreen at San Diego, LLC (Evergreen),
appeal[ed] from an order denying its petition to compel arbitration of the
civil action filed by Luis and Josephina Flores against Evergreen. Luis signed an arbitration agreement when
admitting his wife, Josephina, into Evergreen’s skilled nursing facility.” (Id. at pp. 584-585.) The Court of
Appeal concluded “Luis did not have authority to bind his wife to
the arbitration agreement,” and affirmed the order. (Id.
at p. 585.) The Court of Appeal found that “[e]ven though Evergreen presented evidence showing that Luis acted as if he were
Josephina’s agent, the establishment of the agency also requires conduct on the
part of Josephina conferring that status. It was Evergreen’s burden to show the validity of the
arbitration agreement based on Josephina’s express or implied consent to have
her husband act as her agent. As in Pagarigan, the record is devoid of any such
evidence.” (Id. at p. 589.)
