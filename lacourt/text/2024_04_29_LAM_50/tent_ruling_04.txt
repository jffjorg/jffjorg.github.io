[1]The Court notes
that many of the arguments GM makes in the instant demurrer to the FAC were
addressed in the Court’s December 13, 2023 minute order on GM’s demurrer to the
original Complaint. 


[2]The Court notes
that GM raises a number of arguments for the first time in GM’s reply briefs in
support of the demurrer and motion to strike. The Court notes that “¿[p]oints raised
for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be
considered, because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an
opportunity to counter the argument.¿” (American Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453¿.) Thus, the
Court declines to consider the arguments raised for the first time in GM’s reply
briefs.
