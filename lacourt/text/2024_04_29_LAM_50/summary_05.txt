```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment, citing two defects in the submitted package. First, the plaintiff failed to include an affidavit stating that a copy of the application was mailed to the defendant's attorney of record or the defendant at their last known address, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 587. Second, the plaintiff failed to use the required Form JUD-100 for submitting a proposed judgment. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to resubmit the package in compliance with the court's rules.
