[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff BCS Investment Group, LLC d.b.a. Kaleidoscope Services (“Plaintiff”)
requests entry of default judgment against Defendant SameSky Health Inc.,
formerly known as ConsejoSano, Inc. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total
amount of $159,145.47, comprising $158,497.75 in damages and $647.72 in costs.  
The Court notes a few defects with the submitted default judgment
package.
First,
Item 6 of the Request for Court Judgment (Form CIV-100) is blank. Thus,
it is unclear if the Request was served. 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 587, “[a]n application by a plaintiff for entry of default under
subdivision (a), (b), or (c) of Section 585 or Section 586 shall include an affidavit stating
that a copy of the application has been mailed to the defendant’s attorney of
record or, if none, to the defendant at his or her last known address and the
date on which the copy was mailed. If no such address of the defendant is known
to the plaintiff or plaintiff’s attorney, the affidavit shall state that fact.
No default under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) of Section
585 or Section 586 shall be
entered, unless the affidavit is filed. The nonreceipt of the notice shall not
invalidate or constitute ground for setting aside any judgment.” In Bae v. T.D. Service Co. of Arizona (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 89, 108, footnote 15, the Court observed as follows: 
 
“In a related contention, appellant argues that it was not
obliged to comply with Code of Civil Procedure
section 587 in seeking a default judgment, noting that a defendant
ordinarily is not entitled to notice of proceedings after entry of default (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010). We observe that appellate
courts and treatises have interpreted the phrase “application … for entry of
default” in Code of Civil Procedure section 587 to
include applications for entry of a default judgment. (See Rodriguez, supra,
174 Cal.App.4th at pp. 535–538 [discussing cases]; see also Harris, supra, 74
Cal.App.3d at p. 100 [“The statute provides that no application for
default judgment shall be heard, and no default entered, unless such an
affidavit has been filed.”]; Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2015) ¶ 5:187, p. 5-48 [“As in all
defaults,” an affidavit complying with Code Civ.
Proc., § 587 must be filed with the application for default
judgment.]; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, supra, Proceedings Without Trial, § 162, p. 603 [“A copy of the application for entry of
default or for judgment on the default must be mailed to the defendant’s
attorney of record ….”]; 6 Witkin, Cal.
Procedure, supra, § 164,
p. 605.)” 
Second, Plaintiff submitted a
specially prepared proposed judgment and did not use Form JUD-100. The Court
will require the use of Form JUD-100 because this does not appear to be a case
where a lengthy or detailed judgment is necessary. (See LASC Rule 3.213(b).)

Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for default judgment
without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a schedule for
resubmission of the default judgment package.
