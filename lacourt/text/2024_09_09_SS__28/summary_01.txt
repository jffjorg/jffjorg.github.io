And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor plaintiff Toahiti Chong's action, filed by petitioner Darlene Chong. The petition seeks to approve the settlement agreement, which includes a gross settlement amount of $300,000 and a net settlement amount of $202,724.97. However, the petition does not provide sufficient information about the payment and waiver of medical expenses, which remain unaccounted for in the amount of $17,045.09. The judge cannot approve the petition until this information is provided, as it is necessary to ensure that all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.
