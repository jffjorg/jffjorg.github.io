The court, on motion, may relieve  that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,  2031.240, and 2031.280.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party making the demand may move for an order  compelling response to the demand.  “(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust.

The court, on motion, may relieve that  party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following  conditions are satisfied:  “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that  is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and  2030.240.  “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response  was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  “(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may  move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.  “(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition  of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010).”  (Code Civ.

It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction  under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or  both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission  necessitated this motion.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)  D.      Depositions  Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in  part:  “(a) If,  after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,  director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an  organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a  valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to  proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically  stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the  party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s  attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,  electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the  deposition notice.  “(b) A motion  under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:  “(1) The  motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the  production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,  or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.  “(2) The  motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section  2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the  documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the  deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted  the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.  * * *  “(g) (1) If a  motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the  party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with  whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to  the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances  make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b),  (g)(1).)   DISCUSSION  A.   Defendant’s requests for production of documents   On  September 26, 2023, Defendant served request for production of documents, set  one, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not serve  timely responses and had not served responses by the time Defendant filed this motion  to compel responses to requests for production of documents.  The Court grants the motion and orders Plaintiff to  serve verified, code-compliant responses to the requests for production of  documents without objections and to produce the documents, electronically  stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by October  7, 2024.   B.   Defendant’s form interrogatories  On  September 26, 2023, Defendant served form interrogatories, set one. on  Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not serve  timely responses and had not served responses by the time Defendant filed this  motion to compel responses to form interrogatories.  The  Court grants the motion and orders Plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant  responses to the form interrogatories without objections by October 7, 2024.  C.   Defendant’s requests for admission  On April  22, 2024, Defendant served requests for  admission, set one, on Plaintiff.   Plaintiff did not provide timely responses and had not provided  responses by the time Defendant filed this motion to deem admitted the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any  matters specified in the requests.            The Court grants Defendant’s motion and deems admitted the genuineness of any documents and the truth of  any matters specified in the requests for admission.  D.   Defendant’s deposition notice            On April 22, 2024, Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition  for May 22, 2024.  Plaintiff did not  object to the deposition notice and did not appear for the noticed deposition.  Defendant took a certificate of  non-appearance.  Defendant has submitted  a meet and confer declaration.            The Court grants Defendant’s motion and orders Plaintiff to  appear for a deposition by October 7, 2024.  E.   Sanctions  1.       Motions to compel     Defendant  requests sanctions on the motions to compel responses to the request for  production of documents and form interrogatories.  Under Code of Civil Procedure sections  2030.290 and 2031.300, the Court shall impose a monetary sanction against any  party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to  compel a response to interrogatories or a demand for inspection unless the  Court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction  unjust.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§  2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for  inspection].)  Plaintiff  did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or a  demand for inspection. Therefore, sanctions are not available under Code of  Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300.  Other  statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,  authorize a sanctions award for these motions.   In City of Los Angeles v. Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (Aug. 23,  2024) __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042, 2024 DJDAR 8056, slip opn. pp. 1-42] (PwC),  the Supreme Court held: “It is already well-established that a court may not  rely on [Code of Civil Procedure] section 2023.030 to override the limitations  prescribed by any other applicable sanctions provision in the Act. A court may  invoke its independent authority to impose sanctions under sections 2023.010  and 2023.030 only when confronted with an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a  pattern of abuse, not already addressed by a relevant sanctions provision. And  where it invokes that authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules  generally governing the imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, __ Cal.5th __  [2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066, slip opn. at p. 40].)  Code  of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300,  subdivision (c), limit the Court’s authority to impose sanctions when (as here)  the non-moving party does not oppose a successful motion to compel responses to  interrogatories or inspection demands.   Because these statutes address the issue, the Court may not invoke its  independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure  sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (See PwC,  supra, __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066,  slip opn. at p. 40].)  2.    Motion to deem matters admitted            Sanctions are mandatory when the Court grants a motion  under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280.   Defendants requests $250.00 in sanctions based on one hour of attorney  time at a rate of $250.00 per hour.  The  Court grants the request.  3.    Motion to compel deposition  Defendant  requests sanctions of $1,455.00 based on the costs of the certificate of non-appearance.  The Court grants the request under Code of  Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Defendant City of Santa Monica’s motion to compel  Plaintiff Alvin Pruitt’s  responses to request for production of documents, set one, and orders Plaintiff  Alvin Pruitt to serve  verified, code-compliant responses to the requests for production of documents  without objections and to produce the documents, electronically stored  information, and/or other things requested without objections by October 7,  2024.  The Court GRANTS Defendant  City of Santa Monica’s motion to compel Plaintiff Alvin Pruitt’s responses to  form interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Alvin Pruitt to serve  verified, code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without  objections by October 7, 2024.  The Court GRANTS Defendant City of Santa Monica’s  motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one,  served on Plaintiff Alvin Pruitt and deems admitted the  genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the  requests for admission.  The Court GRANTS Defendant City of Santa Monica’s  motion to compel Plaintiff Alvin Pruitt’s attendance and testimony at a  deposition and orders Plaintiff Alvin Pruitt to attend a deposition by October  7, 2024.  The Court GRANTS in part Defendant City of Santa  Monica’s requests for sanctions and orders Plaintiff Alvin Pruitt to pay  Defendant City of Santa Monica $1,705.00 by October 7, 2024.  In all other respects, the Court DENIES the  sanctions requests.  Moving  party is to give notice of the Court’s ruling.  Moving  party is to file proof of service of the Court’s ruling within five days.
