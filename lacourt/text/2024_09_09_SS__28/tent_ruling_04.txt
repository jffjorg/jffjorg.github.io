SANTOS DEFENDANT’S REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
Denied. 
LEGAL STANDARD 

Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.220 provides:  
“(a) In any
case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal injuries, any
defendant may demand one physical examination of the plaintiff, if both of the
following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The
examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful,
protracted, or intrusive. 
“(2) The
examination is conducted at a location within 75 miles of the residence of the
examinee. 
“(b) A
defendant may make a demand under this article without leave of court after
that defendant has been served or has appeared in the action, whichever occurs
first. 
“(c) A demand
under subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope,
and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if
any, of the physician who will perform the examination. 
“(d) A
physical examination demanded under subdivision (a) shall be scheduled for a
date that is at least 30 days after service of the demand. On motion of the
party demanding the examination, the court may shorten this time. 
“(e) The
defendant shall serve a copy of the demand under subdivision (a) on the
plaintiff and on all other parties who have appeared in the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.250
provides in part: 
“If a defendant who has demanded a physical
examination under this article, on receipt of the plaintiff’s response to that
demand, deems that any modification of the demand, or any refusal to submit to
the physical examination is unwarranted, that defendant may move for an order
compelling compliance with the demand. This motion shall be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2032.250, subd. (a).) 

DISCUSSION         
A.   Plaintiff’s residence 
On
May 21, 2024, the Santos Defendants served a demand for physical examination on
Plaintiff.  The examination was
scheduled for June 24, 2024, at 12:00 noon with Scott Lederhaus, M.D., whose
specialty is neurosurgery, at Medical Review
Associates, 555 E. Ocean Blvd., Suite 500, Long Beach, CA 90802.         
          On May 24, 2024, Plaintiff served an objection stating that his residence is more than 75 miles from the examination
location.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.220, subd. (a)(2).)  Plaintiff refused to attend the scheduled examination. 
          The Santos Defendants now move to compel Plaintiff’s
attendance at a physical examination with Dr. Lederhaus at Medical Review
Associates, 555 E. Ocean Blvd., Suite 500, Long Beach, CA 90802.  The Santos Defendants dispute Plaintiff’s
assertion that he lives more than 75 miles from the examination location. According
to the Santos Defendants, the first amended complaint concedes that Plaintiff
lives in Los Angeles. 
In
fact, the first amended complaint alleges that “At all times material hereto, [Plaintiff]
was an individual who resided within the County of Los Angeles, State of
California.”  (First Amended Complaint ¶
2.)  The first amended complaint goes on
to allege facts about events that took place “[o]n or about December 20, 2021.”
(First Amended Complaint ¶ 10.)  Therefore,
the first amended complaint alleges, at most, that Plaintiff resided in Los
Angeles County on or about December 20, 2021. 
The Santos Defendants have not shown that Plaintiff currently lives in
Los Angeles. 
B.   The motion is untimely 
Plaintiff
argues that the Santos Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff’s examination was
set for hearing after the discovery cut-off date, making it untimely.  Plaintiff is correct.  
On
September 30, 2022, the Court issued a notice of case assignment scheduling the
trial for March 29, 2024. 
On
March 5, 2024, based on the parties’ stipulation, the Court continued the trial
to July 24, 2024 and ruled that discovery and related dates would be based on
the new trial date. 
On
July 24, 2024, the Court continued the trial to November 5, 2024 based on the
parties’ stipulation but did not extend or reopen discovery. 
As a
result of these orders, the cut-off date for discovery motions is July 9, 2024
(15 days before July 24, 2024).  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a) ["Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action"].)  The Santos
Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff's physical examination was initially set for hearing on August 8, 2024, after the
cut-off date.  
The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES the motion filed by Defendants Dawn Renaye
Murray-Santos and Mike Santos to compel Plaintiff Nicholas Johnson to attend a
physical examination with Scott Lederhaus, M.D. at Medical Review Associates,
located at 555 E. Ocean Blvd., Suite 500, Long Beach, CA 90802. 
          Moving parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
          Moving parties are ordered to file the proof of service of
this ruling within five days.
