  Case Number:  20STCV48628    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  28           Having considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules
as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
December 21, 2020, Plaintiff Toahiti Chong (“Plaintiff”), a minor, by and
through his guardian ad litem Darlene Chong, filed this action against
Defendants City of Los Angeles, Blueberry & Chicken, LLC, and Does 1-25 for
general negligence and premises liability. 
On
February 10, 2021, Defendant Blueberry & Chicken, LLC filed an answer. 
On
February 24, 2023, the Court dismissed Defendant Blueberry & Chicken LLC
without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
December 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
July 31, 2024, Petitioner Darlene Chong (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to
approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff’s action.  The petition was set for hearing on September
9, 2024.  
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff
Toahiti Chong. 
DISCUSSION 
The
petition includes the following information: 
Gross
settlement amount:                                        $300,000.00
Total
medical expenses:                                            $142,315.54
Reductions:                                                              $123,289.71

Amount
paid:                                                           $17,045.09
To
be paid/reimbursed from proceeds:                     $1,980.74
Liens:                                                                       $0
Attorney’s
fees:                                                        $90,000.00
Costs:                                                                      
 $5,294.29
Net
settlement amount:                                             $202,724.97 
Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $142,315.54.  Section 12a(3) states that this amount was
subject to $123,289.71 in reductions. 
This should mean that the remaining amount ($19,025.83) is to be
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
However, Section 12a(4) states that $1,980.74 is to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  As a result, $17,045.09 in medical expenses remain
unaccounted for. 
Section
12a(2) states that $17,045.09 in medical expenses were paid but the petition
does not state who paid the medical expenses or whether the person or entity
who paid the medical expenses has agreed to waive its right to be reimbursed
for the payment.  The Court cannot
approve a petition unless it shows that all medical expenses that have not been
waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of minor
Plaintiff Toahiti Chong’s action filed by Petitioner Darlene Chong on July 31,
2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
