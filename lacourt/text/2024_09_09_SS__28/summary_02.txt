```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by Plaintiff Adela Bautista Hernandez to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission served on Defendant Dean Enterprises. The plaintiff is seeking to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission and to impose sanctions on the defendant for failing to serve timely verified responses. The defendant has not filed an opposition to the motion. The judge notes that the plaintiff's motion does not state whether the defendant served unverified responses, which are appropriate in some cases. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has not established that the defendant failed to serve timely verified responses and denies the motion. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
