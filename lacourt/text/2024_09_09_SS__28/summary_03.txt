Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying Paris Page's motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Ryon Peck. The motion was not properly filed, as it did not include a proposed order on the required form (MC-053) and did not provide proof of service on all parties who have appeared in the case. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice. The judge orders Paris Page to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the court within five days.
