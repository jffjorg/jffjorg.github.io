The Court has considered the motions filed by the County of Los Angeles to compel the Plaintiff, Julie Jaleh Sabaierad, to provide further responses to discovery requests. The Court has also considered the opposition and reply filed by the parties. The Court has determined that the County's motions are timely and that the Plaintiff's discovery responses are incomplete and evasive. Therefore, the Court grants the County's motions to compel further responses to discovery requests. The Court orders the Plaintiff to provide further verified, code-compliant responses to the discovery requests by September 30, 2024. The Court also awards the County $690.00 in sanctions and orders the Plaintiff and her counsel to pay the County $120.00 in filing fees. The Court denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions.
