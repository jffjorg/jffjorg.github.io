And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion by plaintiff's counsel to be relieved as counsel in the case involving plaintiff S.B. against Los Angeles Unified School District, Principal Gabriel Arreguin, and others. The motion was denied without prejudice, meaning it can be refiled. The judge noted several issues with the motion, including that the notice of motion and motion did not specify which attorneys were seeking to be relieved as counsel, and that the proof of service did not show service on all parties who have appeared in the action. The judge ordered counsel to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
