 Case Number:  23STCV00997    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as  follows.  BACKGROUND  On January  17, 2023, Plaintiff Julie Jaleh Sabaierad (“Plaintiff’)  filed this action against Defendants County of Los Angeles (“County”), Esayas  Alemu (“Alemu”), and Does 1-100 for negligence.  On  February 21, 2023, the County and Alemu filed answers.  On July  3, 2024, the County filed a motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to  requests for production of documents, set one, special interrogatories, set  one, and form interrogatories, set one.   (The County should have filed three separate motions, one for each type  of discovery.)  The County also requested  sanctions.  The motion was set for  hearing on August 7, 2024.  On July 25,  2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition and request for sanctions.  On July 31, 2024, the County filed a  reply.  The Court continued the hearing  to September 9, 2024.  PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS  A.      Informal Discovery Conference  The  Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts  Effective October 10, 2022 (Filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub  Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery  until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion  to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and  complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses  to Discovery.”  The  parties participated in an IDC on July 2, 2024.  B.       Timeliness of motion  1.    45-days after service of verified responses  A  notice of motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of  the service of the verified responses, or any supplemental verified responses,  or on or before any later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c) [demand for inspection]; Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (c) [interrogatories].)   Failure to file a motion by this deadline constitutes a waiver of any  right to compel further responses.  Plaintiff's responses were not properly verified because Plaintiff purported to verify them on "information and belief."  (See below.)  Therefore, the 45-day deadline did not apply.  Even if the 45-day deadline applied, the  County filed its motion within 45 days of Plaintiff’s supplemental responses.  2.    Discovery motion cut-off deadline  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2024.020 provides:  “(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, any  party shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings  on or before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or  before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action.  “(b) Except as provided in Section 2024.050, a  continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen  discovery proceedings.  (Code Civ. Proc., §  2024.020.)  On  June 14, 2024, Defendants filed an ex parte application to continue the trial  and related dates.  The Court  granted the application in part and continued the trial from July 16, 2024 to  August 15, 2024. The Court ruled that discovery and related dates would remain  associated with the July 16, 2024 trial date absent a stipulation or a noticed  motion to reopen discovery.  On  July 24,2024, Defendants filed another ex parte application, asking the Court  to continue the trial to February 14, 2025 and reopen discovery and related  dates.  Defendants observed that their  motion to compel further discovery was set for August 7, 2024, after the  cut-off date.  The  Court granted the ex parte application in part and continued the trial to  October 2, 2024.  The Court denied  without prejudice the request to reopen discovery and related dates with the  exception of Defendants' motion to compel further discovery, which the  Court agreed to consider on August 7, 2024 or as soon thereafter as the Court's  calendar allowed.  Due to the Court’s  impacted calendar, the Court continued the hearing to September 9, 2024.   Therefore,  contrary to Plaintiff’s contention, the County’s motion to compel further  responses does not violate Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020, subdivision (a).  C.   Meet and confer  A  motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or interrogatories  must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil  Procedure section 2016.040.  (See Code  Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd (b)(2) [demand for inspection]; Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (b)(1) [interrogatories].)   “A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts  showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each  issue presented by the motion.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)   The  parties have met and conferred.  D.      Separate statement  With  exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,  requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate  statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of  factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is  warranted.   The  County has filed a separate statement.  APPLICABLE LAW  A.   Verification  Discovery  responses must be signed under oath by the party to whom they are directed.  (See L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice  Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 8:11102, p. 8F-50  [interrogatories], ¶8:1477, p. 8H-33 [inspection demands] (Cal. Practice Guide).)  However,  “[a] verification on behalf of an individual stating ‘I am informed and believe  that the matters stated herein are true’ is insufficient.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:1104,  p. 8F-51.)  B.   Demand for inspection  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 provides in part:  “(a) On receipt of a response to a demand for  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an  order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems  that any of the following apply:  “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is  incomplete.  “(2) A representation of inability to comply is  inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.  “(3) An objection in the response is without merit or  too general.  “(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with  each of the following:  “(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing  good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  “(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and  confer declaration under Section 2016.040.  “(3) In lieu of a separate statement required under  the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a  concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.  “(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45  days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified  response, or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party  and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any  right to compel a further response to the demand.  * * *   “(h) Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court  shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1031.310,  subds. (a), (b), (c), (h).)  C.   Interrogatories  Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides in  part:  “(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the  propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the  propounding party deems that any of the following apply:  “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is  evasive or incomplete.  “(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents  under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those  documents is inadequate.  “(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit  or too general.  “(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be  accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.  “(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under  the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a  concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.  “(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45  days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified  response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding  party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party  waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.  “(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under  Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or  attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further  response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make  the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,  subds. (a), (b), (c), (d).)   DISCUSSION  A.   The County’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s  further responses to request for production of documents, set one  Served:                                         January  19, 2024                                             Responses:                                  March  12, 2024                                            Further responses:                      April 29, 2024, June  26, 2024           Motion filed:                            July 3, 2024            Granted:  All          B.   The County’s  motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to special interrogatories, set  one  Served:                                       January 19, 2024                                  Responses:                                  March  12, 2024                                                     Further responses:                      April 29, 2024, June  26, 2024 Motion filed:                              July 3, 2024 Granted:  All     D.   The County’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further  responses to form interrogatories, set one  Served:                           January 19, 2024 Responses:                 March 12, 2024                                                                                                 Further  response                     April 29, 2024, May  28, 2024 Motion  filed:                          July  3, 2024                                 Granted:   All   E.   Sanctions   The  County requests $2,880.00 or $3,105.00 in sanctions based on 13.5 hours of  attorney time at a rate of $230.00 per hour.   Counsel spent six hours to prepare the motion and one and a half hours  to draft the supporting declaration.   Counsel estimated spending four to prepare a reply and two  hours to prepare for and attend the hearing.  The  Court awards the County $690.00 in sanctions.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Defendant County of Los Angeles’s  motion to compel Plaintiff Julie Jaleh Sabaierad to provide further responses  to request for production of documents, set one.  The Court orders Plaintiff Julie Jaleh  Sabaierad to provide further verified, code-compliant responses to request for  production of document numbers 11, 18, 21, and 29 and to produce the documents,  electronically stored information, and/or other things requested by September 30,  2024.  The Court also orders Plaintiff  Julie Jaleh Sabaierad to provide a code-compliant verification.  The Court GRANTS Defendant County of Los Angeles’s  motion to compel Plaintiff Julie Jaleh Sabaierad to provide further responses  to special interrogatories, set one.  The  Court orders Plaintiff Julie Jaleh Sabaierad to provide further verified,  code-compliant responses to special interrogatories, set one, numbers 2, 5, 9,  12, 13, 15, 16, and 33, by September 30, 2024.   The Court also orders Plaintiff Julie Jaleh Sabaierad to provide a  code-compliant verification.  The  Court GRANTS Defendant County of Los Angeles’s motion to compel Plaintiff Julie  Jaleh Sabaierad to provide further responses to form interrogatories, set  one.  The Court orders Plaintiff Julie  Jaleh Sabaierad to provide further verified, code-compliant responses to form  interrogatories, set one, numbers 9.2 and 10.1, by September 30, 2024.  The Court also orders Plaintiff Julie Jaleh  Sabaierad to provide a code-compliant verification.  The  Court GRANTS in part Defendant County of Los Angeles’s request  for sanctions and orders Plaintiff Julie  Jaleh Sabaierad and her counsel to pay Defendant County of Los Angeles $690.00  in sanction by September 30, 2024.  In  all other respects, the Court DENIES Defendant County of Los Angeles’s request  for sanctions.  The  Court DENIES Plaintiff Julie Jaleh Sabaierad’s request for sanctions.  The  Court ORDERS Defendant County of Los Angeles to pay the Court two additional  filing fees of $60.00, for a total of $120.00, by September 30, 2024.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
