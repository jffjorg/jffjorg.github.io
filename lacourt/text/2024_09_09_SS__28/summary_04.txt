And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to compel plaintiff Nicholas Johnson's attendance at a physical examination with Dr. Scott Lederhaus at Medical Review Associates in Long Beach, California. The motion was filed by Defendants Dawn Renaye Murray-Santos and Mike Santos. The judge has denied the motion.

The judge's decision is based on the fact that the Santos Defendants' motion is untimely. The cut-off date for discovery motions was July 9, 2024, and the motion was initially set for hearing on August 8, 2024, after the cut-off date. Additionally, the judge has found that the Santos Defendants have not shown that plaintiff currently resides in Los Angeles, as alleged in the first amended complaint. The judge has also noted that plaintiff's objection to the physical examination was based on the fact that his residence is more than 75 miles from the examination location, which the judge has found to be a valid objection.
