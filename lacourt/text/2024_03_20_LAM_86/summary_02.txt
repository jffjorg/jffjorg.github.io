The judge is considering a tentative ruling regarding a lawsuit filed by United Caltrans Tenants (UCT) against the California Department of Transportation (CDT). The dispute centers around the wording of a judgment and the application of the catalyst theory. The court finds that UCT's lawsuit helped catalyze the legislative change at issue and conferred a significant benefit on a large class of persons. The court also finds that UCT is entitled to attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 based on the legislative changes related to inflation-adjusted prices. The court notes that Respondent's argument is not relevant or persuasive and that the legislative change was enacted despite Respondent's opposition. The court will issue a final ruling after considering further briefing and argument.
