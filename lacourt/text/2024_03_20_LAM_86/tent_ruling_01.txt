[Tentative]       ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES  
 
 
Petitioners,
Angela Flores, Marysia Wojick and Priscela Izquierdo, move for an award of trial
and appellate court attorneys’ fees against Respondent, Department of
Transportation of the State of California, in the amount of $320,208.
Respondent opposes the motion. 
 
Petitioners’
request for judicial notice (RJN) of their exhibits 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 and
13 is granted. (See Exhibit List 3:19-22.) 

 
Petitioners also
include various requests for judicial notice in their motion and reply brief,
but they have not submitted copies of the materials for which judicial notice
is requested. (See Memo 4:6-7 and Reply 2:14-3:10, 4:16-23.) Those requests are
denied. (See Cal. Rules of Court (CRC), Rule 3.1306, subd. (c). [“A party requesting
judicial notice of material under Evidence Code sections 452 or 453 must
provide the court and each party with a copy of the material.”] See also Evid.
Code, § 453.)
 
Respondent’s RJN of its exhibits A through K is granted.
Petitioners’ objection to Exhibits H and K is overruled. (Reply 5:17.)    
 
Petitioners’ objections to the declarations of Andrea Maehara
and Eliza Kegeyan and Respondent’s exhibits 1 and 2 are overruled. (Reply
6-7.)  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
“Upon motion, a court
may award attorneys’ fees to a successful party . . . in any action which has
resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest
if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been
conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, (b) the necessity
and financial burden of private enforcement, or of enforcement by one public
entity against another public entity, are such as to make the award
appropriate, and (c) such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid
out of the recovery, if any.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.5.)  
 
Successful
Party
 
“When
it comes to section 1021.5,
the successful party is ‘the party to litigation that achieves its objectives.’
” (La Mirada Avenue Neighborhood Assn. of Hollywood v. City of Los
Angeles (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1149, 1157.) “A party seeking an award
of section 1021.5 attorney
fees must ‘prevail’ or be ‘successful,’ which generally involves obtaining a
favorable judicial decision, i.e., a judicially sanctioned or recognized change
in the legal relationship of the parties.” 
(Marine Forests Society v. California Coastal Com. (2008) 160
Cal.App.4th 867, 877.)  
 
“
‘[A] party need not prevail on every claim presented in an action in order to
be considered a successful party within the meaning of the section.’ [Citation.] Rather,
‘when a plaintiff is successful within the meaning of the section, the fact
that he or she has prevailed on some claims but not on others is a factor
to be considered in determining the amount of the fee awarded.’ ” (Bowman v.
City of Berkeley (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 173, 177.)  
 
Here,
the trial court (Judge James Chalfant) denied the petition and entered judgment
in favor of Respondent on November 24, 2020. The court concluded “mandamus will
not lie to compel [Respondent] to offer the properties to Petitioners at any
price other than the inflation adjusted price.” (Resp. RJN Exh. D.)
 
Petitioners
appealed the judgment. “In July 2021, while [the] appeal was pending, the
California Legislature amended [Government Code] section 54237.9 by
adding a sentence precluding adjustment for inflation.” (Flores v. Dept. of
Transp. (2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 678, 680.) The Court of Appeal concluded the then
current version of Government Code section 54237.9 applied to Petitioners’
appeal because, in suits for mandamus and injunctive relief, the Court applies
the law currently in effect at the time of the appellate decision. (Id.
at 682-683.) Accordingly, the Court reversed the judgment and remanded for the
trial court to apply the current version of Government Code section 54237.9
in adjudicating the petition. (Id. at 684.)
 
When remanding the matter to this
court for further proceedings, the Court of Appeal stated: 
 
It is unclear whether our holding that the
sales price is to be calculated utilizing the revised language in section 54237.9 means the parties will agree on the
calculation. It is appropriate for the trial court to consider in the first
instance what new calculations are compelled by our decision. Appellants have
also requested that we determine attorneys’ fees and costs. We leave that
determination and calculation to the trial court as the prevailing party has
changed.” (Id. at 684 [emphasis added]; see also Resp. RJN Exh. F.) 
 
In addition, the Court of Appeal awarded Petitioners “their
costs on appeal.” (Ibid.) (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 8.278, subd.
(a)(1), (2) [prevailing party “entitled to costs on appeal”].)
 
On
remand, the parties filed additional legal briefing. The court conducted a
hearing on the petition on January 25, issued a traditional writ of mandate and
ordered a return on the writ within 90 days. On August 25, 2023, the court
entered judgment granting the petition for writ of mandate in favor of
Petitioners.[1]
The judgment ordered Respondent to “re-calculate the sales price for each
property where each petitioner[] resides in compliance with the Roberti Law and
applicable regulations, and [Respondent] shall not make any adjustment for
inflation in the price calculations.” (Judgment filed 8/25/23 and Resp. RJN
Exh. E.)  
 
Through
their petition, Petitioners sought a writ directing Respondent to “re-calculate
the sales price in compliance with the Roberti Law and Roberti Regulations and
not utilize in any manner an ‘inflation adjusted price.’ ” (SAP Prayer ¶ 7.) Petitioners
alleged Respondent’s attempts to impose an “inflation adjusted price”
conflicted with the Roberti Law. (Id. ¶¶ 35-58.)  Throughout the petition, Petitioners sought
injunctive and writ relief barring Respondent from applying any “inflation
adjusted price” formula to the determination of price under the Roberti Law. (See
SAP ¶¶ 101-102, 144, 153 and Prayer ¶ 7.) Thus, Petitioners achieved one of their
primary litigation objectives in this proceeding—they obtained an order
precluding Respondent from imposing an inflation adjusted price on the homes
Petitioners sought to purchase from Respondent. 

 
Despite
Petitioners having achieved their litigation goal in this proceeding, Respondents
assert “[b]ecause the issue of whether Caltrans could adjust the affordable
sales price for inflation was rendered moot by the passage of SB 51,
petitioners must establish that their lawsuit was the catalyst that motivated [Respondent]
to provide the change in the affordable purchase price under the Roberti Act
and that petitioners reasonably attempted to settle the litigation prior to the
filing of the lawsuit.” (Opposition 6:21-24.) 

 
“The
‘catalyst theory’ permits an award of attorney fees even when the litigation
does not result in a judicial resolution if the defendant changes its behavior
substantially because of, and in the manner sought by, the litigation.
[Citation.] To obtain attorney fees under this theory, a plaintiff must
establish that (1) the lawsuit was a catalyst motivating the defendants to
provide the primary relief sought; (2) the lawsuit had merit and achieved its
catalytic effect by threat of victory, not by dint of nuisance and threat of
expense; and (3) the plaintiffs reasonably attempted to settle the litigation
prior to filing the lawsuit.” (California
Public Records Research, Inc. v. County of Yolo (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 150,
191 [emphasis added].)  
 
The
court does not agree Petitioners are limited to pursuing their attorneys’ fees
through the catalyst theory of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. The
Court of Appeal reversed the trial court’s decision and noted Petitioners were
the prevailing party. Through their petition, Petitioners specifically sought
to enjoin Respondents from applying any “inflation adjusted price” formula to
the three properties at issue. Petitioners achieved that objective when the
Legislature amended Government Code section 54237.9, the Court of Appeal found it applied to the dispute before
it and reversed the trial court’s judgment in favor of Respondents. Further, this
court granted the petition in favor of Petitioners on remand. Thus, this
proceeding resulted in a “judicial resolution” in favor of Petitioners on a
specific claim alleged in the petition.  
 
The
court acknowledges Petitioners may have prevailed at the Court of Appeal and on
remand, at least in part, as a result of legislative changes, i.e. the passage
of Senate Bill (SB) 51. However, Respondents cite no authority suggesting a
petitioner who has obtained a judgment in his/her favor as a result of a
legislative change—i.e., “a judicially sanctioned or recognized change in the
legal relationship of the parties,” (see Marine Forests Society v.
California Coastal Com., supra, 160 Cal.App.4th at 877)—must rely on the
catalyst theory to prove a petitioner was a successful party within the meaning
of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. The plain language of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021.5 does not preclude a party from being “successful” if
the party somehow obtained a favorable judgment as a result of a legislative
change.
 
The
passage of SB 51 may be relevant to the court’s consideration of whether this
litigation, as opposed to SB 51 or the prior writ petition filed by United
Caltrans Tenants (UCT),[2] conferred
a substantial benefit on the general public or a large class of persons.
However, on this briefing, the court concludes Petitioners are successful
parties within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 in this
proceeding because they prevailed, in part, on their petition for writ of
mandate.[3]
 
Enforcement
of Important Right Affecting the Public Interest[4]
 
“The first prong of the section 1021.5 test . . . requires a determination of ‘the ‘strength’ or
‘societal importance’ of the right involved.” (Roybal v. Governing Bd. of Salinas City Elementary School Dist. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1143, 1148.)
 
This action enforced the Roberti Act,
Government Code section 54235, et seq., which governs the sale of
surplus residential property within the state route 710 corridor. The Roberti
Act “is intended to
benefit persons and families subject to displacement and persons and families
of low or moderate income” and “shall be liberally construed to permit such
persons or families to enforce the rights, duties, and benefits created by the
article.” (Gov. Code, §
54238.5.) The court concludes this proceeding enforced important rights
affecting the public interest as set forth in the Roberti Act. Respondents
develop no argument to the contrary.  
 
Significant Public Benefit Conferred
on General Public or a Large Class of Persons[5] 
 
To obtain an award under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021.5, a party must also show its action conferred a
significant public benefit on the general public or on a large class of
persons.  A significant benefit may be
pecuniary or non-pecuniary and need not be concrete to support a fee award. (Braude v. Automobile Club of Southern
California (1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 994, 1013.)
 
“The trial court determines the
significance of the benefit, and the group receiving it, ‘from a realistic
assessment, in light of all the pertinent circumstances, of the gains which
have resulted in a particular case. The courts are
not required to narrowly construe the significant benefit factor. ‘The ‘extent
of the public benefit need not be great to justify an attorney fee[s] award.’
And fees may not be denied merely because the primary effect of the litigation
was to benefit the individual rather than the public.” (Indio
Police Command Unit Association v. City of Indio (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th
521, 543.) 
 
The court approaches Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021.5 in a practical and equitable way: “[U]tilizing its traditional
equitable discretion, [the court] must realistically assess the litigation and
determine from a practical perspective whether the statutory criteria have been
met.”  (Marine
Forests Society v. California Coastal Com., supra, 160
Cal.App.4th at 876.)
 
Here, the judgment and writ directly benefit
only Petitioners. However, Petitioners (and Respondents) also argue “[t]his
lawsuit was at least part of the rationale for the introduction and passage of
SB 51 (State 2021 Ch. 130). Section 4 of the law added 54237.9 to the statu[t]e,
banning inflation adjustments.” (Memo 3:20-22.) Relatedly, Petitioners argue “[b]ut
for this lawsuit, there would be no public attention to the Caltrans practice,
and when the court ruled against petitioners the need for legislation became
clear. It was always the intent of the Roberti Law to provide for affordable
housing (Govt. Code § 54235 ).” (Memo 1:19-21.)
 
The legislative history of SB 51
supports Petitioners’ position this writ proceeding conferred a substantial
benefit on the public or a large class of persons. Specifically, in 2021, a
senate committee staff report for SB 51 states: 
 
Caltrans is currently in the process of amending its ASP
regulations related to SR 710 property sales to clarify the minimum sales price
of the properties and to address lessons learned during the first phase of
sales, in which 42 properties in the corridor were offered for sale in December
of 2016. During Phase I, Caltrans set the minimum sales price at the original
acquisition price, adjusted for inflation, and was subsequently sued over the
inflation adjusted pricing. The initial lawsuit resulted in the Department
adopting emergency regulations to implement the inflation adjusted pricing. A
subsequent lawsuit promptly challenged the emergency regulations. Caltrans
prevailed in that lawsuit in October 2020 and is now in the process of amending
the regulations to permanently adopt the inflation adjusted pricing.
 
This
bill would reverse this action by explicitly prohibiting Caltrans from
adjusting the original purchase price for inflation when offering surplus
properties for sale pursuant to the Roberti Act. . . .
 
(Sutton
Decl. Exh. 3 at pp. 4-5.)[6]  
 
This statement in the legislative
history of SB 51 strongly suggests Petitioners’ writ petition was, at least in
part, a motivating factor for the legislature to amend the Roberti Law to
prohibit Respondent from adjusting the original purchase price for inflation. Respondent
does not cite any legislative history that conflicts with this reasonable
inference.
 
Further, in addition to this statement
in the legislative history, the timing of events strongly supports Petitioners’
contention this proceeding and Petitioners’ appeal motivated the Legislature to
amend the law. As Respondent acknowledges, Senator Durazo introduced SB 51 on
December 7, 2020, about two weeks after the court entered judgment against
Petitioners in this proceeding on November 24, 2020. (Resp. RJN Exh. D and
Dabney Decl. ¶ 14.)  The Legislature
mandated amended Government Code section 54237.9 become effective July 23,
2021, while Petitioners’ appeal was pending. In these circumstances, the court
concludes the Legislature amended Government Code section 54237.9, at least in
part, in response to this writ petition and the appeal.  
 
By prohibiting Respondent from using a
higher, inflation adjusted price, amended Government Code section 54237.9
confers a substantial benefit on the many persons and families that may be
eligible to purchase surplus property under the Roberti Law. Thus, as a
practical matter, by successfully litigating this writ proceeding as well as
the appeal, Petitioners helped confer a substantial benefit on a large class of
persons. Further, because the Roberti Law promotes much needed affordable
housing, Petitioners’ litigation also conferred a substantial benefit on the
general public.  
 
Respondent contends: “While this
Action was in the middle of litigation, SB 9 and SB 51 were being promulgated
after the decision in the UCT v. Caltrans matter. Petitioners have not provided
any facts that indicate that their filing of the Action was the catalyst for
either SB 9 or SB 51.” (Opposition 7:20-22.) The argument is not persuasive.
Petitioners have provided legislative history and a timeline supporting their
contention that this proceeding was a catalyst for SB 51. The court issued its decision
in UCT v. Caltrans in May 2019, substantially before the Legislature
enacted SB 51 in July 2021. The timeline supports the inference that
Petitioners’ appeal and this writ proceeding were the more important motivating
factors in the legislative change. In any event, even if the UCT v. Caltrans
matter was also a motivating factor for the legislative change, the
court would still conclude this action conferred a substantial benefit on a
large class of persons and the public.[7]
 
Finally, while not cited by the
parties, the court also located authorities supporting a substantial benefit
from litigation based on legislative changes. (See e.g., Bjornestad v. Hulse
(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1568, 1598 [“case law takes a pragmatic approach in defining
‘prevailing’ or ‘successful’ party within the meaning of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 1021.5. . . . The impact
might include legislative changes, settlements, or amendments in policy.”];
see also Marine Forests Society v. California Coastal Com., supra, 160
Cal.App.4th at 876-880.)[8]  
 
For the reasons discussed, the court concludes
this proceeding conferred a substantial benefit on the general public and a
large class of persons.[9]

Necessity
and Financial Burden of Private Enforcement[10]

 
The necessity and financial burden requirement
“‘examines two issues: whether private enforcement was necessary and whether
the financial burden of private enforcement warrants subsidizing the successful
party's attorneys.” (Lyons v. Chinese Hosp. Ass'n (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th
1331, 1348.)  Here, private enforcement
was necessary as there is no reason to believe a government agency would sue to
enforce Petitioners’ claims. 
 
With respect to financial burden,
“[a]n award on the ‘private attorney general’ theory is appropriate when the
cost of the claimant’s legal victory transcends his personal interest, that is,
when the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff
‘out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter.’ ” (Woodland Hills
Residents’ Ass’n, Inc. (1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 941.) “An attorney fee award
under section 1021.5 is proper unless the [successful litigant’s]
reasonably expected financial benefits exceed by a substantial margin the
[litigant’s] actual litigation costs.” (Collins v. City of Los Angeles
(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  
 
With respect to financial burden,
Petitioners argue: 
 
Here, no monetary award or damages were sought. Petitioners are
three low income tenants and their counsel is a sole practitioner[].
Petitioners’ reduced sales prices for their homes do not bring them any
financial award by which to fund this suit, since no financial recovery was
sought.[11]
(Memo 5:6-9.)  
 
The court finds this argument
persuasive. Respondent has not opposed this argument and has thereby conceded
it. (Sehulster
Tunnels/Pre-Con v. Traylor Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111
Cal.App.4th 1328, 1345, fn. 16 [failure to address point is “equivalent to a
concession”].)  
 
Even without Respondent’s implied concession,
the court also concludes the financial burden requirement of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021.5 is met. There is no persuasive evidence in the record
for this motion that Petitioners’ “reasonably expected financial benefits” from
challenging Respondent’s use of an inflation adjusted price – both in this writ
action and on appeal – “exceed by a substantial margin” Petitioners’ actual
litigation costs.  
 
Based on the foregoing, Petitioners
have demonstrated all elements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 are
satisfied here. Accordingly, Petitioners are entitled to an award of reasonable
attorneys’ fees for this writ proceeding and the related appeal.  
 
///
Reasonable
Attorneys’ Fees
 
“The
determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. . . .’  [T]he lodestar
is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community. . . .” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  
 
Generally,
the reasonable hourly rate used for the lodestar calculation is the rate
prevailing in the community for similar work. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010)
188 Cal.App.4th 603, 616.) In making its calculation, the court may rely on its
own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience,
skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees, the difficulty or
complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied, and affidavits
from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate
determinations in other cases. (569 East
County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 426, 437.)  
 
“The
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of
Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)
If the motion is supported by evidence, the opposing party must respond with
specific evidence showing that the fees are unreasonable. (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee
Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 560-563.) The court has discretion to
reduce fees that result from inefficient or duplicative use of time. (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California
State University, supra, 132 Cal.App.4th at 395.)  
 
Apportionment
of fees is not required if fee-bearing and non-fee-bearing claims or legal
activities are inextricably intertwined. (See Fed-Mart Corp. v. Pell Enterprises, Inc. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 215,
227.) However, “the extent of a party's success is a key factor in determining
the reasonable amount of attorney fees to be awarded under section 1021.5.
. . .” (Save Our Uniquely Rural Community Environment v. County of San
Bernardino (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1185 [SOURCE].) “[A] reduced
fee award ‘is appropriate if the relief, however significant, is limited in
comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole. . . .’ ” (Ibid.)
 
Finally,
“[i]n challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice. Failure to raise specific
challenges in the trial court forfeits the claim on appeal.” (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)
 
Reasonable
Hourly Rate
 
Petitioners
request approval of an hourly rate of $400/hour for their attorney and $90/hour
for paralegal work. Considering
all relevant factors, and based on the court’s familiarity with the legal
market and the legal work of Petitioners’ counsel here, the court finds the
hourly rates requested by Petitioners’ counsel are reasonable.[12]
Respondent makes no argument to the
contrary. (Opposition 8:27-28.)  
 
Reasonable Number of Hours 
 
Petitioners
request “compensation for approximately 399 hours that Christopher Sutton’s
firm worked on this case from the first time entry in August 2019 through
trial, an appeal, Caltrans’ post-appeal tenacious arguments, and up to March
2024, in the ‘lodestar’ amount of $160,104.[]” (Memo 5:26-6:1 [citing Sutton
Decl. ¶¶ 2-4 and Exh. 1].) Petitioners also request an additional $14,000 for
litigating this fee motion. (Memo 9:3-5 and Sutton Decl. ¶ 3.) The court has thoroughly
reviewed Petitioners’ counsel’s declarations and his billing invoice submitted
as Exhibit 1.  
 
Respondents
do not challenge the reasonableness of many of the hours claimed by
Petitioners’ counsel, including for the appeal. Nor do Respondents argue that Petitioners’
counsel’s work should be apportioned between specific claims or issues. Instead,
Respondents argue Petitioners’ counsel inappropriately seeks attorneys’ fees
for clerical tasks; some of counsel’s work overlapped with that of his
paralegal; and Petitioners’ counsel inefficiently used time to prepare the
proposed judgments. The court has reviewed and considered Respondents’
declarations related to the lodestar fee, including the highlighted notations
on Exhibit 1 to the declaration of Deputy Attorney Andrea Maehara and the chart
attached as Exhibit 2 to the declaration of Senior Legal Analyst Eliza Kegeyan.  
 
It
appears Respondent contends Attorney Sutton’s time should be reduced by 81.1
hours (or $32,440) and paralegal time reduced by 3 hours ($270). Accordingly, Respondent
apparently concedes if attorneys’ fees are awarded here, an award of $127,394
would be reasonable. (See Kegeyan Decl. Exh. 2 [final page].)[13]
Respondent does not address Petitioners’ counsel’s request for $14,000 as and
for attorneys’ fees related to this fee motion.
 
The
court finds many of the objections to fees—that is, Respondent’s request for
reductions—well taken.
 
Of
the requests for reductions made by Respondent as to paralegal services, the
court finds reductions proposed by Respondent are appropriate in the amount of 1.8
hours (or $162). The court reduces .5 hours (10-29-19) for unnecessary services
as duplicative of counsel’s services, .5 hours (1-7-2020) for unnecessary
services as duplicative of counsel, .4 hours (1-8-2020) for unnecessary
services as duplicative of counsel and .4 hours (1-17-2020) for unnecessary
services as duplicative of counsel’s services.
 
Of
the requests for reductions made by Respondent as to attorneys’ fees, the court
finds reductions prosed by Respondent are appropriate in the amount of 40.1
hours (or $16,040). The court agrees with the justifications offered by
Respondent for reductions. (Kegeyan Decl. Exh. 2.) As a general matter,
Petitioners’ counsel has billed for administrative services that are not
appropriately billed as attorney services at $400/hour. In addition, some of
the time expended by counsel for revisions and further revisions of pleadings is
unreasonable given the pleadings and issues raised. The court further finds the
time expended for other tasks was unreasonable given the nature of the task and
a $400/hour billing rate.
 
The
court agrees with Respondent’s requested reductions of attorney time for the
reasons stated (Kegeyan Decl. Exh. 2) except as to the following
entries: 
 
10-29-19
(1 hour), 11-13-2019 (2 hours), 12-5-2019 (1 hour), 1-6-2020 (1 hour), 1-7-2020

As
for the fee motion—the moving and reply papers, preparation for hearing and the
hearing—the court finds 20 hours at $400/hour (or $8,000) to be a just and
reasonable fee based on the court’s review of the moving and opposition papers.
The reasonable hours expended (20) represents two-and-a-half full days of work.
The issues related to the fees are not novel or complex; the motion is fairly
straightforward.
 
Based
on the court’s review of the record, as well as the court’s familiarity with
the legal work of Petitioners’ counsel on this case, the court concludes that
Petitioners’ reasonable lodestar fee for the entire writ action and the appeal,
including this fee motion, is $143,902 plus $8,000 for the attorneys’ fees
motion for a total fee award of $151,902. As discussed, the court has exercised
its discretion to impose a modest reduction on Petitioners’ requested lodestar
fee as a result of some duplicative and inefficient use of time; in
consideration of the fact that Petitioners’ success on appeal and on remand
must be attributed, in part, to a legislative change; and because Petitioners
admittedly did not prevail on all claims in the petition. 
 
Multiplier

 
A
trial court may adjust the lodestar upward or downward using a multiplier.  (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) Courts look to the following
factors, among others, in determining whether a multiplier is appropriate: “(1)
the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill displayed
in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the litigation
precluded other employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent nature of the
fee award, both from the point of view of eventual victory on the merits and
the point of view of establishing eligibility for an award; (4) the fact that
an award against the state would ultimately fall upon the taxpayers; (5) the
fact that the attorneys in question received public and charitable funding for
the purpose of bringing law suits of the character here involved; (6) the fact
that the monies awarded would inure not to the individual benefit of the
attorneys involved but the organizations by which they are employed. . . .”  (See Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48.)  
 
Petitioners
seek a multiplier of 2.0 on the grounds that Petitioners’ counsel litigated the
case entirely pro bono and the litigation precluded other employment by
Petitioners’ counsel.  Petitioners also
highlight the difficulty and novelty of the legal issues and counsel’s skill in
presenting them; and the important results achieved as grounds for a multiplier.
 
The
evidence establishes Petitioners’ counsel litigated this writ action and appeal
on a pro bono basis. (Sutton Decl. ¶ 9.)[14]
Petitioners’ counsel began representing Petitioners in this matter in August
2019, and he has dedicated four years to the writ action and appeal. (Sutton
Decl. ¶ 9.)  Petitioners’ counsel also
had to decline work from paying clients to undertake this lawsuit. (Sutton
Decl. ¶ 6.) For the reasons discussed, Petitioners’ counsel’s efforts and this
writ proceeding also helped motivate a legislative change that conferred a
substantial benefit on a large class of persons and the general public. These
factors weigh in support of granting a positive multiplier.  
 
However,
the court is not persuaded that the difficulty and novelty of the legal issues
and counsel’s skill in presenting them weigh for a positive multiplier.
Petitioners initially did not prevail at the trial court level and their
success on appeal and on remand must be attributed, in large part, to the
legislative change discussed above. Further, a fee award against the state
would ultimately fall upon the taxpayers. 

 
Weighing
the factors, the court concludes Petitioners are entitled to a multiplier of
1.5 to account for the substantial risks assumed by Petitioners’ counsel in
handling the case pro bono; the fact that his representation precluded other
employment; and the substantial public benefits conferred. Accordingly, the
court awards attorneys’ fee of $215,853 ($143,902 x 1.5) plus $8,000 for this
motion for a total fee award of $223,853.
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The motion is
GRANTED in the reduced amount of $223,853 as and for reasonable attorneys’
fees.  
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
