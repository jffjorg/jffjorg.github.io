  Case Number:  22LBCV00355    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  S27 1.    
Background
Facts
Plaintiff, Chelsey
Binz filed 22LBCV00355 against Defendants, LBMMC, et al. for damages arising
out of complications that arose during her labor and delivery.  The complications ultimately caused damage to
her child, Indiana Rayne Van Den Oever.   
 
22LBCV00355 has
been consolidated with 23LBCV00839, in which the minor child brings her own
claims arising out of the birth.  
 
2.    
Petition
to Approve Compromise of a Minor
The parties have entered into a
global settlement of the action, pursuant to which LBMMC and Drs. Bhatia and
Askari will pay the minor child a confidential amount, which is detailed in the
petition, filed under seal, as well as the proposed order thereon.    
 
The Court has reviewed the
settlement and finds it is fair and reasonable. 
Counsel seeks to recover 33% of the total settlement in attorneys’
fees.  The Court typically restricts fee
awards in cases involving minors to 25% of the gross settlement.  The Court is, however, aware that this case
has been pending for over two years and has been heavily litigated, including
numerous summary judgment motions, such that the Court finds the 33% allocation
to be fair and reasonable.  
 
Pursuant to CRC 7.952, unless
excused by the Court, both the petitioner and the minor child must appear and
testify before the Court grants the petition. 
The minor child is three years old and severely disabled; the Court
therefore finds good cause to excuse her from appearing.  The Court will grant the petition if
Petitioner appears and testifies to the satisfaction of the Court.
