And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted a motion to appoint an elisor to execute documents and transfers on behalf of Defendant Morales, who has refused to execute such documents as ordered by the court. The court has the authority to appoint an elisor to ensure that its judgments are carried out, and in this case, the appointment is necessary to effectuate the quiet title judgment entered on August 12, 2020. The court notes that the use of an elisor is a common practice in cases where a party refuses to comply with a court order. The motion is granted, and an elisor will be appointed to execute the necessary documents and transfers on behalf of Morales.
