And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' ex parte application to expunge the Notice of Pendency of Action and recover attorney's fees and costs. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff, Brian Joseph, had failed to withdraw the Lis Pendens recorded against their property, despite agreeing to do so in the settlement agreement and receiving $200,000. However, the judge found that the lawsuit was dismissed in its entirety on June 11, 2024, after all issues were resolved. The plaintiff had vacated the property on April 14, 2024, and the settlement agreement had been executed. The judge also noted that there was no indication that the court had retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. The defendants are directed to give notice of the denial of their application.
