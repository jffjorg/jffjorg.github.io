 Case Number:  21NWCV00698    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  C Brian
Joseph vs James D Honodel, et al., Case No.: 21NWCV00698
This is an
action for Quiet Title. Defendants James D. Honodel and Marina Honodel apply ex
parte for an order expunging Notice of Pendency of Action and for Attorney’s
Fees and Costs.
Defendants
contend Plaintiff Brian Joseph has improperly failed to withdraw his Lis
Pendens recorded against the title of their property despite agreeing to do so
in the settlement of this action, and despite having received $200,000 from
Defendants.  Defendants argue Plaintiff insists that Defendants must pay
him an additional $150,000 before he will withdraw the lis pendens. 
Defendants also argue that they will be irreparably harmed because they are
currently in escrow for the sale of their home and escrow cannot close until
the Notice of Pending Action filed by Plaintiff is ordered expunged from the
title of Defendants’ property. 
The ex parte
application is DENIED.  On June 11, 2024, the Court on its own motion
dismissed this lawsuit in its entirety because all issues had been
resolved.  The Court found that Plaintiff vacated the property on April
14, 2024 and he has received the funds pursuant to the January 18, 2024
settlement agreement.  Furthermore, a dismissal was filed on May 2, 2024
in the unlawful detainer case.  There is no indication the Court has
retained jurisdiction to enforce settlement pursuant to CCP § 664.6. 
Moving party to give notice.
