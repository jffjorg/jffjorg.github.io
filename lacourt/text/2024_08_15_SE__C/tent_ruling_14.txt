Defendants SADDLEBACK SQUARE, LLC and 1800
ARGYLE, LLC’s
Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED with 20 days
leave to amend. 
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
This
action for breach of contract was filed by Plaintiff MARK KIM (“Plaintiff”) on
February 23, 2024. On March 12, 2024, the operative First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) was filed. 
 
Plaintiff
alleges that “in or about August 2022, Ionix through its principal Park entered
into an agreement with Owner (the ‘Prime Contract’) whereby Ionix would perform
certain construction work on a project located at the Property (the ‘Project’).
The Project consists of various improvements. [¶] On or about December 1, 2022,
Plaintiff was entered into an agreement with Ionix and Park and agreed, among
other things to furnish labor to Ionix for work at the Project. [¶] Plaintiff
performed work at the Project from December 2022 through at least March 2023.
At the special instance of Ionix and Park, Plaintiff purchased certain
materials, rented certain equipment, and otherwise expended funds for Ionix’s
use and benefit at the Project. Ionix and Park promised to reimburse Plaintiff
but have failed to do so.” (FAC ¶¶10-12.)
 
The
FAC asserts the following causes of action: 
 
(1)
Breach of Contract; 
(2)
Account Stated; and 
(3)
Reasonable Value 
 
Defendants
SADDLEBACK SQUARE, LLC (“Saddleback”) and 1800 ARGYLE, LLC (“1800”) demur to
Plaintiff’s third cause of action, arguing that it fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that Plaintiff lacks capacity to
sue because Plaintiff failed to comply with California’s mechanic’s lien
statutes. 
 
The
common count for Goods Sold and Delivered is an action of indebtedness for
goods sold and delivered at an agreed price. (Abadie v. Carrillo (1986)
32 Cal. 173.) The elements of such a claim include: (1) Defendant requested
goods through words or conduct; (2) the goods were delivered; and (3) the goods
wee not paid for. (CACI 371.) The damages equal the reasonable value of the
goods. (Id.) 
 
This
is not a claim based on the collection/foreclosure of a mechanic’s lien. It is
undisputed that no mechanic’s lien was recorded. Plaintiff does not lack
standing to sue based on any failure to comply with the mechanic’s lien
statutes. 
 
Plaintiff
alleges that “[a]t the special insistence and request of Defendants and upon
the promise of Ionix and Park to pay the reasonable value thereof, Plaintiff
performed his work on the Project, providing his labor and at the special
insistence of Ionix renting equipment and purchasing material and the like for
the benefit of Ionix, Park, and [Saddleback and/or 1800]…. Although Plaintiff
has demanded…payment… Ionix, Park, and [Saddleback and/or 1800] have refused
and continues to refuse to pay any part thereof, leaving a sum now due, owing
and unpaid to Plaintiff of $133,678.87, together with interest thereon.” (FAC
¶23.)  
 
Here,
Saddleback and 1800 are the owners of the Subject Property. Plaintiff, a
subcontractor, does not allege any privity of contract with the “Owners”. “A
subcontractor, who has no direct contractual relationship with the property
owner, may generally not recover on an unjust enrichment theory for benefits
conferred on the property.” (Truestone, Inc. v. Simi West Industrial Park II
(1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 715, 724.)   On this basis, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with
20 days leave to amend.
