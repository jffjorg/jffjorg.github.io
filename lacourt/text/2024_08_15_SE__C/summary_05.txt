And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to stay the proceedings in this childhood sexual assault case. The defendants sought to stay the case pending the outcome of two unrelated cases on appeal, arguing that it would be wasteful to proceed with the case if the courts of appeal ultimately rule that the statute of limitations (AB 218) is unconstitutional. The judge found that it is speculative to predict when the courts of appeal will decide the related cases, and that there is always the possibility of conflicting rulings. The judge concluded that judicial economy is best served by proceeding with the litigation, and if the defendants are unable to engage in settlement discussions, the parties can proceed with discovery and motion work.
