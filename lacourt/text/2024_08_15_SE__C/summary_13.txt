The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Abimael G. Garcia vs Best For You Moving, et al. The case arises from a breach of rental contract, and the defendant, Artur Shakhnazarov, has applied for an Order enforcing a Settlement Agreement reached during a mediation on July 17, 2024. However, the judge has denied the ex parte application, as the defendant failed to provide notice of the settlement and did not show that the settlement includes a provision under CCP ยง 664.6 allowing the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice.
