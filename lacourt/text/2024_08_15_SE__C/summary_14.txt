And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the Plaintiff's third cause of action, Reasonable Value, with 20 days leave to amend. The demurrer was filed by Defendants SADDLEBACK SQUARE, LLC and 1800 ARGYLE, LLC, arguing that the cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that the Plaintiff lacks capacity to sue because they failed to comply with California's mechanic's lien statutes. The judge found that the Plaintiff does not lack standing to sue based on any failure to comply with the mechanic's lien statutes, as no mechanic's lien was recorded. The judge also cited a precedent case, Truestone, Inc. v. Simi West Industrial Park II, which holds that a subcontractor who has no direct contractual relationship with the property owner may not recover on an unjust enrichment theory for benefits conferred on the property.
