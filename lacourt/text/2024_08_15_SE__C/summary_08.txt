Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a breach of contract dispute between Shamiaka Harris and Rabi Jamil Mouton. Harris filed a demurrer to Mouton's cross-complaint, which alleges that Mouton made misrepresentations and breached their fiduciary duty. The Judge sustained the demurrer for several causes of action, including breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty, due to insufficient pleading. The Judge also granted Harris's motion to compel Mouton's deposition, imposing a sanction of $900.00 on Mouton. The Judge ordered Mouton to appear for a deposition within 30 days and to pay the sanctions.
