And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the unopposed motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Inc. and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Inc. The motion was supported by expert testimony from Dr. Aimee French, a board-certified internal medicine physician. Dr. French opined that the defendants' actions and omissions in providing care to Joyce Starlin complied with the applicable standard of care for health care practitioners in an intensive care setting in Southern California.

The court found that the plaintiff, Angela Wrisk, did not present any expert testimony to refute the defendants' arguments, and therefore, there are no triable issues of material fact as to whether the defendants breached the standard of care. The court granted the motion for summary judgment, effectively ending the case in favor of the defendants.
