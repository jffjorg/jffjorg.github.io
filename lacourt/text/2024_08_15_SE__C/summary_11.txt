And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application to set aside the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff's counsel failed to appear for the case management conference on August 9, 2024, and the case was dismissed as a result. The judge has instead scheduled a hearing for October 16, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. in Department SE-C to consider the plaintiff's motion. The plaintiff is required to file the moving papers, opposition, and reply briefs in compliance with the hearing date. The judge also advises the plaintiff to file a noticed motion in the future, rather than seeking ex parte relief.
