#10
 
Plaintiff JENNIFER TU’s unopposed Motion to Set Aside
Dismissal under CCP §473(b) is GRANTED. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of July August 13, 2024.   
 
Plaintiff’s Proposed First Amended Complaint, separately
lodged with this Court on August 2, 2024, is DEEMED FILED as of today’s
date. Moving Party is ORDERED to serve the First Amended Complaint per Code. 
 
This personal injury action was filed by Plaintiff on August
21, 2023. On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff’s Complaint was dismissed without
prejudice due to Plaintiff’s Counsel’s second failure to appear without good
cause for a Case Management Conference and OSC Re: Dismissal of the Entire
Action for Plaintiff’s Failure to Appear on 03/28/24. (See 05/30/24 M.O.) 
 
Plaintiff moves to set aside the dismissal under CCP
§473(b). 
 
CCP § 473(b), states that “[t]he court may…relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” 
 
The policy of hearing cases on
their merits is well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971)
17 Cal.App.3d 900.) Given the liberality associated with Motions to Set
Aside under CCP §473(b), the Court finds the Declaration of
Thomas M. Willford sufficient to warrant to relief. The law favors
trials on the merits. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.)

 
The unopposed Motion is GRANTED.
