This action
arises from a breach of rental contract. Defendant Artur Shakhnazarov applies
ex parte for an Order enforcing the Settlement Agreement.  On August 1,

order is improper because a settlement was reached during a July 17, 2024
mediation held between the parties.  The ex parte application is
DENIED.  No notice of settlement has been filed, and Defendant fails to
show that the terms of any settlement includes a provision under CCP § 664.6
that the Court retains jurisdiction over the parties to enforce
settlement.  Moving party to give notice.
