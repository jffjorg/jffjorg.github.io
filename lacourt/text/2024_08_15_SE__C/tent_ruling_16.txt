Motion to Confirm Satisfaction of Judgment 
 
There is an ongoing pending appeal in this action. After the
taking of an appeal, “the trial court may proceed upon any other matter
embraced in the action and not affected by the judgment or order.” (CCP
§916(a).) 
 
The issue here is satisfaction of Plaintiff WNG’s Judgment
in the principal amount of $1,861,054.44, plus 10% prejudgment interest from
the date of July 6, 2016 to April 3, 2023 totaling $1,255,319.39. (See Am.
Judgment, 05/09/23.) 
 
WNG’s appeal would only serve to increase the amount of the
judgment already awarded in WNG’s favor. The existing judgment would otherwise,
not be affected. Moreover, AAA does not argue in Opposition that this Court
lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate this matter. Therefore, this Court may
proceed. 
 
Once a money judgment has been satisfied, the judgment
creditor who has recorded an abstract of judgment must file with the court and
serve on the judgment debtor an acknowledgement of satisfaction. (CCP
§724.040.) If the judgment creditor fails to do this, the judgment debtor may
demand of the creditor that he file the acknowledgement of satisfaction. (CCP
§724.050(a).) If the judgment creditor does not comply with this demand, the
person making the demand may move for an order requiring the creditor to comply.
(CCP §724.050(d).) 
 
Here, Judgment Debtor AAA moves for an order confirming
satisfaction of judgment of full. 
 
In Opposition, Judgment Creditor WNG argues that the Motion
must be denied because the Judgment has not been fully satisfied—as of August
14, 2024 there is still $1,151.18 unsatisfied. 
 
On May 8, 2023, the Judgment Debtors paid $1,878,940.24.
(Feldman Decl., ¶3.) On September 12, 2023, Judgement Debtors paid
$1,397.071.65. (Feldman Decl., ¶8.) On February 23, 2024, Judgement Debtors
issued a cashier’s check in the amount of $1,370,987.32 in satisfaction of the
interest  portion of the Judgment. (Feldman
Decl., ¶¶16-17.) 
 
Based on the evidence presented, it appears that AAA has
satisfied the Judgment in this action. The Judgment Creditor is ORDERED to
comply with the demand for acknowledgement of satisfaction of Judgment. 
 
Reasonable attorney’s fees in favor of AAA in the amount
requested of $3,000.00 ($2,840.00 + $100 +$60) is GRANTED. WNG is ORDERED pay
these sanctions and penalty within 60 days from the date of the Court’s
issuance of this Order. (See CCP §724.050(b).) 
 
Motion to Return Overpayment of Judgment 
 
In light of the Court’s ruling above, Defendant/Judgment
Debtor’s Motion to Enter Order for Return of Judgment Debtors’ Overpayment of
Judgment is CONTINUED as indicated above. The parties are encouraged to meet
and confer over the differing calculations. In Reply, AAA points out a number
of issues with WNG’s calculations. The parties are ORDERED to submit a
Stipulation and Proposed Order to take this matter off-calendar before the
continued hearing date if the parties are able to informally resolve this dispute.
If the parties are unable to informally resolve this dispute, then the parties
are ORDERED to submit a Joint Statement outlining the remaining issues by no
later than 5 court days before the continued hearing date.
