ASSOCIATES v. LI
CASE NO.:  23NWCV02598
HEARING:  08/15/24
 
#8
 
Defendant LI’s unopposed Motion for Leave to File a Cross-Complaint
is GRANTED. 
 
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of August 12, 2024. 
 
This unlawful detainer action was filed on August 11, 2023.
Possession is no longer at issue. Defendant LI seeks to leave to file a
cross-complaint to state a claim for unlawful lockout. 
 
CCP §428.50 states: “(a) A party shall file a cross-complaint against
any of the parties who filed the complaint or cross-complaint against him or
her before or at the same time as the answer to the complaint or
cross-complaint. (b) Any other cross-complaint may be filed at any time before
the court has set a date for trial. (c) A party shall obtain leave of court to
file any cross-complaint except one filed within the time specified in
subdivision (a) or (b). Leave may be granted in the interest of justice at any
time during the course of action.” 
 
The Court finds that it would
serve the interests of justice to grant Defendant leave to file its proposed
Cross-Complaint. It is best to avoid multiplicity or duplicity of actions. The
Motion is GRANTED. 
 
Defendant LI is ORDERED to file
and serve the Cross-Complaint within 30 days.
