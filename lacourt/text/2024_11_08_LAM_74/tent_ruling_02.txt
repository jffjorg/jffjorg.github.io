 Case Number:  22STCV31927    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2024    Dept:  74 Pearlman et
al. v. Laurence Zimmerman et al. 
Plaintiff Eric Pearlman, Sohiel
Poursalimi and Peyman Cohan’s Motion to Compel
 
Because defendant Landover Wireless
Corp. served responses (objections are responses), plaintiffs’ motion to compel
Landover’s initial response is moot. If plaintiffs are dissatisfied with Landover’s
responses, plaintiffs may file a motion to compel further responses.
 
Plaintiffs shall give notice.
