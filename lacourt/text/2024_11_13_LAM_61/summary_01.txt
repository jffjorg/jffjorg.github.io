And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims for wrongful termination and employment discrimination. The plaintiff, Ramiro Gonzalez, executed an arbitration agreement in January 2007, which applies to all claims arising out of or relating to his employment. The defendants, Golden Boy Promotions, Inc. and Oscar De La Hoya, move to compel arbitration based on this agreement.

The plaintiff opposes the motion on various grounds, including waiver and unconscionability. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's arguments are without merit. The judge notes that the plaintiff's opposition is overlong and that the plaintiff's arguments are based on unsubstantiated claims.

The judge also finds that the defendants have not waived their right to compel arbitration. The defendants have consistently pursued arbitration of this matter, and their actions do not indicate an intent to abandon their right to arbitrate.

As a result, the judge orders the parties to arbitrate the disputes.
