assumes Plaintiff meant monetary sanctions and attorney’s fees to be the same
thing, given that Plaintiff’s motion and declaration do not set forth a
separate basis for an award of attorney’s fees here. (See Notice of Motion,
1:27-2:2; Memorandum of Points and Authorities, pg. 7 of pdf, lines 13-16; Hettena
Decl., ¶ 14; Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a); Id., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(10).)
