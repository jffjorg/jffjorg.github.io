And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on three motions: motion to reopen fact discovery, motion to bifurcate the trial, and motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The motions were filed by the Plaintiffs against Browning-Ferris Industries of California, Inc. and Republic Services, Inc., as well as Peter Pouwels.

The Judge denied the motion to reopen fact discovery as the Plaintiff's counsel failed to provide a sufficient explanation for not taking depositions of Marcial Viveros and Moises Romero earlier, despite identifying them as potential witnesses in their discovery responses.

The Judge also denied the motion to bifurcate the trial, finding that a joint trial would not be unmanageable and would not involve irrelevant or prejudicial evidence.

Finally, the Judge granted the motion for leave to file a first amended complaint and advanced the hearing on the motion to October 23, 2023.

* "This is not the case when the 'me too' evidence involves the same supervisor."



**English Summary:**

The judge issued a tentative ruling denying two motions filed by the defendants in this case involving multiple plaintiffs alleging sexual harassment and other workplace violations. 

Firstly, the judge denied the defendants' motion to reopen discovery, finding that the plaintiffs' delay in noticing depositions of two key witnesses was not justified. 

Secondly, the judge denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial, meaning all plaintiffs' claims will be heard together. The judge determined that separating the trials wouldn't promote efficiency and that the "me too" evidence, while potentially prejudicial, is relevant given the allegations involve the same supervisor.

The judge also advanced the hearing for the plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint to October 23, 2023, and scheduled a trial setting conference for the same date.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on three motions filed by the parties. The first motion is to reopen fact discovery to take depositions from Marcial Viveros and Moises Romero. The judge has denied this motion because the plaintiff's counsel failed to explain why they could not take the depositions before the cutoff date, which was March 6, 2023.

The second motion is to bifurcate the trial, which would allow for separate trials for each of the ten plaintiffs. The judge has denied this motion because it would not promote the convenience of witnesses, the ends of justice, or the economy and efficiency of handling the litigation.

The third motion is to file a first amended complaint. The judge has advanced the hearing on this motion to October 23, 2023, and has continued the trial setting conference to the same date.

## Case Summary: Luis Venegas, et al. v. Browning-Ferris Industries of California, Inc., et al. (Case No. 21STCV11027)

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiffs:** Luis Venegas, et al. 
* **Defendants:** Browning-Ferris Industries of California, Inc. ("BFI"), Republic Services, Inc. ("Republic"), Peter Pouwels

**Case Overview:** 

This case involves ten plaintiffs alleging various employment-related claims against BFI, Republic, and their employee Peter Pouwels, including sexual harassment, assault, negligent hiring/supervision, discrimination, retaliation, and wrongful termination.

**Significant Events:**

* **Discovery Deadlines:**  Previously set fact discovery deadline was April 4, 2023, and expert discovery deadline was August 1, 2023.
* **Plaintiffs' Motion to Reopen Discovery (Denied):** The plaintiffs sought to reopen fact discovery to depose two witnesses, Marcial Viveros and Moises Romero. The court denied this motion due to the plaintiffs' lack of diligence in identifying and scheduling depositions despite knowing about these witnesses since August 2021.
* **Defendants' Motion to Bifurcate (Denied):** The defendants requested separate trials for each plaintiff, arguing that a joint trial would be inefficient and involve prejudicial "me too" evidence. The court denied this motion, finding that the allegations involve the same supervisor and a joint trial would be more efficient.
* **Motion for Leave to Amend (Advancing Hearing):** The plaintiffs filed a motion to amend their complaint. The court advanced the hearing for this motion from January 2024 to October 23, 2023.

**Upcoming Events:**

* **Hearing on Motion to Amend Complaint:** October 23, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.
* **Trial Setting Conference:** October 23, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.


**Judge's Reasoning:**

The judge's tentative ruling suggests a focus on judicial efficiency and procedural fairness.  The judge denied the motion to reopen discovery due to the plaintiffs' lack of diligence and found the arguments for bifurcation unconvincing.  The judge also proactively advanced the hearing on the motion to amend the complaint to ensure timely progression of the case.
