And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on three motions: motion to reopen fact discovery, motion to bifurcate the trial, and motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The motions were filed by the Plaintiffs against Browning-Ferris Industries of California, Inc. and Republic Services, Inc., as well as Peter Pouwels.

The Judge denied the motion to reopen fact discovery as the Plaintiff's counsel failed to provide a sufficient explanation for not taking depositions of Marcial Viveros and Moises Romero earlier, despite identifying them as potential witnesses in their discovery responses.

The Judge also denied the motion to bifurcate the trial, finding that a joint trial would not be unmanageable and would not involve irrelevant or prejudicial evidence.

Finally, the Judge granted the motion for leave to file a first amended complaint and advanced the hearing on the motion to October 23, 2023.
