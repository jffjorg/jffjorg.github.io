And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint and has ordered the case to be dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiff brought a lawsuit against the defendant, alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, elder abuse, declaratory relief, and accounting. The defendant demurred to the complaint, and the judge sustained the demurrer, finding that the action was untimely.

The plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud by misrepresenting that the plaintiff's father had sold his business to her. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff and his mother, and that the defendant's alleged misrepresentations were made while the plaintiff was in a position of reliance. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to allege facts demonstrating that the defendant's alleged misrepresentations were made with the intent to deceive or that the plaintiff was prevented from investigating the issue.

The judge also found that the plaintiff's reliance on the defendant's alleged misrepresentations was not reasonable, and that the plaintiff should have acted with due diligence to investigate the issue. The judge concluded that the plaintiff's delay in bringing the action was not justified and that the case should be dismissed with prejudice.
