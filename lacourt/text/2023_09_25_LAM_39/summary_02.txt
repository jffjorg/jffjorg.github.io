And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint and has ordered the case to be dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiff brought a lawsuit against the defendant, alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, elder abuse, declaratory relief, and accounting. The defendant demurred to the complaint, and the judge sustained the demurrer, finding that the action was untimely.

The plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud by misrepresenting that the plaintiff's father had sold his business to her. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff and his mother, and that the defendant's alleged misrepresentations were made while the plaintiff was in a position of reliance. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to allege facts demonstrating that the defendant's alleged misrepresentations were made with the intent to deceive or that the plaintiff was prevented from investigating the issue.

The judge also found that the plaintiff's reliance on the defendant's alleged misrepresentations was not reasonable, and that the plaintiff should have acted with due diligence to investigate the issue. The judge concluded that the plaintiff's delay in bringing the action was not justified and that the case should be dismissed with prejudice.

```

Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the defendant's demurrer and denying leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff, John Bamberger, brought this action against the defendant, Linda Judd, alleging causes of action for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, elder abuse, declaratory relief, and accounting. The defendant demurred to the complaint, and the court sustained the demurrer based on the statute of limitations.

The court finds that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the action is timely under the delayed discovery rule. The plaintiff claims that he did not discover the alleged fraud until 2020, but the court finds that he had a duty to investigate the alleged fraud as a trustee and did not exercise reasonable diligence in doing so.

The court also finds that the plaintiff did not allege any facts demonstrating that the defendant did anything to conceal the alleged fraud or dissuade the plaintiff from conducting due diligence on the transaction. The court concludes that the plaintiff's interpretation of the delayed discovery rule is overly broad and that the rule requires a plaintiff to act with "reasonable diligence" in investigating the alleged fraud.

As a result, the court orders the case to be dismissed with prejudice.
