And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to answer filed by the plaintiff, Kenneth Oleesky, against the defendants, Lithia Motors, Inc. and Van Nuys-L, Inc. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging seven causes of action under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and one cause of action for failure to pay timely wages upon discharge, per Labor Code section 201(a). The defendants filed an answer with 52 affirmative defenses, to which the plaintiff demurred.

The judge has sustained the demurrer with respect to several affirmative defenses, including the failure to use the defendants' policies or preventive/corrective opportunities, the argument that third-parties were responsible for the plaintiff's damages, and the argument that the plaintiff waived any claim he may have against the defendants. The judge has also sustained the demurrer with respect to the affirmative defenses that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the doctrine of estoppel, unclean hands, and consent.

However, the judge has overruled the demurrer with respect to the affirmative defenses that argue the plaintiff was responsible for his damages and that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the doctrine of willful misconduct. The judge has also sustained the demurrer with respect to the affirmative defense that the defendants' conduct was privileged.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff's counsel to provide notice and file proof of an amended answer within 30 days.
