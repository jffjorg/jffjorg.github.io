  Case Number:  MC024069    Hearing Date:   March 26, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a medical malpractice action.
Plaintiffs Sara Flores (“Flores”) and Desiree Ortiz (“Ortiz” and collectively
“Plaintiffs”) allege that on or about July 15, 2012, Ortiz when with Flores to
the delivery room in Defendant Antelope Valley Hospital (“AVH”) to witness the
birth of her baby brother and Defendant Jackson Fu, M.D. (“Dr. Fu”) was
managing the pregnancy care of Flores with a nurse, Lisa Rios (“Rios”).
Plaintiffs presents: (1) Dr. Fu was informed by Rios that the baby did not have
a fetal heart tone and had died in utero and was in breach with his feet; (2)
Fu began to deliver the baby in a negligent manner causing the head of the baby
to become entrapped and detached; (3) the delivery was such that the baby was
delivered with the decapitated head remaining within Flores; (4) Dr. Fu
presented the body of the baby to Flores without notifying Flores that the baby
had been decapitated; (5) Dr. Fu performed a c-section to remove the baby’s
head from Flores; and (6) thereafter, the head was placed upon the spine and
body of the baby. Plaintiffs contend that Ortiz observed the events, including
the horror and shock on Flores’ face upon receiving the body.  
 
On January 31, 2013, Plaintiffs filed their
Complaint alleging one cause of action for Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress (“NIED”). At the time of this filing, Ortiz was a minor.  
 
On May 18, 2015, the case was dismissed with
prejudice by Plaintiffs’ counsel Steven D. Hillyard (“Hillyard”) due to a
settlement. 
 
 Hillyard failed to obtain approval of
the Court for the settlement of a minor and, Ortiz disaffirmed the settlement
after she turned 18 years of age. The relevant actions in the case taken in
response were: (1) a Motion to Vacate, granted in part and denied in part on
March 21, 2018; (2) a Motion for Leave to file a First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”), granted on November 21, 2019; and (3) the FAC. All documents were
filed by Plaintiffs’ new counsel, Peter R. diDonato (“diDonato”).  
 
The operative pleading is the First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”). The FAC alleges two causes of action for: (1) NIED by Ortiz,
and (2) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (“IIED”) by Ortiz. That
is, the only plaintiff prosecuting the allegations in the FAC is Ortiz. 
 
The case proceeded to trial. 
 
During the course of trial, several Motions
for Nonsuit were filed and subsequently denied. 
 
On November 15, 2023, Judgment was entered. 
 
On January 02, 2024, Dr. Fu filed a
Memorandum of Costs. 
 
On January 17, 2024, Ortiz filed a Notice of
Hearing of Motion for New Trial. 
 
On January 18, 2024, Ortiz filed an Amended
Notice of Intention to Move for New Trial.
 
On January 18, 2024, AVH filed a Memorandum
of Costs. This filing did not have counsel Campbell H. Finlay (“Finlay”)’s
signature.
 
On January 19, 2024, AVH filed a second
Memorandum of Costs, evidencing the same amounts in the first filing. This
filing contained Finlay’s signature. 
 
On March 05, 2024, Ortiz’s Motion for New
Trial was denied. 
 
On March 13, 2023, AVH and Dr. Fu filed
their respective Oppositions. 
 
No Replies have been filed.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Striking or Taxing Costs – In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. Of
Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to
order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit. (Michell v. Olick
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) The term prevailing party is defined by statute to
include: (1) the party with a net monetary recovery; (2) a defendant who is
dismissed from the action; (3) a defendant where neither plaintiff nor
defendant recovers anything; and (4) a defendant as against those plaintiffs
who do not recover any relief against that defendant. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1032(a)(4).) Regarding parties dismissed, the term applies whether the
dismissal is voluntary or involuntary. (Santisas, supra, 17
Cal.4th at 606.) A motion to strike or tax costs must be served and filed
within 15 days after service of the costs memorandum. (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)¿¿ 
¿ 
A motion to strike challenges the entire
costs bill whereas a motion to tax challenges particular items or amounts.
Verification of the memorandum of costs by the prevailing party’s attorney
establishes a prima facie showing that the claimed costs are proper. (Jones
v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267.) To overcome that prima
facie showing, the objecting party must introduce evidence to support its claim
that the claimed costs were not reasonably necessary to carry out the
litigation. (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d
256, 266.)¿ 
¿ 
Allowable costs under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5 must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather
than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable
in amount. An item not specifically allowable under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(a) nor prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable
in the discretion of the court if they meet the above requirements (i.e.,
reasonably necessary and reasonable in amount). (Ladas v. California State
Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.) If the items
appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the
party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.
(Ibid.) On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they
are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as
costs. (Ibid.) Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the
litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is
reviewed for abuse of discretion. (Ibid.) However, because the right to
costs is governed strictly by statute, a court has no discretion to award costs
not statutorily authorized. (Id.) Discretion is abused only when, in its
exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances
being considered.” (Ibid.)¿

Discussion
 
Application – 
 
i.       
Motion to Tax Costs as to Dr. Fu
 
Any notice of motion to strike or
to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost
memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended
as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum was
served electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)  
 
Here, the Memorandum of Costs by
Dr. Fu was filed and served on January 02, 2024. (See 01/02/2024 Memorandum of
Costs.) Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6 extends any period of notice, or any
right or duty to do any act or make any response within any period or on a date
certain after the service of the document, which time period or date is
prescribed by statute or rule of court by two court days. (See Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 1010.6(a)(3)(B).) There are some motions in which the extension does
not apply; however, the exceptions do not pertain to this motion. (See ibid.)
15 days after January 02, 2024 is Wednesday, January 17, 2024. With the two
days prescribed by Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6, the Motion to Tax Costs
needed to be filed by Friday, January 19, 2024. Ortiz filed and served her
Motion to Tax Costs as to Dr. Fu on January 31, 2024. Accordingly, the Motion
to Tax Costs as to Dr. Fu is untimely. 
 
A “ ‘failure to file a motion to tax costs
constitutes a waiver of the right to object. [Citations.]’ ” (Douglas v.
Willis (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 287, 289; Jimenez v. City of Oxnard
(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 856, 859 [“ ‘[I]f a party to an action against whom cost
is awarded neglects within the time specified in [former] section 1033 to apply
to the court to have the same taxed, he is deemed to have assented to the
correctness and lawfulness of the items as claimed in the verified memorandum
of costs as filed ... .’ ”]; Davis Lumber Co. v. Hubbell (1955) 137
Cal.App.2d 148, 151 [“When a cost bill is filed it is not the duty of the clerk
to determine the regularity of its filing. The burden of attacking it rests
upon the party who will have to pay the costs, and if he fails to move within
the time allowed he is ‘conclusively’ presumed to have waived such irregularity.”];
San Francisco Unified School District v. Board of National Missions (1954)
129 Cal.App.2d 236, 243 [same].) All cases emphasize that the time limit is
mandatory. (Douglas, supra, 27 Cal.App.4th 287, 290 [“The time
limit is mandatory and failure to timely file and serve a cost bill may result
in waiver of costs. [Citation.].”]; Jimenez, supra, 134
Cal.App.3d 856, 860 [holding re: older version of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 133 –
“By not filing said motion within the period specified in section 1033,
plaintiffs waived the right to object to the costs claimed by the city.
[Citation.]”]; Davis Lumber Co., supra, 137 Cal.App.2d
148, 151 [see ante]; San Francisco Unified School District, supra,
129 Cal.App.2d 236, 243 [same].) 
 
Here, the time specified in which a party
may file a motion to tax cost is to be strictly construed (i.e. mandatory),
failure to file a motion to tax costs within the specified time constitutes a
waiver of the right to object, and Ortiz failed to file and serve her Motion to
Tax Costs as to Dr. Fu within the specified time. Thus, Ortiz has waived her
right to object to Dr. Fu’s Memorandum of Costs. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Tax Costs as to
Dr. Fu is DENIED.
 
ii.     
Motion to Tax Costs as to AVH
 
Ortiz seeks to tax costs related
to Item Numbers Four (deposition costs) and 16 (other – lodging). 
 
Ortiz presents that Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(3)(A) explicitly disallows expert witness fees for
deposition. Ortiz contends that AVH has requested a total of “$27,1967.45” for
deposition costs in Item Number Four, including $3,350.00 related to Ortiz’s
expert Daryoush Jamal, M.D. (“Dr. Jamal”)[1].
(See Motion to Tax Costs as to AVH 3:22-23.) Plaintiff argues that, under Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(3)(A), the $3,350.00 related to Dr. Jamal should be
taxed.
 
Ortiz next presents that Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(3)(c)[2]
specifically authorizes travel expenses only for depositions. Ortiz argues that
lodging and mileage must be stricken from Item Number 16 as: (1) under Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(3)(c), travel expenses are only allowed for
attending depositions; and (2) Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(2) requires
allowable costs to be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation
and, here, lodging in order to avoid Los Angeles County traffic during the day
is not reasonably necessary. 
 
Ortiz also provides an argument
that she is indigent as she qualified for a waiver of Court and trial costs
and, as such, she should not be found liable to pay her opponent’s costs.
Ortiz’s Fee Waiver Orders are attached as Exhibit 2. Ortiz does not provide
legal authority for this argument. The Court cannot consider argument as: (1)
Ortiz has not met her burden to show that the costs were not reasonable or necessary (see legal standard, ante); (2) because
the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, a court has no discretion
to award costs not statutorily authorized (see ibid.); and (4) Ortiz has
not provided any legal authority that evidences a Court may not impose
statutorily authorized costs upon an indigent party.   
 
AVH presents that Dr. Jamal was not an expert witness, but rather
Plaintiff’s treating physician, so Dr. Jamal’s deposition was taken in his
capacity as a percipient witness. AVH presents that (1) Ortiz had claimed that all
her emotional distress was caused by the incident underlying this lawsuit, (2)
no medical records from Gateways Hospital referenced the underlying incident, so
(3) Dr. Jamal’s deposition was necessary to establish the issues of Ortiz’s
credibility, causation, and damages. (Decl. John R. MacRill, III, ¶ 3.) AVH
concedes that expert opinions were asked, but by Ortiz’s counsel and directed
the Court and the parties to attached Exhibit A. AVH directs the Court and the parties
to Cal. Gov. Code § 68092.5(a) as an alternate authority for the requested
fees. 
 
As to lodging and mileage, AVH presents that lodging and travel expenses
for counsel at trial are neither listed nor excluded by Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1033.5.
Rather, AVH cites to case law which discusses the court’s discretion to award
costs not specifically identified by the statute. AVH argues that the Court
should use its discretion to award such fees as counsel’s office is in San
Bernardino, a 150-mile round trip that would take four or more hours of travel
per day to complete. Counsel also presents that the time saved was needed to
prepare for trial each day. (See Decl. John R. MacRill, III, ¶ 4.)  
 
As to Item Number Four, Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. §1033.5(a)(3)(A) reads:
 
The following items
are allowable as costs under Section 1032:
 
[. . .]
 
(3)(A) Taking, video
recording, and transcribing necessary depositions, including an original and
one copy of those taken by the claimant and one copy of depositions taken by
the party against whom costs are allowed.
 
The statute does not distinguish
between types of depositions, rather stating only costs for “necessary
depositions” are allowed. A deposition of Ortiz’s expert for trial is
reasonably necessary. Ortiz has not met her burden to show that costs associated with a deposition of
her expert witness, Dr. Jamal, were not reasonable or necessary. Further
support for Dr. Jamal’s fees is found in Cal. Gov. Code § 68092.5(a). 
 
Regarding Item Number 16, the only mention of lodging in Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 1033.5 is “[j]uror food and lodging while they are kept together during
trial and after the jury retires for deliberation.” (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(a)(2).) As to travel expenses, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(3)(C)
provides for “[t]ravel expenses to attend depositions.” There is no discussion
of lodging and mileage to trial. “Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary
to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to
its preparation.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(2).) Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1033.5(c) goes further to provide in subsection (4): “Items not mentioned in
this section and items assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in
the court's discretion.” It is undoubtedly
reasonably necessary for AVH’s counsel to travel to the courthouse in which
trial is to occur. The Court, in its discretion, finds that lodging for counsel
was also reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation due to the
length of the trial, the amount of time travel would have cost AVH’s counsel,
and the necessity of preparation for trial each day by AVH’s counsel.
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Tax Costs as to AVH is GRANTED in part as to the $3,036.99
associated with lodging in Item Number 16, and DENIED as to the $3,350.00 for
the deposition of Dr. Jamal in Item Number Four and the $825.69 for mileage in
Item Number 16.
