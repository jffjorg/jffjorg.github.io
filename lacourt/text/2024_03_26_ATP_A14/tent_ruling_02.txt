The Court notes that there is discrepancy as to Dr. Jamal’s name. Ortiz
addresses Dr. Jamal as “Jamal Darayoush, M.D.” while AVH addresses Dr. Jamal as
“Darayoush Jamal, M.D.” Due to the discrepancy the Court turns to the Medical
Board of California, a source that the Court is allowed to take judicial notice
of under Cal. Evid. Code § 452(c) and (h). The Medical Board of California presents
that Dr. Jamal’s name is “Jamal (last name), Daryoush (first name).” (See Medical
Board of California Online License Search (2024) https://search.dca.ca.gov/details/8002/A/85105/3add449d20478ab30e666d19255132cf
[as of March 14, 2024] [result for search of “Darayoush” as a first name and
“Jamal” as a last name].) The Court address Dr. Jamal by the name on his
medical license as provided by the Medical Board of California.

Ortiz has written this as section as “Section 1033.5(3)(C).” The Court believes
this is a scrivener’s error as Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(3)(c) states “[t]ravel
expenses to attend depositions[,]” which Ortiz relies on.
