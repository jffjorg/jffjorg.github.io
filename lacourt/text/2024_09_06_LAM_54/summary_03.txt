And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer to the complaint filed by the defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs, David Navarro, et al., failed to allege that they purchased a "new" vehicle, which is required under the Song-Beverly Act. The judge found that the plaintiffs' allegations of non-conformities in the vehicle during the express warranty period were sufficient to state a cause of action under the Song-Beverly Act. The judge is persuaded by the reasoning in Stiles v. Kia Motors America, Inc. and has overruled the defendant's demurrer. The defendant is required to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 30 days.
