Background
 
This
is a lemon law action arising out of the purchase by Plaintiff Juan Ocampo
(“Ocampo”) of a 2013 Kia Sorento (the “Vehicle”), manufactured and/or
distributed by Kia Motors America, Inc. (“Defendant” or “Kia”). Plaintiff
alleges that he received an express written warranty in connection with
purchase of the Vehicle, which provided that Defendant would preserve or
maintain the Vehicle during the warranty period or repair the Vehicle to
warranty if a defect developed during the warranty period. According to
Plaintiff, the Vehicle developed defects in a variety of areas during the
warranty period, including its engine, transmission system, ignition, and
steering. Further, and according to Plaintiff, Defendant was provided
sufficient opportunity to repair the Vehicle but was unable to, or failed to,
service the Vehicle, impairing its safety, use and/or value. 
 
Plaintiffs’
Complaint alleged the five causes of action: (1) violation of Civ. Code §
1793.2(d), (2) violation of Civ. Code § 1793.2(b), (3) violation of Civ. Code §
1793.2(a)(3), (4) breach of express written warranty (Civ. Code § 1791.2(a), §
1794), and (5) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability -Civ. Code §
1791.1, § 1794). 
 
On
August 14, 2020, Ocampo’s motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) was granted. The FAC was filed on August 20, 2020. The FAC names Maria
Alonzo Cordova (“Cordova”) as a new Plaintiff and adds a sixth cause of action
for fraud by omission. On October 28, 2020, Defendant’s demurrer to the
FAC’s sixth cause of action was sustained. Defendant’s motion to strike
footnotes 4, 7 and 9 from the FAC was granted.  
 
On
November 16, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”). The
SAC alleges the same causes of action as the FAC. On April 22, 2021, the
court sustained the demurrer to the SAC with leave to amend.
 
On
May 21, 2021, Plaintiffs filed the operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”)
alleging the same five causes alleged in the original Complaint. 
 
On
March 22, 2024, Plaintiffs accepted Kia’s CCP § 998 Offer (the “998 Offer”). On September 10, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
this Motion seeking attorney’s fees. Defendant Kia opposes the Motion. The
matter is now before the court. 
 
Motions
for attorneys’ fees
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Under the Civ. Code § 1794(d), the prevailing party in an
action that arises out of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entitled to
fees that were reasonably incurred:¿ “If the buyer prevails under this section,
the buyer shall be allowed by the Court to recover as part of the judgment a
sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's
fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been
reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿
 
The lodestar method is the primary method for determining a
reasonable attorney fee award under Civ. Code § 1794(d).¿ (See Robertson v.
Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785,
818-19.)¿ “A trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or
lodestar figure, based on the careful compilation of the time spent and
reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney involved in the presentation of
the case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1321 [internal quotations omitted].) “The reasonableness of attorney fees
is within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a
consideration of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity
of the issues, the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time
involved.¿ [citation] The court may also consider whether the amount requested
is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan
(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)¿ “The basis for the trial court's calculation
must be the actual hours counsel has devoted to the case, less those that
result from inefficient or duplicative use of time.”¿(Horsford v. Board of
Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359,
395.)¿“The law is clear, however, that an award of attorney fees may be based
on counsel's declarations, without production of detailed time records.”¿(Raining
Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiffs’
request judicial notice of the following: 
1)    
Exhibit 1: A true and correct copy of
the Consent Order, dated November 20, 2020, between Kia Motors America, Inc.
and the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, In re: Kia Motors America, Inc., RQ17-003, NHTSA Recall
No. 17V-224. 
 
The court denies Plaintiffs’ request for
judicial notice as the request is irrelevant. 
Plaintiffs’ operative complaint no longer includes a fraud claim. “Although a court
may judicially notice a variety of matters (Evid. Code, §¿450 et seq.), only relevant
material may be noticed.” (American Cemwood Corp. v. American Home
Assurance Co. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 431, 441, fn. 7.)  
 
III.      Evidentiary Objections 
 
Plaintiffs’
objection No. 1 to Exhibit 1 of the Declaration of Samuel B. Laughlin is
sustained. Objections Nos. 2 to 4 are overruled. 
 
IV.       Discussion
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel, Consumer Law Experts (“CLE”), moves for $189,949.50
in attorney’s fees. Defendant Kia opposes the motion on the basis that the sum
requested is excessive and unreasonable. (Cohen Decl., Ex. M.) Plaintiffs
assert they are entitled to attorney’s fees as the prevailing party because Plaintiffs
accepted Defendant’s 998 Offer for $57,000.00 and attorney’s fees on March 22,
2024. (Id., ¶ 12(d), Ex. E.) In addition, for filing this fee Motion and
in anticipation of responding to Defendant Kia’s opposition, Plaintiffs seek an
additional $3,937.50 in attorney’s fees. (Id., ¶ 25.)
 
A.        Reasonable
Hourly Rates¿¿ 
¿ 
In setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are
entitled to consider the rate of “fees customarily charged by that attorney and
others in the community for similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Information
Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per
hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus.
(1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664; see also Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v.
Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009 [“[R]ate determinations in other
cases, particularly those setting a rate for the plaintiffs' attorney, are
satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market rate.”].)
 
The hourly billing rates of CLE’s attorneys in this action are as
follows: 
 

Jessica Anvar (managing attorney) 17 years of
     experience - 2.7 x $550/hour = $1,485.00 
Benjamin Beck (former partner) 14 years of experience-
     2.3 x $525/hour = $1,207.50 
Daniel Choi (former associate) 11 years of experience -
     132.8 x $475/hour = $63,080.00 
Jordan G. Cohen (senior partner) 12 years of experience
     - 108.7 x $525/hour = $57,067.50 
Andrew Dickson (associate) 10 years of experience - 9.9
     x $425/hour = $4,207.50 
Iraida Gonzalez (senior associate) 4 years of
     experience- 53.5 x $425/hour = $22,737.50 
Corinna Jiang (5 years of experience) - 9.9 x $430/hour
     = $4,257.00 
Elvin Vu (former associate) 9 years of experience- 42 x
     $425/hour = $17,850.00 

 
(Cohen Decl., ¶¶ 13-22, Ex. M.) 
 
The hourly billing rate of CLE’s paralegals in this action was
$200.00/hour. 
 

Elaine Astorga (paralegal) -1.3 x $200/hour = $260.00 
Kathy Carreño (paralegal) - 3.4 x $200/hour = $680.00 
David Gomez (paralegal)- 2.4 x $200/hour = $480.00 
Daisey Hernandez (paralegal) - 3.8 x $200/hour =
     $760.00 
Clarence Serrano (paralegal) - 1.0 x $200/hour =
     $200.00 
Virginia Walls 
     (paralegal) - 13.7 x $200/hour =$2,740.00 

 
(Cohen Decl., ¶ 21). The total number of hours billed was 387.4
hours resulting in a fee of $177,012.00. (Id., Ex. M.) 
 
Attorney Cohen asserts that 5 years ago, when he had 7 years of
experience, his hourly rate $450.00 per hour was approved. (Cohen Decl., ¶ 22,
Ex. F.) In 2023, Mr. Cohen’s hourly rate of $510.00 and $525.00 per hour was
approved by other courts. (Id., Ex. G, H, I, J, K.) Ms. Anvar’s hourly
rate of $525.00 per hour was approved by a court in 2023. (Id., Ex. G,
H, K.) The court further notes that in 2020, CLE’s paralegal rates were $175.00
per hour. (Id., Ex. G, H, K.) In December 2023, Corrinna Jiang, who only
had 4 years of experience, had approved an hourly rate of $325.00 per
hour. (Id., Ex. K.) 
 
Defendant Kia asserts all hourly rates above $350.00/hour should
be reduced to $350.00/hour  because this
action was a noncomplex lemon law case. In support of this proposition,
Defendant Kia relies on Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020)
48 Cal.App.5th 240 (Mikhaeilpoor). In Mikhaeilpoor, the trial reduced
the attorneys’ hourly rates to $350.00/hour for all of the plaintiff’s
attorneys despite the plaintiff’s counsels’ hourly rates ranging from
$595.00/hour to $325.00/hour. (Id., at p. 245.) The Mikhaeilpoor Court
upheld the trial court’s decision agreeing with the trial court’s finding that
the hourly rates for a simple lemon law action were excessive, the case was
overstaffed, and $350.00/hour was an hourly rate reflective of the work
performed by all 10 attorneys. (Id., at p. 256 [“As such, the trial
court's award of a $350 hourly billable rate is supported by substantial
evidence.”].)
 
Despite eight attorneys staffing this action, CLE asserts during
the four years this action was pending, 93% of the attorney time billed in this
action was billed by four primary handling attorneys. “First, Elvin Vu, who
left the firm in approximately May 2021; second, Daniel Choi, who left the firm
in approximately June of 2022; third, Iraida Gonzalez” who later handed the
matter to Jordan Cohen for trial preparation. (Supp. Cohen Decl., ¶ 4.) 
 
The court fails to see why this case necessitated the involvement
of three partners: Mr. Cohen, Ms. Anvar, and Mr. Beck. Moreover, despite the
case requiring the involvement of three CLE partners, the case was also
staffed by senior attorneys, Daniel Choi, Andrew Dickerson, and Elvin Vu,
despite the availability of less expensive associates. 
 
The billing rates of Elvin Vu and Andrew Dickenson, who have nine
and 10 years of experience respectively, are $425.00 while Daniel Choi, with 11
years of experience, has a billing rate of $475.00 per hour, resulting in more
than an .11% increase per year of experience. CLE failed to provide any
evidence that other courts have found Daniel Choi’s hourly rate of $475.00 reasonable.

 
Ms. Jian, with five years of experience, reported a billing rate
of $430 for this action.  Last year, her
hourly rate was only $350.00 per hour. (Cohen Decl., Ex. K.) Similarly, Ms.
Gonzalez, with four years of experience, is requesting an hourly of $425.00 per
hour, significantly higher than what Ms. Jian’s hourly rate was for four years
of experience. 
 
Paralegals for this matter had a billing rate of $200.00 per hour,
even though in 2023, their billing rate was $175.00 per hour. (Cohen, Decl.,
Ex. G, H, K.) This case was filed in 2019, yet since 2019 paralegals have
billed at a rate of $200.00/per hour. 
 
For these reasons, the court finds that CLE has inflated its
billing rate and overstaffed this action resulting in various billing
inefficiencies. Moreover, unlike the Mikhaeilpoor case, this action
never went to trial. While this case was filed in 2019, the billing rates of
CLE’s staff are all billed at 2024 rates rather than their past rates.
Accordingly, the court agrees that CLE’s hourly rates need to be reduced and
the rates are excessive. The court concludes that a billing rate of $460.00 for
the senior attorneys who worked on this matter is the reasonable hourly rate
for the services rendered in this action. 
This action was not complex and did not go to trial.  The court also reduces the hourly rates of
Corinna Jiang and Iraida Gonzalez to $330.00/hour and $325.00/hour. 
 
The court awards hourly rates for CLE’s attorneys and paralegals
as follows: 
 

Jessica Anvar - 2.7 x $460/hour = $1,242.00
Benjemen Beck - 2.3 x $460/hour = $1,058.00
Daniel Choi - 132.8 x $460/hour = $61,088.00
Jordan G. Cohen - 108.7 x $460/hour = $50,002.00
Andrew Dickson - 9.9 x $425/hour = $4,207.50
Iraida Gonzalez - 53.5 x $325/hour = $17,387.50
Corinna Jiang - 9.9 x $330/hour = $3,267.00
Elvin Vu - 42 x $425/hour = $17,850.00

 
Total $156,102.00
 

Elaine Astorga (paralegal) -1.3 x $175/hour =$227.50
Kathy Carreño (paralegal) - 3.4 x $175/hour = $595.00
David Gomez (paralegal)- 2.4 x $175/hour = $420.00
Daisey Hernandez (paralegal) - 3.8 x $175/hour =
     $665.00
Clarence Serrano (paralegal) - 1.0 x $175/hour =
     $175.00
Virginia Walls 
     (paralegal) - 13.7 x $175/hour =$2,397.50

 
Total: $4,479.50
 
Thus far, the adjusted lodestar is $160,581.50. 
 
B.        Time Reasonably
Spent on the Litigation¿ 
¿ 
“‘In challenging attorney fees as excessive
because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging
party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and
citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive,
duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.’ ” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez¿(2014)
230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488, citing Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163¿Cal.App.4th¿550, 564.) The court
will exercise its discretion in determining whether Plaintiffs’ request for attorney’s
fees is reasonable by considering the following factors: the nature of
litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in handling
the matter, the attention given, the success or failure, and the resulting
judgment. (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623.)¿¿¿  
¿ 
CLE asserts that they reasonably spent about
387.4 hours totaling $177,012.00 in fees litigating this action. (Cohen, Decl., Ex. M.) 
 
Defendant Kia objects to the following billing entries:
 
a)         Time Billed for
Drafting the Pleadings 
 
Defendants object to the fact that CLE billed 21.10 hours and
incurred $9,132.50 in fees just to draft the pleadings. However, Defendant
fails to show that Plaintiff’s spent 21.10 hours on the pleadings and fails to
point to the specific billing objections. 
 
Having reviewed the billing entries, the court notes that the
original Complaint was reviewed and drafted by Jessica Anvar. On January 1,
2020, Benjamen Beck billed for reviewing and revising the FAC. By January
1,  2020, the FAC, which added the fraud
cause of action had already been drafted. Nevertheless, Bejamin Beck and Elvin
Vu would both bill time to draft a simple motion for leave to amend the
complaint after January 2020. Beginning March 13, 2020, Elvin Vu would also
begin billing for drafting and reviewing the FAC. Despite being responsible for
drafting the FAC, Elvin Vu billed for administrative tasks such as “review of
filing” and “case review on April 14, and April 24, 2020, June 5, 2020, June
12, 2020, June 22, 2020, August 3, 2020.” 
 
In drafting the motion for leave to amend and revise the FAC,
Elvin Vu should have billed no more than 4.0 hours billed at a rate of
$425.00/hour given that she had 9 years of experience. Therefore, of the
approximately 13.0 hours spent on the motion for leave to amend and the FAC,
9.0 hours, or $3,825.00 will be subtracted from the lodestar. 
 
                        b)        Excessive Time Discussing and Conferring
with Other Attorneys/Staff
Defendant Kia asserts that CLE billed at least 6.2 hours
($2,812.50) just to review upcoming hearings and discuss and review the case
with other attorneys and/or staff. Having reviewed the CLE billing statements,
the court finds that while Elvin Vu, Daniel Choi, Iraida Gonzalez, billed for
debriefing and conferring with the supervising attorney, the entries were
sporadic, not excessive. However, there are billing discrepancies. On April 8,
2020, Elvin Vu billed 0.6 hours for “conferring with supervising attorney”
while on that same date Benjeman Beck billed 0.2 of an hour for the same;
“Confer with handling attorney re strategy going forward.” (Cohen, Ex. M.) 
 
As the time spent conferring between the handling attorney and the
supervising attorney is suspect, the court will deduct 5.0 hours billed at a
rate of $460.00, or $2,576.00, 
from the lodestar. 
 
                        c)
        Time Billed For Non-Existent
Events. 
 
Defendant Kia contends that CLE’s billing records contain entries
for non-existent events such as 1.6 hours ($760) to “Appearing for D’s MTC
hearing” on February 24, 2022, despite there being no hearing for that date.
The records reflects that there was no hearing for said date and Plaintiffs’
reply fails to address this contention. 
 
Defendant Kia further complains about entries dated May 21, 2021,
but the billing entries do not reflect Defendant Kia’s contention and appear to
be proper. The billing entries of September 13, 2022, October 21, 2022, October
24, 2022, and May 19, 2023, appear proper and do support Defendant Kia’s
contention that the billing was nonexistent o unnecessary events. 
 
Therefore, the only deduction the court will make a deduction for
1.6 hours billed at a rate of $460.00, or $736.00. 
 
                        d)        Time Billed for Administrative Tasks and
Overhead
 
Defendant Kia asserts that CLE’s billing records should be reduced
because its billing statements are filled with entries for clerical and
administrative tasks that are not recoverable as attorney’s fees. (See Nadarajah
v. Holder (9th Cir. 2009) 569 F.3d 906, 921 [“When clerical tasks are
billed at hourly rates, the court should reduce the hours requested to account
for the billing errors.”].) Defendant Kia asserts that the billing entries of
Virginia Walls and Daisey Hernandez are not recoverable as attorneys’ fees
because the two paralegals billed for purely clerical tasks such as updating
the calendar, reviewing the docket, labeling exhibits, and making reservations.

 
Plaintiffs maintain that paralegal fees are recoverable as
attorney fees. “We think, however, necessary support services for attorneys,
e.g. secretarial and paralegal services, are includable within an award of
attorney fees.” (Salton Bay Marina, Inc. v. Imperial Irrigation Dist.
(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 914, 951.) “An award of attorney fees which does not
compensate for paralegal service time would not fully compensate the attorney.”
(Guinn v. Dotson (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 262, 269.) The court agrees that
Plaintiffs are entitled to recover fees for time billed by paralegals and that
such a practice “is consistent with market rates and practices.” (Guinn,
at p. 269.) 
 
Defendant Kia also takes issue with the fact that attorneys like
Corrinna Jiang and Iraida Gonzalez billed for administrative tasks such as
“organize exhibition exhibits” on September 9, 2021, and for “receiving
documents” on October 11, 2022. “ ‘It is appropriate to distinguish between
legal work, in the strict sense, and investigation, clerical work, compilation
of facts and statistics and other work which can often be accomplished by
non-lawyers but which a lawyer may do because he has no other help available.
Such non-legal work may command a lesser rate. Its dollar value is not enhanced
just because a lawyer does it. ’ ” (Missouri v. Jenkins by Agyei (1989)
491 U.S. 274, 288, fn. 10.) “[T]he filing, transcript, and document
organization time was clerical in nature and should have been subsumed in firm
overhead rather than billed at paralegal rates.” (Nadarajah v. Holder
(9th Cir. 2009) 569 F.3d 906, 921.) 
 
The court agrees that it is inappropriate for clerical tasks
performed by attorneys to be billed at attorney rates because the costs of
completing such tasks are part of overhead costs and are appropriately absorbed
and compensated by an attorney’s higher fee rates. “However, clerical and other
overhead expenses are ordinarily included in an attorney's hourly rates and are
not separately recoverable unless they represent expenses ordinarily billed to
a client.” (City of Oakland v. McCullough (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1, 7.)
 
CLE’s billing records reflect various instances of attorneys
billing for clerical tasks or block billing for clerical tasks performed
alongside legal work. Elvin Vu billed time to pull documents, review service
and filing, and for conferring receipt of “cmc draft” and “discovery
extension.” For example, on May 22, 2020, Elvin Vu billed for “Hearing dates
and calendaring e email.” 
 
On August 3, August 24, and October 4, 2021, Daniel Choi billed
entries reflect billing for organizing exhibits. Daniel Choi also billed for
conducting electronic service even though such a task could have been completed
by a paralegal. Daniel Choi’s billing entries for November 4, November 8, and
December 8, 2021, reflect time billed for serving supplemental responses and
objections.
 
 Iraida Gonzalez billed time
spent for “Assigned LIT CM a task re ex parte to continue trial” and “2022
Assigned tasks to LIT CM regarding trial continuance” on September 29 and
September 30, 2022. Iraida Gonzalez also billed for time spent requesting
copies from Titan Legal Services when such a task could have been completed by
a paralegal and billed at a lower rate. On June 2, 2023, Iraida Gonzalez also
billed for “proof of service and served to Opposing Counsel.” 
 
As the billing entries of CLE’s counsel include various instances
of attorney’s billing for administrative tasks, to account for any billing
errors the court deducts 25%, or $40,145.25, from the $160,581.50
lodestar. 
 
                        e)         Time Billed to Depose Dealership
Witnesses and Defense Expert
 
Defendant Kia asserts that CLE billed at least 54.90 hours
totaling $23,895.00 to depose unnecessary dealership witnesses because the
service advisors and technicians who work on hundreds of vehicles cannot
remember each one and they already keep a contemporaneous record of their work
on the repair orders. 
Plaintiffs assert that 4.4 hours spent preparing for a 3.3 hour
deposition of Kia’s expert, Jeff Richards, was reasonable. Plaintiffs further
assert that the 8.9 hours billed by CLE for reviewing the deposition
transcripts of dealership personnel were reasonable because they were in
preparation for trial. CLE adds that less than 1.0 hours billed to review 100
pages of transcripts for each of the eight dealership witnesses was reasonable.

 
Defendant Kia failed to show that taking the depositions of
dealership personnel was not necessary in this action. Even if the depositions
were only conducted to authenticate repair records, Defendant Kia fails to show
that it offered to stipulate to the authenticity of these records or the number
of repairs of the Subject Vehicle such that depositions were not necessary. In
the absence of such a showing, the court declines to deduct fees for time spent
deposing dealership personnel and reviewing transcripts. 
 
                        f)         Time Billed on Discovery
 
Defendant Kia objects to the 12.3 hours billed, or $5,272.50, for
drafting written discovery. 
Kia asserts that Plaintiffs unnecessarily billed for additional
sets (January 5, 2021, 1.1 hours for $467.50; January 6, 2021, 0.7 hours
for $297.50), researching documents to prepare written discovery (May 25, 2021,
0.9 hours for $427.50), and reviewing KA’s discovery responses (various
September 19, 2022 entries, subtotaling 4.9 hours for $2,082.50). Defendant Kia
also contends that on March 17, 2020, April 1, 2020, April 2, 2020, and
November 4, 2021, Plaintiffs’ attorneys billed 3.5 hours, for a total of $1,365
to draft responses to Defendant’s standard discovery requests. Plaintiffs’
responses were generic when compared to other responses served by
the Plaintiffs and were unnecessary and excessive. 
 
Plaintiffs fail to address the contention that the excessively
billed for written discovery. 
 
However, Plaintiffs did assert that Defendant Kia submitted
“boilerplate objections” to Plaintiffs’ written discovery. (Motion, at p.
5:16.) Elvin Vu and Danil Choi billed less than three hours to review Defendant
Kia’s discovery responses but on September 19, 2022, Iraida Gonzalez would
begin billing about 13.9 hours to review Kia’s discovery responses, despite
representations that the responses contained boilerplate objections. These
hours exclude the time billed by Ms. Gonzalez in anticipation of preparing for
the IDC. 
 
Therefore, 11.9 hours billed at a rate of $325.00/hour, or $3,687.50,
will be deducted from the lodestar. 
 
Defendant Kia also asserts that on April 7, 2020, Plaintiffs
produced exactly 19 pages of documents, which consisted of copies of drivers’
licenses, repair order, and a demand letter. (Laughlin Decl., ¶ 6(H).) Kia
asserts that Plaintiff’s counsel billed 1.2 hours to prepare this production
when it only should have taken 5 minutes. The court agrees and deducts 0.7 hour
billed at a rate of $425.00, or $297.00, from the lodestar. 
 
Defendant Kia asserts that the Plaintiffs billed excessively
for motions to compel document production, given that this was a simple lemon
law action, and the repair orders were already in the Plaintiffs’
possession. 
Defendant Kia asserts that starting with a meet and confer letter
on May 19, 2020, Plaintiff spent over 13.4 hours ($6,067.50) billing for filing
motions to compel, eventually resulting in an 
IDC before this court. Defendant Kia asserts that the motions to compel
were unnecessary because the Plaintiffs sought documents involving other
vehicles and the request was not proportional to the needs of the case.
Defendant Kia fails to show which specific billing entries show that CLE billed
13.4 hours for preparing motions to compel. The court’s review of CLE’s billing
records does not support Kia’s contention.
 
On July 18, 2021, Corinna Jiang billed 0.9 hour in part to review
the motion to compel, while on July 16, 2021, and July 17, 2021, Daniel Choi
billed 3.5 hours for the same task. As this court requires an IDC before filing
a motion to compel, the court agrees that the motions were unnecessary.
Therefore 0.9 hours billed at a rate of $330.00/hour, or $637.00,
and 3.5 hours billed at a rate of $460/hour, or $1,610.00, will be
deducted from the lodestar. 
 
Defendant Kia further asserts that billing on the motions to
compel KIA’s PMQ were excessive. Kia also fails to show that Plaintiffs’ billing,
including the meeting and conferring regarding disputes over Kia PMQ, were not
reasonably necessary to the litigation or excessive, given that despite
Plaintiffs’ requests, the PMQ did not occur until December 8, 2021. Therefore,
no deductions as to this matter will be made. 
 
                        g)         Time Billed for Excessive Tasks
 
Defendant Kia asserts that CLE billed excessively for the
following tasks: 
 

6/4/2020 - review of the 998 offer - Elvin Vu for 0.3 hours
     of work billed at $425/hour totaling $127.50 
6/5/2020 - Receipt and review of Kia's 998 - Elaine Astorga
     for 0.1 hours of work billed at 
     $200/hour totaling $20.00 
6/12/2020 - review of file and signed PO - Elvin Vu for 0.5
     hours of work billed at $425/hour totaling $212.50 
7/24/2020 - Review of CMS - Elvin Vu for 0.4  hours of work billed at 425/hour
     totaling $170.00 
9/16/2021 - Review of notices of deposition of Juan Ocampo
     and Maria Alonzo. Drafting objections to both NODs -  Daniel Choi for 1.1 hours of work billed
     a $475/hour totaling $522.50
 1/17/2024 - Draft
     correspondence to client confirming authorization to reject 998 offer
     -Jordan Cohen for 0.4 hours of work billed at $525/hour totaling $210.00 
1/23/2024 -Remote appearance at Court Hearing: FSC - Iraida
     Gonzalez for 1.1 hours of work billed at $425/00 totaling $467.50

 
As deductions to hourly rates and billing have already been made
to account for any billing errors for time spent on administrative tasks, the
court declines to make further deductions for billing for excessive tasks. 
 
However, the court agrees that January 23, 2024 billing by Iraida
Gonzalez for appearing at the final conference is excessive as Mr. Cohen made
an in-person appearance and the case settled on that day in court. The court
deducts 1.1 hours billed at a rate of $325.00/hour, or $357.00, from the
lodestar. 
 
h)        Time Billed on
NHTSA Recall
 
Defendant Kia asserts that on July 4, 2021, CLE unnecessarily
billed 1.2 hours ($510.00) for NHTSA Recall 17V-224 because the recall was only
relevant to Plaintiffs’ fraud claims. The court agrees. 
 
Plaintiffs’ FAC and SAC filed respectively on August 14, 2020, and
November 16, 2020, were the only complaints where Plaintiffs asserted a claim
for fraud. When the Plaintiffs filed the operative TAC on May 21, 2021,
the fraud claim was not included. Plaintiffs fail to explain why research into
NHTSA Recall 17V-224 was needed after the fraud claim had been dismissed.
Therefore, 1.2 hours billed at a rate of $425.00, or $510.00, will be
deducted from the lodestar. 
 
                        i)         Time Billed to Finalize Settlement
 
Defendant Kia asserts that CLE billed 3.7 hours ($1,812.50) to negotiate
a standard lemon law settlement agreement that was not dissimilar to other
settlements negotiated by the parties. Plaintiffs’ counsel asserts that
settlement was hindered by Kia’s initial refusal to include a timing provision
in the release that Plaintiffs insisted on. (Cohen Supp. Decl., ¶ 9.) CLE
asserts that Kia agreed to the timing provision and subsequently violated the
provision. (Id.) The court sees no reason to reduce the time spent
finalizing the settlement. 
 
                        j)         Time
Billed for Travel
 
Defendant Kia asserts that CLE billed a total of 7.0 hours
($3,387.00) for time spent traveling to hearings and depositions without citing
any authority permitting the recovery of such costs. Plaintiffs assert that
under the Song-Beverly Act, CLE is entitled to “an award of reasonable attorney
fees for time reasonably expended by his or her attorney.” (Robertson v.
Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785,
818.)
 
California case law holds that attorneys are compensated for
travel costs, not for the attorney's time spent traveling. “As to the
out-of-town travel expenses, the court finds that item to be reasonable in
amount and the type of expense that would ordinarily be charged to the client.
In the circumstances of this case, the court concludes that equity requires
that plaintiffs' counsel be reimbursed for travel expenses necessarily incurred
during the litigation.” (Keith v. Volpe (C.D. Cal. 1980) 501
F.Supp. 403, 414–415.) “The trial court did not err in awarding costs incurred
by Bakersfield attorneys to attend depositions in San Diego County.” (Thon
v. Thompson (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1546, 1548.) “The court did not abuse its
discretion in allowing the costs of travel to and from depositions in New
Mexico and Texas.” (Chaaban v. Wet Seal, Inc. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 49,
60.) 
 
CLE may recover travel costs, but the court is not persuaded that
attorney compensation for time spent merely traveling is reasonable under the
Song-Beverly Act. The appearances for which CLE attorneys are seeking fees
could have been made remotely.  On June 9,
2023, Andrew Dickson billed 1.5 hours at a rate of $425.00/hour for travel
time. Accordingly, $637.50  will
be subtracted from the lodestar. Jorden Cohen billed 3.8 hours for travel time.
Accordingly, 3.8 hours billed at a rate of $460.00 per hour, or $598.00,
will be deducted from the lodestar. 
 
                        k)        Deductions
for Block Billing 
 
Defendant Kia asserts that Plaintiff block billed in the amount of
14.4 hours, totaling $5,985.00. (See chart at Laughlin Decl., ¶ 12(P). “While
not per se objectionable, block billing can exacerbate the vagueness of an
attorney fee request and support a court’s finding that time entries were
inflated and non-compensable. (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
 (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1325-1326.) “[T]rial courts are granted discretion ‘to penalize [block
billing] when the practice prevents them from discerning which tasks are
compensable and which are not.’ [Citation.]” (In re Marriage of Nassimi (2016)
3Cal.App.5th 667, 695-696.) 
 
The court agrees that CLE blocked billed many entries and that
several entries are vague as to what actual work was performed. The court
deducts $5,000.00 from the lodestar. 
 
                        l) Time Billed for Fee Motion
 
Defendant Kia asserts that CLE excessively billed 14.6 hours  ($7,665.00) for this fee motion, and that the
time Plaintiffs’ counsel anticipates billing to review the opposition and draft
the reply are also excessive. 
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel asserts that he anticipates billing 7.0 hours
to review the opposition, draft a reply, and attend the hearing billed at a
rate of $525.00 per hour ($3,937.50.) (Cohen Decl., ¶ 25.) Plaintiffs’ counsel
billed 14.6 hours drafting the initial fee motion. However, Plaintiffs’ counsel
failed to provide evidence to support the fee request of attorneys Daniel Choi,
Andrew Dickson, and Elvin Vu. Plaintiffs’ counsel asserts that the $475.00
billing rate of Rodney Gi’ at $475.00 was reasonable despite Rodney Gi not
being an attorney who staffed this matter. Moreover, the fact that CLE’s staff
billed at 2024 rates since the inception of this case, lends little credibility
that CLE’s billing records were properly audited. (Cohen Decl., ¶ 24.) 
 
The court finds that Plaintiffs’ counsel should have billed no
more than 6.0 hours to draft this initial fee motion, and 4.5 hours to review,
draft, the reply, and attend the hearing. 
 

14.6 hours billed at a rate of  $460.00/hour = $6,716.00
6.0 hours billed at a rate of $460.00/hour = $2,760.00
$6,716.00 - $2,760.00 = $3,956.00

 
The court deducts $7,893.50 ($3,956.00 + 3,937.50) from the
lodestar.
 
C.        Adjusted Lodestar

the lodestar of $160,581.50, the court
makes the following deductions:
