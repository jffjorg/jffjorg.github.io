And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Robert O'Neill's motion to continue the trial, which was scheduled for August 5, 2024. The motion was filed due to the need for more time to complete discovery proceedings. The judge found that the defendant had not shown good cause for the continuance and that there were alternative means to address the issue, such as serving a notice under CCP ยง 2025.230 to require the plaintiff to produce the most qualified person to testify. The judge also noted that the defendant had not responded to the plaintiff's arguments that the delay in discovery was the fault of the defendant. The judge concludes that the motion to continue trial is denied, and it is so ordered.
