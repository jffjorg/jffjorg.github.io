Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendants' motion to transfer venue from Los Angeles County to Orange County. The motion was made under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 397, which allows the court to change the place of trial when the court designated in the complaint is not the proper court. The Judge found that the Defendants have made a proper showing of non-residence in Los Angeles County and that the burden is on the Plaintiff to show that the case comes clearly within one of the statutory exceptions to the general rule that actions are triable in the place of the defendant's residence. The Judge concluded that the case is about the recognition of a foreign country money judgment and has no ties to Los Angeles County, and therefore, the action should be transferred to Orange County.
