Significant Statements:
  - "The SOD must provide actual notice of the nature and amount of damages being sought by plaintiff—i.e., the potential liability defendant faces."
  - "With no SOD served, request for entry of default judgment is premature as default itself was prematurely entered."
  - "As Defendant was not served with a SOD—which is designed to give defendants “one last clear chance” to respond to the allegations of the complaint by providing them with actual notice of their exact potential liability—the default judgment application is premature as default was prematurely entered."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a default judgment application and a motion to be relieved as counsel. The plaintiff, Armando Parras, seeks a default judgment against the defendant, Pico Mobility, LLC, in the amount of $29,074.11. However, the judge has denied the application without prejudice due to two defects. Firstly, the plaintiff has not served the defendant with a statement of damages (SOD), which is required to give the defendant notice of the potential liability. Secondly, the plaintiff has not explained how it calculated its general damages.

The judge has also granted the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Timothy M. Ghobrial, the plaintiff's counsel. The motion was granted due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the fact that the defendant is in default, making it unnecessary for immediate or urgent counsel. However, the judge noted that the proof of service attached to the motion did not indicate that the defendant had been served with the motion and order relieving the counsel.
