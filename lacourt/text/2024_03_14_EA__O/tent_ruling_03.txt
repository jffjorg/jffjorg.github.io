Background
 
On September
20, 2022, SHENZHEN QIANHAI BAOPING ASSET MANAGEMENT CO., Ltd Filed Suit Against
Defendants JINGGANG YAN, XIUHONG LIANG for recognition and enforcement of
foreign country money judgment under uniform foreign country money judgments
recognition act. 
 
On November
14, 2022, default was entered against Defendants. 
 
On February
21, 2023, the court denied Plaintiff’s application for default judgment.
 
On April 6,
2023, the court granted default judgment in the total amount of $9,613,252.20.
 
On October
30, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to set aside default and default judgment
and writs of execution, which the court granted on 12/14/23.
 
On January
29, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion. 
 
On February 13, 2024, a Writ -
Return was filed. 
Legal Standard
Defendants bring forth the instant motion pursuant to CCP section 397.
In turn, the general venue
rule is that “the superior court in the county where the defendants or some of
them reside at the commencement of the action is the proper court for the trial
of the action.” (Code Civ. Pro., § 395(a).) As such, the court may, on
motion, change the place of trial “when the court designated in the complaint
is not the proper court.” (Code of Civ. Pro., § 397, subd. (a).) Where a
defendant has made a proper showing of nonresidence, the burden is on the
plaintiff to show that the case comes clearly within one of the statutory
exceptions to the general rule that actions are triable in the place of the
defendant’s residence. [Citation.]” (California State Parks Foundation v.
Superior Court (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826, 833.)
Discussion
Venue rules designate a particular county within California as the “proper” place for
trial of the action. The purpose of the venue rules is to protect defendants
from being forced to trial at some remote location. (See Motion p. 2,
quoting Kaluzok v. Brisson (1946) 27 Cal.2d 760, 763 [“The right of a
plaintiff to have an action tried in a county other than that of the
defendant’s residence is exceptional.”].) For
venue purposes, a person's residence is interpreted as domicile; i.e., the
place where the person resides with the intent to remain indefinitely. (Enter
v. Crutcher (1958) 159 Cal.App.2d 841, 844-845.) “Venue is determined based
on the complaint on file at the time the motion to change venue is made.” (Brown v. Superior Court (1984)
37 Cal.3d 477, 482.) 
Here, though the complaint alleges that Defendants reside in Los Angeles
County, Defendants set
forth evidence that they reside in Orange County. (See Liang Decl. “I am
a resident of Orange County, California and have been a resident of Orange
County continuously since around August 2018.”]; See Yan Decl., ¶3 [“Angeles
County, Defendants set forth evidence that they reside in Orange County. (See Liang
Decl., ¶3 [“I am a resident of Orange County, California and have been a
resident of Orange County continuously since around August 2018.”].)
To the extent that Plaintiff may argue that the convenience of witness
and the ends of justice will be served by keeping this action in Los Angeles
County, this case is about recognition of an alleged Chinese judgment; the
Complaint is entirely devoid of any ties to Los Angeles. (Motion p. 3.) 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted; the action is transferred
to Orange County.
