Jahanbin v.
Douglas et al., Case No. 24SMUD00098
Hearing Date March
1, 2024
Defendants Douglas
and English’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint 
 
In this unlawful
detainer matter, defendants demur, arguing the thirty-day notice to vacate for
cause does not comply with the Santa Monica Rent Control Charter Amendment and
its regulations. 
 
SMRCCA §1806(a) establishes
a just cause standard for evictions in Santa Monica. Regulation 9001 requires a
notice of eviction under the SMRCCA to “contain a specific statement of the
reasons for the termination with specific facts to permit a determination of
the date, place, witnesses and circumstances concerning the reason for the
eviction.” 
 
Defendants demur
on the grounds that the 30-day notice does not state the date of the alleged breach.
The regulation does not require the notice to state the date of the breach,
only to set forth specific facts by which the date can be determined. The
notice is detailed and specific, alleging defendants “illegally installed a
doorway . . . installed new drywall,” in violation of the Santa Monica
Municipal Code and continued in their illegal use of the property despite
written notice to cease. Complaint pg. 5. 
 
The notice alleges
“[t]hese violations have persisted for several months inside your unit,
specifically the garage[.]” The notice contains enough facts for plaintiffs to
determine the date the alleged illegal construction was performed. The
thirty-day notice is sufficiently specific under the SMRCCA and regulation
9001. OVERRULED.
