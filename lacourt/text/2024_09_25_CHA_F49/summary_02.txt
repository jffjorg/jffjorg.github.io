And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Defendant Jose Manuel Armando Lorenzo-Reyes's Counsel, Jeffrey Baraban. The Motion was filed on July 24, 2024, and the Judge has continued it to allow Counsel an opportunity to address deficiencies in the declarations and proof of service. The Judge notes that Counsel's reasons for seeking relief are satisfactory, but that there are contradictions in the declarations regarding the verification of the client's current address. The Judge also notes that the Proof of Service does not show that Defendant Levalley has been served with the Motion, and therefore requires that the Motion papers be served on Defendant Levalley. The next hearing in the case is set for November 14, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department F49.
