RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Austin Smith
NOTICE: OK.

REQUESTED: An

without objection, to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, within 15
days, and imposing monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Austin Smith and his

TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The request for monetary
sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs Taylor Peacock (“Peacock”) and Austin Smith
(“Smith”) (collectively “Plaintiffs”) brought this action under Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act (Lemon Law), Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act over alleged defects in their 2020 Ford Expedition
(the “Subject Vehicle”), which was manufactured by Defendant Ford Motor Company
(“FMC”). Plaintiffs entered into a warranty contract with Defendant FMC on or
about December 19, 2020.
 
On January 31, 2023, Plaintiffs initiated this action.
Subsequently, on May 26, 2023, the Department F47 Court sustained a demurrer
filed by Defendant FMC on April 10, 2023.
 
On June 23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants FMC and AutoNation Ford Valencia
(“AutoNation Ford”), and Does 1 through 10, alleging the following causes of
action: (1) Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code Section 1793.2, (2) Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section
1793.2, (3) Violation of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2, (4)
Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability (Civ. Code §§ 1791.1, 1794,
1795.5), (5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment, (6) Negligent Repair, (7)
Violation of Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Civ. Code § 1750 et seq.), and (8)
Violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The First through Fifth, and
Seventh through Eighth Causes of Action are alleged against Defendant FMC. The
Sixth Cause of Action is alleged against AutoNation Ford. Subsequently, on
December 5, 2023, the Department F47 Court sustained FMC’s demurrer to the
Third and Fifth Causes of Action.
 
On May 6, 2024, AutoNation Ford
filed the instant Motion to Compel Plaintiff Smith’s Responses to Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One (the “Motion”). 
 
Subsequently, on September 12,
2024, Plaintiff Smith filed his Opposition to the Motion, and AutoNation Ford
replied on September 18, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Within 30 days after service of a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand is directed shall serve the
original of the response to it on the party making the demand, and a copy of
the response on all other parties who have appeared in the action, unless on
motion of the party making the demand, the court has shortened the time for
response, or unless on motion of the party to whom the demand has been
directed, the court has extended the time for response.” (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 2031.260, subd. (a).)
 
“If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210,
2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One
 
AutoNation Ford’s counsel
(“Counsel”) attests that on March 7, 2024, Plaintiff Smith was served with the
first set of Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (the “Requests”).
(Geraghty Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. “2.”) After not received any responses by the due
date, Counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel a written meet and confer letter on
April 24, 2024, requesting Plaintiff Smith to serve his responses, without
objection, by April 29, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5, Ex. “3.”) On May 6, 2024,
Counsel attempted to contact Plaintiff’s counsel via telephone, but was
unsuccessful.  (Id. ¶ 6.) Despite
these efforts, no responses were received from Plaintiff Smith at the time of
the filing of the Motion. (Id. ¶ 8.) Subsequently, Plaintiffs’ counsel
served verified discovery responses to AutoNation Ford on August 28, 2024.
(Sanaia Decl. ¶ 8.)
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Plaintiff Smith failed to serve a timely response,
thereby waiving any objection to the Requests, including those based on
privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a). 
 
Nevertheless, under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), the court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2033.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 
Here,
Plaintiff Smith’s counsel contends that she was not aware of outstanding
discovery responses, until August 26, 2024, when the opposition to the Motion
became due. (Sanaia Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10.) Plaintiffs made a good faith attempt to
immediately respond to Defendant’s Discovery Requests. (Id. ¶ 7.) “The
reason for this delay is due to a calendaring error. Upon further
investigation, we noticed the deadline to serve Discovery Responses was not
properly calendared. Calendaring Department of Plaintiffs’ Counsel is
responsible for making sure that due dates and deadlines are calendared, and
that Plaintiffs’ attorneys are made aware of these deadlines. Because of this
inadvertent and excusable mistake made by the Calendaring Department,
Plaintiffs failed to respond to Defendant’s discovery requests in a timely
manner.” (Id. ¶ 9.)
 
Established case law holds
that errors such as misreading a calendar do not qualify as excusable neglect
absent extraordinary circumstances. (See Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 674). Similarly, simple carelessness, lack of diligence, or neglect
without reasonable justification is not excusable. (See Huh v. Wang
(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 1406 [attorney’s failure to respond to discovery due to
“press of business” did not constitute excusable neglect.]) Additionally, AutoNation
Ford’s counsel sent a written meet and confer letter on April 24, 2024,
alerting that “[a]s of today’s date, my office has not received Plaintiffs’
discovery responses.” (Geraghty Decl. Ex. “3.”) Furthermore, the Motion papers
were served upon Plaintiff’s counsel’s law firm on May 6, 2024. (5/6/2024 Proof
of Service.) Consequently, the Court finds Plaintiff’s argument that the delay
was solely due to calendaring errors to be unpersuasive. 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds that
Plaintiff Smith’s failure to serve a timely response was not the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Therefore, Plaintiff Smith
is not relieved from the waiver of objections.
 
Based on the above, the Court GRANTS IN PART the Motion,
deeming Plaintiff’s objections asserted in his responses dated August 28, 2024,
waived.
 
However, the Court DENIES IN
PART Plaintiff’s Motion as to compel responses, as the responses were served
prior to the hearing.
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Monetary
sanctions, as outlined under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300
subdivision (c) are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand.
(Code Civ. Proc., §2031.300, subd. (c).) Additionally, California Rules
of Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
Here, Plaintiff Smith served
his responses to AutoNation Ford’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One, untimely, thereby justifying the imposition of monetary sanctions under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (c).
 
Given that the Motion shares significant
similarities with another concurrently filed motion, the Court determines the
total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the Motion to be $435.00, calculated based on a
reasonable hourly rate of $250.00 for 1.5 hours reasonably spent plus a $60.00
filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant AutoNation
Ford’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant
AutoNation Ford Valencia’s Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One, is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.
Specifically, Plaintiff Austin Smith’s objections, asserted in his responses
dated August 28, 2024, are deemed waived. However, because Plaintiff Austin
Smith has already served responses prior to the hearing, the Motion is DENIED
IN PART to the extent it seeks to compel those responses.
 
Defendant
AutoNation Ford Valencia’s Request for Monetary
Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Plaintiff
Austin Smith and his attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally
pay $435.00 to Defendant AutoNation Ford Valencia
within 20 days.

party to give notice.
