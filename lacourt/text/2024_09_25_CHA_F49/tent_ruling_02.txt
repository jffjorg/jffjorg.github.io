BACKGROUND
 
On April 14, 2023, Plaintiff Hugo Moisa-Archila (“Plaintiff”
or “Moisa-Archila”) initiated this action against Defendants Jose Roberto
Gonzalez dba JRG Trucking (“JRG Trucking”), Alicia Ranee Levalley (“Levalley”),
Jose Manuel Armando Lorenzo-Reyes (“Lorenzo-Reyes”) (collectively,
“Defendants”), and Does 1 to 100 for motor vehicle negligence. The Complaint
alleges that Plaintiff sustained personal injuries and property damages as a
result of a motor vehicle incident that occurred on May 2, 2022. Subsequently,
Defendants JRG Trucking, Levalley, and Lorenzo-Reyes filed their respective
Answers to the Complaint on May 8, September 5, and December 29, 2023,
respectively. 
 
On July 24, 2024, Defendant Lorenzo-Reyes’s Counsel filed
the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”).
 
            No Opposition papers have been
received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
The court may
order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and
after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
            In
addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subsection (d) requires that
the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal
service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must
be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:
            (A) The service address is the current residence or
business address of the client; or
(B)
The service address is the last known residence or business address of the
client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after
making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the
motion to be relieved.
 
            (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (1)(A) & (2).)
 
Here, Defendant Lorenzo-Reyes’s Counsel (“Counsel”) has
filed Judicial Council Forms MC-051 and MC-052. Additionally, Counsel has lodged
Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the Court.
 
Counsel has provided a declaration stating that the Motion
is necessitated by that “Our investigator advised that [Lorenzo-Reyes’s]
current address is 456 COTTONWOOD DR, SALINAS, CA 93905 (MONTEREY COUNTY). Our
investigator was unable to make contact with Mr. Reyes and Mr. Reyes has
blocked any incoming calls from our investigator.” (MC-052, ¶ 2.) Additionally,
Counsel submitted a separate declaration, attesting that “Multiple attempts
have been made to obtain cooperation from Defendant, Jose Manuel Armando
Lorenzo-Reyes and he has failed to cooperate, as indicated above. As a result
of his conduct, The Law Firm of Baraban & Teske cannot continue to
represent Defendant, Jose Manuel Armando Lorenzo-Reyes.” (Baraban Decl. at p.
2.)
 
The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory.

 
However, the Court observes a deficiency in the Counsel’s
declarations, as contradictory statements have been made regarding the
verification of the client’s current address. Counsel, in his declaration,
states that the Motion papers were served by mail to Lorenzo-Reyes’s last known
address. (MC-052, ¶ 3(a)(2).) In paragraph 3.b.(1)(d), Counsel asserts that the
client’s last known address has been confirmed within the past 30 days as
current, by means of “USPS to 26575 Calle Linda, Moreno Valley, California.
USPS to 456 COTTONWOOD DR, SALINAS, CA 93905 (MONTEREY COUNTY).” Conversely, on
paragraph 3.b.(2)(b) and (c), Counsel indicates that he has “been unable to
confirm that the address is current or to locate a more current address for the
client,” despite efforts including: “(b) calling the client’s last known
telephone number or numbers. (c) contacting persons familiar with the client
(specify): Sister Alma Rosa Ochoa 951-455-8932.”) (MC-052, ¶¶ 3b(1) and 3b(2).)

 
Accordingly, the Court directs the Counsel to clarify to
correct or address the contradictions.
 
The Court further notes a deficiency in the service of the
Motion papers. Counsel filed a Proof of Service demonstrating proper service on
Defendant Lorenzo-Reyes and on Plaintiff’s attorneys of record. 
 
However, the Proof of Service does not show that Defendant
Levalley has been served on the Motion, thereby failing to comply with the
requirements to serve “on the client and on all other parties who have
appeared in the case.)” (Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1362(d).) (Underlines
added.) Defendant Levalley appeared in this case by filing an Answer to the
Complaint on September 5, 2023. Therefore, the Motion papers must be served on Defendant
Levalley.
 
The next hearing scheduled for this action is a Mandatory
Settlement Conference set for November 14, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department
F49 at 9425 Penfield Ave., Chatsworth, CA 91311. (MC-053, ¶ 8.) A jury trial is
set for February 10, 2025 (Id. ¶ 9.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court CONTINUES the Motion to
allow Counsel an opportunity to address the deficiencies detailed above.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Jose
Manuel Armando Lorenzo-Reyes’s Counsel Jeffrey
Baraban’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is CONTINUED.
 
Moving counsel to give notice.
