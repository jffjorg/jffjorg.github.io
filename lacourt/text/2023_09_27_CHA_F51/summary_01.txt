```yaml
Case Number: 20CHCV00519
Plaintiff: Vincent Kody Pappadato
Defendant: Lou De Angelis
Motion: Motion for Summary Judgment
Relief Requested: Grant summary judgment or summary adjudication in favor of Moving Defendant and against Plaintiff
Tentative Ruling: The motion is granted
Evidentiary Objections: Nos. 4 and 11 are sustained, and Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are overruled
Background: Plaintiff brings an action against defendants insurance companies and their employees, alleging false representations to induce Plaintiff to leave employment and invest in a new insurance agency
Analysis:
  - Legal Standard: The function of a motion for summary judgment is to determine whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim
  - Intentional and Negligent Misrepresentation: Plaintiff's first and second causes of action allege against all Defendants intentional and negligent misrepresentation
  - Contractual Disclaimer: The Agent Appointment Agreement and Direct Appointment Policy Assignment Addendum contain integration clauses that preclude the introduction of evidence that varies or contradicts the terms of the written instruments
  - Reasonable Reliance on Misrepresentations: The alleged misrepresentations concerned future seed books of business promised to Plaintiff, which are not actionable as a matter of law
  - Damages: Plaintiff cannot show that he has suffered any damages stemming from Moving Defendant's alleged misrepresentations
  - Facts:
    + Plaintiff and nonmoving Farmers defendants entered into an Agent Appointment Agreement on 4/1/19
    + The agreement contains an integration clause that precludes the introduction of evidence that varies or contradicts the terms of the written instruments
    + Plaintiff signed a Direct Appointment Policy Assignment Addendum on 4/12/19
    + The addendum provides that Plaintiff voluntarily enters into the agreement without relying on any representations made by the Companies or any of their representatives not contained in the agreement
    + The agreement contains an acknowledgment provision executed by Plaintiff, which provides that Agent acknowledges that Agent has read, understands, and agrees to the terms and conditions contained in the Agreement
  - Conclusions:
    + Moving Defendant has satisfied his initial burden to present facts to negate an essential element to Plaintiff's first and second causes of action
    + The burden shifts to Plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact exists with regard to his reliance on the alleged representations made
    + Plaintiff has failed to show that he reasonably relied on Moving Defendant's alleged misrepresentations
    + Plaintiff cannot show that he has suffered any damages stemming from Moving Defendant's alleged misrepresentations
    + The motion is granted
