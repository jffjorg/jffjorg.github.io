Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, American Franchise Regional Center, LLC, et al., in a lawsuit brought by the plaintiff, Zixuan An. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached a contract and made misrepresentations, and seeks damages and other relief.

The court has ruled that the plaintiff's entire action is barred by the statute of limitations. The court agrees with the defendants that the plaintiff's contract claims are barred because they were filed more than four years after the alleged breach. The court also rules that the plaintiff's claims for negligent misrepresentation and fraud are barred because they were not filed within the applicable statute of limitations.

The court further rules that the plaintiff's accounting claim fails as a remedy because there is no underlying theory of liability. The court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be able to refile the complaint with new allegations.

In essence, the court has ruled that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred and therefore cannot proceed. The parties are advised to review the tentative ruling and submit any objections or arguments in writing to the court.
