And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the defendants' motion to seal evidence submitted in support of their motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The court notes that the defendants have not demonstrated that they have taken measures to guard the secrecy of the materials, and therefore the court cannot find an overriding interest that supports sealing. The court is continuing the hearing to allow the defendants to file a supplemental brief and additional evidence further substantiating their claims that the information at issue should be sealed. The court also orders the defendants to file an amended notice of motion and to lodge another copy of the unredacted documents with the court. The hearing is continued to February 9, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse.
