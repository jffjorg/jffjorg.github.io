I.       INTRODUCTION
          On
July 14, 2023, plaintiff Zixuan An (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
defendants Agnes Sinclair aka Agnes Yen (“Yen”), American Franchise Regional
Center LLC (“American Franchise”), and Americana Hesperia Retirement Funding
LLC (“Americana Hesperia”) (collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiff also named four
other defendants who have not yet been served: Sylvia Young (“Young”), John
Deyong Hu (“Hu”), Hu & Associates, LLC (“Hu Associates”), and Universo
Holdings, Inc. (“Universo”)
          Plaintiff
asserts causes of action for breach of contract, rescission, fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy to commit fraud,
conversion, breach of fiduciary duties, constructive fraud, and violation of
Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. (“UCL”) against American
Franchise and Americana Hesperia. Plaintiff asserts the same causes of action
(except for breach of contract and rescission) against Yen. 
          On
October 6, 2023, Defendants filed this demurrer on the grounds that Plaintiff’s
action was barred by the statute of limitations and Plaintiff failed to state
sufficient facts. 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARDS
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of the pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on
its face.  (City of Atascadero v.
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445,
459.) “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded
but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. We accept the
factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider matters which
may be judicially noticed. [Citation.]” (Mitchell v. California Department
of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged
in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].) Allegations
are to be liberally construed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) A demurrer may be
brought if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action
asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) 
III.     REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendants request judicial notice of a
complaint filed in another action captioned Weibeing Fei, et al. v. American
Franchise Regional Center, LLC, et al. (Case No. 20PSCV00207), which was
filed on March 12, 2020, and includes identical allegations regarding
Defendants and Hesperia. The request for judicial notice is DENIED as the
Complaint is irrelevant. Plaintiff is not included as a party in the attached
complaint; the only plaintiffs are Weibig Fei and Wan “Wendy” Tao.  
IV.     DISCUSSION
A.  
Factual
Allegations
Plaintiff alleges that he invested
approximately $500,000 with American Franchise and his funds were to be pooled
with other investors to create a senior care facility (the “Project”), built
and operated by Americana Hesperia, as part of the EB-5 Regional Center Pilot
Program. Plaintiff claims that in or about July 28, 2015, Hu held several
seminars in various cities in China about Americana Hesperia to promote the Project
to Chinese investors. (Compl., ¶ 11.) Hu represented that the Project had been
reviewed and approved by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services
(“USCIS”) and any Chinese investors would be qualified to apply for EB-5
immigration visas. (Compl., ¶ 11.) Hu and Yen represented that the Project
would have minimal risk because if the Project failed, the investors could recoup
their investment by selling the land, which was purportedly worth $22 million.
(Compl., ¶ 12.) Hu and Yen also introduced the supposed mayor of Hesperia, “Mr.
Ted”, to make speeches which were translated by a Chinese interpreter. (Compl.,
¶ 12.) Based on a Power Point presentation, the Project was supposed to begin on
or about April 1, 2017, and be completed by May 30, 2019, with a “grand opening
event” by January 1, 2020. 
On or around August 8, 2016, Plaintiff
signed an agreement with American Franchise for one membership unit of
Americana Hesperia and paid $500,000 by check to American Franchise. (Compl., ¶
18.) 
On or about July 28, 2017, Yen sent an
email to all EB-5 investors advising them that the Project had been delayed and
that further updates would be provided. (Compl., ¶ 20.) However, no updated
project timeline was ever provided. (Compl., ¶ 20.) 
B.  
Statute
of Limitations
As an initial ground for their
demurrer, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s entire action is barred by the
statute of limitations. The Court agrees. 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s contract
claims are barred by the statute of limitations because his causes of action
began accruing more than four years before the filing of this complaint.
Defendants argue that Plaintiff was informed on July 28, 2017, that
construction permitting would be delayed, which placed him on notice that the
original timeline for construction would not be honored. The statute of
limitations for recission of contract and breach of contract is four years.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 337.) Therefore, Defendants argue, Plaintiff’s contract-based
claims should have been filed by July 28, 2021. 
The Court notes that Defendants did not
include the tolling period from April 6, 2020, through October 30, 2020,
implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. (CRC emergency Rule 9.) But,
even after factoring in the extra 207 days this tolling period provides,
Plaintiff’s contract-based claims are still barred because they should have
been brought by February 20, 2022. 
As for Plaintiff’s claims based on
misrepresentation, Defendants also point to Plaintiff’s allegations that in or
about the end of 2018 and 2019, he discovered Defendants’ misrepresentations in
2016 about the ownership and value of the land. (Compl., ¶ 21.) Defendants
additionally refer to Plaintiff’s allegation that the Project was due to be
completed by June 2019 and contend that any reasonable person would have
investigated and pursued available claims when no work had commenced by the
date it was set to be completed. (Compl., ¶ 22.) The statute of limitations for
negligent misrepresentation is 2 years and the statute of limitations for fraud
is 3 years. Therefore, based on a generous interpretation of Plaintiff’s
allegations and the lack of any opposition brief from Plaintiff arguing to the
contrary, assuming Plaintiff’s causes of action began accruing no later than
June 1, 2019, Plaintiff’s causes of action for negligent misrepresentation and
fraud should have been brought no later than December 27, 2021, and December
26, 2022, respectively. 
Likewise, the analysis above applies to
Plaintiff’s claims for conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of
the UCL. The statute of limitations for conversion and the statute of
limitations for a claim under the UCL is 4 years. (Code Civ. Proc., § 338; Bus.
& Prof. Code, § 17208.) The statute of limitations for breach of fiduciary
duty depends on the underlying breach which, here, are the alleged
misrepresentations, and thus subject to either a 2-year or 3-year statute of
limitations. (Compl., ¶¶ 93-94; 
Last, Plaintiff’s accounting claim
fails as a remedy because there is no underlying theory of liability. (Glue-Fold,
Inc. v. Slautterback Corp. (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023, n.3. An action
for an accounting “is barred when it appears that the statute [of limitations]
has run against the basic cause of action to which the accounting is a mere
incident.” (Phillis v. City of Santa Barbara (1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 45,
68 [citing Jefferson v. J.E. French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719].)
IV.     CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’
unopposed demurrer to the entire Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.

Moving party to give notice.
