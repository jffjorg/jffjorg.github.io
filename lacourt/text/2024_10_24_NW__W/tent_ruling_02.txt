FACTUAL
BACKGROUND
 
On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff Ismail
Akel filed a complaint against Defendant Farideh Javaheripour and Ramin
Javahery for Violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code sect. 151.10; Violation of
Business and Professions Code 17200; Common Counts: Money Had and Received;
Fraud; and Violation of Cal Civil Code 1947.11. Plaintiff alleges they entered
into a lease agreement with Defendants to rent a property owned by Defendants.
Plaintiff alleges Defendant represented that the Property was legal to be
rented; however, upon taking possession and steps to arrange for US mail
delivery to the Property, Plaintiff discovered the Property was an illegal
structure. 
 
On February 8, 2024, Farideh
Javaheripour filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff for breach of written
agreement and common counts. 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: 
 
Counsel contends they have been unable to communicate effectively
with the clients, nor have the clients paid in full for services rendered on
their behalf to date and they continue to decline counsel's advice. As a
result, counsel can no longer effectively represent the clients' interests
further in this matter.
 
Counsel has complied with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362 by
filing forms MC-051 and MC-052 and lodging with the Court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053. Counsel confirmed Plaintiff’s last known address
by telephone within the last 30 days. 
 
Trial is not set. There is a Status Conference set for October 24,
2024. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendants Farideh Javaheripour and Ramin Javahery
is GRANTED.
