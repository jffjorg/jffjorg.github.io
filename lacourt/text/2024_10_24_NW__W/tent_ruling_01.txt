BACKGROUND
 
This is a breach of contract action. Plaintiff Douglas
Emmett 2014, LLC alleges on September 25, 2015, Plaintiff’s predecessor in
interest, Douglas Emmett 1997, LLC (“DE 1997”) leased to Defendant Infogen,
Inc. certain real property under a written Short Term Office Lease. The initial
term of the Short Term Office Lease expired on March 31, 2016. Plaintiff succeeded to all
of DE 1997’s right, title and interest in and to the Premises as owner and
became the landlord under the Lease in 1997. Plaintiff alleges on March 24,
2016, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written First Amendment to Short
Term Office Lease which extended the term of the Short Term Office Lease until
March 31, 2017. Plaintiff further alleges Plaintiff and Defendant entered
several more amendments, ultimately leasing the space and extra storage space
until June 30, 2020. On October 3, 2015, Defendant Jeff Rayden executed a
written guaranty of the lease agreement. Upon expiration of the lease
agreement, Plaintiff alleges Defendant failed and refused to surrender
possession of the premises to Plaintiff and beginning July 1, 2020, Defendant
Infogen wrongfully remained in possession of the premises. On July 29, 2021,
Plaintiff was restored possession of the premises by a lockout performed by the
sheriff’s office pursuant to a judgment entered in an unlawful detainer action
filed by Plaintiff against Defendant Infogen. 
 
On November 3, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint against
Defendant Infogen, Inc. asserting causes of action breach of lease and breach
of guaranty. On November 10, 2021, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint
naming Defendant Rayden as a defendant. 
 
Request for entry of default was entered January 21, 2022
and default judgment was entered May 19, 2022. The court set aside the default
and default judgment on January 5, 2023. 
 
After a bench trial, judgment was entered in Plaintiff’s
favor and against Defendant Rayden. Defendant Rayden has filed an appeal. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Motion to Fix Recoverable Fees and Costs
by Plaintiff Douglas Emmett 2014, LLC is granted
in part.  The court strikes $9,514.65 in
court reporter fees.  THE REST ARE
RECOVERABLE.  
 
discussion
 
Plaintiff Douglas Emmett 2014, LLC moves
this court for an order determining that Plaintiff is entitled to recover a
total of $87,799.97 in attorney’s fees and costs against Defendant Jeff Rayden.
Plaintiff seeks (i) $69,376.50 in attorneys’ fees billed; (ii) $15,740.32 in
costs and expenses as stated in the Memorandum of Costs; (iii) $683.15 in
research costs; and (iv) $2,000.00 in attorneys’ fees and costs for this
motion. 
 
A prevailing party is entitled to
reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.  (CCP § 1033.5(a)(10).)  “Prevailing party” includes the party with a
net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a
defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant
as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that
defendant.  (CCP § 1032(a)(4).)  In all other circumstances, the “prevailing
party” shall be as determined by the court. 
(Id.) In any action “on a contract” that
provides for the prevailing party’s recovery of attorneys’ fees, the prevailing
party “shall be entitled to [an award of] reasonable attorneys’ fees.”¿ (Civ.
Code, § 1717; see also Drybread v. Chipain Chiropractic Corp. (2007) 151
Cal.App.4th 1063, 1071 (Drybread) (in action arising out of lease
agreement, prevailing party entitled to attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses
incurred).) 
 
The fee setting inquiry ordinarily
begins with the “lodestar,” i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. 
(PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal. 4th 1084, 1095.)  “The lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of facts specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.”  (Gorman v. Tassajara Dev. Corp. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774.) In
determining whether to adjust the lodestar figure, the court may consider the
nature and difficulty of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the
skill required and employed to handle the case, the attention given, the
success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.  (EnPalm
LLC v. Teitler (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774.)
 
Section 13.10 of the Office Lease and
Paragraph 14 of the Guaranty both provide that if litigation arises out of the
Lease or in connection with the Guaranty, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover costs and attorney fees. Following trial on Plaintiff’s
breach of contract action, Plaintiff received a judgment against Rayden
granting Plaintiff compensatory damages, prejudgment interest, and attorneys’
fees and costs. As such, there can be no dispute Plaintiff is the prevailing
party and entitled to attorney fees. 
 
Plaintiff also asserts the fees
sought are reasonable. Hinshaw & Culbertson LLP (“Hinshaw”) charged $270
per hour for partner time, $230 per hour for senior counsel and associate time,
and $95.00 per hour for paralegal and law clerk time. Plaintiff contends these
hourly rates are reasonable and are actually below the market rates charged by
attorneys with similar skills and experience at comparable law firms for the
same types of cases in the relevant community. 
 
The court agrees. The
hourly rates sought are reasonable. Generally, a reasonable hourly rate is
prevailing in the community where the case is litigated for similar work. (PLCM
Group v. Dexter (2000) 22 Cal.4th 15 1084, 1095 ["PLCM"]; MBNA
America Bank, N.A. v. Gorman (2006) 147 16 Cai.App.4th Supp. 1, 13.) Moreover,
“the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market,
as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting
fees [citation], the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that
skill was applied [citations], and affidavits from other attorneys regarding
prevailing fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.”¿ (569
East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 426, 437.) Based on the Hinds Declaration, their description of the
reasonableness in fees, the accompanying exhibits, and the court’s knowledge
and familiarity with the legal market, Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is
reasonable.   
 
Next, Plaintiff argues the amount of hours expended by Hinshaw is
reasonable. Plaintiff’s counsel has expended a total of 275.1 hours in attorney
time resulting in a total of $69,376.50 in legal fees incurred by Plaintiff
prior to the drafting of this motion. (See Hinds Decl. ¶9, Exh. A.) Plaintiff
notes the amount of hours expended is reasonable given this case presented more
complex issues than a typical unlawful detainer and breach of lease/breach of
guaranty action in that Rayden asserted novel defenses including claiming that
Plaintiff was unable to proceed against Rayden because Infogen, Inc. was not
properly identified in the Office Lease. Additionally, the COVID-19 Pandemic
and the related moratoriums by the County and State created novel issues
concerning breach of lease and breach of guaranty actions. 
 
The court agrees. Verified cost bills are “prima facie evidence
the costs, expenses and services listed were necessarily incurred…” (Hadley
v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) A review of the entries indicate
that the entries are valid and 275.1 spent on this action were reasonable. As
noted above, this action involved novel issues like COVID-19 and related
moratoriums. 
 
The court notes Plaintiff also seeks $683.15 in research costs
outside of the Memorandum of Costs because they are not provided for under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 but are recoverable under the Office Lease.
The court grants the request for research costs as attorney fees. (See Exh. B
and C.) 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to
Fix Recoverable Fees and Costs by Plaintiff Douglas Emmett 2014, LLC is GRANTED.
 
 
Memorandum
of Costs
 
Concerning costs, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs on August
6, 2024 requesting $15,740.32. Defendant did not file a motion to tax
costs.  Nonetheless, plaintiffs are only
allowed to recover those costs permitted by statute.  
 
The court finds that many of the  costs are recoverable. Plaintiff seeks $435.00
in filing and motion fees, $150.00 in jury fees, $3,115.15 in deposition costs,
$492.22 in service of process fees, 
$1,208.00 in electronic filing fees, and $825.30 in County recording
fees for Abstract of Judgment.   All of
these are properly awarded.  
 
The court denies the request for court reporter
fees as the reporter was not ordered by the court and the court knows of no
statue authorizing court reporter fees in this case.   C.C.P. Section 1033.5(a)(9) and (11).
