And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part the plaintiff's motion to fix recoverable fees and costs. The court strikes $9,514.65 in court reporter fees, but finds that the rest of the fees and costs are recoverable. The plaintiff seeks a total of $87,799.97 in attorney's fees and costs against Defendant Jeff Rayden, including $69,376.50 in attorney's fees billed, $15,740.32 in costs and expenses as stated in the Memorandum of Costs, $683.15 in research costs outside of the Memorandum of Costs, and $2,000.00 in attorneys' fees and costs for this motion.

The court finds that the hourly rates sought by the plaintiff's counsel are reasonable, and that the amount of hours expended by the counsel is also reasonable given the complexity of the case. The court grants the request for research costs as attorney fees.

The court also denies the request for court reporter fees, finding that the reporter was not ordered by the court and that the court knows of no statute authorizing court reporter fees in this case.

Overall, the court grants the motion to fix recoverable fees and costs in part, finding that the plaintiff is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs against Defendant Jeff Rayden.
