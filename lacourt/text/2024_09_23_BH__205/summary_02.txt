Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company's motion to compel RR Construction & Restoration to produce documents in response to a subpoena. The subpoena was served on RR Construction on June 21, 2024, demanding the production of business records by that date. RR Construction failed to produce any documents or respond to the subpoena, despite numerous attempts by Nationwide's counsel to contact them. The judge concludes that the subpoena seeks relevant documents and that RR Construction has waived any objections to the subpoena due to their failure to respond. The judge grants Nationwide's motion to compel RR Construction's production of documents in response to the subpoena.
