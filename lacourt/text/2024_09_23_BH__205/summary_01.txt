And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT AND MARKETING, LLC (TEAM) and BRIAN DELINO, et al. TEAM had sued Delino and his company, Big Daddy Formals, LLC, for theft of trade secrets, fraud, and other claims. The judge granted terminating sanctions and struck Delino's answer and cross-complaint, effectively admitting the fact allegations of TEAM's complaint.

The judge awarded TEAM damages in the amount of $932,756.11 jointly and severally against Delino and Big Daddy Formals, LLC, as well as damages in the amount of $25,001.50 against Delino individually and $2,910 against Big Daddy Formals, LLC. The judge also awarded TEAM attorney fees in the amount of $115,730, but denied its request for fees under the unfair competition law.

The judge denied TEAM's request for anti-SLAPP fees and monetary sanctions, but included the previously awarded fees and sanctions in the judgment. The judge also denied TEAM's request for damages related to Delino's fraud in collecting directly from TEAM's clients, awarding only $2,354 in damages.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling grants TEAM's request for default judgment and awards damages, attorney fees, and costs to TEAM.
