And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on Defendant Lai's demurrer to the complaint. The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, intentional fraud, and other claims against Defendant Lai and Global West Real Estate Corporation. Defendant Lai argues that the complaint fails to specify which plaintiff is asserting each cause of action and which defendant each cause of action is directed against. The judge rules that the complaint substantially complies with California Rule of Court 2.112 and is not uncertain for failure to identify the parties. The demurrer is therefore overruled.
