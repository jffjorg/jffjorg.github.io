BACKGROUND
 
On August 17, 2022, Plaintiff
Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed four causes of action
against Defendant Greenfield Landscaping and Maintenance, Inc. aka Greenfield
Tree Service (“Defendant”) for 1) breach of contract, 2) open book account 3)
account stated and 4) reasonable value. 
 
On December 06, 2022, Plaintiff requested
default be entered against the Defendant.  The Clerk entered default against Defendant
the same day. 
 
On January 04, 2023, the Court
entered default judgment against the Defendant in the amount of $25,671.14. 
 
On April 25, 2023, Defendant filed
a Motion to Set aside Default and Default Judgment and to Stay Execution of the
Judgment. Defendant filed a joint stipulation on May 09, 2023, indicating that
the parties agreed to set aside the default and default judgment and that
Defendant would file an answer to the Complaint within ten days of the Court’s
order. The Court ordered for the default and default judgment to be set aside
on May 30, 2023. 
 
Defendant filed its answer to the
Complaint on June 13, 2023. 
 
On July 07, 2023, the Court reassigned
the matter to the Hon. Judge Katherine Chilton in Department 25 at the Spring
Street Courthouse. 
 
 On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion for Order Allowing Plaintiff to File a First Amended Complaint. 
 
No opposition has been filed.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
Leave to amend is permitted under
the Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a) and section 576. The
policy favoring amendment and resolving all matters in the same dispute is “so
strong that it is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be
justified. . ..” “Although courts are bound to apply a policy of great
liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at any stage of the
proceedings, up to and including trial [citations], this policy should be
applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party . . .. [citation]. 
A different result is indicated ‘where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice
to the opposing party’ is shown. [Citation].” (Magpali v. Farmers Group (1996)
48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.)  
 
A motion for leave to amend a
pleading must also comply with the procedural requirements of California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires a supporting declaration to set forth
explicitly what allegations are to be added and where, and explicitly stating
what new evidence was discovered warranting the amendment and why the amendment
was not made earlier. The motion must also include (1) a copy of the proposed
and numbered amendment, (2) specifications by reference to pages and lines the
allegations that would be deleted and added, and (3) a declaration specifying
the effect, necessity and propriety of the amendments, date of discovery and
reasons for delay. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, subds. (a), (b).)
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Plaintiff seeks leave to file an amended complaint to revise the
amount due to include the actual earned premiums remaining due and owning as
determined by an audit of defendant’s operation and payroll records as required
under the terms of the policy. 
 
 Plaintiff provides a copy of the proposed
First Amended Complaint with a supporting declaration stating the reason why Plaintiff
seeks leave to amend. (Michael
D. Frischer Decl.; Ex. 3.) Plaintiff provides the declaration of its counsel who states that
the matter was brought due to Defendant’s failure to cooperate with State
Compensation Insurance Fund (“SCIF”) for the purposes of completing the audit
for two workers compensation policy matters 9277782-20 and
9277782-21. (Id. ¶ 2.) Defendant
provided an answer to the complaint on June 13, 2023.  However, Plaintiff served discovery on May
09, 2023, to compel Defendant to comply with the audit by producing the
information and documentation needed by SCIF’s auditor to properly calculate
the earned premiums for the 2020 and 2021 policies. (Id. ¶ 4.) Defendant
produced the information and payroll records which were forwarded to SCIF. (Id.
¶ 5.) As a result of the audit, SCIF provided Plaintiff’s counsel with the
worksheets and revised invoice for the 2020 and 2021policies to show actual
earned premiums due and owing for this policy in the sum of $19,055.62 for
policy no. 9277782-20 and $20,635.55 for policy no. 9277782-21. (Id. ¶ 6. Exh. 2.)
Counsel states that Plaintiff now seeks to amend its complaint to accurately
reflect the precise amount of insurance premiums earned by SCIF and still due
and owing. (Id. ¶ 7.) 
 
Here, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has not sufficiently satisfied the requirements under CRC rule
3.1324. The Motion includes a copy of the proposed amended complaint as well as
a declaration specifying the effect, necessity
and propriety of the amendments, date of discovery and reasons for delay. However,
the Court notes that Plaintiff does not provide the Court with specifications
by reference to pages and lines the allegations that would be deleted and added
to the proposed First Amended Complaint, which can be provided in the form of a
supporting chart that references the page and line of what is being changed. 
 
Thus, the Court CONTINUES the hearing on Plaintiff’s
Motion for Leave to Amend. 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment
Bureau’s Motion for Order Allowing Plaintiff to File a First Amended Complaint
is CONTINUED
TO MAY 7, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 of the SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.

 
At least 16 court days before the
next scheduled hearing, Petitioner must file and serve supplemental papers providing
specifications by reference to pages and lines
the allegations that would be deleted and added to the proposed First Amended
Complaint. Failure to do so will result in the Motion
being placed off calendar or denied.
 
Moving Party is ordered to give
notice.
