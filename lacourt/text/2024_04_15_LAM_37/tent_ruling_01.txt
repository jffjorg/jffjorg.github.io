Background
 
On December 1, 2022,
Brendan Schultz (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Issraaid (US) Global
Humanitarian Assistance, Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 100.
 
The operative Second
Amended Complaint (“SAC”), filed August 28, 2023, alleges nine causes of action:
(1) Negligence; (2) Gross Negligence; (3) Willful Misconduct; (4) Reckless
Misconduct; (5) Failure to Pay Minimum Wage; (6) Failure to Provide Meal
Periods; (7) Failure to Pay Rest Periods; (8) Negligent Misrepresentation; and
(9) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress. 
 
On January 25, 2024,
Defendant filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC. Plaintiff opposes the demurrer.
The matter is now before the court. 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Summary of Allegations in SAC
 
The SAC alleges that
Plaintiff worked as a volunteer with Defendant’s food distribution program
during the summer of 2020. (SAC ¶ 3, 6, 7.) 
 
On February 4, 2021,
in a virtual meeting with Defendant, Defendant offered Plaintiff a contract
position as a volunteer coordinator for its volunteer program. (SAC ¶ 10.)
Plaintiff accepted the position, signed a contract, and entered an employment
relationship with Defendant on February 15, 2021. (SAC ¶¶ 11, 12.)
 
Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant falsely represented that the position would abide by the requirements
for contract worker classification.  Plaintiff
alleges he should have been classified as a regular employee. (SAC ¶¶ 13, 14,
15.) 
 
As Plaintiff should have been
classified as an employee, he contends he should have been paid minimum wage
and provided meal/rest breaks or overtime pay. (SAC ¶ 16.) After informing
Defendant’s supervisor in early May 2021 that he thought the requirements of
the position did not comply with California labor law, Defendant informed
Plaintiff of the intent to terminate the employment relationship. (SAC ¶¶ 16,
17.) 
 
Plaintiff filed this action on
December 1, 2022. Defendant now demurs to the first, second,
third, fourth, eighth, and ninth causes of action on the basis that the facts
pled are insufficient to support said causes of action (CCP, § 430.10(3).) 
 
            B.        Plaintiff’s Opposition
The court is aware that
Plaintiff has failed to file a proof of service for its opposition and that
Defendant asserts they could only review the opposition until April 10, 2024.
(Albert Supp. Decl. ¶ 4.) However, as Defendant has failed to allege that it
was prejudiced by the late opposition, the court will proceed to address the
demurrer on the merits. (See Tate
v. Superior Court
(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 925, 930 [The court may treat the appearance of Defense
counsel at the hearing and her opposition to the motion on its merits as a
waiver of defective notice of the motion.].)
C.        First, Second, Third, and Fourth Causes
of Action – Negligence, Gross Negligence, Willful Misconduct, Reckless
Misconduct
 
“The elements of a cause of
action for negligence are well established. They are (a) a legal duty to use
due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c) the breach as the
proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.” (Ladd v. County of San
Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917 [internal quotations omitted].) “A duty
may arise through statute, contract, or the relationship of the parties.” (Lichtman
v. Siemens Industry Inc. (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 914, 920 [internal
quotations and citations omitted].) The existence of a legal duty is a question
of law for the court to decide. (Adams v. City of Fremont (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 243, 265.) “However, the elements of breach of that duty and
causation are ordinarily questions of fact for the jury's determination.” (Vasquez
v. Residential Investments, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 269, 278.)
 
Defendant argues that the first cause of
action (negligence) fails because the only duty an employer owes an employee is
the duty to provide a safe working environment. Although Labor Code § 226.8
imposes on employers a legal duty to not willfully misclassify an individual as
an independent contractor, there is no private right of action for violations
of section 226.8. (Noe v. Superior Court (2015) 237
Cal.App.4th 316, 341.) Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to show that Defendant owed
Plaintiff a legal duty to not misclassify employees[2]. 
 
With respect to the second cause of
action (gross negligence), the Judicial Council of California Civil Jury
Instructions (“CACI”) No. 425 clarifies that gross negligence is not a cause of
action, but a judicial instruction given when a statute or contract provides
for a high standard of care. “California
does not recognize a distinct cause of action for ‘gross negligence’
independent of a statutory basis.” (Eriksson v. Nunnink (2011) 191
Cal.App.4th 826, 856.) 
 
With respect to the third cause of action
(willful misconduct), willful misconduct is not a cause of action but “‘an
aggravated form of negligence, differing in quality rather than degree from
ordinary lack of care’ [Citations.]” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 526.) “Its pleading
requirements are similar to negligence but stricter.” (Id. at p. 526.) 
 
With regard to the fourth cause of action
(reckless misconduct), reckless misconduct is similarly a form of aggravated
negligence “differing in quality rather than degree from lack of ordinary
care.”  (Morgan v. Southern Pacific
Trans. Co. (1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 1006, 1011.)


Plaintiff fails to cite case law or statute to
show that Defendant had a duty to not misclassify Plaintiff or that a specific
statute imposed on Defendant a heightened duty of care that prohibited gross
negligence or willful or reckless misconduct. 
 
Accordingly, the court sustains the demurrer
to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action without leave to
amend. 
 
D.        Eighth Cause of Action - Negligent
Misrepresentation
 
“The elements of
negligent misrepresentation, a form of deceit, are misrepresentation of a past
or existing material fact, without reasonable ground for believing it to be
true, and with intent to induce another's reliance on the fact misrepresented;
ignorance of the truth and justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the
party to whom it was directed; and resulting damage.” (Home Budget Loans,
Inc. v. Jacoby & Meyers Law Offices (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1285.)
Claims for negligent misrepresentation, like fraud claims, must be pled with
the requisite specificity. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30
Cal.4th 167, 184.)
 
The eighth cause of
action alleges that Defendant misrepresented that Plaintiff was a formal
employee as opposed to a contractor. (SAC ¶ 76.) Plaintiff alleges that had he
known he was an independent contractor he would not have performed “labor for
defendant” and he was harmed because he did not receive minimum wage. (SAC ¶¶
79, 80.) 
 
The SAC fails to
allege who specifically told Plaintiff that he would be hired and managed as an
independent contractor rather than an employee or what authority that
individual had to speak on behalf of Defendant. Moreover, Plaintiff failed to
plead the element of reliance: that because he relied on the representation
that he would be managed as an independent contractor, he would have still
performed the same work as an employee and would have “performed labor for the
defendant.” (SAC ¶ 79.) The difference between being an independent contractor
and an employee is the degree of control exercised over Plaintiff and the wages
due rather than the labor performed. 
 
Based on the above,
the demurrer to the eighth cause of action is sustained with leave to amend.
 
E.        Ninth Cause of Action for Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress 
 
California courts
have repeatedly recognized that NIED is not an independent tort, but the tort
of negligence such that the traditional elements of duty, breach of duty,
causation, and damages apply. (See, e.g., Spates v. Dameron Hospital
Association (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 208, 213; Marlene F. v. Affiliated
Psychiatric Medical Clinic, Inc. (1989) 48 Cal.3d 583, 588.) other duty to the plaintiff.” (Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 965,
984.) “[U]nless the defendant has assumed a duty to plaintiff in which the
emotional condition of the plaintiff is an object, recovery is available only
if the emotional distress arises out of the defendant’s breach of some other
legal duty and the emotional distress is proximately caused by that breach of
duty.” (Id. at 985.) “Even then, with
rare exceptions, a breach of the duty must threaten physical injury, not simply
damage to property or financial interests.” (Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 965,
984.)
 
As
Plaintiff’s negligence claim fails, so does Plaintiff’s NIED claim. “Whether
plaintiffs can recover damages for NIED is dependent upon traditional tort
analysis and the elements of duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages must
exist to support the cause of action.”  (Klein v. Children’s Hospital Medical Center
(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 889, 894.)
 
The demurrer to the
ninth cause of action is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
The
demurrer to the first, second, third, fourth, and ninth causes of action is
sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer to the ninth cause of action is
sustained with leave to amend. Plaintiff is granted 30 days leave to amend. The
court sets the OSC RE: Amended Complaint for May 29, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
Defendant to give notice.
