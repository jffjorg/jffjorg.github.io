  - "Determining whether the complaint is sufficient as against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if one consideration of all the facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged."

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is about a demurrer filed by the City of Santa Monica to the first cause of action of a complaint filed by Ashley Rochestie. The complaint alleges that Rochestie fell into a hole in the sidewalk created by a half-filled planter and seeks damages from the City, as well as other defendants. The City argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action because Rochestie did not timely present a government claim to the City, as required by the Government Claims Act. The Court agrees with the City and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend. The Court finds that the complaint fails to comply with the presentation requirement of the Government Claims Act, and therefore, the action against the City is barred as a matter of law.
