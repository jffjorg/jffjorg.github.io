MOTION
 
This case arises from injuries Plaintiff Ashley Rochestie
(“Plaintiff”) allegedly sustained when she fell into a hole in the sidewalk
created by a half-filled planter.    
 
Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants City of Santa Monica; Los
Angeles County; SML Investors, LLC; 624 Lincoln Blvd. Apartments; and Yi Pan,
alleging five causes of action for (1) Damages Based on Governmental Tort
Liability and Negligence (Gov. Code, § 835); (2) Negligence; (3) Premises
Liability; (4) Private Nuisance; and (5) Public Nuisance.  
 
As to Defendant City of Santa Monica (“Defendant”), Plaintiff only
alleges the first cause of action.  Defendant
City of Santa Monica demurs to the first (and only) cause of action in
Plaintiff’s complaint alleged against it for failure to state a cause of action
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section 430.10, subdivision (e), on the
basis that Plaintiff did not first exhaust her administrative remedies, as required
under the Government Claims Act, Government Code sections 911.2, et seq.  
 
Plaintiff opposes the demurrer and Defendant replies.
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Defendant requests the Court to take
judicial notice of two facts:
 
1.      The
City’s business records reflect that Plaintiff’s tort claim was received on May
22, 2023. The proof of service reflects that the claim was sent on May 17,
2023.
 
2.      The
City’s business records reflect that a claim rejection notice was mailed on
July 5, 2023.
 
Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c) provides that judicial
notice may be taken of “[o]fficial acts of the legislative, executive, and
judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States.”  
 
In general, courts may take judicial notice of the filing and contents
of a government claim, under Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c), but
not the truth of the allegations contained therein.  (Gong v. City of Rosemead (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 363, 369, fn. 1.)   “If a plaintiff alleges compliance with the
claims presentation requirement, but the public records do not reflect
compliance, the governmental entity can request the court to take judicial
notice under Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c) that the entity's
records do not show compliance.”  (Id.
at p. 376.)  
 
The claim is stamped as
received by the City Clerk on May 23, 2023 at 10:01 a.m. in Santa Monica,
California, not May 22, 2023.  Moreover,
there is no proof of service attached to the request for judicial notice
indicating that the claim was sent on May 17, 2023.   Yet, even if there was, a proof of service regarding
when the claim was sent to the government would be a representation by Plaintiff
or Plaintiff’s agent(s), not an “official act of the legislative, executive,
[or] judicial department of the United States [or] any state in the United
States.”  
 
The claim rejection notice,
which is dated July 5, 2023, contains a signed proof of service embedded within
the document, indicating that Michael Mack, the Liability Claims Adjuster for
Defendant City of Santa Monica, mailed the claim rejection notice from Santa
Monica, California on July 5, 2023.  
 
Therefore, the Court declines
to take judicial notice as to the first request, but grants the second request
and takes judicial notice of the fact that Defendant’s claim rejection notice
was mailed on July 5, 2023.
 
ANALYSIS
 
                  
I.           
DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if one consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
GOVERNMENT
CLAIM PRESENTATION REQUIREMENT
 
Per the Government Claims Act, a party with a claim for money or
damages against a public entity must present a written claim directly with that
entity.  (Gov. Code, § 905.)  And
under Government Code section 945.4, “no suit for money or damages may be
brought against a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is
required to be presented until a written claim has been presented to the public
entity and has been acted upon by the board, or has been deemed to have been
rejected by the board.”  (Munoz v.
State of Cal. (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1776; City of Ontario v.
Superior Court (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 894.)  Further, an action against
a public employee is barred if an action against the employing public entity
would be barred by the failure to satisfy the Government Claims Act. (Gov.
Code, § 950.2.) The claim presentation requirement provides a public entity
with an opportunity to evaluate the claim and decide whether to pay on the
claim.  (Roberts v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th
474.)  
 
Accordingly, “[a] claim relating
to a cause of action for death or for injury to person or to personal property
or growing crops shall be presented as provided in Article 2 (commencing with
Section 915) not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.”  (Gov. Code, § 911.2, subd. (a).)  “When a claim that is required by Section
911.2 to be presented not later than six months after the accrual of the cause
of action is not presented within that time, a written application may be made
to the public entity for leave to present that claim.”  (Gov. Code, § 911.4.)  “The board shall grant or deny the
application within 45 days after it is presented to the board.”  (Gov. Code, § 911.6, subd. (a).)  
 
            Failure
to allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim
presentation requirements subjects a claim against a public entity to a
demurrer, or to motion for summary judgment, nonsuit, motion for judgment on
the pleadings or motion to strike.  (Toscano
v. County of Los Angeles, (1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 775, 783.)  “Moreover, a plaintiff need not allege strict
compliance with the statutory claim presentation requirement.  Courts have long recognized that a claim that
fails to substantially comply with sections 910 and 910.2, may still be
considered a ‘claim as presented’ if it puts the public entity on notice both
that the claimant is attempting to file a valid claim and that litigation will
result if the matter is not resolved.”  (Id.
at p. 1245 [cleaned up].)   
 
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiff’s claim fails because Plaintiff did not timely submit the
claim to the government, as required by Government Code section 911.2.
 
            Here,
the Complaint alleges, “Plaintiff filed a Claim for Damages To Person or
Property form with the City of Santa Monica in accordance with Government
Code §911.2.”  (Complaint ¶ 12.)  Notwithstanding this allegation, Defendant
contends that Plaintiff did not, in fact, timely submit a claim to the
government, in accordance with Government Code, section 911.2.  However, the only fact Defendant cites in
support of which the Court can properly take judicial notice is that Defendant
rejected Plaintiff’s claim on July 5, 2023.
 
            Nevertheless,
in opposition, Plaintiff concedes that the government claim was not
timely presented to Defendant pursuant to Section 911.2.  In particular, Plaintiff admits that the government
claim was mailed to Defendant on May 17, 2023 – 11 months after the alleged
incident occurred on June 13, 2022. (Opp. at p. 5; Comp. ¶ 13.)[1]  
 
            In reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
statutory right to petition the Court for relief was untimely pursuant to
Government Code section 946.6.  Whether
Plaintiff is entitled to present a late government claim is not squarely before
the Court vis-à-vis Defendant’s demurrer. 

 
            In short, because Plaintiff has
failed to comply with the presentation requirement as set forth in the GCA, the
Court finds that Plaintiff’s action against Defendant is barred as a matter of
law.  
 
B.    
LEAVE TO AMEND
 
A plaintiff has the burden of showing in what
manner the complaint could be amended and how the amendment would change the
legal effect of the complaint, i.e., state a cause of action. (See The
Inland Oversight Committee v City of San Bernardino (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th
771, 779; PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v Hulven Int'l, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 156, 189.) A plaintiff must not only state the legal basis for
the amendment, but also the factual allegations sufficient to state a cause of
action or claim. (See PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v Hulven Int'l, Inc.,
supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at p. 189.) Moreover, a plaintiff does not meet his
or her burden by merely stating in the opposition to a demurrer or motion to
strike that “if the Court finds the operative complaint deficient, plaintiff
respectfully requests leave to amend.” (See Major Clients Agency v Diemer
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1133; Graham v Bank of America (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 594, 618 [asserting an abstract right to amend does not satisfy the
burden].)
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to meet this burden, as the opposition
simply indicates, “Finally, this honorable court has wide discretion
with regard to granting leave to amend, and ‘[a] trial court abuses its
discretion if it sustains a demurrer without leave to amend when the plaintiff
shows a reasonable possibility to cure any defect by amendment.’ Balikov v.
S. Cal. Gas Co., 94 Cal. App. 4th 816, 820 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 2001).”  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court sustains Defendant’s Demurrer to the
First Cause of Action without leave to amend. 

 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service regarding the same.
