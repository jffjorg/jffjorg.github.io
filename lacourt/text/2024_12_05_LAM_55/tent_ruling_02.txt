 Case Number:  22STCV15370    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2024    Dept:  55 22STCV15370
Defendants’ Motion to Bifurcate Punitive Damages Claims
Defendants Marathon Industries, Inc. and Marathon Fleet Repair
Services, Inc. move for an order bifurcating the issue of liability for
punitive damages at trial from a determination of the amount of punitive
damages. Plaintiff does not oppose the motion. The Court finds good cause to
grant the motion. Accordingly, the parties shall prepare for a bifurcated trial
on the issue of punitive damages only. The first phase of the trial shall include
evidence related to potential liability for punitive damages. The second phase,
if necessary, will begin immediately after the first phase concludes and will focus
on the amount of punitive damages.
