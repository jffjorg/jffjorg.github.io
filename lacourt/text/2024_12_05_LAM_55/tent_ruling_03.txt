NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS: Hearing on Starr Aviation Agency, Inc.’s Motion for Leave to
Intervene
 
Starr Aviation Agency, Inc.’s Motion for Leave to Intervene
is granted. 
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Kristen M Wallis, as personal representative of
the Estate of Tyson Wallis, filed this wrongful death action against Robinson
Helicopter Company, Inc. (“Defendant”), alleging that Tyson died in a Robinson
R44 helicopter when it crashed on March 25, 2022.
Plaintiffs Basia Trout and Roger Trout filed a separate
complaint in case number 22TRCV00428, against Defendant alleging causes of
action for wrongful death of Lora Trout arising out of the same March 25, 2022,
helicopter accident. 
The causes of action in both complaints are: (1) Strict
Product Liability; and (2) Negligence.
On August 15, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to
consolidate both cases. 
Starr Aviation Agency, Inc. filed
a Motion for Leave to Intervene. The
motion is unopposed. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
“The court shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty
to intervene in the action or proceeding if … the following condition[] is
satisfied: (A) A provision of law confers an unconditional right to intervene.”
Code Civ. Proc., § 387 (d)(1)(A). “If either the employee or the employer
brings an action against such third person, he shall forthwith give the other a
copy of the complaint by personal service of certified mail.” Lab. Code, §
3853. “If the action is brought by either the employer or the employee, the
other may, at any time before trial on the facts, join as party plaintiff or
shall consolidate his action, if brought independently.” Ibid.
“If an employee injured in the course of his or her
employment by a third party commences an action against that third party, Labor
Code section 3853 grants the employee’s employer an unconditional right to
intervene in the action at any time before trial on the facts.” Mar v. Sakti
Internat. Corp. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1780, 1782. “In this context, ‘employer’
includes the employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier.” Summers v.
Newman (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1021, 1024 (citing Lab. Code § 3850).

Helicopters Inc.(“SKY”) for workers’ compensation insurance. Decedent Lora
Trout was an employee of SKY, and Starr has paid her beneficiary death benefits
totaling $197,152.01. As SKY’s workers’ compensation insurer, Starr is entitled
to intervene. Therefore, Starr’s motion is granted. 
 
CONCLUSION
Starr’s Motion for Leave to
Intervene is granted. Starr is ordered to file and serve its Complaint-in-Intervention,
attached as Ex. A to the Declaration of Ktherine A. Sandoval, within 7 days of
