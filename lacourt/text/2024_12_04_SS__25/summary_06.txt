And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Confirmed, LLC, which alleges that the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Vivek Shah is moot because Defendant removed the non-compliant job posting and updated other job postings to include pay scales. The Judge disagrees with Defendant's argument, finding that the Complaint still states a cause of action alleging a violation of California Labor Code Section 432.3. The Judge further finds that Plaintiff has pled ongoing harm and various requests for relief, including injunctive relief. Therefore, the Judge overrules the demurrer and orders Defendant to serve and electronically file its answer to the Complaint within 10 days of the ruling.
