And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion to set aside/vacate the dismissal entered on June 20, 2024. The plaintiff, Ely Sandoval, filed a complaint against William Zimmer on December 21, 2022, alleging a single cause of action for motor vehicle negligence. However, the plaintiff failed to appear at a scheduled hearing on June 20, 2024, resulting in the dismissal of the complaint.

The plaintiff's counsel, Frank Canter, claims that the failure to appear was due to an inadvertent calendaring error caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and a major break-in at his law office. The judge has found that the motion was timely filed and that the plaintiff has established a right to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).

As a result, the judge has granted the motion and set aside the dismissal. The judge has also set an order to show cause re: proof of service in compliance with California Rules of Court 3.110(b) to February 10, 2025, and has set the trial date to June 24, 2025. The parties are required to comply with the trial requirements as set forth in the court's Third Amended Standing Order for Limited Civil Cases.
