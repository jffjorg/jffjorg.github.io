ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On January 31, 2024, Wawanesa General
Insurance Co. (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against Jose Rivas Aguero
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-20, alleging a Motor Vehicle cause of action. This
action arises out of a traffic collision on July 28, 2023 on E. 79th St &
Main St, Los Angeles, CA 90003. (Compl., ¶ MV-1.) Plaintiff insured Juan Coria.
(Compl., ¶ A-2.0.) Plaintiff alleges its insured suffered property damage as a
result of Defendant’s negligence. (Compl., ¶ 11.) 
 
On May 13, 2024, Defendant filed an
Answer.
 
On September 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Amend the Complaint (the “Motion”) and filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”). Plaintiff seeks this order on the grounds that the
filing of the original complaint was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. 
 
No Opposition has been filed.
 
On October 22, 2024, the Court found
that while Plaintiff substantially met the requirements as set forth in
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, the Notice of Motion, Motion, and
accompanying declaration were served by mail to the wrong address –
specifically, the documents were served to “915 E 48th St” instead of “915 E 84th
St”. (Emphasis added.) Since Plaintiff had not properly served Defendant, the
Court continued the hearing to allow Plaintiff to correct the error. (10/22/24 Order.)
 
Additionally, the Court notes the non-Jury
Trial in this matter is also set for today.
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
As an initial matter, Plaintiff has
not filed a new proof of service, or any sort of document, following the
October 22, 2024 hearing, despite the Court’s order. (10/22/24 Order.) Thus, the
Court finds Defendant was still not properly served with the Notice of
Motion, Motion, and accompanying declaration. 
 
III.             
Legal
Standard
 
            Leave
to amend is permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(a), which states: “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms
as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding
or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name
of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms,
enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may likewise, in its
discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be
just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may
upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time limited by this
code.”
 
“Although courts are bound
to apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint
at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial [citations], this
policy should be applied only ‘where no prejudice is shown to the adverse party
. . .. [citation].  A different result is
indicated ‘where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing
party’ is shown. [Citation].” (Magpali v.
Farmers Group (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
 
            A
motion for leave to amend a pleading must also comply with the procedural
requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which requires that a motion to amend
must:  “[i]nclude a copy of the proposed…
amended pleading… [and] state what allegations in the previous pleading are
proposed to be [deleted and/or added], if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number, the [deleted and/or additional] allegations are located.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1321(a).) 
 
A motion for leave to
amend a pleading must also include “[a] separate declaration must accompany the
motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations
were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1321(b).)
 
IV.             
Discussion

 
Plaintiff seeks leave of court to file a FAC that would correct the
amount of actual damages from $18,461.71 to $88,461.71. (Motion, p. 4.) 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a). The Motion includes a copy of the proposed FAC (Motion, Exh. A) and
sets forth the allegations to be added and/or deleted along with the
corresponding paragraph numbers. (Motion, p. 4.) 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion also includes a separate declaration from attorney
Mark R. Nivinskus that substantially satisfies California Rules of Court, rule
3.1321(b). Indeed, the declaration states that Plaintiff seeks to amend the
amount for actual damages to correct an error with the effect that it would
provide time to allow Plaintiff’s action to be settled or decided accurately on
the merits. (Nivinskus Decl., ¶¶ 5, 10.) Plaintiff’s counsel states he
discovered this error “subsequent to the filing of Plaintiff’s original
complaint” and after Defendant filed an Answer, and thus this Motion is
necessary and proper to correct the mistake. (Nivinskus Decl., ¶¶ 6-9.) Plaintiff
has substantially met the requirements set forth in California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1324(b). 
 
Provided Plaintiff satisfactorily rectifies the procedural issues
described herein, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a FAC will be granted.
