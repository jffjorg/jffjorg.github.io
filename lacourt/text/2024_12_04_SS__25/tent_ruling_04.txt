ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On June 21, 2024, Petitioner Royce
Cinderella, LLC dba Cinderella Mobilehome Park (“Petitioner”) filed a Verified
Petition for Injunctive Relief Pursuant to Civil Code Section 798.88 (the
“Petition”) against Respondent Mary Louise Valenzuela (“Respondent”). The
Petition sought to enjoin Respondent from violating the terms of Petitioner’s
“Community Policies of Cinderella Mobile Home Park” (“Park Rules”) and the Rental
Agreement under Civil Code section 798.88 (Petn., ¶¶ 4-6, Prayer), also known
as the Mobilehome Residency Law (Civ. Code, § 798.) These violations include
failing to trim the weeds, plants, and bushes around the home; failing to
remove debris, clutter, trash, and improper storage; failing to repair damaged
sewer pipes/lines; threatening and harassing other Park residents; failing to
maintain vehicle stored on premises; failing to supervise pet when outside of
the home; and failing to provide management with up-to-date vaccination and
registration records of pet. (Petn., ¶¶ 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22.) Respondent’s
conduct allegedly violates Rules 4(B), 4(E), 9(D), 10(A), 10(B), 10(B)(5),
19(N), 21(A), and 22(B) of the Park Rules, which are incorporated into their
written lease agreement. (Petn., Prayer, ¶ 1; Petn., Exh. 1, ¶ 13.) 
 
Petitioner requests an injunction
against Respondent from failing to: trim overgrown plants/trees, removing
weeds, or watering landscaping as necessary; repair damaged sewer pipe/lines;
remove unapproved storage items and trash; supervise pet when pet is outside
the home; provide Park Management with up-to-date registration and vaccination
records for all pets living on Premises; maintain all vehicles on the Premises
in a clean and presentable manner; and maintain all department of motor vehicle
registration tags up-to-date for all vehicles stored on premises. (Petn.
Prayer, ¶ 1(a)-(g).) Petitioner also requests an injunction from harassing and
threatening other Park residents, causing the Park residents to fear for their
health, safety, and well-being, and violating the Rental Agreement and the Park
Rules. (Petn., Prayer, ¶ 1(h)-(i).) Finally, Petitioner requests reasonable
attorney fees and costs. (Petn., Prayer, ¶¶ 2-4.) 
 
On October 25, 2024, the Court initially
held a hearing on the Petition. At the hearing, the Court determined the
Petition was supported by clear and convincing evidence of Respondent’s
violations of the Park’s reasonable Rules and Regulations. (10/25/24 Order.)
However, the Court found service was improper and thus continued the Petition
to allow Petitioner to file proper proof of service demonstrating the
Respondent was properly served with the Petition. (10/25/24 Order.) The Court
further ordered that “[a]t least five (5) court days before the next scheduled
hearing, Petitioner must file proof of service demonstrating the Petition was
properly served on Respondent. (10/25/24 Order.) Additionally, the October 25th
Minute Order notes: “Respondent Mary Louise Valenzuela appears in court, is
handed a copy of the Court’s Tentative Ruling and is advised of today’s
continuance order.” (10/25/24 Order.)
 
On October 31, 2024, Petitioner filed
proof of personal service demonstrating Respondent was served with the
Petition, Proposed Order, Civil Case Cover Sheet, Civil Case Cover Sheet
Addendum and Statement of Location, Notice of Case Assignment, and General
Order on June 27, 2024. (10/31/24 Proof of Service.) The Court finds Respondent
was provided reasonable notice of the Petition in advance of the new hearing
date.
                                                                                                   
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
The Mobilehome
Residency Law (“MRL”) gives management an injunctive relief remedy for
violations of “reasonable” park rules and regulations. (Civ. Code, § 798.88.)
Specifically, management may obtain a restraining order against a continuing or
recurring violation of any “reasonable rule or regulation.” (Civ. Code, §
798.88, subd. (b); Rancho Santa Paula Mobilehome Park, Ltd. v. Evans
(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1142.) At the time of the hearing, the court shall
issue the injunction if it finds by clear and convincing evidence the existence
of a continuing or recurring violation of a “reasonable rule or regulation.”
(Civ. Code, § 798.88, subd. (d).) The duration of the injunction may not exceed
three years. (Civ. Code, § 798.88, subd. (d).)
 
III.             
Discussion
 
As an initial matter, the Court notes
the Petition is signed but not dated. (Petn., p. 7.) 
 
Substantively, the Petition is
verified by an authorized agent for Petitioner, although the name of whom is
unknown as the verification signature is indiscernible. (Petn., Verification.)
The Petition is supported by a copy of the Rental Agreement between Petitioner
and Respondent (Petn., Exh.1); a copy of the Park Rules (Petn., Exh. 2); copies
of eight written notices to Respondent and accompanying proofs of service
(Petn., Exhs. 3-14); and photographs of continuing violations as of May 29,
2024. (Petn., Exh. 15.) The Rental Agreement states Respondent has resided on
the Premises since March 8, 2007. (Petn., Exh. 1, p. 1.) The Rental Agreement
incorporates the Park Rules, thereby requiring the residents to abide by the
same. (Petn., Exh. 1, ¶ 13.) 
 
Respondent has been in violation of
Rules 10(A), 10(B), and 9(D) since July 7, 2023, and thereafter. (Petn., Exh.
3-4.) These violations include failing to upkeep landscaping, failing to remove
debris, clutter, trash, and improper storage, and failing to repair damaged
sewer pipes/lines. (Petn., ¶¶ 3-8.) On July 7, 2023, Petitioner issued two
seven-day notices to comply with Park Rules to Respondent. (Petn., Exhs. 3-4.)
Respondent did not comply with Park Rules by July 21, 2023, at which time
Petitioner issued another seven-day notice. (Petn., Exhs. 5-6.) Respondent
again did not comply with the Park Rules by August 3, 2023, at which time
Petitioner issued two more seven-day notices. (Petn., Exhs. 7-8.) Respondent
also has repeatedly violated Park Rule 4 since August 2023. (Petn., Exhs.
9-12.) These violations include threatening and harassing other Park members
and failing to repair damaged sewer pipes/lines. (Petn., ¶¶ 16-20.) On August
23, 2023, Petitioner issued a seven-day notice to Respondent to comply with
Park Rule 4(E). (Petn., Exhs. 9-10.) On November 9, 2023, Petitioner issued a
seven-day notice to Respondent to comply with Park Rule 4(B). (Petn., Exhs.
11-12.) 
 
On May 17, 2024, Petitioner issued a
seven-day notice to comply with Park Rules as well as a letter warning that
continued non-compliance with Park Rules could result in termination of the
lease agreement.  (Petn., Exhs. 13-14.)
The violations included harassment of other Park members and failure to upkeep
landscaping, repair damaged sewer pipes/lines, remove unapproved storage items,
maintain vehicle, supervise pet on Premises, and provide updated pet records to
Park Management. (Petn., ¶ 22.) The letter noted that Respondent failed to
comply with all previous notices of violations and stated Respondent’s current
violations constituted the following: impermissible storage of items on
porches, in carports or outside of storage sheds; damaged sewer pipe on Premises;
insufficient maintenance of yard; unmaintained vehicle on Premises; having a
pet outside in the Park without supervision; having a pet without providing
up-to-date records to Park Management; and harassing or threatening other Park
residents. (Petn., Exh. 15.) The Court notes that while the Petition states
these violations were of Park Rules 9(D), 10(A), 10(B)(5), 19(N), 21(A), and
22(B) (Petn. ¶ 22), the May 2024 letter and notice state these violations were
of Rules F(13), F(25), F(3), D(1), G(9), G(2), G(14), and H(7) in the “Park’s
Residency Documents.” (Petn., Exh. 13, Exh. A, “Description of Violations –
Current Violations.”) Given that the content of both rule sets substantially
align and both are
promulgated by the Park in accordance with the Rental Agreement, this
discrepancy is not dispositive. 
 
The violations of Park Rules 9(D),
10(A), 10(B), and 10(B)(5) for “landscaping, presence of prohibited
miscellaneous items and trash, the expired tags on the vehicle stored on the
Premises, and the overall lack of the maintenance of said vehicle” remained as
of May 29, 2024, as demonstrated by photographs taken of the Premises. (Petn., ¶
26; Petn., Exh. 15.) 
 
Therefore, the Petition is supported
by clear and convincing evidence of Respondent’s violations of the Park’s
reasonable Rules and Regulations. Further, no response to the Petition has been
filed showing why an injunction should not issued.
