(“Global Home”), Zhirayr Jerry Lusikyan (“Lusikyan”), individually and dba  Global Home, Narine Fstkchyan (“Fstkchyan”), individually and as trustee of the  Narine Separate Property Trust, Harut Fstkdayam (“Harut”), Hagop Fstkdayam  (“Hagop”), and the North River Insurance Company (“North River Insurance”) (“Defendants”)  for breach of contract; quantum meruit; account stated; foreclosure of  Mechanic’s Lien; enforcement against on Mechanic Lien’s Lien Release Bond;  Recovery on Contractor’s License Bond; and Recovery on Personal Guaranty.    The Complaint alleges that on or  around January 23, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendants Global Home and Lusikyan  entered into a written contract Credit Application (the “Contract”), “the  purpose of which was to allow Global Home and Lusikyan to purchase building  materials from Plaintiff on a credit basis for various projects for which  Global Home and Lusikyan would perform construction services, including the  private work of improvement of their property located at 6525 Varna Avenue, Van  Nuys, CA 91401.”  (Complaint, ¶ 15.)  Plaintiff alleges that on or about March 9,  2023, Global Home and Lusikyan breached their Contract by failing to pay the  sum then due and owing to Plaintiff in the amount of approximately $23,771.45,  and by requiring Plaintiff to provide equipment and materials without  compensation. (Complaint, ¶ 18.)     On October 12, 2023, default was entered against  Defendants Global Home and Lusikyan (individually and dba Global Home).    On November 29, 2023, default was entered against  Defendant Harut.    On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the action as to  North River Insurance only. (6/25/24 Request for Dismissal.)    On July 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Order for  Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation. On August 15, 2024, the Court denied the  motion without prejudice, finding that Plaintiff failed to attach the fully  executed stipulation and default notice referenced in the accompanying  declarations. (8/15/24 Order.)    On August 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion  for Order to Enter Judgment Against the Defendants Pursuant to Stipulation (the  “Motion”), which includes the fully executed stipulation and default notice  referenced in the accompanying declarations. (Motion, Exhs. A, B.) No Opposition  was filed.      On October 21, 2024, the Court found Plaintiff failed to  effect proper service of the Motion because Plaintiff failed to serve Hagop and  Fstkchyan. Thus, the Court continued the Motion to allow Plaintiff time to  serve the Motion on all parties. (10/21/24 Order.)   On October 22, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed the action as to  Hagop, Fstkchyan, and Does 1-100. However, the Court notes the Request for  Dismissal lists “Hagop Fstkdayam and Narine Fstkdayam,” rather than “Narine Fstkchyan”;  thus, the last name for Narine is erroneous and should be corrected.   II.                  Legal  Standard & Discussion    As an initial matter, the Court notes that, given  Plaintiff’s dismissal of Hagop and Fstkchyan on October 22, 2024, the service  of process issues discussed at the October 21, 2024 hearing have been remedied.  Accordingly, the Court proceeds to make a finding on the merits of the Motion.   Under Code of Civil Procedure, section  664.6:     (a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the  parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for  settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter  judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,  the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement  until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.    (b) For purposes of this section, a  writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:    (1) The party.  (2) An attorney who represents the  party.  (3) If an insurer is defending and  indemnifying a party to the action, an agent who is authorized in writing by  the insurer to sign on the party’s behalf. This paragraph does not apply if the  party whom the insurer is defending would be liable under the terms of the  settlement for any amount above the policy limits.”    Plaintiff moves for an order for  judgment pursuant to the stipulation against Defendants. The Stipulation for  Future Entry of Judgment (the “Stipulation”) filed by Plaintiff was signed by  Defendants Global Home and Lusikyan, individually and dba Global Home, and  Plaintiff on March 26, 2024. (Motion, Exh. A, p. 5.) Accordingly, the Court  considers the Motion as brought by Plaintiff and against Global Home and  Lusikyan, individually and dba Global Home, only.    The Stipulation provides the matter  would be settled for a total sum of $38,270.24 to be paid by Defendants at a  rate of $4,252.25 per month, beginning April 30, 2024 and continuing each month  thereafter until December 31, 2024. (Motion, Exh. A, ¶¶ 1-2.) The Stipulation  provides specific monthly deadlines for each installment payment as well as the  specific mode of payment. (Motion, Exh. A, ¶¶ 2, 4.) Additionally, the  Stipulation states there is no grace period for the installment payments.  (Motion, Exh. A, ¶ 3.)    The Stipulation further provides that  failure to make a timely payment constitutes a default and, in the event of  default, the unpaid balance will become immediately due, and Plaintiff’s  counsel may immediately appear ex parte, without providing notice in order to  obtain judgment. (Motion, Exh. A, ¶ 6.) The Stipulation then states “the Court  may then issue the Judgment, which shall describe the amount due, and which  shall permit [Plaintiff] to immediately enforce the terms thereof and collect  the sums owed from [Defendants], including $38,130.24 less payments received.”  (Motion, Exh. A, ¶ 6.)    Here, the Court finds the Stipulation  to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  Plaintiff submitted evidence Plaintiff and Lusikyan and Global Home entered  into a Stipulation on or about March 26, 2024. (Motion, Exh. A, p. 5.) Pursuant  to the Stipulation, Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff $38,130.24 less payments  received in the event of default, which could be proven solely by a declaration  from Plaintiff’s counsel. (Motion, Exh. A, ¶ 6.) Plaintiff submitted a  declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel pursuant to the Stipulation. (Oh Decl.)  While Plaintiff dismissed North River Insurance from the action on June 25,  2024, the Court retained jurisdiction on the matter as this was only a partial  dismissal and the action against Defendants Lusikyan and Global Home is still  before this Court. (See Casa De Valley View Owner’s Assn. v. Stevenson (1985)  167 Cal.App.3d 1182, 1192.) Plaintiff submitted evidence Defendants failed to  perform under the Stipulation as promised, and Plaintiff’s counsel attempted to  contact Defendants regarding the default to no avail. (Oh Decl. ¶ 4; Motion,  Exh. B.)   Further, Plaintiff provides evidence  that North River Insurance issued a payment of $7,500 “for the full amount of  the penal sum of the Contractors’ License Bond,” and Plaintiff “applied this  partial payment towards reducing the principal amount owed by Defendants.” (Oh  Decl., ¶ 6; Manley Decl., ¶ 8.) As of the date this Motion was filed, however,  Plaintiff had not received any payments from Defendants or any communication  stating Defendants will pay any amount. (Manley Decl., ¶¶ 6-7; Oh Decl., ¶¶ 3,  5.) Accordingly, Plaintiff submitted evidence Defendants breached the  Stipulation, and Plaintiff is entitled to an order enforcing the Stipulation  and entering judgment against Lusikyan and Global Home.    Plaintiff requests that a judgment of  $30,770.24, based on the principal amount of $38,270.24 less payment received  in the amount of $7,500, be entered against Lusikyan and Global Home. (Motion,  p. 6; Manley Decl., ¶¶ 8-9; Oh Decl., ¶ 6.)    However, the Court notes Plaintiff’s  calculation for the Judgment differs slightly from the calculation listed in  the definite terms of the Default section of the Stipulation, which states that  the Judgment shall be “$38,130.24 less payments received.” (Motion, Exh.  A, ¶ 6, emphasis added.)    Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request is GRANTED in the  reduced total amount of $30,630.24, reflecting $38,130.24 less the payment of  $7,500 received.   III.               Conclusion  & Order   Plaintiff BFS Group of California, LLC’s unopposed  Motion for Order for Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation is GRANTED in the reduced  amount of $30,630.24.    Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation (CCP 664.6) is to be  entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants Global Home Design &  Development, Inc., Zhirayr Jerry Lusikyan, and  Zhirayr Jerry Lusikyan individually and dong  business s Global Design & Development, jointly and severally in the TOTAL amount  of $30,630.24.   Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to electronically submit  a proposed form of Judgment, consistent with this Court’s Ruling, within  10-days.   The Order to Show Cause Re:  Proof of Service is hereby discharged.   The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re:  Plaintiff’s Request for Entry of Default  Judgment as to Remaining Defendant Harut Fstkdayam (CCP 3.110(h)) is set for  JANUARY 29, 2025at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
