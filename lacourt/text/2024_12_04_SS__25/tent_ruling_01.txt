ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background

 
On November 11, 2022, Plaintiff Farmers
Insurance Exchange (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Noah Dinard
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-5 requesting damages of $24,265.01. (Compl., p. 1,
Prayer.) 
 
On March 2, 2023, Defendant filed an
Answer.
 
On May 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
“Stipulation for Entry of Judgment in the Event of Default” (the
“Stipulation”). 
 
On August 13, 2024, the Honorable
Karine Mkrtchyan signed an order dismissing the action but retaining
jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. (8/13/24 Order.)
 
On October 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment
Against Defendant (the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition was filed.   
 
II.                
Procedural
Issues
 
While Plaintiff properly served
Defendant with the Notice of Motion and Motion, Plaintiff failed to provide
proof of service as to the Judgment and Proposed Order.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to file proof of
service demonstrating the Judgment and Proposed Order were served on Defendant
in the next 5 days. 
 
III.             
Legal
Standard & Discussion 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6: 
 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the
parties outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
 
(1) The party. 
(2) An attorney who represents the
party. 
(3) If an insurer is defending and
indemnifying a party to the action, an agent who is authorized in writing by
the insurer to sign on the party’s behalf. This paragraph does not apply if the
party whom the insurer is defending would be liable under the terms of the
settlement for any amount above the policy limits.” 
 
The Stipulation filed by
Plaintiff was signed by Defendant on April 24, 2024, Defendant’s counsel on May
13, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel on May 14, 2024, and an authorized representative
for Plaintiff on May 15, 2024. (5/15/24 Stipulation, p. 4.) 
 
The Stipulation provides
the matter would be settled for a total sum of $11,000. (5/15/24 Stipulation, ¶
4.) The Stipulation states Defendant is to pay the total sum of $11,000,
reflecting $5,000 paid by Defendant’s insurance carrier and $6,000 to be paid
by Defendant as follows: (1) $500 down by June 15, 2024; (2) $75 per month,
beginning July 15, 2024 and continuing on the fifteenth day of each month
thereafter for a period of 24 months; (3) $100 per month, beginning July 15, 2026
and continuing thereafter until the balance is paid in full. (5/15/24
Stipulation, ¶ 2.) 
 
The Stipulation further
states that failure to make a timely payment constitutes a default and, in the
event of default, “Defendant shall be permitted a fifteen-day grace period for
payment of any installment due hereunder. Plaintiff shall give written notice
to Defendant of his default; and, Defendant shall then be allowed an additional
ten days from the date of said written notice to cure the particular default.”
(5/15/24 Stipulation, ¶ 8.) In the event Defendant fails to cure the default, “Plaintiff
may immediately cause Judgment to be entered pursuant to the terms set forth in
this Stipulation for the full amount of the agreed upon judgment as set forth
in Paragraph 1 less any monies paid to date of the breach; and shall also file
a partial Satisfaction of Judgment for all sums previously paid pursuant to
this Stipulation.”  (5/15/24 Stipulation,
¶¶ 6, 8.) Paragraph 1 of the Stipulation states: “The parties stipulate that
Judgment shall be entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the
sum of TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY-FIVE DOLLARS ($24,265.00)
plus costs of suit and prejudgment interest from the date of the loss less any
monies paid to date of breach will be entered as set forth in paragraph 6
below.” (5/15/24 Stipulation, ¶ 1.)
 
The Court finds the
Stipulation to be valid and enforceable under Code of Civil Procedure section
664.6. Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant made partial payment –
Defendant’s insurance carrier paid a total of $5,000. (Benson Decl., ¶ 5.) As
of the date this Motion was filed, however, Plaintiff had received no further
payments from Defendant. (Benson Decl., ¶¶ 5, 8-9.) Plaintiff also presents
evidence of the default payment letter sent to Defendant on July 30, 2024
advising Defendant of the default and the remaining balance then due in the sum
of $6,000. (Benson Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. 2.) Further, Plaintiff presents evidence
that Plaintiff’s office emailed Defendant on or about August 20, 2024
requesting status of his past due payments; Plaintiff received no response. (Benson
Decl., ¶ 7.)
 
Plaintiff requests that a
judgment of $19,340.00, based on the principal amount of $24,265.00,
less payments received in the amount of $5,000.00 plus filing costs of $75.00,
be entered against Defendant. (Benson Decl., ¶ 10.) 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed
Motion is GRANTED, provided Plaintiff satisfactorily rectifies the
procedural issues described herein.
