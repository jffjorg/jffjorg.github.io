(Compl., p. 4.) The claim arose from a motor vehicle collision on  January 2, 2021 that involved Plaintiff and Defendant at or near the vicinity  of 18561 Soledad Canyon Road, City of Santa Clarita, County of Los Angeles,  State of California 91351. (Compl., ¶¶ MV-1, MV-2.)    On June 20, 2024, after failure of  both Plaintiff and Defendant to appear at the scheduled hearing, the Court  dismissed Plaintiff’s Complaint without prejudice. (6/20/24 Order.)   On September 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed  the instant Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Dismissal (the “Motion”). No Opposition  has been filed.   On October 21, 2024, the Court conducted  a hearing on the Motion and found that, while Plaintiff timely filed the Motion  and established a right to relief, Plaintiff failed to comply with Code of  Civil Procedure section 1005 by failing to file proof of service in compliance  with Section 1005. Accordingly, the Court continued the Motion to allow  Plaintiff to file proof of service of the moving papers in compliance with Code  of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).   On November 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed  an Amended Notice of Motion and Motion that contained supplemental papers responding  to the Court’s ruling on October 21, 2024. The supplemental papers include a  declaration by Plaintiff’s Counsel and Proof of Service by mail of the Notice  of Motion and Motion for an Order to Set Aside/Vacate the Dismissal on  Defendant and Defendant’s insurance carrier on November 7, 2024. (Supp. Canter  Decl., ¶¶ 9-11, Exh. 11.)   In light of  these supplemental papers and the attached Proof of Service, the Court finds  Plaintiff’s Motion is now in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section  1005, subdivision (b). Accordingly, the Court proceeds to decide the Motion on  the merits.    II.                  Legal  Standard & Discussion   Plaintiff moves for an order  vacating the dismissal entered on June 20, 2024 pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).    The court has broad discretion to  vacate the entry of default, default judgment, or a dismissal where the moving  party timely establishes a proper ground for relief.  (Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc. (2007)  146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 473,  subdivision (b) contains two distinct provisions for relief from default.   The first provision is discretionary and broad in scope, providing: “The court  may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal  representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken  against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or  excusable neglect.  Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a  copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise  the application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable  time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or  proceeding was taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)    The second provision of Code of  Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) is mandatory, providing: “[T]he  court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months  after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s  sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or  neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or  her client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2)  resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client,  unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by  the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The court shall,  whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct  the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing  counsel or parties. However, this section shall not lengthen the time within  which an action shall be brought to trial pursuant to Section 583.310.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)   The general underlying purpose of  Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) is to promote the  determination of actions on their merits.   (Even Zohar Const. & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015)  61 Cal.4th 830, 838-839.)     Here, Plaintiff’s counsel, Frank Canter, (“Counsel”) contends that the failure to appear at the June 20,  2024 hearing was due to his inadvertent calendaring error as to the hearing  date. (Motion, ¶¶ 13-17; Canter Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) Counsel argues that this error occurred because the  COVID-19 pandemic heavily impacted his law office and his law office suffered a  major break-in, which involved damage to computers, that interfered with his  ability to timely calendar and locate files for this case. (Canter  Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 6-8.)   The Court finds the motion was timely  filed on September 24, 2024, within the six-month statutory period. Counsel’s  declaration established that the June 20, 2024 dismissal was entered due to his  excusable neglect in failing to properly calendar. Counsel noted that this  calendaring error occurred because COVID-19 heavily affected his law office and  a major break-in happened at his law office in September 2023, which included  damage to computers, that interfered with his ability to timely calendar and  locate files for this case. (Canter Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, 6-8.) Plaintiff’s  resulting failure to appear caused the June 20, 2024 dismissal. (Canter Decl.,  ¶¶ 15-18). Therefore, pursuant to the mandatory provision of the Code of Civil  Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), the Court finds Plaintiff has  established a right to relief.   Accordingly, Defendant’s unopposed  Motion is GRANTED.     III.               Conclusion  & Order   For the  foregoing reasons, Plaintiff Ely Sandoval’s unopposed Motion to Set  Aside/Vacate the Dismissal is GRANTED.     The Court sets an Order to Show  Cause Re: Proof of Service in Compliance with California Rules of Court  3.110(b) to February 10, 2025 at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring  Street Courthouse.   The Court sets the Trial Date to  June 24, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 25 of Spring Street  Courthouse.     Parties must comply  with the trial requirements as set forth in the court's Third Amended Standing  Order for Limited Civil Cases (effective February 24, 2020).    All JOINT trial  documents are to be electronically filed at least ten (10) days prior to the  trial date.    Parties should be  prepared to submit a JOINT Trial Readiness Binder / Exhibit Binder, and to  personally appear on the date of trial.   Moving Party is ordered to give notice  of this Court’s ruling.
