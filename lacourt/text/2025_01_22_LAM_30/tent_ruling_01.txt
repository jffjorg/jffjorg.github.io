MOTION
TO COMPEL ARBITRATION
 
 
Defendant The CMI Group dba A to Z Call
Center Services, LP (Defendant) moves for an order compelling Linda Rae
Biesecker-Kesting (Plaintiff) to submit to binding arbitration and stay this
action pending resolution of the arbitration. The motion is granted.
 
A.    Legal Standard
 
“On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate
the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy
exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been
waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the
agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2, subds. (a), (b).)
 
A proceeding to compel arbitration is
in essence a suit in equity to compel specific performance of a contract. (Freeman v. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance
Co. (1975) 14 Cal.3d 473, 479.) Such enforcement may be sought by a party
to the arbitration agreement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1280, subd. (e)(1).) 
 
            A motion to compel arbitration
requires the facts to be proven by affidavit or declaration and documentary
evidence with oral testimony taken only in the court’s discretion. (Code Civ.
Proc., §1290.2; Rosenthal v. Great
Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413–414.) The motion
must set forth the provisions of the written agreement and the arbitration
clause verbatim, or such provisions must be attached and incorporated by
reference. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1330; see Condee v. Longwood Mgmt. Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215,
218.)  
 
            Once the moving party alleges that
an arbitration agreement exists, the burden shifts to the responding party to
prove the falsity of the purported agreement, and no evidence or authentication
is required to find the arbitration agreement exists. (See Condee, supra, 88 Cal.App.4th at p. 219.) However, if the existence of the
agreement is challenged, “[movant] bears the burden of proving [the arbitration
agreement’s] existence by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Rosenthal, supra, p. 413; see also Espejo v. Southern California Permanente
Medical Group (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1058–1060.)
 
B.     Discussion 
 
Defendant
argues that a valid arbitration agreement exists. A party moving to compel
arbitration may meet its initial burden by providing a copy of the signed
arbitration agreement. (Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 158, 165–166 (Gamboa).) The opposing party may produce
evidence to challenge the agreement in response. (Ibid.) Then, the
moving party must use admissible evidence to show a valid agreement. (Ibid.)
Here, Defendant provides evidence of multiple arbitration agreements accepted
by Plaintiff by referencing the motion to compel arbitration filed by Charter
Communications, Inc. (Charter). (Flores Decl. ¶¶ 14, 29, Exs. 1, 7.) Plaintiff
does not challenge the existence of these agreements or the authenticity of her
signature. Thus, Defendant has met its burden. 
 
Defendant
argues that it is entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement as an agent of
Charter. Non-signatory defendants may enforce arbitration agreements where
there is sufficient identity of parties. (Marenco v. DirecTV LLC (2015)
233 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1417 (Marenco).) “Enforcement is permitted where
the nonsignatory is the agent for a party to an arbitration agreement.” (Ibid.,
citing Dryer v. Los Angeles Rams (1985) 40 Cal.3d 406, 418 (Dryer).)
In Dryer, the plaintiff alleged that individual nonsignatory defendants were
acting as agents for the defendant party to the arbitration agreement. (Dryer,
supra, at p. 418.) The court held that those defendants were entitled to
the benefit of the arbitration provisions because they acted as agents to the
signatory. (Ibid.) Here, Defendant acted on behalf of Charter to collect
payments from Plaintiff, acting as an agent of Charter. Indeed, Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant acted as Charter’s agent. (Compl. ¶ 11.) Moreover, the
arbitration agreement specifically extends to “affiliates” and “third parties
[Charter] may retain to provide the Services.” (Flores Decl. Ex. 1.) Defendant
provided services to Charter in the form of debt collection. (Compl. ¶ 10.) Thus,
under Dryer Defendant is entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement.
 
Plaintiff
cites Daniels v. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 674,
680, for the proposition that agreements to arbitrate do not extend to
nonsignatories. In Daniels, a plaintiff alleging wrongful death sought
to avoid an arbitration agreement he had signed acting as the decedent’s agent.
The court held that because plaintiff had not entered into the agreement in a
personal capacity, the arbitration clause did not bind their individual claims.
(Ibid.) In the present case, a nonsignatory agent seeks to enforce an
arbitration agreement instead. Thus, under Dryer Defendant may enforce
the arbitration agreement as Charter’s agent. The Court need not address
Defendant’s estoppel argument.
 
Plaintiff
objects that the agreement in question is unconscionable. However, the Court
has previously ruled that this is an issue for the arbitrator. “Parties
to an arbitration agreement may agree to delegate to the arbitrator, instead of
a court, questions regarding the enforceability of the agreement.” (Tiri v.
Lucky Chances Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 231, 241 (Tiri).) Parties
may even delegate disputes over the enforceability of the agreement itself. (Ibid.)
For such a delegation clause to be effective, its language must be clear and unmistakable,
and it must not be revocable under state contract defenses such as fraud,
duress, or unconscionability. (Id. at p. 242.) Here, the
arbitration agreement between the parties includes a clause that vests
exclusive authority in the arbitrator “to resolve any dispute relating to the
interpretation, applicability, scope, or enforceability of these arbitration
provisions.” (Flores Decl., Ex. 1.) This qualifies as clear and unmistakable
language under Tiri. 
 
Additionally, the Court determined that
the delegation clause is revocable due to unconscionability. Unconscionability generally requires a
finding of both procedural and substantive unconscionability. (Stirlen v.
Supercuts, Inc. (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1533.) They need not be present
to the same degree: a sliding scale is used such that the greater the
procedural or substantive unconscionability present, the less that is required
of the other. (Gentry v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 443, 469 (Gentry).)

 
Procedural unconscionability
“addresses the circumstances of contract negotiation and formation, focusing on
oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power.” (Haydon v. Elegance
at Dublin (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 1280, 1287 (Haydon).) In assessing
procedural unconscionability, courts must ask “whether circumstances of the
contract’s formation created such oppression or surprise that closer scrutiny
of its overall fairness is required.” (Ibid.) Oppression occurs where a
contract’s formation lacks negotiation or meaningful choice. (Ibid.) Surprise
may be found where the allegedly unconscionable provision is hidden in a boilerplate
printed form. (Ibid.) 
 
Generally, unconscionability
analysis begins with whether the contract is one of adhesion. (Armendariz v.
Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 113.) Such
contracts are standardized and imposed and drafted by a party of superior
bargaining strength; the subscribing party is left with the choice to adhere to
the contract or reject it. (Ibid.) Here, the arbitration agreement is a
non-negotiated adhesion contract between a heavily resourced communications
company and an individual consumer. Such a contract is generally procedurally
unconscionable. (Cabatit v. Sunnova Energy Corporation (2020) 60
Cal.App.5th 317, 323.) However, California courts have recently noted that such
contracts are “indispensable facts of modern life that are generally enforced”
and that a lack of ability to negotiate terms does not by itself demonstrate
procedural unconscionability. (Murphy v. Twitter, Inc. (2021) 60
Cal.App.5th 12, 37.) Thus, the present contract being one of adhesion makes a
finding of procedural unconscionability more likely but not guaranteed.
Plaintiff does not advance any other arguments concerning procedural
unconscionability, however. Accordingly, the Court does not find the delegation
clause procedurally unconscionable.
 
Even if the Court found a low
degree of procedural unconscionability in the delegation clause, Plaintiff must still demonstrate a high
degree of substantive unconscionability to render it unenforceable. (Gentry,
supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 469.) Substantive unconscionability exists when
a contract “imposes unduly harsh or one-sided results.” (Haydon, supra,
97 Cal.App.5th at p. 1289.) Nothing about the delegation provision produces
unfair results. It merely tasks the arbitrator, rather than the Court, with
deciding arbitrability. Accordingly, the Court does not find the delegation
clause substantively unconscionable, either. 
 
Defendant
additionally requests that the present proceedings be stayed pending the
outcome of arbitration. If a court orders arbitration of a controversy, the
court shall stay the action or proceeding until arbitration is complete on
motion by a party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.) Here, the Court has ordered
arbitration. Accordingly, the proceedings are stayed pending the outcome of
that arbitration.         
 
Conclusion 
The motion to compel
arbitration filed by Defendant is granted and the proceedings are stayed
pending completion of arbitration.
