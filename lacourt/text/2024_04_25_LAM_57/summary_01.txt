The Judge has determined that the Defendant has willfully disregarded the Court's order to produce an unredacted claim file. The Defendant's failure to comply with the order is not considered a "technical violation", but rather a violation of the order. The Judge has taken into account the Defendant's track record of non-compliance with the Court's discovery orders and has decided to strike the Defendant's answer and enter a default against the Defendant. The Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the form of attorney's fees incurred in connection with the motion for terminating sanctions is also granted. The Judge's decision renders moot the Defendant's pending discovery motions that were scheduled for today.
