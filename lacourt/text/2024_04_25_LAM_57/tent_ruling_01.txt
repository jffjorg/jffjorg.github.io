  Case Number:  19STCV40504    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  57 Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions is granted.   The Court has determined that Defendant has willfully disregarded the Court's October 18, 2023 order compelling Defendant to produce an unredacted claim file.   Defendant did not produce an unredacted claim file.   Its failure to do so was not a "technical violation" of the order.  It was a violation of the order, plain and simple. The track record of  Defendant's non-compliance with the Court's other discovery orders, prior to the one issued on October 18, 2023, is not, as Defendant claims, "unrelated procedural history."  It is related, relevant, procedural history that informs the Court's determination that terminating sanctions are warranted at this point.   In light of that determination, the Court is striking Defendant's answer and entering a default against Defendant.   Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the form of attorney's fees incurred in connection with the motion for terminating sanctions is granted.   The Court's decision to grant Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions renders moot Defendants' pending discovery motions that are on calendar today.
