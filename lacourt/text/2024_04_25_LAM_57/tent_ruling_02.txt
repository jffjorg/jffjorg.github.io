 Case Number:  23STCV09308    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is granting the motion of the individual Defendants to quash the service and summons of the Plaintiff's complaint.  Plaintiff has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that these Defendants purposefully availed themselves of the benefits of the forum and therefore has failed to show that this Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants.   The Court gave Plaintiff the ability to conduct jurisdictional discovery to gather evidence to fend off Defendants' motion.  In its supplemental brief, however, Plaintiff failed to offer any of the evidence that it may have gathered during that discovery period.The Court is denying Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to its request for production of documents.  Based on the Court's evaluation of the parties' separate statements submitted in connection with the motion, Plaintiff has failed to show that there is good cause to compel further responses.
