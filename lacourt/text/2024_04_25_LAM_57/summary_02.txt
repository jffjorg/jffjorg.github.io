And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the individual defendants to quash the service and summons of the plaintiff's complaint, as well as the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses. The court has granted the defendants' motion, finding that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the defendants purposefully availed themselves of the benefits of the forum, and therefore failed to show that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants. The court also denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses, finding that the plaintiff failed to show good cause to compel further responses.
