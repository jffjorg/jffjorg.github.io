And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Theresa M. Traber in a toxic tort action alleging that plaintiff Arturo Montoya-Bautista developed silicosis and consequential injuries by breathing in dust from defendants' stone products. Defendant M S International, Inc. demurs to the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment and moves to strike portions of the complaint.

The court rules that the demurrer is overruled, finding that the allegations of fraudulent concealment are sufficient to state a cause of action. However, the court grants the motion to strike the allegation "[other stone products to be identified during the course of discovery]" because it is inconsistent with the requirements of Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71. The court notes that leave to amend the complaint may be granted in the future if discovery reveals that an amendment to list another product or products is justified.
