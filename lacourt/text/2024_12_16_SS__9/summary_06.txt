And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling orders the Petitioner, whose identity cannot be verified, to submit to a Live Scan to enable a complete California Criminal History to be run. The Petitioner must contact the Name Change Clerk in the Clerk's Office to obtain instructions on how to have fingerprints taken for a California Record Review Live Scan and the results sent to the Court Clerk. The petition is continued to February 24, 2025 to allow for this process to take place. If the Petitioner fails to follow these instructions and provide sufficient information to run a criminal history assessment prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice. The Name Change Clerk is ordered to run and complete a criminal history assessment prior to the continued hearing, and the Court Clerk is to give notice.
