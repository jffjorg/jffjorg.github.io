And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a name change petition. The Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is spelled correctly and legibly. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is required at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written or spelled correctly, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a revised proposed decree. The petition has been granted, and a signed copy of the decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
