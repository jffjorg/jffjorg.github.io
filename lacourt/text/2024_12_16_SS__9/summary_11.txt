And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition for name change, but with certain conditions. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. The signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
