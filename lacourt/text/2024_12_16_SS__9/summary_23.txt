And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition to change the Petitioner's name. However, the new name on the proposed decree must be reviewed by the Petitioner to ensure it is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the new name meets these criteria, the Petitioner does not need to appear at the scheduled hearing. If the new name is not satisfactory, the Petitioner must attend the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A signed copy of the decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing, and once signed, the decree cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
