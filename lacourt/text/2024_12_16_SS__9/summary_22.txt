And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the petitioner is seeking to change their name. The judge has granted the petition, but has also specified certain conditions that must be met before the decree will be signed. Specifically, the petitioner must ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled on the proposed decree. If the name is not legible or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
