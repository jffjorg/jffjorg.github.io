And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the petition has been granted, allowing the Petitioner to change their name. However, the Petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree before the hearing on December 16, 2024. If the name is correctly spelled and legible, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. But if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Additionally, once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
