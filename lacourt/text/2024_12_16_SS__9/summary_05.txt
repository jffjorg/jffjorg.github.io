The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of a petition for a name change. Due to the lack of identification information provided, the judge has ordered the petitioner to submit to a Live Scan to enable a complete California Criminal History to be run. The petitioner is directed to contact the Name Change Clerk in the Clerk's Office to obtain instructions on how to have their fingerprints taken for a California Record Review Live Scan and results sent to the Court Clerk. The petition is continued to February 24, 2025, at 9:30 am to enable the Live Scan to be run. If the petitioner fails to comply with these instructions and provide sufficient information prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice. The Name Change Clerk is ordered to run and complete a criminal history assessment prior to the continued hearing, and the Court Clerk is directed to give notice.
