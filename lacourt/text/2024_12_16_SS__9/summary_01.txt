The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a name change petition. The petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the new name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary at the December 16, 2024 hearing.

Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
