And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the petition and rules that the petitioner must double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
