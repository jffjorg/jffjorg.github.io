And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition and will sign the decree. However, the judge requires the petitioner to double-check the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the new name is correctly spelled and legible, the petitioner does not need to appear at the hearing. If the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
