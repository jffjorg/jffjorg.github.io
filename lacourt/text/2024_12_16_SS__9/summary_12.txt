If the proposed decree is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the upcoming hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. If the proposed decree is correct, no appearance is necessary. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
