 Case Number:  24STCP03250    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  9 The criminal history assessment that
the Court’s Clerk’s Office has run through CLETS reveals that Petitioner has an
active outstanding warrant:  “COLLEYVILLE
WARRANT PC60981 MIS/THEFT OF PROPERTY”  
Petitioner must clear the outstanding
bench warrant and file evidence of such before the Court will rule on the
petition for name change.  The OSC and hearing on the petition for name
change are continued to March 10, 2025 at 9:30 am.  No later than two
weeks before the continued OSC and hearing, Petitioner must file written proof
that the outstanding bench warrant has been fully addressed and resolved. 
Petitioner must also appear at the continued hearing on March 10, 2025 to
answer any questions that the Court may have concerning the outstanding

prejudice.  The Name Change Clerk is to
run a new criminal history assessment prior to the continued OSC to verify that
the bench warrant has been cleared.
The Court Clerk is to give notice to
all parties.
