And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition for name change, but has made some conditions. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure the new name is spelled correctly and legibly. If everything is in order, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written or spelled correctly, the petitioner must attend the hearing to submit a revised proposed decree. The signed decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Additionally, the judge notes that once the decree is signed, it cannot be changed without a new petition.
