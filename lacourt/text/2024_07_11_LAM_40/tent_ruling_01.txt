[TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc.’s Motion for
  Terminating Sanctions, Striking Defendant Addition Building & Design,
  Inc.’s Answer and Entering Default



 
On February
25, 2021, Plaintiff CREDITORS
ADJUSTMENT BUREAU, INC.
(“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants ADDITION BUILDING &
DESIGN, INC. (“Addition
B&D”) MICHAEL
ROSS aka MICHAEL EDWARD ROSS dba GREEN BUILD DESIGN LA (“Green BD”), and DOES 1
through 10 (collectively, “Defendants”). The Complaint asserts the following
causes of action against all Defendants: 
 
1.
Breach of Contract
2. Open
Book Account
3.
Account Stated
4.
Reasonable Value
 
Plaintiff
now brings a Motion for
Terminating Sanctions, which Defendant Addition B&D has not opposed. The
motion includes a proof of service on Defendant’s counsel by mail and email on May
21, 2024. 
 
After
review, the Court GRANTS the Motion because Plaintiff has established Defendant
Addition B&D has engaged in a pervasive and consistent pattern of misuse of
the discovery process.
 
Background Allegations
This
action involves a written agreement between State Compensation Insurance Fraud
(“Plaintiff’s Assignor”) and Defendants, wherein Plaintiff’s Assignor agreed to
provide Defendants with a worker’s compensation insurance policy in exchange
for payment of premiums covering the period of January 11, 2018 through January
11, 2019. (Compl., ¶¶1, 11.) On or about May 26, 2020, Defendants breached the
policy requiring payment of premiums. (Id. at ¶14.) Defendants owes
$296,480.20 with ten percent interest per annum and has failed to pay it
despite a demand for payment made by Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶2, 14.)
 
Motion for Terminating Sanctions
Legal Standard: Code of Civil
Procedure Section 2023.030, states in pertinent part: “To the extent authorized
by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision
of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or
attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose…[monetary, issue,
evidence, or terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in the misuse of
the discovery process….” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (a)-(d); see
also Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.320(c).) “Misuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to…(d) Failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery…(g) Disobeying a court order to
provide discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.) 
 
“Nevertheless,
absent unusual circumstances, such as repeated and egregious discovery abuses,
two facts are generally prerequisite to the imposition of a nonmonetary
sanction. There must be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure
must be willful.” (Lee v. Lee (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1553, 1559.) “Even
where nonmonetary sanctions are called for, they ‘”…’ should be appropriate to
the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’ [Citations] ‘”…[¶]
The sanctions the court may impose are such as are suitable and necessary to
enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he
seeks, but the court may not impose sanctions which are designed not to
accomplish the objects of discovery but to impose punishment.’”’ [Citations.]”
(Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315,
1327.) 
 
“A trial court
has broad discretion when imposing a discovery sanction.” (Lee, supra,
175 Cal.App.4th at 1559.) “In exercising this discretion [for nonmonetary
sanctions], a variety of factors may be relevant, including, 1) the time which
has elapsed since [the discovery requests] were served, 2) whether the party
served was previously given a voluntary extension of time, 3) the number of
[the discovery requests] propounded, 4) whether the unanswered questions sought
information which was difficult to obtain, 5) whether the answers supplied were
evasive and incomplete, 6) the number of questions which remained unanswered,
7) whether the questions which remained unanswered are material to a particular
claim or defense, 8) whether the answering party has acted in good faith, and
with reasonable diligence, 9) the existence of prior orders compelling
discovery and the answering party’s response thereto, 10) whether the party was
unable to comply with the previous order of the court, 11) whether an order
allowing more time to answer would enable the answering party to supply the
necessary information, and 12) whether a sanction short of dismissal or default
would be appropriate to the dereliction.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 796-97.) 
 
Here, Defendant
Addition B&D was ordered to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set Two and Request for Admissions, and pay monetary sanctions
in the amount of $3,578.35 within 30 days of the March  1, 2023 order. (Frischer Decl., ¶¶2-3, Ex. 1.)
The ordered sanctions were amended in a subsequent Nunc Pro Tunc Order on March
7, 2023 as against Defendant Addition B&D and current defense counsel of
record, Gary Schwartz only. (Id. at ¶4, Ex. 2.) Plaintiff contends
although Defendant Addition B&D paid the ordered sanctions, it has still
failed to provide any further proper and meaningful responses in compliance
with the March 1 and 7, 2023 orders. (Id. at ¶5.) Furthermore, Defendant
Addition B&D has not filed an opposition, thus provides no rebuttal
response to this contention.
This Court
previously denied a motion for terminating sanctions, noting in May 2023 that
noncompliance with previous orders did not justify terminating sanctions at the
time, but specifically warning that should such conduct continued, it could
justify an eventual order of termination. Unfortunately, it did continue. On
May 10, 2023, when the Court denied the terminating sanctions, Defendant Addition
B&D was ordered to pay $3,490.62 in monetary sanctions for noncompliance
with the March 1 and 7, 2023 orders. (Frischer Decl., ¶¶6-7, Ex. 3.) Plaintiff
asserts that Defendant Addition B&D and its counsel have failed to pay
these ordered sanctions. (Id. at ¶9.) Moreover, this Court heard and
granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set
Three; Special Interrogatories, Set Three; Demand for Production of Documents,
Set Three; and Request for Admission, Set Three. (Frischer Decl., ¶¶10-20, Exs.
5-9.) This Court also ordered sanctions in an amount totaling $9,681.55 for all
four motions. (Id.)
 
Defendant
Addition B&D has now also failed to provide responses and produce documents
in accordance with the January 23, 2024, January 29, 2024, and February 5, 2024
orders. (Id.) Likewise, Defendant Addition B&D has failed to pay the
ordered sanctions. (Id.) As such, Plaintiff has demonstrated that
Defendant Addition B&D is engaging in a pervasive and consistent pattern of
misuse of the discovery process. Additionally, the issuance of monetary
sanctions has not produced compliance. Last, Defendant Addition B&D has not
shown it is interested in defending against this lawsuit since no opposition
has been filed attesting to any substantial justification or other
circumstances that would make imposing terminating sanctions unjust. 
 
Therefore,
Defendant Addition B&D’s conduct in violating multiple court orders for
discovery and failure to respond to this motion warrants terminating sanctions
and monetary sanctions for the reasonable expense of bringing this motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on
the foregoing, Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc.’s Motion for
Terminating Sanctions is GRANTED. Defendant Addition Building & Design,
Inc.’s Answer to Complaint is stricken and default is entered against it. Sanctions
in the amount of $2,579.15 for the reasonable fees and costs of bringing this
motion is granted. Plaintiff is to file a default judgment package within 30
days of this order.
