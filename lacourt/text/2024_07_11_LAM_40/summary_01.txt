The court has found that Defendant Addition B&D has engaged in a pervasive and consistent pattern of misuse of the discovery process, including failing to comply with multiple court orders and failing to provide meaningful responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests. As a result, the court has struck Defendant Addition B&D's Answer to the complaint and entered default against them. The court has also ordered sanctions in the amount of $2,579.15 to be paid by the plaintiff for the reasonable fees and costs of bringing this motion. The plaintiff is required to file a default judgment package within 30 days of this order.
