The Judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Andre Sengul dba Greenleaf Diamonds, LLC's Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Default and Default Judgment is GRANTED. The motion was filed by Defendant Sengul, who claims that he did not have actual notice of the action in time to defend it. According to the facts, seven written contractual agreements were entered into between Plaintiff SURENDRA BHAVNANI DBA LAXMI IMPEX and Defendant Sengul, but Defendant Sengul failed to make payments on the agreements, resulting in a balance owed of $72,372.00. The Plaintiff made a demand for payment, but Defendant Sengul refused to pay.

The Judge finds that Defendant Sengul has presented sufficient grounds for discretionary relief under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473.5 and orders Defendant Sengul to file his Answer within 20 days of this order.
