And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and for sanctions. The plaintiff, Nekuryan Property Investment, LLC, filed the lawsuit against Assil Noga aka Noga Assil on May 30, 2024, seeking recovery of COVID-19 rental debt. The defendant filed an answer on August 19, 2024. The plaintiff then filed a motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and for sanctions on November 14, 2024. However, at the hearing on December 16, 2024, the defendant represented that she had complied with all discovery demands and had served responses to the form interrogatories on December 15, 2024. The judge found that the defendant's responses to the form interrogatories were served on time and that the plaintiff had not received responses nor objections to discovery. The judge also noted that the code of civil procedure limits the number of interrogatories and prohibits interrogatories with subparts. Therefore, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to form interrogatories and for sanctions.
