And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Edmond Asatryan's motion to vacate the entry of default and default judgment, and has set aside the entry of default and default judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d). The judge found that the proof of service stating that Defendant was personally served with the Summons and Complaint on August 15, 2024, was improper because Defendant was out of the country at that time. The judge also found that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that any specific part of Defendant's declaration was inadmissible. As a result, the default entered on September 16, 2024, and default judgment entered on October 2, 2024, are hereby vacated. An order to show cause regarding service of the summons and complaint is set for March 18, 2025.
