Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered their default on September 16, 2024 and default judgment on October 2, 2024.Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment; and Quash Service of the Summons on November 12, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition with evidentiary objections on December 3, 2024, and Defendant replied on December 9, 2024.DiscussionDefendant moves to vacate the entry of default and default judgment, and to quash service of the Summons and Complaint. (Notice of Motion, pp. 1-2.) The request to vacate is brought on multiple grounds, including Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivisions (b) and (d), and section 473.5. The request to quash service is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10. The Motion is supported by the declaration of Defendant, to which multiple exhibits are attached. Plaintiff’s evidentiary objection to the entire declaration is overruled. The objection fails to demonstrate that any specific part of the declaration is inadmissible.Code of Civil Procedure section 473(d)The Court begins its analysis with Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), as this provides Defendant with the broadest possible relief. Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d) states that “[t]he court may, .... on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) As cited by Defendant, a “default judgment valid on its face but otherwise void because service was improper is governed by this provision.” (Rogers v. Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1121 [overruled on other grounds in California Capital Insurance Company v. Hoehn (2024) 2024 WL 4812045, at *3].)As evidence that the default and judgment are void, Defendant submits their declaration disputing being personally served with the Summons and Complaint. (Motion, Asatryan Decl., p. 9.) The proof of service states that Defendant was personally served with the Summons and Complaint on August 15, 2024 at 13137 Ratner Street, North Hollywood, California. (Proof of Service, filed 08/29/24, ¶¶4-5.) Defendant, however, declares and provides documentary evidence that they were out of the country for the month of August 2024. (Motion, Asatryan Decl., Exhs. B1-6, D1-2.) Defendant’s declaration sufficiently demonstrates that they could not have been personally served with the Summons and Complaint on August 15, 2024, as claimed in the proof of service.Plaintiff’s opposition offers no argument, nor evidence, to the contrary. Instead, Plaintiff makes a number of arguments that have no bearing on the question of whether the entry of default and default judgment are void for lack of proper service. First, Plaintiff argues at length that equitable relief from default may only be granted in exceptional circumstances that are not present in this action. The instant Motion, however, is not brought on grounds of equitable relief, or on the grounds of extrinsic or intrinsic fraud. The opposition also contends that Defendant has not demonstrated a meritorious defense to this action. Yet a showing of a meritorious defense is not required for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d). Third, Plaintiff argues that Defendant has not shown personal knowledge of the contents of Defendant’s declaration but does not point to any particular statement that was made without personal knowledge. The declaration attests to Defendant’s own whereabouts at the time of service; a person’s statement regarding their own location on a given date is necessarily within their personal knowledge.Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant has demonstrated service of the Summons and Complaint on Defendant was improper, rendering the subsequent entry of default and default judgment void. The Court sets aside the entry of default and default judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d).ConclusionDefendant Edmond Asatryan’s Motion to Vacate Entry of Default and Default Judgment; and Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED AS TO THE REQUEST TO VACATE. THE DEFAULT ENTERED ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2024 AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT ENTERED ON OCTOBER 2, 2024, ARE HEREBY VACATED. THE REQUEST TO QUASH SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS IS DEEMED MOOT.AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT IS SET FOR MARCH 18, 2025 AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.Court clerk to give notice
