            v.
 
PACIFIC ENERGY NETWORK
  LLC, et al., 
                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  24STCV07459
  Hearing Date:  June 21, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant business alliance insurance
  company’s motion to set aside default 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 25, 2024, Plaintiff Maria
Brizuela filed this action against Defendants Pacific Energy Network LLC, Cross
River Bank, and Business Alliance Insurance Company. 
On May 14, 2024, the Court entered default
against Defendant Business Alliance Insurance Company.            
On May 23, 2024, Defendant Business
Alliance Insurance Company filed the instant motion to set aside the default.
Plaintiff filed her opposition on June 7, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
473(b).) Because the law favors resolution on the merits, doubts are resolved
in favor of the party requesting relief, and only “slight evidence” is needed
to justify relief. (Caldwell v. Methodist Hospital (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th
1521, 1524.) “[C]ourts have often granted relief pursuant to the discretionary
relief provision of section 473 if no prejudice to the opposing party will
ensue.” (Comunidad en Accion v. Los Angeles City Council (2013) 219
Cal.App.4th 1116, 1132-1133.)
DISCUSSION
            “The ethical obligation to warn
opposing counsel of an intent to take a default is now reinforced by a
statutory policy that all parties ‘cooperate in bringing the action to trial or
other disposition.’ ([CCP] § 583.130.) Quiet speed and unreasonable deadlines
do not qualify as ‘cooperation’ and cannot be accepted by the courts.” (Lasalle
v. Vogel (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 127, 137.)
Plaintiff requested entry of default a
mere eight days after the deadline without attempting to contact Defendant
about its response to the complaint. (See Valdez Decl. ¶ 7.) Defendant
contacted Plaintiff two days after discovering the default and eight days after
the default had been entered. (Mo Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) This motion was filed nine
days after the default was entered. Because Defendant acted promptly, and
Plaintiff has shown no prejudice, relief is warranted under the policy in favor
of resolution on the merits.     
CONCLUSION
            Defendant Business Alliance
Insurance Company’s motion to set aside default is GRANTED.
