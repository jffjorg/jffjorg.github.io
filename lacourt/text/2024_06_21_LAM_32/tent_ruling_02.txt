  Case No.:  23STCV14200

     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motions to compel responses 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 20, 2023, Plaintiff Afifa
Soliman filed this action against Defendants Santa Maria Pharmacy, Inc. and
Marcos Soliman, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2)
elder abuse, (3) failure to pay minimum wages, (4) violation of Labor Code
section 226, (5) violation of Labor Code section 1198.5, (6) unfair business
practices, and (7) fraud. 
            On May 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant eight motions to compel discovery responses from both Defendants.
Defendants have not opposed the motions. 
LEGAL STANDARD
 Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff propounded the subject
discovery on February 21, 2024. (Galliver Decl. ¶ 2.) Pursuant to Defendants’
request, Plaintiff granted an extension to April 5, 2024. (Id., ¶ 8.)
Defendants failed to respond by April 5, 2024, but Plaintiff granted a further
extension to April 26, 2024. (Id., ¶¶ 9-11.) Defendants did not respond
by April 26, 2024. (Id., ¶ 13.) 
            In her reply, Plaintiff acknowledges
that she received Defendants’ belated responses after the motions were filed.
Accordingly, Plaintiff concedes that the motions are moot to the extent they
seek to compel Defendants’ responses to the subject discovery. However,
Plaintiff maintains the motions for purposes of sanctions. 
The Court agrees that sanctions are
warranted because Defendants provide no substantial justification for their
failure to timely respond to discovery. Plaintiff’s counsel claims to have
spent 3.5 hours drafting the eight motions. (Galliver Decl. ¶ 14(a).) The Court
finds this reasonable. No additional hours are necessary, given the lack of
opposition. Plaintiff’s counsel claims an hourly rate of $500. (Id., ¶
14(d).) The Court reduces this to $400 per hour given the simplicity of the
motions and lack of opposition. Plaintiff additionally incurred a $60 filing
fee for each motion, totaling $480. Therefore, sanctions are awarded in the
total amount of $1,880.
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motions to compel
responses are GRANTED. The Court sanctions Defendants and their counsel in the
total amount of $1,880, to be paid within 30 days of this order.
