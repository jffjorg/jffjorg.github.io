And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Paula Purcell, in her motion to compel further responses from the defendant, Equity Residential Management LLC. The plaintiff had sought to compel the defendant to provide further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production. The defendant had opposed the motion, arguing that the requests were unduly burdensome and overbroad. The judge found that the defendant's responses to the requests for production were defective and failed to provide proper statements of compliance or noncompliance. The judge also found that the defendant's responses to special interrogatories were incomplete and failed to provide sufficient detail. The judge granted the plaintiff's motion in part, ordering the defendant to provide supplemental responses within 20 days. The judge denied sanctions, finding that the parties had acted with substantial justification.
