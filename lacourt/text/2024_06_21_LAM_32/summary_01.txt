And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary judgment motion brought by the Defendant, County of Los Angeles, seeking to dismiss the Plaintiff, Jaro Custodio's, medical malpractice claim. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to obtain informed consent for the appendectomy and left arm surgery, and negligently treated his left arm IV.

The Judge finds that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the Defendant obtained informed consent for the surgeries and whether the Defendant acted within the standard of care in treating the Plaintiff's IV. The Judge also finds that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the septic thrombophlebitis in the Plaintiff's left arm was caused by the Defendant's negligent treatment of the IV rather than a complication from the appendectomy.

The Judge concludes that the Defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.
