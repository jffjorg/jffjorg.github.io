And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

"The court has tentatively ruled that the defendant, Business Alliance Insurance Company, may set aside the default judgment entered against it. The defendant failed to respond to the complaint, but contacted the plaintiff after the default was entered and filed a motion to set aside the default shortly after. The court has determined that the defendant acted promptly and that the plaintiff has shown no prejudice, so relief from the default judgment is warranted. The court is granting the defendant's motion to set aside the default."
