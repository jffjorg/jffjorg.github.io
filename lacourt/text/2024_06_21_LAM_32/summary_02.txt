The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Afifa Soliman vs. Santa Maria Pharmacy, Inc. and Marcos Soliman. The Plaintiff, Afifa Soliman, filed the action on June 20, 2023, alleging various causes of action against the Defendants. On May 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed eight motions to compel Defendants' responses to discovery requests. The Court granted the motions and sanctioned the Defendants and their counsel in the amount of $1,880. The sanction is due to the Defendants' failure to respond to discovery requests in a timely manner. The Court found that the Plaintiff's counsel spent 3.5 hours drafting the motions and reduced the hourly rate from $500 to $400 per hour due to the simplicity of the motions and lack of opposition. The Court ordered the Defendants to pay the sanction within 30 days of the order.
