Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Plaintiff
Kaitlyn Alcala, a Minor
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Petitioner Tawney Alonso’s Petition for Approval of
Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for
Plaintiff Kaitlyn Alcala, a Minor is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a personal injury action arising from a motor vehicle collision. In June
2021, Plaintiffs Taide Alarcon Alonso and Kaitlyn Alcala were involved in a
motor vehicle collision with Defendant Linda Rodriguez at the intersection of
Garey Avenue and East Mission Boulevard in Pomona.
On June
5, 2023, Alcala, through guardian ad litem Tawny Alonso, and Alarcon Alonso filed
a complaint against Rodriguez and Does 1-25, alleging a single cause of action
for motor vehicle negligence.
On October
17, 2023, Alarcon Alonso and Alcala filed a notice of conditional settlement. On
June 26, 2024, Alonso filed the present petition on Alcala’s behalf. A hearing
on the present petition is set for August 15, 2024, along with an OSC Re:
Dismissal.
ANALYSIS
Alonso
petitions for the court’s approval of a $19,999.99 settlement reached between Alcala
and Rodriguez. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS Alonso’s petition.
Legal Standard
An
enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s claim can only be
consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for approval must be presented
to the court and until it is granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton
v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any
settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Id.,
at p. 1606.)
Probate
Code section 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement proceeds are to be paid.
Pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, the order shall approve payment of
reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows:
The
court making the order or giving the judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a
part thereof, shall make a further order authorizing and directing that such
reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a
parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court
shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property
to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or incompetent person.
(Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).)
In
cases pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, “unless the court has approved the
fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when
approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or
property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a
disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he
court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made
between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances
existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the
attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955,
subd. (a)(2).)
Discussion
Pursuant
to the settlement agreement reached between the parties, Rodriguez agrees to
pay a total of $19,999.99 to Alcala. (Petition, ¶ 10.)
With regards to attorney
fees, a retainer agreement is attached to the Petition as Attachment 17a. In
it, the attorney fees for Alcala will be 40% of the gross recovery if the
matter is resolved following the filing of a lawsuit. (Attach. 17a, ¶ 6.) Here,
Alcala’s counsel requests $6,666.66 in attorney fees which is only 33.33% of Alcala’s
total recovery. (Petition, ¶ 13.) In a second supplemental declaration, Alcala’s
counsel estimates counsel spent an estimated thirty (30) hours on the present
case. (Gdolian 2nd Supp. Decl., ¶ 11.) While the supplemental declaration fails
to discuss counsel’s experience and qualifications, the court finds the
requested attorney fees result in an average hourly rate of $222.22. Based on
the court’s own experience, the court finds this to be a reasonable rate and
determines the requested attorney fees are reasonable.
The Petition also requests $622.30
in litigation costs and $2,996.47 in medical expenses. Thus, Alcala will
receive a total net amount of $9,714.56. The Petition requests the funds be deposited
in an insured account with Bank of America subject to withdrawal only upon
authorization by the court.
Upon review the court finds
the amount awarded to Alcala to be reasonable and finds the disposition of the
funds is proper. Accordingly, Alonso’s petition is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Based upon the foregoing, the
court GRANTS Alonso’s petition.
