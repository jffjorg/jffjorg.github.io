The court finds that the attorney fees requested by Alcala's counsel are also reasonable, at an average hourly rate of $222.22. The court has approved the fee agreement in advance and has determined that the requested attorney fees are reasonable. The court has also approved the disposition of the funds, which will be deposited in an insured account with Bank of America subject to withdrawal only upon authorization by the court. Therefore, the court grants the petition and approves the settlement agreement.
