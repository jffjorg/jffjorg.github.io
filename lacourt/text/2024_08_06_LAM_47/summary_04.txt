The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law case filed by Meena Fatemah Sher against Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. The plaintiff is seeking to compel responses to four sets of discovery requests, including form and special interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission. The judge grants the motions to compel responses to the form and special interrogatories, and requests for production, but denies the motion to compel responses to the requests for admission. The judge orders the defendant to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections within 30 days of the order. The ruling is conditioned on the plaintiff paying $180 in filing fees within 10 days of the order.
