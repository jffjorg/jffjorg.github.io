And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for a permanent injunction. The plaintiff, Ozelia Harris, had sought to expunge a written warning from her personnel file, alleging that the warning was retaliatory and harassing due to her use of medical leave and perceived disability. However, the judge found that the jury trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the defendants, and that the plaintiff did not demonstrate an adverse employment action or harassment. The judge also criticized the plaintiff's motion for being overly lengthy and lacking in merit, and noted that the plaintiff did not demonstrate an error in the jury's verdict. As a result, the judge denied the motion for a permanent injunction.
