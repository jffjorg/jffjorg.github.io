```

The judge's tentative ruling is that both Defendant Shilpa Shah and Defendant Lara Nelson are not entitled to summary judgment. The ruling is based on the facts that a triable issue of fact exists as to whether both defendants breached the standard of care and whether their conduct caused the death of Maia Hansen. The judge also rejected the defendants' arguments that the statute of limitations barred the plaintiffs' claims.
