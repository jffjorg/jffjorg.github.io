Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of the summons and complaint filed by Specially Appearing Defendant Spectrum Quartz LLC, arguing that the court lacks both general and specific personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant claims it has no contacts with California whatsoever, and the plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish jurisdiction. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have not carried their burden to demonstrate general jurisdiction, and that the exercise of jurisdiction is not reasonable in this case. The judge also denies the plaintiffs' request for jurisdictional discovery, citing the lack of any explanation for why such discovery would lead to the production of evidence establishing jurisdiction.
