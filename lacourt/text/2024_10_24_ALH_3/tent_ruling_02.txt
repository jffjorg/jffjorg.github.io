I.      INTRODUCTION
         On July 5,
2024, plaintiff Anahid Minaskanian (“Plaintiff”), individually and as
successor-in-interest of Lida Zohrabians (“Zohrabians”), filed this action
against defendants Central Convalescent Hospital of Glendale Inc. dba Chandler
Convalescent Hospital (“Facility”) (erroneously sued separately as “Central
Convalescent Hospital of Glendale Inc. dba Chandler Convalescent
Hospital-Glendale” and “Chestnut Ridge Post Acute LLC dba Chandler Convalescent
Hospital-Glendale”) and Renew Health Consulting Services (“Management”). Plaintiff
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on May 8, 2024. 
          On
June 7, 2024, Facility and Management (collectively, “Defendants”) filed a
demurrer and a motion to strike. It appears that Defendants inadvertently
failed to file a copy of the motion to strike with the Court, even though they
served Plaintiff with their papers because Plaintiff filed an opposition brief
and Defendant filed a reply brief. In the interest of judicial economy, the
Court continues the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike to November 5,
2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse. 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 24th
day of October
2024
