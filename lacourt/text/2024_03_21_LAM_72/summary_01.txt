```

Summary:
The Judge denies summary judgment and summary adjudication on all claims brought by Zurich American Insurance Company and ACE Property & Casualty Insurance Company against Mitsubishi Electric US, Inc. The Judge finds that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether RIM was an agent of the Owners for the purposes of the Elevator Agreement and therefore an eligible indemnitee. The Judge also rejects Defendant's arguments that RIM was not entitled to indemnification as a matter of law, citing judicial estoppel and the Court's previous rejection of Defendant's argument in overruling Defendant's demurrer.
