And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge grants Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending the outcome of arbitration. The parties executed two arbitration agreements during the Plaintiff's employment: one in 2009 and one in 2015. The 2015 Agreement provides that all claims relating to the Plaintiff's employment with Defendant must be submitted to binding arbitration with JAMS. The Judge finds that the 2015 Agreement is not substantively unconscionable, as it does not require the Plaintiff to pay costs in excess of what he would have to pay in court. The Judge also finds that the agreement is not procedurally unconscionable. Therefore, the Judge grants Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending the outcome of arbitration. A status conference on arbitration is set for December 11, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
