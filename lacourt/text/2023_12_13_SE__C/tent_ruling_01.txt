  Case Number:  18NWCV00181    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  C Rick Oliver Trevino, et al. vs Stacy Helen Trevino, et
al., 18NWCV00181
Michael R. Perry, Esq. Larry
M. Roberts, Esq. Matthew J. Bertolucci, Esq. Attorneys for
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Rick Oliver Trevino apply ex parte to be relieved as
counsel.  Attorneys for Plaintiff allege they will be irreparably harmed
if the motion is not advanced from the currently scheduled hearing date of
January 10, 2024, because that date is beyond the 5-year deadline to bring the
matter to trial.  This action was filed on December 21, 2018. Trial is not
set, but an order to show cause re dismissal pursuant to settlement is
scheduled for December 14, 2023, one day after the instant ex parte
application.  Attorneys for Plaintiff represent that they filed the motion
in August of 2023, received the hearing date in January, but did not file the instant
ex parte application until December 12, 2023.  The Court finds Attorneys
for Plaintiff have not acted with due diligence in seeking ex parte relief and
have not otherwise demonstrated irreparable harm.  Accordingly, Attorneys
for Plaintiff Michael R. Perry, Larry M. Robert’s, and Matthew J. Bertolucci’s
ex parte application is DENIED.
