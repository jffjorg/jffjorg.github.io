And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the ex parte application of Plaintiff's attorneys to be relieved as counsel. The attorneys alleged that they would be irreparably harmed if the motion was not advanced from the currently scheduled hearing date of January 10, 2024, as that date is beyond the 5-year deadline to bring the matter to trial. However, the court found that the attorneys had not acted with due diligence in seeking ex parte relief and had not demonstrated irreparable harm. The court noted that the attorneys filed the motion in August 2023, received the hearing date in January, but did not file the instant ex parte application until December 12, 2023.
