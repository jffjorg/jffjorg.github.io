And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiffs' Application for Good Faith Settlement in the amount of $12,232.69. The settlement is between the Plaintiffs, Dominic Garcia and Manual Martinez, and Defendant Sadlerstone, LLC dba Concrete Collaborative. The judge determined that the settlement is in good faith because it is for the amount Sadlerstone's proportional liability, as alleged in the First Amended Complaint. The judge also noted that Natural Stone, one of the defendants, has not opposed the Application on the grounds that the amount is not in good faith. The judge's ruling is based on the legal standard set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6, which requires consideration of several factors, including total recovery, proportionate liability, and the amount paid in settlement. The judge also cited several California court cases, including Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates, Far West Financial Corp. v. D&S Co., Long Beach Memorial Medical Center v. Superior Court, and Torres v. Union Pacific R. Co.
