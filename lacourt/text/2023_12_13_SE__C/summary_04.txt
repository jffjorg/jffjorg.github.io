And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding an ex parte application by Attorneys for Defendant Rick O Trevino to be relieved as counsel. The Attorneys argue that they would be irreparably harmed if not granted relief, as they would continue to prepare for trial while their client is no longer paying their fees. However, the Judge determines that the Attorneys have not demonstrated good cause for ex parte relief, as the trial is not scheduled until April 17, 2024, and the current hearing date for the motion to be relieved as counsel is January 10, 2024, less than a month away. The Judge denies the ex parte relief and orders the Moving Party to give notice.
