CASE NO.:  22NWCV01090
HEARING:   12/13/23 @ 9:30 AM

Defendant Yong Wang’s Motion to Quash Service
of Summons is DENIED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant Yong Wang (Defendant) moves to quash
service of summons on the grounds that he was improperly served.
Background
This
is a Breach of Contract action filed by Plaintiff Eureka LLC against Defendants
Zhongtian International Trade Company, Ye Zhang, and Yong Wang for $66,676.62.
Legal
Standard
“A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a
notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: (1) To quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him
or her.” (CCP § 418.10(a).)
“No
default may be entered against the defendant before expiration of his or her
time to plead, and no motion under this section, or under Section 473 or 473.5
when joined with a motion under this section, or application to the court or
stipulation of the parties for an extension of the time to plead, shall be
deemed a general appearance by the defendant.” (CCP § 418.10(d).)
Discussion

Here, Defendant argues that he was not properly
served with the Summons and Complaint so as to have proper notice of this
lawsuit. This Court previously set aside default entered against Defendant
because he declared that he did not receive actual notice of the complaint.  Defendant asserted he was served by
substitute service at 15 Cabrito, San Clemente, CA, but has lived at 19 Calle
Saltamontes, San Clemente, CA since 2019. 
 
However, the Court may obtain personal
jurisdiction over a party by that party making a general appearance in the
action. (Mansour v. Superior Court (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1750,
1756-1757.) “A general appearance occurs where a party, either directly or
through counsel, participates in an action in some manner which recognizes the
authority of the court to proceed.” (Mansour v. Superior Court (1995) 38
Cal.App.4th 1750, 1756.) Here, like in Mansour, Defendant has made a
general appearance by submitting a case management conference statement and
participating in the conference. Defendant’s other appearances were made
through a special appearance so that he could challenge jurisdiction and be
served formally with the Summons and Complaint. However, the Court sees no
evidence that Defendant limited his participation in the case management
conferences to a special appearance. Further, Defendant filed a statement prior
to the February 14, 2023 conference. Thus, this Court has obtained personal
jurisdiction through a general appearance by Defendant. Therefore, Defendant’s
Motion to Quash is denied. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
Motion to Quash Service of Summons is DENIED. Defendant is to file his answer
within 20 days of this Order.
