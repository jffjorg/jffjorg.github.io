Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the escrow defendants (Antonio Aguilar, United Escrow Services, and Executive Realty Services, Inc.). The court has granted the motion in part, dismissing the plaintiff's (Dinorah Talavera) Sixth Cause of Action for Negligent Misrepresentation, and denied the motion in part, allowing the plaintiff's Sixteenth and Nineteenth Causes of Action for Tort of Another and Breach of Fiduciary Duty to proceed.

The court's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to plead with specificity the facts that allegedly support the negligent misrepresentation claim. The court held that each element of a cause of action for fraud or negligent misrepresentation must be factually and specifically alleged, and that the plaintiff has not done so in this case.

On the other hand, the court allowed the plaintiff's claims for Tort of Another and Breach of Fiduciary Duty to proceed, finding that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support these claims.

The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend its complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the ruling.
