And here is a summary in English text:

Judge's Tentative Ruling: Defendant Yong Wang's Motion to Quash Service of Summons is denied. The Court has obtained personal jurisdiction over the defendant through a general appearance, despite the defendant's claims that he was improperly served. The defendant has made a general appearance in the action by submitting a case management conference statement and participating in the conference. The Court sees no evidence that the defendant limited his participation in the case management conferences to a special appearance. Therefore, the motion is denied, and the defendant is required to file an answer within 20 days of this order.
