 Case Number:  22NWCV01161    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2023    Dept:  C Nicole Zaun vs Rick O Trevino, et al., 22NWCV01161
Michael R. Perry, Esq. Larry
M. Roberts, Esq. Matthew J. Bertolucci, Esq., Attorneys for Defendant Rick
Oliver Trevino, apply ex parte to be relieved as counsel.  Attorneys for
Defendant argue they would be irreparably harmed if not granted relief ex
parte, as they would continue having to prepare for trial when their client is
no longer paying the attorney fees.  (See Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c);
(Bertolucci Dec., ¶¶ 7, 11.)  However, trial is not scheduled until April
17, 2024 and the currently scheduled hearing date for the motion to be relieved
as counsel is January 10, 2024, less than a month from today.  The court
determines that Attorneys for Defendant have not demonstrated good cause for ex
parte relief.  Attorneys for Defendant also apply ex parte to be relieved
as counsel in Rick Oliver Trevino, et al. vs Stacy Helen Trevino, et al.,
18NWCV00181, heard concurrently with the instant motion.  The Court denies
ex parte relief in that matter as well. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
