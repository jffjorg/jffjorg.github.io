Standard
The
trial court’s determination of good faith under CCP § 877.6 must take into account “a number of factors,”
including total recovery and proportionate liability, “the amount paid in
settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a
recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he
were found liable after a trial.” ¿(Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde &
Associates¿(1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499; see also Far West Financial Corp.
v. D&S Co.¿(1988) 46 Cal.3d 796, 816, fn. 16 [expanding on Tech-Bilt
factors].)¿ “If section 877.6 is to serve the ends of justice, it must
prevent a party from purchasing protection from its indemnification obligation
at bargain-basement prices.”  (Long Beach Memorial Medical Center v.
Superior Court¿(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th¿865, 876.)¿ 
“[A]
defendant’s settlement figure must not be grossly disproportionate to what a
reasonable person, at the time of the settlement, would estimate the settling
defendant’s liability to be.”  (Torres v. Union Pacific R. Co.¿(1984)
157 Cal.App.3d 499, 509.)¿¿If the settlement is not so far “out of the
ballpark” in relation to the above factors as to be inconsistent with the
equitable objectives of CCP § 877.6, the settlement shall be determined as
being made in good faith.  (Tech-Bilt,¿supra, 38 Cal.3d at pp. 499-500.) 
Discussion

The first issue is whether Defendant Concrete
Collaborative is a suspended entity and, thus, cannot benefit from a
determination of good faith settlement under CCP § 877.6. Natural Stone argues
that its search of Concrete Collaborative revealed that Concrete Collaborative,
LLC was suspended. However, as reflected in the Settlement Agreement,
the true name of Concrete Collaborative is Sadlerstone, LLC dba Concrete
Collaborative (Salderstone). (Boyes Decl., Ex. A.) Thus, this Court does not
have evidence that Defendant Concrete Collaborative is a suspended entity and
cannot benefit from a determination of good faith settlement.
Plaintiffs and Salderstone (Settling Parties)
seek to settle for $12,232.69. The Court determines that this is a good faith
settlement because the First Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs were
charged $12,232.69 for their order from Sadlerstone. Thus, the Settlement
Agreement is for the amount Sadlerstone’s proportional liability. Further,
Natural Stone has not opposed the Application on the grounds that the amount is
not in good faith.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’
Application for Good Faith Settlement is GRANTED.
