Plaintiff Smithway Associates, Inc. seeks to enforce its settlement with Defendants Greenberg Cheese Company, Inc. and Michael Greenberg.  Plaintiff seeks judgment in the amount of “$275,000, plus prejudgment interest on this remaining balance at ten percent (10%) per annum pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 685.010 and 685.020, in the current amount of $26,595.02 ($75.34 per day for 353 days from January 1, 2024 to the hearing date) [ ], plus an award of attorney's fees and costs to enforce the Stipulation for Settlement in the amount of $ 10,530.50.”The Court is authorized to enter judgment pursuant to a stipulated settlement.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6.)  In reviewing a motion to enforce a settlement, the Court determines “whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.”  (Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182.)  “A settlement is enforceable under section 664.6 only if the parties agreed to all material settlement terms.  [Citations.]  The court ruling on the motion may consider the parties’ declarations and other evidence in deciding what terms the parties agreed to, and the court’s factual findings in this regard are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.  [Citations.]  If the court determines that the parties entered into an enforceable settlement, it should grant the motion and enter a formal judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (Id. at pp. 1182-1183; see also Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1357 [“Strong public policy in favor of the settlement of civil cases gives the trial court, which approves the settlement, the power to enforce it”].)There is no opposition.  Because a valid settlement agreement exists and the Court retains jurisdiction, the Motion to Enforce Settlement is granted.  (CCP § 664.6.)   Moving party to give notice.
