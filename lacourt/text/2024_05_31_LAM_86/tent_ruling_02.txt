[1]           Sarcoma is a broad term for cancers
that start in soft tissues and can develop anywhere in the body but are found
mostly in the arms, legs, chest and abdomen. (AR 59.)
 


[2]           Myelodysplasia is a blanket phrase
that means abnormal bone marrow. (AR 103.) 


[3]           Myriad Genetics Laboratories tested
for the following genes: “APC, ATM, BARD1, BMPR1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1,
CDK4, CDKN2A (p14ARF and p16INK4a), CHEK2, EPCAM (large rearrangement only),
MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, SMAD4, STK11,
TP53.” (AR 258.)
 


[4]           The records included: Essential
Functions of Police Officer; petitioner’s application; and Rousseve’s death
certificate, employment records, and personal medical records. (AR 119, 123.)


[5]           Dr. Caren’s opinion arising from
Rousseve’s workers compensation case is not probative because the presumption
of industrial injury under Labor Code § 3212 presumption is not incorporated
into the Los Angeles Administrative Code. A different standard applies in
determining whether Rousseve’s death was service-connected.
