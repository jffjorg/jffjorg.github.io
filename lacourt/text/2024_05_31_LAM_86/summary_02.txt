And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the case of Rousseve v. Myriad Genetics Laboratories, where Rousseve died and his estate is seeking to determine whether his death was service-connected. The court has reviewed the evidence, including Rousseve's workers compensation case and the results of genetic testing by Myriad Genetics Laboratories. The court has also considered the opinion of Dr. Caren, which is deemed not probative due to the lack of incorporation of Labor Code ยง 3212 into the Los Angeles Administrative Code. The court is currently considering the dispute over whether Rousseve's death was service-connected and will make a final ruling after further review.
