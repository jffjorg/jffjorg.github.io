[TENTATIVE] RULING ON PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT
  OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Leticia Rousseve, surviving spouse of James Rousseve, petitions for a writ of
mandate directing respondent Los Angeles City Fire and Police Pension System to
set aside its decision denying her request for service-connected survivor
benefits.  
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Employment
with Los Angeles Police Department
 
Officer
James Rousseve joined the Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”) on December
12, 2005, and served for over twelve years, during which time he was exposed to
vehicle exhaust, illegal drug-related substances, and gunpowder residue. (AR 15-19,
53.) Rousseve’s partner, Officer Brent Hirunpugdi, testified that they were
heavily exposed to vehicle exhaust during their assignment patrolling the Southwest
Division and while working in the Office of the Operations Crime Reduction Enforcement
of Warrants Task Force, located in an underground parking lot. (AR 13 [HT 12:8-19],
15 [HT 14:16-22], 19 [HT 18:2-11, 18:16-23], 21 [HT 20:7-18]; see also AR
475 [noting that Rousseve was stationed at former plant reputed to have toxic
residue].) He testified that they were exposed to narcotics residue because the
pair were involved in several narcotics arrests and were not provided with
specialized equipment. (AR 17 [HT 16:2-7] [Hirunpugdi provided latex gloves for
PCP], 24 [HT 23:19-23] [Rousseve got liquid PCP on his gloves].) Finally, he
testified that they were exposed to “gunpowder residue and lead” when they
handled their weapons. (AR 18 [HT 17:3-21].) 
 
In
late 2014, Rousseve went on disability leave. (AR 97.) He was cleared to return
to work on June 13, 2017, in a light duty capacity with special accommodations.
(AR 128.)
 
B.          
Cancer
Diagnosis, Treatment, and Death
 
Rousseve’s
symptoms began with right groin pain, fever, and nausea in December 2013, which
were associated with a hernia. (AR 124.) The hernia was repaired on February 4,
2014, at which time possible intestinal adhesions were observed. (AR 184.) A CT
scan on August 23, 2014 confirmed there was a tumor measuring 10 cm in the
right abdomen. (AR 253.) A biopsy on November 5, 2014 revealed that it was a
high-grade malignant tumor, later diagnosed as desmoplastic small round cell
tumors (“DSRCT”). (AR 58, 120, 253, 647.) DSRCT is a rare sarcoma,[1]
characterized by small, round cancer cells that are surrounded by a scar. (AR 58,
129.) 
 
To
treat the DSRCT, Rousseve underwent a pre-surgery course of chemotherapy that required
fourteen cycles of treatment (AR 409), two surgeries (AR 120-21, 561, 647-48), post-surgery
courses of heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy that “bathed” his entire abdomen
(AR 120-21, 565, 459-60), an immunotherapy treatment (AR 121), and palliative radiation
treatment. (AR 128.) Rousseve succumbed to his cancer and passed away on November
9, 2019. (AR 88.) His death certificate listed both “desmoplastic small round
cell tumors” and “myelodysplasia”[2]
as the cause. (AR 88.)
 
C.          
Family
History of Cancer
 
Rousseve’s
medical records indicated a significant family history of cancer. On February 2,
2015, Duveen Sturgeon M.S.N. saw Rousseve for a genetic consultation. Sturgeon
noted the following with respect to Rousseve’s family history: his brother was
diagnosed with lymphoma at 26; his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at
70; his father was diagnosed with prostate cancer at 60; his maternal grandmother
was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 46 and pancreatic cancer at 77; his
maternal great uncle was diagnosed with colon cancer at 40; another maternal
great uncle was diagnosed with colon cancer at 70; another maternal great uncle
was diagnosed with bladder cancer in his 80s; his maternal great aunt was
diagnosed with breast cancer in her 60s; his maternal grandfather was diagnosed
with brain cancer at 51; his paternal grandmother was diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer at 82; his paternal grandmother was diagnosed with leukemia at 50; and
his paternal uncle was diagnosed with leukemia in his 30s. (AR 0259-60.) The
high incidence of cancer in his family was “suggestive of an inherited
susceptibility to cancer.” (AR 260.)
 
D.          
Genetic
Testing
 
Given
this family history, Sturgeon provided genetic counseling and coordinated a 25 gene
panel test to determine if there was a deleterious mutation in the 25 genes
associated with hereditary cancer.[3]
(AR 260.) The panel results did not show a mutation in the 25 genes linked to
hereditary cancer, but such results were limited by “current knowledge and
technology.” (AR 91, 258.) The results noted that “[o]ther genes not analyzed
with this test may also be associated with cancer.” (AR 92.) According to
Sturgeon, the results did “not explain his diagnosis of sarcoma[,] however
several important hereditary syndromes [were] excluded.” (AR 258.)
 
Rousseve
also engaged in cytogenetic testing to determine if he had abnormality in his EWSR1
gene, which is associated with Ewings sarcoma. (AR 28 [HT 27:15-25], 126.) 
 
E.          
Petitioner’s
Application for a Surviving Spouse Pension
 
On
December 3, 2019, petitioner filed an application for survivor pension
benefits.
(AR 53.) On December 19, 2019, respondent Los Angeles City Fire and Police
Pension (“LAFPP”) awarded petitioner a nonservice-connected pension benefit,
which provides lower benefits than a service-connected pension. (AR 53; see LAAC
§ 4.2008(a)(2).) In response, petitioner applied for a service-connected
pension. (AR 84-85.) The Board conducted a hearing on her application on January
19, 2023. (AR 2-48.)
 
F.          
Posthumous
Review of Rousseve’s Medical Record
 
Pursuant
to LAAC § 4.2008(h), two doctors qualified in oncology—Drs. Michael Van Scoy-Mosher,
M.D., and Susan E. Lawrence, M.D.—reviewed Rousseve’s records[4]
and provided written reports. (AR 119-31.) Petitioner obtained a third medical
review from Dr. Charles Wiseman M.D., F.A.C.P., who also testified at the
hearing about the report he had prepared following his medical review. (AR
25-38, 102-17.)
 
1.           
Medical
Report by Dr. Michael Van Scoy-Mosher, M.D.
 
On
March 1, 2022, Dr. Michael Van Scoy-Mosher, M.D., performed an Independent Records
Review to determine if Rousseve’s death from DSRCT and myelodysplasia was
related to performance of his LAPD duties. (AR 119.) Dr. Van Scoy-Mosher is
board-certified in oncology and hematology. (AR 119.) He discussed how Rousseve
was “exposed presumably to the ordinary exposures such a person in his
profession would be exposed to” while working as a police officer from December
12, 2005, to November 9, 2019. (AR 120.) Importantly, he noted there was no
claim of any “special occupational exposures.” (AR 120.) Dr. Van Scoy-Mosher
opined that the “etiology of soft tissue sarcomas such as [DSRCT] is entirely
unknown.” (AR 121.) He noted that there is no medical research to support a
finding that Rousseve’s sarcoma was related to the occupational hazards he encountered
as a police officer and concluded that “his death was totally unrelated to his occupational
exposure and experience as a police officer III.” (AR 121.)
 
2.           
Medical
Report by Dr. Susan Lawrence, M.D.
 
On
March 10, 2022, Dr. Susan Lawrence, M.D., performed an Independent Records Review
to determine if Rousseve’s death from DSRCT and myelodysplasia was related to performance
of his LAPD duties. (AR 123.) Dr. Lawrence is a board-certified oncologist. (AR
123.) Noting Rousseve’s form of cancer was extremely rare, she stated that
“[n]o studies have demonstrated a connection between [the] police force and
soft tissue sarcomas.” (AR 129-30.) She further noted that “some environmental
factors have been associated” with soft tissue sarcoma. 
(AR
0129.) These factors include:
 
[E]xternal
radiation therapy, chemotherapy, Thorotrast, arsenical pesticide and medications,
Phenoxy herbicides, vinyl chloride, immunosuppressive drugs, alkylating agents,
androgen-anabolic steroids, human immunodeficiency virus, human herpesvirus
type 8 (in Kaposi’s sarcoma) and [Epstein Bar Virus]….
 
(AR
129.) Based on Rousseve’s employment records and occupational exposure history,
Dr. Lawrence determined that he “did not have a documented history of exposure
to any of these environmental factors.” (AR 129.) She also addressed the
possibility that edema and irritation near Rousseve’s abdomen where his
equipment belt was usually worn was a causal factor for DSRCT. (AR 130; see
AR 266 [Rousseve noted that he developed tumor in abdomen where equipment belt
rested].) She noted a reported association between chronic irritation and soft
tissue sarcomas but dismissed this reported association as insufficient to
support causation because “more studies are necessary to determine [its]
validity.” (AR 130.) Dr. Lawrence concluded that “Rousseve’s employment in LAPD
was not a predominant cause of his diagnosis of [DSRCT] and subsequent death.” (AR
130.)
 
3.           
Rebuttal
Report by Dr. Charles Wiseman, M.D., F.A.C.P.
 
Dr.
Charles Wiseman M.D., F.A.C.P., a licensed physician in the State of
California, who is board-certified in internal medicine and oncology, was
called by petitioner to serve as a rebuttal witness. (AR 102.) He has practiced
medicine for 45 years and conducted research in tumor immunology. (AR 102.)
Following his review of Rousseve’s medical records, medical reports from Drs.
Van Scoy-Mosher, Lawrence, and Jeffrey Caren, Dr. Wiseman prepared a report for
petitioner on September 23, 2022. (AR 101-17.) He dismissed Rousseve’s
significant family history of cancer as a factor in his illness, relying on the
genetic testing to validate this point but qualified that “it was not a total
genomic survey.” (AR 103.)
 
Dr.
Wiseman noted that Rousseve had a “sarcoma,” caused by desmoplastic small round
cell cancer,” a rare cancer for which there are few “epidemiological studies.” (AR
103.) Further, he noted that “there are no chemicals which directly establish a
link to development of sarcoma.” (AR 103.) Dr. Wiseman opined “[t]here is no
evidence in Officer Rousseve’s personal history of any obvious significant
exposures that would be a cause of his cancer,” (AR 104) but he was “exposed to
various carcinogenic agents, including but not limited to hydrocarbons, diesel fumes,
gasoline fumes, benzene, lead and variety of unknown illegal drug related
substances from attendance at meth lab fires.” (AR 102-03.) Dr. Wiseman pointed
to identified genetic mutations in Rousseve’s cancer suppressor gene, TP53, and
theorized that exposure to these various agents could have led this deleterious
genetic mutation, though “medical science has not developed tools to directly
identify what caused any of the aberrations identified for Officer Rousseve.”
(AR 104.) Dr. Wiseman’s report concluded that exposure to these various agents “could
therefore be the plausible predominant cause of Officer Rousseve’s cancer.” (AR
104.) In his testimony on January 19, 2023, Dr. Wiseman provided a notably more
definitive opinion, stating, “[b]ased on my training, experience, research, I
believe the predominant cause of Officer Rousseve’s cancer was mutagenesis from
environmental agents.” (AR 33 [HT 32:5-8.)
 
Regarding
Rousseve’s second cause of death, “myelodysplasia,” or abnormal bone marrow,
Dr. Wiseman opined that it could have been caused by his aggressive
chemotherapy treatments. (AR 103.) He offered an alternative theory in his
report and testimony that it could have been caused by benzene exposure. (AR 29
[HT 28:10-15]; AR 103.)
 
 
 
4.           
Workers’
Compensation Report by Dr. Jeffrey Caren, M.D., F.A.C.C.
 
Dr.
Jeffrey Caren, M.D., evaluated Rousseve several times for his workers’
compensation case. These exams took place on October 14, 2015, January 19,
2017, and May 23, 2018. (AR 474, 960, 1119.) Dr. Caren was “unable to determine
if the cancer was or was not caused by the claimed toxic exposure.” (AR 480-81,
981.) Dr. Caren
noted that Rousseve’s cancer is presumed to be an industrial injury pursuant to
Labor Code § 3212. (AR 481.)
 
G.          
LAFPP
Staff Report and Board Hearing
 
Prior
to petitioner’s hearing, LAFPP staff prepared a report recommending that the
Board deny her application for a service-connected survivorship pension. (AR 54,
57.) On January 19, 2023, the Board heard petitioner’s application. (AR 2.)
Petitioner put on three witnesses: (1) herself, testifying to Rousseve’s
lifestyle and health (AR 8-12); (2) Officer Brent Hirunpugdi, Rousseve’s LAPD
partner, testifying to their assignments and environmental exposures (AR 12-25);
and (3) Dr. Wiseman, testifying to his theory linking environmental exposures
to cancer-causing genetic mutations (AR 25-38). In his closing, petitioner’s
counsel argued for service-connection, pointing to Dr. Wiseman’s medical
opinion that environmental factors caused Rousseve’s TP53 gene to mutate,
malfunction, and develop cancer. (AR 38-42.)
 
While
Board members empathized with petitioner and expressed sympathy, they explained
that their fiduciary duty to follow the LAAC did not permit them to consider
any emotional connection to Petitioner’s case in their deliberations. (AR 45-46
[HT 44:14-23, 45:13-19].) Commissioners Garrett Zimmon and William Chun both
expressly stated they did not see clear and convincing evidence of
service-connection. (Ibid.) After considering petitioner’s evidence and
closing statement and deliberating, the Board unanimously voted to adopt
staff’s recommendation to deny petitioner’s application. (AR 46-47.)
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
July 6, 2023, petitioner filed a verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of
Mandate. On August 14, 2023, respondent filed an Answer. On December 5, 2023,
petitioner filed a reply to the Answer.
 
            On
March 15, 2024, petitioner filed an opening brief. On April 15, 2024, respondent
filed an opposition. On April 30, 2024, petitioner filed a reply. The Court has
received hard copies of the administrative record and joint appendix. 
 
 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
          Under CCP § 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the respondent
has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether
there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is
established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the
decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by
the evidence. (CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
A disability pension
benefit is a fundamental vested right. (See Strumsky v. San Diego County
Employees Retirement Assn. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 45 [service-connected death
benefits to widow of police officer found to be fundamental vested right].)
Accordingly, the Court exercises its independent judgment on the administrative
findings. (See Wences v. City of
Los Angeles (2§009) 177 Cal.App.4th 305, 314; Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.) Under the independent
judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the administrative record for
errors of law, but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence
disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”
(Bixby, 4 Cal.3d at 143.) The court
must draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own
credibility determinations. (Morrison v.
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003)
107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) “In exercising
its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong presumption of
correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the party challenging
the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the
administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.”  (Fukuda
v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal quotations omitted.)
A reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either party to an appeal and
will not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a search of the record
for any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d
740, 742.) When an appellant challenges “‘the sufficiency of the evidence, all
material evidence on the point must be set forth and not merely their own
evidence.” (Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309, 317.)  
 
IV.     Analysis
 
As
a preliminary matter, respondent’s request to take judicial notice of Los
Angeles Charter Code §§ 1102 and 1106 and Los Angeles Administrative Code
(“LAAC”) §§ 4.2006 and 4.2008 is GRANTED, pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(b). 
 
Petitioner
seeks a writ of mandate directing respondent Los Angeles City Fire and Police
Pension System to set aside its Board’s decision to deny her request for
service-connected survivor benefits and to grant service-connected survivor
benefits. (Pet. Prayer ¶ 1.)
 
A.          
Standard
in Finding Death was Service-Connected
 
Section
1102 of the Los Angeles City Charter created the Board of Fire and Police
Pension Commissioners to manage and control the pension system for police
officers. (RJN Ex. 1.) Under section 1106(a)(1) of the City Charter, the Board
has “sole and exclusive responsibility to administer its system . . . to
provide benefits to system participants and their beneficiaries and to assure
prompt delivery of those benefits and related services.” (RJN Ex. 2.)
 
Spouses
of Tier 5 plan members, like Rousseve, are entitled to a monthly pension for
life. (RJN Ex. 4 at LAAC § 4.2008(a)(2).) The amount of the pension is greater
if the plan member’s death is “service-connected.” (Cf. RJN Ex. 4 at
LAAC § 4.2008(a)(1), (a)(2) [30-40% of final average salary for
nonservice-connected death, 75% of final average salary for service-connected
death].)  The Board has the power to hear
and determine whether the plan member’s death was service-connected or
nonservice-connected. (RJN Ex. 3 at LAAC § 4.2008(g)(1), citing LAAC § 4.2006(c).)
 
With
respect to finding whether the death of a plan member was service-connected,
LAAC § 4.2008(a) states: “[A] Plan Member has died by reason of injuries
received or sickness caused by the discharge of his or her duties if there is
clear and convincing evidence that the discharge of the Plan Member’s duties
were the predominant cause of his or her death.” (RJN Ex. 4 at LAAC §
4.2008(a)(1).) “Clear and convincing” evidence requires “a finding of high
probability,” with evidence “so clear as to leave no substantial doubt” and
“sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable
mind.” (In re Angelia P. (1981) 28 Cal.3d 908, 919, internal quotations
omitted.) 
 
B.          
Evaluation
of Evidence
 
The
parties do not dispute that decedent James Rousseve was exposed to vehicle
exhaust and diesel fumes, as well as narcotics and gunpowder residue while
working as a police officer. (See AR 15-18 [HT 14:14-17:23], 21 [HT 20:7-25],
24 [HT 23:14-25].) The question presented here is whether exposure to these
agents caused Rousseve’s death. 
 
During
the hearing on petitioner’s application for service-connected survivor
benefits, Dr. Wiseman, petitioner’s expert, testified that Rousseve’s exposure
to carcinogenic agents caused a mutation in his TP53 gene, rendering his body
incapable of regulating cell growth and causing the sarcoma that led to his death.
(AR 26-27 [HT 24:18-25:18], 29-31 [HT 28:16-30:5].) Dr. Wiseman noted that
Rousseve’s death certificate designated that he had myelodysplastic syndrome,
which is caused by exposure to benzene commonly found in diesel exhaust. (AR 29
[HT 28:1-15].) 
 
As
compared to his hearing testimony, Dr. Wiseman was more equivocal in his prior
written report. After having noted that Rousseve had a mutation in his TP53
gene, Dr. Wiseman stated: “To develop one explanatory scenario, Officer
Rousseve could have developed [desmoplastic small round cell cancer] from
exposure to environmental chemicals producing mutations, that is genetic
aberrations, and these mutations led to the development of his malignancy.” (AR
103.) After having noted that studies have not linked desmoplastic small round
cell cancer, the type of cancer Rousseve had, to exposure to air pollutants
because the cancer is particularly rare, Dr. Wiseman concluded his report by stating:
 
Given
any list of mutations, medical science has not developed tools to directly
identify what caused any of the aberrations identified for Officer Rousseve.
The rate of mutations from environmental exposures is offered as an explanatory
sequence. Such exposures could therefore be the plausible predominant
cause of Officer Rousseve’s cancer.
 
(AR
103-04, emphasis added.) By using the word “could” in the paragraph quoted
above, Dr. Wiseman’s report describes environmental exposures as a possible
cause of Rousseve’s cancer. Dr. Wiseman’s conclusion is qualified, however, by the
admission that medical science currently cannot directly identify what caused
the mutations identified for Rousseve. 
 
            Dr. Wiseman’s recognition of the
limits of medical science is consistent with the findings of respondent’s
experts, Dr. Scoy-Mosher and Dr. Lawrence.[5]
In finding that Rousseve’s sarcoma was unrelated to occupational exposure, Dr.
Scoy-Mosher explained:
 
[The]
entiology of soft tissue sarcomas such as desmoplastic sarcoma is essentially
entirely unknown. There has been no connection to the kinds of exposures of a
work that would be encountered in an ordinary police career and there is no
scientific evidence to lead one to believe that his unfortunate development of
this sarcoma and his death from the sarcoma were in any way related to this
occupational employment as a police officer.
 
(AR
121.)
 
            Dr. Lawrence listed risk factors of
soft tissue sarcoma, including external radiation therapy, chemotherapy,
Thorotrast, arsenical pesticide and medications, Phenoxy herbicides, vinyl
chloride, immunosuppressive drugs, alkylating agents, androgen-anabolic
steroids, human immunodeficiency virus, human herpesvirus type 8, and Epstein-Barr
virus. (AR  129.) Other risk factors
identified by Dr. Lawrence include certain inherited syndromes such as retinoblastoma,
Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Gardner’s syndrome, Werner’s syndrome, nevoid basal cell
carcinoma syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, and some immunodeficiency
syndromes. (AR 129-30.) Dr. Lawrence also identified chronic edema and chronic
irritation as risk factors, but she noted that more studies are needed to
determine the association between edema and irritation and soft tissue
sarcomas. (AR 130.) Dr. Lawrence also identified working varying shifts as a
potential risk factor, but she noted that studies have yielded conflicting
results. (AR 130.) 
 
            Dr. Lawrence stated that Rousseve
had no history of the risk factors that she listed. (AR 130.) Dr. Lawrence did
not list vehicle exhaust, narcotics residue, or gunpower residue as potential
risk factors for soft tissue sarcomas. In any event, Dr. Lawrence noted that
the risk factors account for a small minority of soft tissue sarcoma cases. (AR
130.) Due to the rarity of soft tissue sarcoma (1% of all cancers diagnosed in
the United States), and the subcategory of desmoplastic small round cell
tumors, Dr. Lawrence stated that studies have been unable to determine the causation
of soft cell sarcomas. (AR 130.) Dr. Lawrence concluded that Rousseve’s
employment in the LAPD was not a predominant cause of his cancer diagnosis and
death. (AR 130.) 
 
Petitioner
faults respondent’s experts for having failed to consider Rousseve’s job duties
and industrial environmental exposures. Even assuming the truth of Dr.
Scoy-Mosher’s assumption that Rousseve’s exposure to carcinogenic agents was
ordinary, petitioner and respondent’s experts agree that soft tissue sarcomas
are rare and medical studies have not definitively identified causes of soft
tissue sarcomas. (See, e.g. AR 104 [Wiseman states that “[t]here are 50
different kinds of [soft tissue sarcomas], [desmoplastic small round cell
cancer] is particularly rare, so it is not surprising the paper did not
describe the specific mutation relating to Officer Rousseve’s cancer].) 
 
Considering
the evidence in its totality, the Court finds that petitioner has not shown by
clear and convincing evidence that Rousseve’s environmental exposures while
working as a police officer caused his cancer, as is required under LAAC § 4.2008(a).
Dr. Wiseman’s more affirmative stance during the hearing does not change the
fact that, notwithstanding the plausibility of his conclusion regarding
causation, there appears to be no consensus regarding the role that
environmental or occupational exposures have in the development of soft tissue
sarcomas. While the lack of definitive studies may be the unfortunate byproduct
of the rarity of Rousseve’s type of cancer, such lack ultimately leaves this
Court unable to find with a high probability, or with evidence so strong as to
leave no substantial doubt, that Rousseve ultimately died because of his job
responsibilities. (See
Angelia P., 28 Cal.3d at 919.)
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), respondent shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed
judgment.
