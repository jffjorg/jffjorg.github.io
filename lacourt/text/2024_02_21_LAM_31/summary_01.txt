And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger sets a new hearing date for the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees incurred from the appeal. The hearing was previously set for February 21, 2024, but was continued to March 29, 2024 due to a stipulation by the parties to continue the hearing. The parties had filed a stipulation to continue the hearing because the plaintiff's attorney has been sued for fees arising out of this matter, including legal services rendered for the appeal, and the plaintiff is disputing the amount claimed. Additionally, the parties have not apprised the court of the status of the arbitration. The court directs the parties to notify the court of the status of arbitration no later than 5 court days before the hearing.
