And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants KH Capital's motion for leave to intervene in the action between Shuki International, Inc. and Antonio Brown. KH Capital is a judgment creditor of Shaoul Amar, who is the equitable owner of Shuki International, Inc. The court finds that KH Capital has a mandatory right to intervene because it has an interest in the value of the jewelry that is the subject of the action, and it is not so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede its interest. The court also finds that none of the parties adequately represent KH Capital's interest. The motion is granted, and KH Capital is ordered to file its proposed Complaint-in-Intervention within five days of the date of the order.
