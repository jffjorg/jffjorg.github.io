MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Marvin
B. Adviento, MBA Legal, P.C.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On January 23, 2024, Marvin B. Adviento, counsel for Plaintiff,
Elena Svistina, filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration
in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052));
(3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other
parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving
counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
Marvin B. Adviento seeks to be relieved as counsel of record
for Plaintiff for the following reasons: “There is an irreparable breakdown in
the attorney-client relationship.”  (Form
MC-052.)   
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)  
 
Upon review, the court finds the Motion does not comply with
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Specifically,
there is no proof of service showing this motion was served on all parties in
this action.  Additionally, the proposed
order (Form MC-053) is incomplete. 
Counsel is to address Items 3, 5, 7, and 9.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            Accordingly,
the hearing for this motion is CONTINUED to March 27, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  Counsel is to file and serve an amended motion
correcting the defects noted in this order. 
Counsel is also directed to include the new hearing dates in its amended
motion.  
            Counsel to
give notice.  


Dated:   February 21,
2024
