MOTION
FOR SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA 
CODE
OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 128.5
      


 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
The Redeemed Christian Church of God-Jesus Embassy, Los Angeles
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition  
 
 
This is a breach of contract case concerning real
property.  On September 28, 2021,
Plaintiff, The Redeemed Christian Church of God-Jesus Embassy Los Angeles,
filed a complaint against Defendants, Swift Petrochemicals, Inc. (“Swift”) and
Mutiu Olatunji Durosinmi-Etti (“Etti”). 
On October 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Third Amended
Complaint (TAC) alleging causes of action for: 1) Breach of Contract, 2) Promissory
Estoppel, 3) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing,
4) Declaratory Relief, 5) Constructive Trust, and 6) Fraud.  
 
On December 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for
sanctions against Defendants and their counsel. 

 
The motion is procedurally defective.  First, the proof of service states that Defendants
were served with Plaintiff’s Notice of Motion and Motion to Compel Deposition.  There is no proof of service showing
Defendants were served with this motion. 
Second, the notice of motion does not state the grounds for issuance of
the order.  “A notice of motion must
state in the opening paragraph the nature of the order being sought and the
grounds for issuance of the order.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(a).) 
  
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions is DENIED
without prejudice.
 
Clerk of the Court to give notice.
