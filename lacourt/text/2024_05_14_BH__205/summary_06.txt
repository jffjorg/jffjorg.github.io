And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has denied Defendant's motion to strike Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The Court found that Plaintiff's allegations of fraud, including false representations made by Defendants under penalty of perjury, were sufficient to state a claim for punitive damages. The Court held that the allegations of fraud and the manner in which Defendants breached the rental agreement were sufficient to entitle Plaintiff to seek punitive damages.
