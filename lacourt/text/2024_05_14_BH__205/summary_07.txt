And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants defendants' demurrer to the complaint with 20 days' leave to amend. The court finds that the complaint is largely unintelligible and cannot reasonably be responded to by the defendants. The court declines to consider the other arguments raised by the defendants as to why each of the causes of action must fail. Instead, the court allows the plaintiff leave to clearly state the allegations and causes of action being alleged against the defendants.
