And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Annunziata Crupi's motion for sanctions against the Barkhordarian Law Firm. The motion was filed over a month after the deadline for serving the moving papers, and the Judge has ruled that it is untimely. The Plaintiff had alleged that the Defendant failed to properly serve her with a demurrer and motion to strike, and the Judge has concluded that the Plaintiff's own failure to serve the papers in a timely manner renders the motion moot.
