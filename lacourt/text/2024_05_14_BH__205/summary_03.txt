And here is the text summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants Defendant Dylan Omid Keshmir's motion to vacate judgment in an unlawful detainer action. The Court finds that the failure to timely file opposition was due to a calendaring error by counsel, which is considered excusable neglect. The Court also notes that the attorney's declaration of fault warrants mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b). The Court vacates the judgment in favor of the Landlord and resets the hearing on the Landlord's motion to vacate dismissal and enforce settlement for May 31, 2024.
