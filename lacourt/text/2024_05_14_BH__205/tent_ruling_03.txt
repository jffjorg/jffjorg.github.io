 Case Number:  23SMCV01584    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  MIRIAMS WELL, LLC,    Plaintiff, v.  DYLAN OMID KESHMIR, et al.,    Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV01584     Hearing Date:  May 14, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANT DYLAN OMID KESHMIR’S    MOTION TO VACATE JUDGMENT       BACKGROUND This is an unlawful detainer action.  Defendants Dylan Omid Keshmir and Megan Pater are tenants of residential property located at 344 S. Rexford Drive #6, Beverly Hills, California 90212 (the “Premises”).  Plaintiff Miriams Well, LLC is the Landlord. The parties signed an “Unlawful Detainer Stipulation and Judgment”.  The stipulation provided for judgment of $42,600 which was subject to partial waiver if Tenants made timely payments of (1) $7,200 on July 20, 2023, (2) $7,200 on September 20, 2023, and (3) an additional $200 per month for 12 months beginning October 1, 2023.  The case was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6. Tenants paid $7,200 on July 20, 2023, but made only a partial payment of $6,200 on September 20, 2023.  Tenants also failed to pay ongoing rent, including the additional $200 per month required in the stipulation.   Pursuant to the stipulation, Landlord would get all financial assistance Tenants received for rent payment during the Covid-19 period, in an amount totaling $28,800, and half would be used to address the habitability issues with the unit.  Tenants would submit written maintenance requests for repairs to Plaintiff.     On March 26, 2024, the Court granted Landlord’s motion to vacate dismissal and enforce settlement.  In doing so, the Court declined to consider Tenants’ opposition which was due on March 13, 2024 but was not filed until March 19, 2024.  This hearing is on Defendant Dylan Omid Keshmir’s motion to vacate judgment.  Keshmir argues that his failure to timely file his opposition was due to a calendaring error by his counsel, and his counsel’s declaration of fault mandates relief from the judgment pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b).   LEGAL STANDARD Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §473(b), both discretionary and mandatory relief are available to parties when a case is dismissed.  Discretionary relief is available under the statute as “the court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 473(b).)  Alternatively, mandatory relief is available when “accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.”  (Id.)  The purpose of the attorney affidavit provision is to “relieve the innocent client of the burden of the attorney’s fault, to impose the burden on the erring attorney, and to avoid precipitating more litigation in the form of malpractice suits.”  (Hu v. Fang (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 61, 64.)  Mandatory relief is available even if counsel’s neglect was inexcusable.  (SJP Limited Partnership v. City of Los Angeles (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 511, 516–517.)   An application for discretionary or mandatory relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) “[W]hen relief under section 473¿is¿available, there is a strong¿public¿policy¿in¿favor¿of granting relief and allowing the requesting party his or her day in court[.]” (Rappleyea v. Campbell¿(1994) 8 Cal. 4th 975, 981-82.)  Any doubt in applying section 473, subdivision (b), must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief.  (Bonzer v. City of Huntington Park (1993) 20 Cal. App. 4th 1474,¿1477-1478.)   Where relief is promptly sought and no prejudice would be done to the opposing party, only very slight evidence is required to justify the setting¿aside of a default.  For this reason, orders denying relief under section 473 are carefully scrutinized on appeal. (Rappleyea v. Campbell¿(1994) 8 Cal..4th 975, 980;¿Elston v. City of Turlock¿(1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233.)  DISCUSSION Defendant’s motion to vacate judgment is accompanied by an attorney declaration of fault.  In such circumstances, mandatory relief is required even if counsel’s error may be inexcusable.  (SJP Limited Partnership, 136 Cal.App.4th at 516–517.)  In any event, counsel attests his failure to file a timely opposition was due to a calendaring error, and calendaring errors are generally considered excusable neglect¿for which discretionary relief is also warranted. (See, e.g., Communidad en Accion v. Los Angeles City Council (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1133.) CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to vacate judgment.  The Court vacates the judgment in favor of Landlord.  The Court re-sets the hearing on Landlord’s motion to vacate dismissal and enforce settlement for May 31, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: May 14, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
