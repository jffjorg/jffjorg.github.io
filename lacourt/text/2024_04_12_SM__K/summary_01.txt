And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in an unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff, Zappia, brought an action against her tenants, Searle, et al, for owner move-in. The court found that the tenants failed to comply with a 60-day notice of termination under the lease agreement. The court granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees, awarding 90 out of the 106 hours requested by the plaintiff's counsel, and reducing the hourly rate from $450 to $400. The court also rejected the defendants' argument that the attorney's fees should be reduced further due to the defense counsel's inexperience with unlawful detainer matters.
