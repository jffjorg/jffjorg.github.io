I
INTRODUCTION
 
            This was an unlawful detainer
brought by the owner of her property (Plaintiff or “P”) against her tenants (Defendants
or collectively “D”).  The basis for the eviction
was P’s desire to move her daughter into the residence.  After a hotly contested bench trial that
spanned 5 days, this Court entered judgment for P.  P now brings this motion for attorney’s fees
pursuant to the lease agreement and CC §§ 1942.4(b)(2) and 1942.5(i).
 
            D’s opposition does not contest the
grounds for the award of attorney’s fees nor that P was the prevailing party.  Instead, aside from a few arguments, D in
essence challenges the amount of attorney’s fees requested.
 
II
ANALYSIS
 
            First, this Court rejects D’s
argument that attorney’s fees cannot be awarded because they were not included
in the Judgment.  As P points out in her
Reply Brief, this argument is nonsensical because attorney’s fees are costs which
cannot be sought until after judgment has been entered.
 
            Second, D’s argument that P’s counsel
Edward Zappia was representing himself in pro per and therefore not entitled to
attorney’s fees is also rejected out of hand. 
Although counsel is married to the actual Plaintiff Anna Zappia, defense
counsel was not the owner of the property at issue and was retained by his wife
Anna to prosecute this unlawful detainer. 
Moreover, defense counsel has also established that the residence at
issue was Plaintiff’s sole property alone and not community property obtained
during the course of the marriage.
 
            Third, this Court finds that this
unlawful detainer action arose from the lease agreement which provided D’s with
a 60 day notice of termination under Paragraph 40 of the Lease Agreement.  Obviously, D did not comply with the 60 day moveout
notice per that paragraph, which has necessitated P bringing this action for eviction.  This case “arises from” D’s failure to abide
by this term of the lease agreement, regardless of whether the basis upon which
the UD was premised was an owner move-in.
            With respect to the attorney’s fees
requested, this Court exercises its discretion in awarding 90 out of the 106
hours requested by P’s counsel, and reduces the hourly rate to $400/hr from the
$450 requested.  The reductions are based
on not awarding travel/commute time for the court appearances, and that $400 is
a reasonable rate for an unlawful detainer attorney to have handled this
matter.  This Court rejects D’s argument
that further reductions should be given because defense counsel was relatively
new to UD’s and had to spend considerable time learning this field.  There is no requirement that P hire a
seasoned unlawful detainer attorney; so long as the hours spent were reasonable
for any attorney to spend in order to prosecute this case, those hours will be
awarded.  Furthermore, the issues in this
case were not simple garden variety unlawful detainer issues; very experienced
defense counsel in essence threw the proverbial “kitchen sink” at P’s, raising
numerous complicated defenses including retaliation, habitability, and LA Rent Stabilization
Ordinances.  In light of these issues
raised by the defense, this Court easily finds that the 90 hours awarded are reasonable.
 The $400 rate is a reasonable rate for
an attorney to handle the unlawful detainer issues raised in this case and also
given defense counsel’s inexperience with UD matters.
 
            IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that D pay P
reasonable attorneys’ fees in the amount of $36,000 and costs in the amount of $8,092.20.
