And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between the County and Finance over whether Finance should be added as a real party-in-interest to a petition. The County has filed a declaration with emails between the Commission and the County, but the judge has ruled that these emails are irrelevant and will not be considered. The judge notes that the moving parties have satisfied the requirement to meet and confer, but that these efforts have failed to resolve the issues in dispute. The judge also notes that Finance has correctly pointed out that there is a distinction between a "real party-in-interest" plaintiff and Finance, and that the County's opposition to the Commission's demurrer is similar but not identical. The judge has not yet made a final ruling in the case, but has indicated that the "its all one state" argument has been disposed of by prior case law.
