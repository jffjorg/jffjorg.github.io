[1] Defendants argue that the renewed allegations for
punitive damages are improper because although the Court’s March 13, 2024 Order
granted Plaintiffs leave to amend the fraud cause of action, it granted the
motion to strike the punitive damages without leave to amend.  The word “without” is an erroneous typo in
the Court’s order.  Plaintiffs’
re-allegations of punitive damages are proper in light of the Court’s leave to
amend the complaint to add additional facts to support the fraud cause of
action.  To that end, the Court will
amend the March 13, 2024 Minute Order.
