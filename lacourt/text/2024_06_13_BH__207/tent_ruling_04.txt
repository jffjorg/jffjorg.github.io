The Court does not generally consider reply evidence, as it deprives the
opposing party of a fair opportunity to respond.  (San Diego Watercrafts, Inc. v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 308, 316 [“due process requires a
party be fully advised of the issues to be addressed and be given adequate
notice of what facts it must rebut in order to prevail”]; see also Wall
Street Network Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th
1171.)  Moreover, as discussed below,
because the Court does not reach the parties’ arguments regarding Plaintiff’s
proficiency in English, the reply evidence is irrelevant to the Court’s
decision in any event.
