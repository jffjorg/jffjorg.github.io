MOTION
 
Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor Montgomery Management Company
(“Plaintiff”) seeks a charging order as to Defendant and Judgment Debtor Ralph
Brescia’s (“Defendant”) membership interest in MR2 Enterprises, LLC to satisfy
the unpaid balance on the judgment entered against Defendant on May 15,
2023.  Plaintiff’s motion is
unopposed.  
 
At the hearing on April 24, 2024, the Court ordered Plaintiff to file a
supplemental brief addressing the interest calculations.  Plaintiff complied with the Court’s order and
the Court has considered the supplemental brief.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
708.310 provides, “If a money judgment is rendered against a partner or member
but not against the partnership or limited liability company, the judgment
debtor’s interest in the partnership or limited liability company may be
applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment by an order charging the
judgment debtor’s interest pursuant to Section 15907.03, 16504, or 17705.03 of
the Corporations Code.”
 
            Corporations Code section 17705.03,
subdivision (a) provides: “On application by a judgment creditor of a member or
transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the transferable
interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A
charging order constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor’s transferable interest
and requires the limited liability company to pay over to the person to which
the charging order was issued any distribution that would otherwise be paid to
the judgment debtor.”
 
            Here, judgment was entered against
Defendant and for Plaintiff in the amount of $72,296.78 on May 15, 2023.  (See Judgment.)  On August 18, 2023, the Court awarded  attorneys’ fees in the amount of $72,320.00.  (Minute Order, Aug. 18, 2023.)  Post-judgment interest on the attorneys’ fees
begins to accrue as of the date of judgment, even though the exact dollar
amount had not yet been ascertained. 
(See Felczer v. Apple Inc. (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 406.)  Post-judgment interest accrues at a rate of
10 percent.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.010.)
 
Plaintiff
has also provided evidence that Defendant is listed as having an ownership
interest as a manager or member of MR2 Enterprises LLC on the annual California
Secretary of State filing for MR2 Enterprises LLC.  (Stewart Decl. ¶¶ 6-7 and Ex. C.)  The statement of information lists Defendant’s
name and address of record with the Court. 
(Ibid.)  
 
            Plaintiff also indicates that on
October 13, 2023, the Sheriff’s Department collected $2,455 from Defendant to
be applied to the outstanding judgment. 
(Stewart Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
            Therefore, in general, Plaintiff has
demonstrated that Defendant owes a balance on the judgment, and Defendant has
an ownership interest in MR2 Enterprises LLC, to which Plaintiff may attach to
recover on the judgment.
 
            As such, Plaintiff seeks $13,049.67,
representing 10% annual interest on the $144,616.80 judgment ($72,296.78
principal + $72,320 attorney fees) for the 381 days from the May 15, 2023
judgment up to and including May 30, 2024, the date of Plaintiff’s supplemental
declaration, minus the $2,045.55 collected by the Sheriff in October.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion is granted.  Further, the Court orders Plaintiff to file a
proposed Order in conformity with the ruling on or before June 27, 2024, and to
lodge a courtesy copy of the proposed Order directly in Department 207.  
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
