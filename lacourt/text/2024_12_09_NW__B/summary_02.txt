The court finds that the defendant has satisfied the meet and confer declaration requirement and has provided the required specifications for the proposed IME. The court also grants the defendant's request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $2,103.18. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to arrange a mutually convenient date and time to conduct the IME within the next 45 days.
