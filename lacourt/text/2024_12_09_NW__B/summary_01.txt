```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the County's demurrer to Plaintiff's second amended complaint and has made the following rulings. The County's demurrer is untimely and has not provided a meet and confer declaration as required by CCP § 430.41. The County's argument that Plaintiff failed to file a claim for damages as required by Gov. Code § 945.4 is also without merit. The Court has considered the face of the pleading and has determined that Plaintiff's second amended complaint states a cause of action against the County. Therefore, the County's demurrer is overruled on both procedural and substantive grounds.
