  Case Number:  20STCV37624    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  B MICHAEL MORRIS Plaintiff, vs. SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, A MUNICIPAL ENTITY, ET AL. Defendants. CASE NO: 20STCV37624 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES’S DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT Dept. B 8:30 a.m. December 9, 2024I. BACKGROUNDOn October 1, 2020, Plaintiff Michael Morris (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles (“Superior Court”), the County of Los Angeles (“County”), and Does 1 to 50 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging two causes of action: (1) premises liability; and (2) general negligence. Plaintiff alleges that, on September 17, 2019, due to Defendants’ negligence, Plaintiff suffered injuries when he sat on a chair which collapsed underneath him at the Van Nuys Courthouse.On May 24, 2022, the County filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint alleging that the complaint failed to allege a statutory basis for liability against the County as required by theGovernment Claims Act. The Court sustained the County’s demurrer with leave to amen on August 10, 2022.On August 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed their first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleging one cause of action for premises liability pursuant to Cal. Gov. Code §§ 815.2(a), 820(a), 835 and 840.2.On November 17, 2022, the Superior Court filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC, alleging that the FAC failed to state facts sufficient to support a cause of action against the Superior Court since the Superior Court does not own or control the subject premises. The Court sustained the Superior Court’s demurrer with leave to amend on January 13, 2023.On January 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed their second amended complaint (“SAC”) with additional facts.On February 23,2023, the County filed its Answer to the SAC.On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024.On July 17, 2024, the County filed the instant demurrer to Plaintiff’s SAC.On November 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed their opposition.On December 2, 2024, the County filed their reply.II. LEGAL STANDARDA demurrer is a pleading that may be used to test the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10.) There are two types of demurrers: general demurrers and special demurrers. (See McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 77.)General demurrers can be used to attack pleadings for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (CCP § 430.10(e); McKenney, 167 Cal.App.4th at 77.) Such demurrers can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable; evidence or extrinsic matters are not considered. (CCP §§ 430.30 and 430.70; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the Court admits “all material facts properly pleaded” and “matters which may be judicially noticed,” but does not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation].” (Blank, 39 Cal.3d at 318.) It gives these facts “a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.” (Ibid.). At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) "If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence." (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.) Special demurrers can be used to attack the pleadings on grounds that the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible, or in a contract case, for failure to allege whether a contract is oral or written. (CCP § 430.10(f).)CCP § 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due.(CCP § 430.41(a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (CCP § 430.41(a)(3).)When a demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings were defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) Generally, the court will allow leave to amend on at least the first try, unless there is absolutely no possibility of overcoming the issue. (See Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227 [“Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on its face it is incapable of amendment. (Citation.) Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given."].)III. DISCUSSIONEvidentiary ObjectionsPlaintiff’s December 3, 2024, objection to the reply declaration of Gary Bacio (“Bacio”) is overruled. Plaintiff misstates Bacio’s declaration. Baccio does not raise new matters or facts in their reply papers as Plaintiff claims; instead, it replies directly to Plaintiff’s arguments made in opposition of the County’s demurrer.UntimelinessAs a preliminary matter, the County’s demurrer is untimely. Plaintiff filed their SAC on January 24, 2023. The County filed their demurrer on July 17, 2024, a year and a half after Plaintiff’s filing. Demurrers must be filed within 30 days after service of the complaint which is subject to demur. (CCP § 430.40(a).) Therefore, the County’s demurrer is overruled as untimely. Moreover, the County Answered the SAC on February 23, 2023, Nonetheless, for both parties’ benefit, the Court now chooses to discuss the motion’s substance.Meet and Confer RequirementThe County fails to provide a meet and confer declaration as required by CCP § 430.41.(a). Therefore, the County’s motion is further denied on procedural grounds.County’s ArgumentThe County argues that Plaintiff’s SAC fails to allege facts sufficient to constitute causes of action against the County because Plaintiff failed to file a claim for damages as required by Gov. Code § 945.4.Under Gov. Code § 945.4, no personal injury suit for money or damages may be brought against a government entity until a written claim is presented to and acted upon by the Government Claims Program (“GCP”). (Gov. Code § 945.4.) The claim must be presented no later than six months after accrual of the cause of action. (Gov. Code § 911.2(a).) However, a claimant may apply to the GCP for late claim relief. (Gov. Code § 911.4.) If claimant’s application is denied, then they may petition the court for an order for relief from the presentation requirement of § 945.4. (Gov. Code § 946.6.)Here, the County relies on the declaration of Katherine Medina (“Medina”), Deputy Clerk of the Board of Supervisors for the County of Los Angeles, to support its claim thatPlaintiff failed to file a claim of damages pursuant to Gov. Code § 945.4. (See Motion; Medina Decl. ¶¶ 1-3.) However, evidence and extrinsic matters cannot be considered for the purposes of ruling on a demurrer. (CCP §§ 430.30 and 430.70; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) The Court may only consider the face of the pleading or matters outside of the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Ibid.) Here, the Medina declaration is not a judicially noticeable matter. Further, the SAC at paragraph 9 states that Plaintiff has complied with applicable claims statutes. Therefore, on both procedural and substantive grounds, the County’s demurrer is overruled.IV. CONCLUSIONThe County’s demurrer is OVERRULED.Moving Party to give notice.December 6, 2024 _____________________Hon. Karen MoskowitzJudge of the Superior Court
