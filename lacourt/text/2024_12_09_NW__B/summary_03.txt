Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled that the current guardian ad litem, Chelsea Hiles, should be removed from the case and a new guardian ad litem should be appointed. The court has also granted leave for the plaintiffs to file an amended petition to approve a compromise of the disputed claim or pending action or disposition of judgment for a minor or a person with a disability. The court's decision is based on the fact that the family has relocated to Israel and closed the account, making it difficult for Hiles to deposit the settlement funds into a blocked account. The proposed new guardian ad litem, Samuel Lovitch, has agreed to serve and has no financial interest or claim against the current guardian ad litem or minor. The court finds that the removal of the current guardian ad litem and the appointment of a new one is in the best interest of Natan, the minor.
