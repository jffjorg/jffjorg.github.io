 Case Number:  21STCV01327    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  B MUTIAT MAJEKODUNMI, Plaintiff, vs. ROBERT HAMANOTO, Defendant. Case No.: 21STCV01327 Hearing Date: DECEMBER 9, 2024Defendant Robert Hamamoto’s motion to compel the independent medical examination of Plaintiff Mutiat Majekodunmi is granted. Defendant’s request for sanctions is also granted in the reduced amount of $2,103.18.Defendant Robert Hamamoto (“Defendant”) moves to compel the independent medical examination (“IME”) of Plaintiff Mutiat Majekodunmi (“Plaintiff”), contending that there is good cause for the motion because Plaintiff placed her physical injuries in controversy. (Motion p. 5:11-20.)“Unless otherwise limited by order of the court …, any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action …, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)Where any party seeks to obtain discovery by a physical examination, the party shall obtain leave of the court. (CCP § 2032.310(a).) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under CCP § 2016.040. (CCP § 2032.310(b).) The Court shall grant the motion only for good cause shown. (CCP§ 2032.320(a).)Meet and ConferOn May 21, 2024, defense counsel served notice of a Demand for Physical Examination of Plaintiff on plaintiff’s counsel, to be conducted on August 6, 2024, by orthopedic surgeon Michael P. Weinstein, M.D. (“Dr. Weinstein”). (Babadjanian Decl. ¶ 7; Exh. E [Demand].) Defense counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel email reminders regarding the noticed examination on July 30, August 1, and August 3, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 9; Exh. F [email correspondences].) Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond. (Ibid.) Plaintiff failed to appear for the August 6, 2024, examination. (Ibid. at ¶ 10.) On August 21, 2024, Defense counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letter regarding the same. (Ibid. at 12; Exh. H [email].) Plaintiff’s counsel stated they had no authorization to enter into a stipulation to facilitate Plaintiff’s examination. (Ibid.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant satisfies the meet and confer declaration requirement.Separate Statement RequirementsA motion for “medical examination over objection” must be accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(a).) Here, Plaintiff did not object to Defendant’s noticed examination. Accordingly, a separate statement is not required.Good CauseDefendant contends that there is good cause to compel Plaintiff’s independent medical examination (“IME”) because Plaintiff placed her physical injuries in controversy. In response to questioning at her February 7, 2024, deposition, Plaintiff claims injuries to her head, neck, lower back, shoulders, left hand and wrist, knees, and ankles. (Babadjanian Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. A [Plaintiff’s depo.] at 14:24-15:1, 33:3-25, 68:15-21, 72:13-73:10, 74:20-76:25,14:13-23, 35:6-10, and 36:7-12.)Plaintiff did not object to Defendant’s noticed IME or oppose this motion. Without an IME, Defendant cannot fully evaluate Plaintiff’s injuries and prepare a defense for trial. Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant has shown good cause to compel Plaintiff's IME.Required Specifications of the Proposed IMEA motion for an examination must specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well as the identity and specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will perform the examination. (CCP § 2032.310(b).)Defendant provides a scheduled IME for September 17, 2024, or alternatively on such date and time as Dr. Weinstein is available, depending on the hearing of the instant motion and Dr. Weinstein’s availability. (Motion p. 2:5-9.) The IME will take place at 360 San Miguel Drive, Suite 701, Newport Beach, CA 92660. (Ibid. at 10-11.) Defendant states that the IME “will be conducted for the purposes of determining, evaluating and assessing plaintiff’s physical condition and claims of injury in controversy in this action.” (Ibid. at 18-19.) The examination “will be consistent with the practices of orthopedic surgery in Southern California and consultations in connection with such practices.” (Ibid. at 25-26.) Finally, the exam may include the taking of x-rays, CT scans, or MRIs as the performing physician deems necessary. (Ibid. At 3:1-2.)Accordingly, the Court finds that Defendant provides the required specifications of the proposed IME.SanctionsThe Court declines to award discovery sanctions as Plaintiff’s counsel advised moving party that there was no authority to stipulate to an IME prior to the noticed examination and leave of Court is otherwise required pursuant to a showing of good cause.ConclusionFor the reasons set forth above, the motion to compel Plaintiff’s independent medical examination is GRANTED. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to arrange a mutually convenient date and time to conduct the IME within the next 45 days.Moving party to give notice.Dated: December 6, 2024Hon.
