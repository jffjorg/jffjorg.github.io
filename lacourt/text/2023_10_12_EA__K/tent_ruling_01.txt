  Case Number:  22PSCV01757    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  K Plaintiff AMM Restoration & Construction, Inc.’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff AMM Restoration &
Construction, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff performed
building consulting services for Defendant Baja Group Inc. dba Mariscos Baja
(“Defendant”) pursuant to a July 17, 2021 written contract. Defendant has
failed to pay for these services.
On November 9, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Defendant and Does 1-10
for:
1.                 
Breach of Contract
2.                 
Reasonable Value of Work, Labor and Services (Common
Count in Quantum Meruit)
On December 28, 2022, Defendant’s default was entered.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is set for
October 12, 2023.
Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Exhibit A to Edward Gonzalez’s (“Gonzalez”) declaration
provides, in relevant part, that “[o]nce an agreed upon estimate is established
for REPAIRS, CONTENTS/PACK OUT, TOTAL LOSS estimates on behalf of the insured
to the insurance carrier, it is agreed that the insured will pay AMM
Restoration and Construction Inc., A TOTAL OF 10% of the total amount of the
final approved estimate amount.” (Emphasis added). Gonzalez attests that
“[d]efendant's insurer approved AMM's cost of repair estimate of $261,389.55
and paid out the same to Defendant. . .” (Id., ¶ 4); however, Exhibits 6
and 8 reference the “ANM estimate”[1] as
$260,616.98, not $261,389.55, while Exhibit 9 references same as $252,166.28.
It is unclear to the court that the 10% fee should be based on $261,389.55
rather than on one of these other two amounts.2.                 
Exhibit A also provides, in relevant part, that “[i]t
is agreed and understood that the 10% of the total amount of the estimate that
is paid by the insured to AMM will be credited toward the repair of the
property if AMM is contracted to do the repairs.” The court infers, from the
instant default prove-up package, that AMM was not, in fact, subsequently
contracted by Defendant to do the repairs, but would like an affirmative
statement in this regard made in a declaration.                [1]
The reference to “ANM,” rather than “AMM,” appears to be a typographical error.
