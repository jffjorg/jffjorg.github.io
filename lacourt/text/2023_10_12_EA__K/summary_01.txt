And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The court has identified two defects in the plaintiff's proof-up package: (1) a discrepancy in the amount of the estimate for repairs, and (2) a lack of evidence that the plaintiff was subsequently contracted by the defendant to do the repairs. The court has ordered that the plaintiff provide an affirmative statement in a declaration regarding this issue. The case is set for an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment on October 12, 2023.
