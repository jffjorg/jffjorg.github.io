  - "Amendment of a judgment to add an alter ego “is an equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending the judgment to add a new defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the real defendant....

  - "After the death of the judgment creditor, the judgment may be enforced as provided in this title by the judgment creditor's executor or administrator or successor in interest." (CCP section 686.010)

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to add JRDM International, Inc. as a judgment debtor. The plaintiff had argued that JRDM International, Inc. is the alter-ego of Kolah Farangi, Inc. and therefore should be held responsible for the judgment debt. However, the judge found that the preponderance of evidence does not support a finding of alter-ego liability at this time. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's counsel has no standing to bring the current motion because the plaintiff has passed away, and only the plaintiff's estate would have standing to pursue this relief. The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and case law, including Greenspan v. LADT, LLC and Kirkeby v. Superior Court.
