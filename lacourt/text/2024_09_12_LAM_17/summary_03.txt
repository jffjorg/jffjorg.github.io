Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant Takuhi Papazian to respond to the Plaintiff's Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One). The Defendant is sanctioned $700 payable within 30 days. The Judge also grants the Plaintiff's motion to have its Requests for Admission (RFAs) deemed admitted as to Defendant Takuhi Papazian, and sanctions the Defendant and its counsel $700 payable within 30 days. The same sanctions are applied to Defendant Gevork Papazian and Defendant Hagop Papazian, who also failed to respond to the Plaintiff's RFAs. The Plaintiff's motion to have its RFAs deemed admitted as to Defendant Valentina Papazian is not addressed in this tentative ruling. The Plaintiff is seeking to determine whether the Defendants are tenants and the terms of the tenancy, and the Judge's decisions aim to expedite the litigation process.
