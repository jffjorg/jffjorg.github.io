And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mahmud Reza Siamizade v. Steven Meier and Meier Orthopedic Sports Medicine. The case involves a dispute over medical records and a demurrer to the second cause of action.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the second cause of action is overruled, as the two causes of action are based on different statutory grounds and are not duplicative. The second cause of action is based on the duty to provide medical records to counsel, while the first cause of action is based on the duty to provide medical records to the plaintiff.

The judge has also granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to strike exhibits from the amended complaint. The judge has struck exhibits D-F, which are deemed to be improperly attached, but has denied the motion as to exhibits A-C and G, which are deemed to be relevant to the claims asserted in the amended complaint.

The judge has ordered that all parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing. If all parties submit, the court will adopt the tentative as the final order.
