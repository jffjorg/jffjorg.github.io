And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication of the third cause of action, which seeks to cancel a written instrument based on non-delivery. The plaintiff, Shima Nikfarjam, argues that she did not sign the grant deed and therefore cannot be bound by it, but the defendant, Arian Eghbali, has submitted evidence that Shima was involved in the decision to execute the deed of trust and that the plaintiff, Kamran Sadeghian, acted as agent on behalf of Shima when he signed the deed. The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether Shima was acting as an agent for Kamran, and therefore denies the motion for summary adjudication.
