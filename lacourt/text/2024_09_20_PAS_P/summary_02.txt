And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate two cases, one of which is the present case (23BBCV01892) and the other being the case Enrique Zamago Barajas, v. Shahin Rostamlou et al. (Case No. 24NNCV00667). The motion is to consolidate the two cases, which involve the same traffic collision that occurred on March 28, 2023. The Judge notes that the procedural requirements for consolidation have not been fully met, as the Notice of Motion to Consolidate has not been filed in the Barajas Case. Therefore, the Judge intends to continue the hearing to allow the Plaintiff to file the Notice of Consolidation in the Barajas Case. The Judge also notes that if the Plaintiff had properly filed the notice of motion in both cases, consolidation would be appropriate.
