And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 23AHCV01963, arising from an alleged fraudulent lease agreement between Plaintiff Helen Woo and Defendant Eon Walk. The Plaintiff had sought to compel Defendant Walk to respond to Form Interrogatories and to deem Requests for Admissions (RFAs) admitted.

The Judge granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, directing Defendant Walk to provide complete responses without objections. The Judge also granted the motion to deem RFAs admitted, but with a caveat that Defendant Walk must serve a response in substantial compliance with the statutory requirements before the hearing.

The Judge awarded sanctions in the amount of $1,560 to the Plaintiff for Defendant Walk's failure to respond to the discovery requests. The Judge found that Defendant Walk's failure to respond was without justification and that the Plaintiff's counsel's rates were reasonable.

The Judge ordered Defendant Walk to pay sanctions to the Plaintiff within 30 days of the order and to provide Plaintiff with code complaint responses without objections within 30 days of the order. The Judge also ordered Plaintiff to give notice of the order.
