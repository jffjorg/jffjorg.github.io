 Case Number:  24NNCV00030    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER SUSTAINING WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND DEFENDANTS’ DEMURRER TO THE FIRST
AMENDED COMPLAINTI.        INTRODUCTION
          This is an action arising from alleged wrongful actions
taken against Plaintiffs Lucinda Sky (“Sky”) and Leonardo Nishanov (“Nishanov”)
(collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) by the management of the apartment building at
which they reside. Plaintiffs allege that ever since they moved into the
Glenoaks Villas they have experienced misconduct by Defendant Otilia Rosenburg
(“Rosenburg”), who is the manager of the Glenoaks Villas. 
          Plaintiffs allege causes of action against Defendants
Rosenburg and Symphony Asset Pool XIII LLC (“Symphony”) for, among other causes
of action, personal injury, intentional infliction of emotional distress, grand
theft, auto, concealment of evidence, contract forgery, civil rights, negligent
tort, and injunctive relief. 
          On March 14, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint, which added Does 1 through 10 as Defendants. 
          On April 29, 2024, after hearing, the Court denied
Plaintiff Sky’s ex parte application to consolidate 3 cases, request for
jury trial, and request for self-representation. (04/29/24 Minute Order.) 
          On May 24, 2024, Defendants filed a demurrer to the First
Amended Complaint.
          On June 11, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Official Request for
Jury Trial. 
          Also, on June 11, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended
Complaint. 
To
date, no opposition has been filed.
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint by raising questions of law. (Rodas
v. Spiegel, (2001)87 Cal. App. 4th 513, 517.) In determining the merits of
a demurrer, all material facts pleaded in the complaint and those that arise by
reasonable implication, but not conclusions of fact or law, are deemed admitted
by the demurring party. (Ibid.) When considering demurrers, courts read
the allegations liberally and in context. Plaintiffs need allege only “ultimate
facts.” (Ludgate Ins. Co. Ltd. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., (2000) 82 Cal.
App. 4th 592, 606.) And the absence of any allegation essential to a cause of
action renders it vulnerable to a demurrer. (McKenney v. Purepac Pharm. Co.,
(2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 72, 77.) 
 
III.     PROCEDURAL
ISSUES
A party may amend its
pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the answer,
demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike
is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended
pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to
the demurrer or motion to strike.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 472(a).) When plaintiff
files an amended complaint after a demurrer is filed, but before it is decided,
the demurrer must be overruled as moot. (JKC3H8 v. Colton, (2013) 221
Cal.App.4th 468, 477.) 
Here, however, Plaintiffs
filed the SAC without leave of Court. Plaintiffs were authorized to amend
without leave of Court only once, and they exercised that right when they filed
the FAC. “After expiration of the time in which a pleading can be amended as a
matter of course, the pleading can only be amended by obtaining the permission
of the court. (See [Code Civ. Proc.,] §§ 472, 473.)” (Hodges v. County of Placer (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th
537, 544.) 
“Under section 436: ‘The court
may, upon a motion made pursuant to [CCP] Section 435 [allowing motions to strike],
or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: [¶]
... [¶] (b) Strike out all ... of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with ... an order of the court.’ (Italics added.) Indeed, “by virtue of its inherent
power to prevent abuse of its processes” (italics added), a trial court may
strike an amended complaint ‘filed in disregard of established procedural
processes,’ and may strike an amended pleading “because no request for
permission to amend was sought.’ [Citation.]” (Leader v. Health Industries
of America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 613.) Thus, the Court
strikes the SAC and will consider the merits of Defendants’ demurrer to the
FAC.
As for Defendants’
demurrer, the Court finds that it does not comply with California Rules of
Court rule 3.1113(d) [length of memorandum], which states: “Except in a summary
judgment or summary adjudication motion, no opening or responding memorandum
may exceed 15 pages.” Here, Defendants’ moving papers are 19 pages. Rule
3.113(g) states that an oversized memorandum must be considered in the same way
as a paper that is filed late. “A memorandum that exceeds the page limits of
these rules must be filed and considered in the same manner as a late-filed
paper.” (Cal. Rul. Court, rule 3.113(g).) Rule 5.94(d) provides the rule for
late filed papers: “No moving or responding papers relating to a request for
order may be rejected for filing on the ground that it was untimely submitted
for filing. If the court, in its discretion, refuses to consider a late filed paper,
the minutes or order must so indicate.” Despite filing an oversized memorandum,
the Court exercises its discretion to consider the demurrer. (Jackson v. Doe (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 742, citing McAllister v. County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
253, 280, citing Code Civ. Proc. § 437: “The court may, in furtherance of justice,
and on any terms as may be proper ... enlarge the time for answer or demurrer.”)
Plaintiffs have made no showing of prejudice, and the demurrer has been fully briefed.
 
IV.     ANALYSIS
          A.      Continuous
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Defendants argue that the
Continuous Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) fails to allege
the necessary elements of IIED, which include extreme and outrageous conduct,
severe emotional distress, and a direct causal link between Defendants’ conduct
and the distress. According to Defendants, the alleged actions—such as pressure
to allow maintenance work, theft by unknown persons, withholding surveillance
footage, and pet poisoning by third parties—do not meet the legal threshold for
extreme and outrageous behavior because they involve property management
disputes and criminal activities that do not rise to the level of conduct that
society would find intolerable. Additionally, Defendants contend that
Plaintiffs fail to establish a direct causal connection between Defendants’
actions and the claimed emotional distress. The FAC includes references to
unrelated events, such as drug trafficking and police misconduct, which involve
third parties, which Defendants claim further weaken the causal link necessary
for an IIED claim. 
Defendants also argue
that Plaintiffs do not adequately allege severe emotional distress. While
Plaintiffs claim to suffer from conditions like PTSD, panic attacks, and
physical health deterioration, Defendants assert that these allegations are
vague and not specifically tied to their conduct. The FAC also mentions “lead
poisoning” as a cause of some of the alleged physical damages, which has no
connection to Defendants. 
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the
allegations are conclusory and lack sufficient facts to allege a claim for
IIED. 
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the continuous intentional infliction of emotional
distress claim.
B.       Policy Withholding
Victim’s Civil Rights to Obtain Their Evidence 
Defendants argue that
Plaintiffs’ cause of action for Policy Withholding Victim’s Civil Rights to
Obtain Their Evidence under California Penal Code 422.6 fails because there are
no specific facts against Symphony. They also argue that California Penal Code
422.6 is a criminal statute that does not provide for civil damages or a
private right of action. Courts have consistently held that criminal statutes
cannot be used as the basis for civil lawsuits unless the statute explicitly
provides for such a right, which this one does not. (Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Mendes (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th
136, 141.) Even if Plaintiffs had invoked the correct statute, such as the Bane
Civil Rights Act, Defendants argue that the claim would still fail because
Plaintiffs have not alleged facts showing any violation of a civil right or
law. Defendants contend that the refusal to provide security camera footage
does not violate any legal right, as Plaintiffs have no legal entitlement to
that footage without a subpoena or law enforcement demand. Additionally, both
Penal Code 422.6 and the Bane Act require that the alleged interference with
civil rights be motivated by characteristics such as race or gender, which
Plaintiffs have not alleged. Without claims of “hate motivation” or any
violation of a specific legal right, Defendants argue that the cause of action
should be dismissed in its entirety without leave to amend.
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the claim
fails as a matter of law.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the policy withholding victim’s civil rights to obtain
evidence claim. 
                    C.      Concealment
of Someone’s Evidence
Defendants argue that the
Concealment of Someone’s Evidence claim under California Penal Code 135 fails
because there are no specific facts alleged against Symphony, meaning the claim
against this defendant is insufficient. Also, Defendants state that Penal Code
135 is a criminal statute that criminalizes the willful destruction,
concealment, or erasure of evidence meant to be used in an official trial or
investigation. The statute does not confer a private right of action for civil
claims. Additionally, Defendants emphasize that there is no recognized civil
cause of action for concealment or spoliation of evidence under California law.
Courts have repeatedly declined to recognize such a tort because it would lead
to burdensome litigation over speculative losses and impose costly evidence
retention policies. (Agnew v. Parks (1959)
172 Cal.App.2d 756, 343.) Instead, sanctions or evidentiary instructions are
the appropriate remedies for spoliation of evidence in ongoing litigation. 
Even if a private right
of action existed, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege facts that
meet the requirements of Penal Code 135. The mere refusal to hand over private
security footage does not amount to the “concealment, destruction, or erasure”
of evidence. Additionally, Plaintiffs do not allege that the supposed
concealment occurred when the evidence was about to be produced for a legal
proceeding or investigation authorized by law, as required by the statute.
Moreover, Plaintiffs fail to allege the necessary intent on Defendants’ part to
conceal evidence. 
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the claim
fails as a matter of law.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the concealment of someone’s evidence claim. 
                    D.      Contract
Forgery
Defendants argue that the
cause of action for Contract Forgery under California Penal Code 470 fails
because no specific facts have been alleged against Symphony, and the FAC does
not reference any contract or specific act of forgery by any Defendant, which
is critical to establishing a forgery claim. Since no contract is mentioned,
Defendants assert that the demurrer should be sustained on this ground alone. Furthermore,
Defendants point out that fraud claims must be pled with particularity,
providing detailed facts to support the claim, which Plaintiffs fail to do.
Even if Plaintiffs were trying to assert a fraud cause of action outside the
scope of the penal code, they still lack the necessary specificity. Defendants
also emphasize that Penal Code 470 is a criminal statute and does not provide a
private right of action for civil claims. Even if it did, Plaintiffs have not
alleged any facts showing forgery of a document as required by the statute. 
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the claim
fails as a matter of law.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the contract forgery claim. 
          E.       Working Together in Conspiracy
Defendants argue that the
Working Together in Conspiracy under California Penal Code 182 claim fails
because no specific facts have been alleged against Symphony, and no facts are
presented to show that Defendants conspired together to commit any crime.
Defendants emphasize that Penal Code 182 is a criminal statute and does not
provide a private right of action for civil claims. Even if Plaintiffs were
attempting to assert civil conspiracy, Defendants argue that this cause of
action should still be dismissed because conspiracy is not a standalone cause
of action under California law. Instead, conspiracy is a legal doctrine used to
impose liability on individuals who share a common plan with a tortfeasor but
did not commit the tort themselves. Since conspiracy is not a separate tort and
Plaintiffs cannot remedy this defect through amendment.
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the claim
fails as a matter of law.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the working together conspiracy claim.
                    F.       Housing
Discrimination
Defendants argue that the
Housing Discrimination claim under California Penal Code section 745 fails
because Penal Code section 745 pertains to prohibiting convictions or sentences
based on race, ethnicity, or national origin in criminal cases and applies to
individuals such as judges, attorneys, law enforcement, and expert witnesses
involved in a criminal case. Defendants point out that they do not fall under
any of these categories, and Plaintiffs have not alleged facts to suggest
otherwise. Moreover, the statute does not provide a private right of action for
civil claims. Defendants further argue that, even if the Court interpreted
Plaintiffs’ claim as one under civil discrimination laws, Plaintiffs have
failed to allege any specific facts indicating discrimination by Defendants. As
such, the cause of action does not apply to the Defendants or the facts of this
case, and it cannot be cured by amendment. 
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the claim
fails as a matter of law.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the housing discrimination claim.
G.      Poisoning Someone’s Animal;
Grand Theft Auto; Damaging Someone’s Property
Defendants argue that
Plaintiffs’ second, third, and sixth causes of action for Poisoning Someone’s
Animal (CA Penal Code 596), Grand Theft Auto (CA Penal Code 487), and Damaging
Someone’s Property (CA Penal Code 594) should be dismissed for failure to state
a valid claim. Defendants note that these claims are directed only at
Rosenburg, not Symphony, and Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient facts or
clarity to support these causes of action. Defendants state that Penal Code
section 596, regarding animal poisoning, does not provide a private right of
action. Even if it did, Plaintiffs fail to allege that Rosenburg was
responsible for poisoning the dog, and they do not provide the required elements
of non-consent and willful intent. 
Similarly, Penal Code
sections 487 (Grand Theft Auto) and 594 (Damaging Someone's Property) also do
not confer a private right of action. Defendants assert that Plaintiffs’ vague
allegations do not specify how Rosenburg was involved in the theft or damage to
their property, including the stolen vehicle. Plaintiffs merely state that
their vehicle was stolen and damaged but provide no facts linking this to
Rosenburg. The claim regarding property damage is equally vague, and Plaintiffs
do not allege specific facts against Rosenburg for damaging their automobile or
any other property. As such, Defendants argue that these causes of action lack
the necessary details to proceed and must also be dismissed without leave to
amend.
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the claim
fails as a matter of law.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the claims for poisoning someone’s animal, grand theft
auto, and damaging someone’s property.
                    H.      Negligence
Tort of Habitability on Premises
Defendants argue that the
Negligence Tort of Habitability on Premises under California Penal Code 1714 fails
because there is no Penal Code section 1714, making it unclear what legal basis
Plaintiffs are relying on. Defendants state that this uncertainty alone
justifies dismissing the cause of action without leave to amend, as it does not
state a proper legal claim. Additionally, Defendants argue that even if the Court
were to infer a cause of action, such as a claim for breach of the implied
warranty of habitability or general negligence, Plaintiffs fail to allege any
of the necessary elements for such a claim. There are no specific facts
regarding the habitability of the premises or any substantial negligence by
Rosenburg. Plaintiffs mention potential issues like broken hardware and mold,
but they also acknowledge that Rosenburg attempted to fix these problems, which
Plaintiffs themselves found “inconvenient.” Defendants assert that these
allegations are insufficient to constitute a valid cause of action. 
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the claim
fails as a matter of law.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the negligence tort of habitability on premises claim. 
                    I.        Crime
by Poisoning Someone’s Food or Drink
Defendants argue the
Crime by Poisoning Someone’s Food or Drink under California Penal Code 347 claim
fails because Penal Code 347 does not provide a private right of action.
Defendants state that this legal defect cannot be remedied through amendment. Moreover,
Defendants argue that the Court should not attempt to infer any civil cause of
action, such as battery, emotional distress, or assault, because Plaintiffs
have not clearly indicated which tort or legal theory they are pursuing. Even
if a tort were inferred, Plaintiffs fail to allege the necessary elements for
any such claim. Additionally, the allegations are vague, lacking specific
details like dates, times, or locations of the alleged conduct, further
supporting dismissal. 
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the claim
fails as a matter of law.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the crime by poisoning someone’s food or drink claim. 
                    J.       Hiring Someone to Push
Defendants argue that the
Hiring Someone to Push (second degree battery) claim under California Penal
Code 242 fails because Penal Code 242, which defines battery, does not provide
a private right of action, and this defect cannot be corrected through
amendment. Even if the Court were to infer a civil battery claim, Defendants
argue that Plaintiffs have failed to allege the necessary elements, such as
lack of consent, causation, and damages. Plaintiffs only state that a stranger
pushed them, causing injury, but by their own admission, this act was committed
by someone unrelated to the Defendants. Since Plaintiffs admit the conduct was
done by a stranger and not by Rosenburg, Defendants argue that the cause of
action is unsupported and should be dismissed without leave to amend.
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the claim
fails as a matter of law.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the hiring someone to push claim.
                    K.      Racketeering
and Criminal Profiteering
Defendants argue that the
Racketeering and Criminal Profiteering claim under California Penal Code 186 fails
because Penal Code 186, part of the California Control of Profits of Organized
Crime Act, does not provide a private right of action for civil claims. The
statute is intended for use by prosecutors, and Plaintiffs cannot rely on it to
bring a civil lawsuit. Defendants state this legal defect cannot be cured. Even
if a private right of action existed, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to
allege sufficient facts to support claims of racketeering or criminal profiteering.
No specific facts are alleged against Symphony, and the complaint lacks any
allegations that Defendants engaged in a “pattern of criminal profiteering
activity,” as required by the statute. Plaintiffs do not identify any predicate
offenses or provide the necessary details to establish racketeering or
conspiracy. The claims are vague, lacking specificity about time, place, or the
nature of the alleged conduct.
Furthermore, if the Court
were to interpret Plaintiffs’ claims as RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act) claims, Defendants state that the burden of pleading would
be even higher. Plaintiffs would need to allege at least two related predicate
acts of racketeering and show that Defendants’ actions caused a concrete
financial loss. Plaintiffs fail to meet these requirements, as they only allege
emotional distress without demonstrating any direct financial loss caused by
Defendants. 
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the claim
fails as a matter of law.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the racketeering and criminal profiteering.
                    L.       Injunctive
Relief
Defendants argue that the
cause of action for injunctive relief, referencing California Penal Code 422.6,
should be dismissed for failure to state a valid claim. They contend that the
claim is unclear, as it does not specify what remedy Plaintiffs are seeking
through injunctive relief, nor does it provide sufficient facts to articulate a
coherent cause of action. The allegations are vague, lacking clarity, and do
not meet the legal standards required to state a claim. Additionally,
Defendants reiterate that Penal Code 422.6, which Plaintiffs reference, does
not support a private right of action, as discussed previously. Given the
uncertainty and inadequacy of the claim, Defendants request that it be
dismissed without leave to amend.
Plaintiffs provide no
arguments in opposition and fail to show that they may remedy the deficiency by
amending the claims. The Court finds that Defendants have shown that the claim
fails as a matter of law.
Thus, the Court SUSTAINS
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND the injunctive relief claim. 
 
IV.
