Summary:
The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff, Jeffrey Ito, filed a complaint and summons against the University of Southern California (USC), but named the defendant as "USC Department of Public Safety", which is not a proper party. The plaintiff failed to meet his burden to demonstrate proper service on the defendant, as the person served, Marva Miguel, was not authorized to accept service on behalf of USC. The judge held that service must be made on a person authorized by the corporation to receive service of process, and that Marva Miguel was not such a person. Therefore, the defendant's motion to quash is granted.
