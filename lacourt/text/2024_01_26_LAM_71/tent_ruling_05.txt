[1] The Court notes the caption on Plaintiff’s SAC
indicates the existence of this cause of action, but the body of the SAC does
not include this cause of action.  In
fact, the SAC labels the 5th cause of action as violation of the Unruh Civil
Rights Act.  To avoid confusion, the
Court labels the causes of action in Plaintiff’s SAC as it is numbered in the
caption of the SAC rather than the numbering reflected in the body of the
pleading.


[2] The Court notes Defendants do not demur to the 10th
cause of action.
