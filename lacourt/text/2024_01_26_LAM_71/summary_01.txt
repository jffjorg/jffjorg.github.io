The court has granted WWC Holdings, LLC's counsel, Michael Narvid's, motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on January 2, 2024, and the court has determined that there is no prejudice to the client and that the orderly process of justice will not be disrupted. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw and will grant the motion as long as the requirements of California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 are met. The court has reviewed the completed forms (MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053) and the declaration submitted by counsel stating that there is a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The court has also confirmed that WWC was served with copies of the motion papers and has confirmed its current address via the California Secretary of State records and the principal's email signature block.
