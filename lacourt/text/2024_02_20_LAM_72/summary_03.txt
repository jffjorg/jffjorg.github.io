And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case files and issued a tentative ruling in the matter of Jorge Hernandez Verdel vs. General Motors LLC. Plaintiff Jorge Hernandez Verdel is seeking a person most qualified (PMQ) on certain topics and production of documents reflected in each of the categories attached to the deposition notice. Plaintiff is also seeking $1,860 in discovery sanctions.

The judge grants Plaintiff's motion as set forth below. Defendant General Motors LLC shall produce a PMQ and responsive documents within 30 days. Defendant shall also pay Plaintiff's counsel $1,860 in attorney's fees within 30 days.

The judge agrees with Plaintiff that Defendant must produce a PMQ and documents as set forth below. However, the judge finds that Defendant's request for document production is vague and overbroad, and therefore does not require further production.

The judge also grants Plaintiff's request for discovery sanctions in the amount of $1,860, finding that Defendant is a frequent litigant in Lemon Law cases and is subject to frequent discovery motions and requests for discovery sanctions. The judge notes that imposition of sanctions is mandatory under California law unless the court finds that the defendant acted with substantial justification or there are other special circumstances.
