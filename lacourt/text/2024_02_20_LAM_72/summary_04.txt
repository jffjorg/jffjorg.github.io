And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge grants the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by Defendants Nancy Le and Diego Rivera. The Judge finds that the process server's attempts to serve the summons and complaint were defective, and therefore, the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Defendants. The Judge concludes that the proof of service filed by Plaintiff is defective in several respects, including the lack of a date or time of service, the failure to attach a declaration of reasonable diligence, and the failure to show that the process server mailed a copy of the complaint or summons to the Defendants. As a result, the Judge grants the Defendants' motion to quash service of summons and complaint.
