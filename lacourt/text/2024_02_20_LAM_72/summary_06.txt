And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Mares' request to vacate default entered on October 10, 2023, finding that Mares made a simple calculation error and filed her answer just a few days late. The Judge credits Mares' testimony that the error was due to her understanding of when she was served. The Judge denies the request for relief to BHL, finding that BHL must be represented by counsel and cannot make this motion on its own behalf. The Judge sets an OSC re Entry of Default Judgment against BHL for May 1, 2024, and continues the Case Management Conference to that date.
