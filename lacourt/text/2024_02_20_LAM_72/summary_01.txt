And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of JORGE PINA ALONSO, et al. v. KIA MOTORS AMERICA, INC. The Defendant has moved for judgment on the pleadings on the fourth cause of action, which alleges fraudulent concealment. The Court has denied this motion.

The Court has found that the Defendant's argument that the plaintiff's claim is preempted by federal law is without merit. The federal regulations governing the disclosure of vehicle information do not apply to the Defendant's failure to disclose information about the engine's defects to the plaintiff. The Court has also found that the plaintiff's claim is not preempted by federal law, even if the Defendant had reported information about the engine's defects to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

The Court has also found that the plaintiff's complaint adequately alleges the elements of fraud, including a misrepresentation, scienter, intent to induce reliance, justifiable reliance, and resulting damage. The Court has denied the Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and has allowed the plaintiff's claim to proceed.
