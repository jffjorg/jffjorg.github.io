```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by PRBC against SGPV is sustained without leave to amend. The judge found that PRBC's claims for equitable indemnity, declaratory relief, contribution, and implied indemnity are all defective and fail to state a cause of action. The judge concluded that SGPV is not obligated to indemnify PRBC for commission payments made to a third-party broker, as those payments are not the same as the commissions owed to Plaintiff. The judge also ruled that PRBC's declaratory relief claim is derivative of the equitable indemnity claim and fails to state a cause of action. The judge's tentative ruling is final unless one or both parties file a timely notice of intent to appear at the hearing and request a trial on the issue.
