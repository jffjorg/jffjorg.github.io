And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion for sanctions filed by the plaintiffs against Kia America, Inc., which claims that the defendant failed to comply with a discovery order issued on September 16, 2022. The plaintiffs contend that the defendant failed to provide verified, code-compliant responses to their request for production of documents and did not produce technical service bulletins TRA085, TRA083, and TRA098, which are relevant to the transmission defect in the 2020 Kia Optima. The defendant argues that the technical service bulletins were not applicable to the subject vehicle and therefore were not subject to the court's discovery order. The court finds that the circumstances do not warrant terminating sanctions, but orders the parties to be prepared to discuss the appropriateness of proposed issue and evidentiary sanctions during the hearing.
