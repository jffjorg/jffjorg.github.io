Defendant Shmuel Erde has moved for leave to file a cross-complaint against former Defendant Balboa LLC, Plaintiff Cartwright, and Dolores Golden. The motion is granted because the cross-defendants have not responded to discovery and the Court has previously noted that Defendant would need to seek leave to file a cross-complaint to allege claims against Balboa. The Court will allow leave to file a cross-complaint and Defendant Erde is ordered to notice the parties. The Court considers the moving papers and has received no opposition to the motion.
