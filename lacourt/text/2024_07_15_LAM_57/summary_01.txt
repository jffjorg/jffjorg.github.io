And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted in part Michael Pircher's motion to quash a business records deposition subpoena issued by Kevin Wheaton and Believable Bluff, LLC. The subpoena sought records from Pircher's former counsel, Bergkivst Bergkvist & Carter, LLP (BBC), which Pircher claims are protected by the attorney-client privilege. The court ruled that Pircher waived the attorney-client privilege with respect to one communication between himself and his counsel, Paul Carter, during a deposition earlier this year. However, the court held that Pircher did not waive the privilege as to other communications between himself and BBC, and therefore granted the motion to quash the subpoena to the extent it seeks to shield those communications from disclosure. The court denied Pircher's request for sanctions against Wheaton and Believable Bluff for issuing the subpoena, finding that they had a reasonable basis for doing so.
