TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Defendant Pilar Devries’ Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment; and Request for Sanctions is DENIED.
 
                                                                                                                                
ANALYSIS:
 
On September 14, 2022, Plaintiff Antonio E. Banda, Jr. (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendant Lloyd Vernis (“Defendant”).
Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered
default on November 1, 2022 and default judgment on January 4, 2023. 
 
Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment on January 12, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on January
26, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to vacate the entry of default pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which states that an
application for relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the
order from which relief is sought and must be accompanied by an affidavit of
fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect of the moving
party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON
Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) The motion must also be
accompanied by a copy of the moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be corrected if Defendant submits a proposed
responsive pleading by the hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel,
Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
The instant Motion was not timely filed within six months of
entry of default on November 1, 2022 or default judgment entered on January 4,
2023. The six-month deadline is jurisdictional and not subject to tolling. (Manson,
Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) Therefore,
Defendant cannot obtain relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (b). 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Lloyd Vernis’ Motion to Vacate Default and Default
Judgment is DENIED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
