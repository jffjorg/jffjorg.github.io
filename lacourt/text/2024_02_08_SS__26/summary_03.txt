And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Lloyd Vernis' Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment. The motion was filed late, more than six months after the entry of default and default judgment. According to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), a motion to vacate must be filed within six months of the entry of the order from which relief is sought. The Judge also notes that the six-month deadline is jurisdictional and not subject to tolling. Therefore, the motion is denied, and the default judgment will stand.
