ANALYSIS:
 
On July 6, 2021, an arbitrator issued an Arbitration Award
in favor of Wasserman Media Group, LLC (“Petitioner”) and against Paul Lo Duca
(“Respondent”). On August 3, 2021, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award (the “Petition”). The Court set the Petition for
hearing on December 7, 2021 and ordered Petitioner to give notice. (Notice of
Hearing, 08/03/21.) On November 2, 2021, the Court continued the hearing to
March 17, 2022. (Notice of Continuance, 11/02/21.) On March 4, 2022, Petitioner
filed an Application for Publication, based on multiple failed attempts to
serve Respondent. (See Fieldsted Decl. ¶¶ 4-8.) On March 8, 2022, the court
rejected Petitioner’s Application for Publication because Petitioner had not
demonstrated diligence in its service attempts. (See Notice of Rejection,
3/8/22.) 
 
The Petition came for hearing on March 17, 2022 and was
continued again to September 13, 2022. Petitioner filed Proof of Personal
Service on April 7, 2022. Following the lack of any responsive pleading from
Respondent, the Court entered Respondent’s default on May 19, 2022. The
Petition came for hearing on September 13, 2022. Only Petitioner appeared and
the minute order reflects that the Petition was granted. (Minute Order,
09/13/22.) Petitioner was ordered to file and serve a proposed judgment within
ten days of the order. (Ibid.)
 
No proposed judgment was filed and after more than a year,
Petitioner filed the instant Motion to Correct Order and Place Petition Back on
Calendar on November 28, 2023. No opposition to the Motion has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
The motion is brought pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), under which courts have
inherent powers to correct orders by a nunc pro tunc order where there has been
clerical error by clerk or by the judge himself, or where some provision of, or
omission from, order or judgment was due to inadvertence, or mistake of court.
(Lane v. Superior Court of Siskiyou County (1950) 98 Cal App 2d 165,
219; Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).)

 
The Motion is supported by the declaration of Petitioner’s counsel, who
states that they learned the wrong “Paul Lo Duca” may have been served.
(Motion, Fieldsted Decl., ¶¶4-5.) Upon appearing at the hearing on September
13, 2023, Petitioner’s counsel informed the Court of the service issue and
requested a continuance of the hearing to allow for service on the correct
respondent; the Court continued the hearing to December 1, 2023 and ordered
Petitioner to give notice. (Id. at ¶6 and Exh. 1.) Notice of the continued
hearing date was served on Respondent but never filed. (Ibid.)
 
In December 2022, Petitioner discovered that the minute order did not
reflect the continuance and sought to reset the Petition for hearing in August
2023. (Id. at ¶¶7-9 and Exhs. 3-4.) Petitioner now brings the instant
Motion to Correct Order and Place Petition Back on Calendar.
 
Petitioner’s evidence demonstrates that the order dated September 13,
2022 contains a clerical error by granting the Petition instead of continuing
the hearing date. Accordingly, the order is corrected nunc pro tunc to reflect
the continuance of the hearing date. The Court sets the hearing date on the
Petition for May 9, 2024 at 8:30 am in Department 26 in the Spring Street
Courthouse. By April 4, 2024, Petitioner is to file proof of service of the
Petition and Notice of Hearing Date in accordance with the statutory
requirements.
 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner Wasserman Media Group, LLC’s Motion to Correct Order
and Place Petition Back on Calendar is
GRANTED. THE SEPTEMBER 13, 2022 MINUTE ORDER IS CORRECTED NUNC PRO TUNC TO
REFLECT A CONTINUANCE OF THE HEARING DATE ON THE PETITION. THE COURT SETS THE
HEARING DATE ON THE PETITION FOR MAY 9, 2024 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE
SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY APRIL 4, 2024, PETITIONER IS TO FILE PROOF OF
SERVICE OF THE PETITION AND NOTICE OF THE HEARING DATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS.
