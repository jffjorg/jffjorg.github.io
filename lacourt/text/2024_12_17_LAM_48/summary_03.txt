Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motions to strike the third amended complaint (TAC) filed by the plaintiff, Jia Chen, and grants the plaintiff permission to file the late complaint. The judge finds that the TAC alleges sufficient facts for fraudulent inducement and that the defendants have shown no prejudice caused by the TAC's late filing. The judge also warns against incivility in legal proceedings, citing the defendants' inflammatory and unwarranted statements about opposing counsel.
