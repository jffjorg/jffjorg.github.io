[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING APPLICATION FOR
  SUBSTITUTED SERVICE ON SECRETARY OF STATE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 17, 2024



 
On May 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
this action against Defendant Frobb West 17th Street LLC and others.
On
October 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Application for Service on Secretary of State
on Behalf of Defendant.
If
a corporation’s agent designated for service of process cannot with reasonable diligence
be found at the address designated for personally delivering the process, and it
is shown by affidavit that the domestic corporation cannot be served in accordance
with Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.10, 415.20, 416.10, or 416.20, the court
may order service on the Secretary of State. 
(Corp. Code, § 1702, subd. (a).)
Plaintiffs’
counsel determined that Alex Finkel was Defendant’s registered agent, located at
903 24th Street, Santa Monica, CA 90403. 
(Malco Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. B.)  Plaintiffs’
process server attempted service on June 13 and 18, 2024, but the occupant said
that “subject and agent are unknown and do not reside here.”  (Malco Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. C.)  Counsel discovered another resident for Alex Finkle
in Boulder, Colorado.  (Malco Decl. ¶ 6.)  The process server was told that “the subject
and agent are unknown and do not reside” there. 
(Malco Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. D.)
Counsel
then attempted to serve Defendant’s managing partners at 2217 Fox Hills Drive, Los
Angeles, CA 90064.  (Malco Decl. ¶ 7 &
Ex. E.)  The process server made eight attempts
at service from July 12 to July 29, 2024. 
(Malco Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. F.)  At
an unsuccessful stakeout on August 9, 2024, a woman told
the process server through the intercom that she did not know the subjects and hung
up.  (Malco Decl. ¶ 9 & Ex. G.)  Additional unanswered attempts were made on September
7, 2024, September 10, 2024, September 15, 2024, September 20, 2024, and October
7, 2024.  (Malco Decl. ¶ 10 & Ex. H.)
On
August 28, 2024, counsel mailed the Summons and Complaint along with copies of the
Notice of Acknowledgment and Receipt to Defendant’s registered address, but the
Notice of Acknowledgment has not been returned. 
(Malco Decl. ¶¶ 11-12 & Ex. I.)
Plaintiffs
have shown that the agent designated for service of process could not with reasonable
diligence be found at the address designated for personally delivering the process,
and Defendant cannot be served through other means.
Accordingly,
the Application for Service on Secretary of State is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
