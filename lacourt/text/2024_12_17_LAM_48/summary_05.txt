And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses from the defendant in response to discovery requests. The defendant had provided responses that were deemed insufficient by the plaintiff, and the defendant's objections to jurisdiction and standing were deemed improper. The judge ordered the defendant to provide supplemental responses within 30 days. The parties are required to send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative ruling, and if all parties submit, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also scheduled.
