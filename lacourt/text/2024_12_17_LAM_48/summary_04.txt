And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' renewed motion to designate the case as complex. The defendants had argued that the case requires exceptional judicial management due to its complexity, citing issues related to the CARES Act and the volume of documentary evidence. However, the Judge did not find these arguments convincing, noting that the case is almost two years old and has been managed without issue to date. The Judge also pointed out that the defendants have not produced a substantial amount of evidence, and that the parties can deal with privacy issues related to third-party health information through a stipulated protective order. As a result, the Judge denied the motion and scheduled a jury trial for July 7, 2025.
