Summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant General Motors LLC's motion for summary judgment. The court finds that Plaintiffs Richard C. Gallegos and Christina L. Gallegos cannot maintain claims under the Song-Beverly Act and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act because they purchased a used vehicle and Defendant did not issue or provide any new or additional warranty coverage to Plaintiffs or the vehicle. The court also finds that Defendant is not liable for breach of implied warranty because it is only a manufacturer and not a distributor or seller of the used vehicle. The court grants summary adjudication of all claims and orders Defendant to submit a proposed judgment within 5 days.
