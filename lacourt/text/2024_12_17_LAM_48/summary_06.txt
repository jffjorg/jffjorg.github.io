And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling granting an application for substituted service on the Secretary of State. The case involves Monica Santizo and others (plaintiffs) suing Pico Portfolio LP, et al., and Frobb West 17th Street LLC (defendants). The plaintiffs' counsel attempted to serve process on the defendants' registered agent, Alex Finkel, at his designated address, but was unsuccessful. They then attempted to serve the managing partners at a different address, but were also unsuccessful. The court has determined that the agent designated for service of process could not be found with reasonable diligence, and therefore grants the application for service on the Secretary of State. The notice of acknowledgment has not been returned.
