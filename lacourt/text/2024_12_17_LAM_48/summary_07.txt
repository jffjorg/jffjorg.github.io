And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the plaintiffs' motion to seal certain exhibits in the case. The exhibits, which are a Co-Production Deal Memo and a Writer Agreement, contain confidential and commercially sensitive information that was not necessary to resolve the anti-SLAPP motion. The judge finds that the confidentiality concern is an overriding interest that outweighs the public's right to access the information, and that sealing the exhibits is necessary to protect this interest. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to provide notice of the sealing and has granted the motion to seal.
