On July 9, 2024,
Plaintiffs served Defendant Oscar Moquete with their Requests for Admission,
Set One. The responses were due on August 9, 2024. As of August 15, 2024, when
the present motion was filed, Defendant Oscar Moquete had not responded to
Plaintiffs’ Requests for Admission, Set One. Plaintiff now moves the Court to
deem the contents of their Requests for Admission, Set One, as admitted against
Defendant Moquete. It is undisputed that Defendant did not provide the
discovery responses prior to the statutory deadline, nor was any opposition
filed indicating to the Court that responses were served before the hearing.
Accordingly, the present motion is granted, and the contents of Plaintiffs'
Requests for Admission, Set One, are deemed admitted against Defendant Oscar
Moquete.
