Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint and has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the first cause of action for battery and the tenth cause of action for negligent violation of statutory duty to maintain habitable conditions. The judge has also granted the motion to strike paragraphs 62, 71, 78, 100, 101, 116, 117, and 136 of the complaint, as well as paragraphs 9 and 13 of the prayer for relief.

The judge has found that the plaintiff has adequately stated a prima facie claim for punitive damages, as the plaintiff has alleged malice and despicable conduct by the defendant. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has adequately alleged the elements of a civil battery, including intent, harmful or offensive contact, lack of consent, and harm or offense to a reasonable person.

The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
