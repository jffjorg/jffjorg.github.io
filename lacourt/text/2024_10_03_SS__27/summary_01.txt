And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to consolidate the case with related cases and to continue the trial. The defendant failed to comply with the requirements of California Rule of Court 3.350, which includes providing a notice of motion that lists all named parties, includes the captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, and is filed in each case. The judge also denied the request for a continuance because the defendant did not provide sufficient information about the status of written discovery and depositions in the related cases, nor did they explain how incomplete discovery would impact the lead case. The judge noted that the defendant had failed to articulate good cause for the continuance and did not address the factors for a trial continuance under California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c) and (d).
