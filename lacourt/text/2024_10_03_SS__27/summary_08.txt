And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer and motion to strike the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Christian Haywood, are granted. The plaintiff filed a handwritten complaint alleging medical malpractice or negligence against Cedars Sinai, but the complaint is uncertain and lacks jurisdictional allegations, specific damages, and the plaintiff's signature. The judge finds that the complaint is so uncertain that the defendant cannot reasonably respond, and that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to support a cause of action. The judge is granting the demurrer and motion to strike the complaint, but is giving the plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint within 20 days.
