And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Marco Nicolas vs. Gerardo Zamora, et al. The case involves a vehicle collision and a dispute over discovery requests. The plaintiff, Marco Nicolas, served the defendants with form interrogatories and special interrogatories, but the defendants only provided objection-only responses. The plaintiff then filed a motion to compel further responses, which the defendants opposed. The defendants claimed that their responses were timely, but the judge found that their calculations for the due date were incorrect. The judge granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses, but found that the motions were moot since the defendants had already provided further responses. The judge also awarded the plaintiff sanctions against the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $3000.
