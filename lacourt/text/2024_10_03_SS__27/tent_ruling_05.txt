 Case Number:  22STCV33554    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2024    Dept:  27 Hon. Lee S. Arian, Dept 27
 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
Hearing Date: 10/3/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV33554 FABIAN SALGADO vs
JILLIAN DUDLEY et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel Lauren A. Landau
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED IS CONTINUED
 
Attorney Lauren A. Landau represents Plaintiff
Yurid Chaves-Ramirez and now moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an
irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. No opposition has
been filed. Landau has submitted Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion
and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). A breakdown in
the attorney-client relationship is a proper ground for withdrawal. (See Estate
of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 [a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to
withdraw].) Counsel has also made reasonable efforts to obtain Plaintiff's
current mailing address. However, an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal is
scheduled for October 11, 2024. To avoid disrupting the orderly process of
justice, the motion is continued to October 11, 2024.
