INTRODUCTION
This
is an action arising from an infestation of bedbugs which plaintiff Shamim
Seifzadeh (Plaintiff) experienced in her apartment in October 2020. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant, the owner and manager of the apartment building, had
knowledge of the pre-existing insect infestations prior to leasing the
apartment to Plaintiff and did not inspect the apartment, eliminate bedbugs
from the apartment, or notify Plaintiff of the bedbugs’ presence. (Complaint,
¶¶ 5, 29-32.) Plaintiff also alleges that metal from a toilet handle fixture in
the apartment went into her fingernail during normal use, requiring medical
attention. (Complaint, ¶¶ 26-27.)

II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Meet and Confer¿ 
Before filing a demurrer or motion to
strike, the demurring and moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading sought to be stricken or demurred to, in person or
telephonically, for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer and motion to strike.¿ (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)¿ 
 
Demurrer¿ 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)¿ When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context.¿ (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)¿ In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿ (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿ “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters.¿ Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.”¿ (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.)¿ “The
only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it
stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”¿ (Hahn, supra, 147
Cal.App.4th at p. 747.)¿ The ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed
true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly
alleged.¿ (Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields v. County of
San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n demurrer, pleadings are read liberally and allegations
contained therein are assumed to be true.”])
“The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or
conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)¿
 
Motion to Strike¿ 
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof.¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., §
435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1322, subd. (b).)¿ The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42
Cal.2d 767, 782.)¿ 
In order to state a prima facie claim
for punitive damages, a complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the
general punitive damage statute, Civil Code section 3294.¿ (College. Hospital, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 721.)¿ These statutory elements include
allegations that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud or malice.¿ (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).)¿¿¿ 
“Malice is defined in the statute as
conduct intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”¿ (College Hospital, Inc., supra,
8 Cal.4th at p. 725 [examining Civ. Code, §
3294, subd. (c)(1)].)¿ “A conscious disregard of the safety of
others may constitute malice within the meaning of section 3294 of the Civil
Code. In order to justify an award of punitive damages on this basis, the
plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to
avoid those consequences.”¿ (Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890,
895-896.)¿

“As amended to include [despicable],
the statute plainly indicates that absent an intent to injure the plaintiff,
‘malice’ requires more than a ‘willful and conscious’ disregard of the
plaintiffs’ interests.¿ The additional component of ‘despicable
conduct’ must be found.”¿ (College Hospital, Inc., supra, 8 Cal.4th at
p. 725.)¿ The statute’s reference to despicable conduct represents a “new substantive limitation on punitive damage awards.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ Despicable conduct is “conduct which is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable,
wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by
ordinary decent people.¿ Such conduct has been described as ‘having the character of outrage frequently associated with
crime.’ ”¿ (Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co.
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1287.). Factors in assessing the degree of
reprehensibility of a defendant’s conduct are (1) whether the harm caused was
physical or merely economic; (2) whether the conduct demonstrated indifference
or reckless disregard for the health or safety of others; (3) the financial
vulnerability of the target; (4) whether the conduct occurred repeatedly or only
once; and (5) whether the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery,
or deceit, or was a mere accident. (Pfeifer v. John Crane, Inc. (2013)
220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1311, fn 12.) 
“In order to survive a motion to strike
an allegation of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to
such relief must be pled by a plaintiff.¿ [Citations.]¿ In passing on the correctness of a
ruling on a motion to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to
a motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their
truth.¿ [Citations.]¿ In ruling on a motion to strike,
courts do not read allegations in isolation.¿ [Citation.]”¿ (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)¿ “The mere allegation an intentional tort
was committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages.¿ [Citation.]¿ Not only must there be circumstances
of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to
support such a claim.¿ [Citation.]”¿ (Grieves v. Superior Court
(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166.)¿ 
“[T]he imposition of punitive damages
upon a corporation is based upon its own fault.¿ It is not imposed vicariously by
virtue of the fault of others.”¿ (City Products Corp. v. Globe
Indemnity Co. (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 31, 36.)¿ “Corporations
are legal entities which do not have minds capable of recklessness, wickedness,
or intent to injure or deceive.¿ An award of punitive damages against a corporation
therefore must rest on the malice of the corporation’s employees.¿ But the law does not impute every employee’s malice to the
corporation.¿
Instead, the punitive damages statute requires proof of malice among corporate
leaders:¿ the ‘officer[s],
director[s], or managing agent[s].’ ”¿ (Cruz v. Home Base (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 167
[citation omitted].)¿ As to ratification, “[a]
corporation cannot confirm and accept that which it does not actually know
about.”¿ (Id., at p. 168.) For
ratification sufficient to justify punitive damages against corporation, there
must be proof that officers, directors, or managing agents had actual knowledge
of the malicious conduct and its outrageous character. (College Hospital,
Inc., supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 726.)¿
 
III.    DISCUSSION  
 
Meet
and Confer¿ 
The
Court finds Defendant has filed code-compliant meet and confer declarations for
both the demurrer and the motion to strike.¿
(See Kahn Decl. ISO MTS, ¶¶
5-6; Kahn Decl. ISO Demurrer ¶¶ 5-7.) 
 
Demurrer
Defendant
has demurred to Plaintiff’s first cause of action for battery, eighth cause of
action for violation of Civil Code section 1941.3, ninth cause of action for
violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, and tenth cause of action for negligent
violation of statutory duty to Plaintiff.
 
 
          Demurrer – First Cause of Action –
Battery
The
elements of a civil battery are: (1) the defendant acted with intent to cause
harmful or offensive contact, (2) the act resulted in a harmful or offensive
contact with the plaintiff’s person, (3) the plaintiff did not consent to the
contact, and (4) a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position would have
been harmed or offended by the contact. (So v. Shin (2013) 212
Cal.App.4th 652, 669.) 
The
Court finds that Plaintiff has not stated a claim for civil battery. The
complaint includes a statement that Defendant’s “intentional, deliberate, and
reckless actions… cause Plaintiff to be touched by bedbug infestation and other
uninhabitable conditions.” (Complaint, ¶ 44.) However, this is a conclusory
allegation that the Court need not credit. The complaint further alleges that
Defendant’s intent is evidenced by its actions in failing to properly and
thoroughly inspect the apartment to ensure that the apartment was free from
bedbugs, thereby demonstrating wanton and reckless misconduct (Complaint, ¶ 45;
Opp. to Demurrer, p. 7.) However, reckless conduct alone does not constitute a
sufficient basis for battery, unless an act “inherently dangerous to others is
committed with a conscious disregard of human life and safety” such that the
act transcends recklessness. (People v. Martinez (1977) 75 Cal.App.3d
859, 863.) Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendant acted with a conscious
disregard of human life and safety. Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to allege
the intent element of battery and has failed to state a claim for civil
battery.
Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s first cause of action is SUSTAINED, with leave to
amend.
 
Demurrer
– Eighth Cause of Action – Violation of Civil Code Section 1941.3
          Plaintiff
has stated in her opposition that, due to attorney error, she mistakenly
alleged Civil Code section 1941.3 as a cause of action when she intended to
allege Civil Code section 1942.3.
Defendant’s
demurrer to Plaintiff’s eighth cause of action is SUSTAINED, with leave to
amend.
 
Demurrer
– Ninth Cause of Action – Violation of Civil Code Section 1942.3
Civil
Code section 1942.3 states that a landlord of a dwelling “may not demand rent,
collect rent, issue a notice of a rent increase, or issue a three-day notice to
pay rent or quit if all of the following conditions are met:
(1)
The dwelling substantially lacks any of the affirmative standard
characteristics listed in Section 1941.1 or violates Section 17920.10 of the
Health and Safety Code, or is deemed and declared substandard as set forth in
Section 17920.3 of the Health and Safety Code...
(2)
A public officer or employee who is responsible for the enforcement of any
housing law, after inspecting the premises, has notified the landlord or the
landlord's agent in writing of his or her obligations to abate the nuisance or
repair the substandard conditions.
(3)
The conditions have existed and have not been abated 35 days beyond the date of
service of the notice specified in paragraph (2) and the delay is without good
cause…
(4)
The conditions were not caused by an act or omission of the tenant or lessee in
violation of Section 1929 or 1941.2.”
The
complaint alleges that the apartment lacked at least one of the affirmative
standard characteristics listed in Civil Code section 1941.1 and Defendant
continued to collect rent even after being placed on notice of this condition,
and the condition was not cause by an act or omission of Plaintiff. (Complaint,
¶¶ 146, 148, 151.) However, Plaintiff does not allege that the condition
existed and was not abated 35 days beyond service of the notice without good
cause, nor does Plaintiff allege that a public officer or employee responsible
for the enforcement of any housing law inspected the premises and notified
Defendant in writing of its obligations to abate the condition. Therefore,
Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action for violation of Civil Code
section 1942.3.
Defendant’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the ninth cause of action, with leave to amend.
          
 
Demurrer
– Tenth Cause of Action – Negligent Violation of Statutory Duty to Maintain
Habitable Conditions
Plaintiff
has not alleged which statute Defendant has violated for this cause of action.
Plaintiff has therefore failed to state a cause of action for negligent
violation of a statutory duty to maintain habitable conditions.
Defendant’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED as to the tenth cause of action, with leave to amend.
 
Motion
to Strike
Defendant
seeks to strike paragraphs 52, 62, 71, 78, 100, 101, 116, 117, and 136 of the
complaint, as well as paragraphs 9 and 13 of the prayer for relief. The
majority of these are punitive damage allegations, while paragraph 62 of the
complaint is an allegation concerning section 40 of California State Housing
Law and a paragraph 13 of the prayer for relief requests attorneys’ fees.
Plaintiff
has not opposed the motion to strike as it pertains to paragraph 62 of the
complaint or paragraph 13 of the prayer for relief. Therefore, these paragraphs
are stricken.
          Punitive Damage Allegations
The
Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately stated a prima facie claim for
punitive damages. Plaintiff has adequately alleged malice as required by Civil
Code section 2394 because Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant deliberately and
recklessly failed to inspect Plaintiff’s apartment or provide notice to
Plaintiff of bedbug infestation despite having knowledge of existing
infestations. (Complaint, ¶ 38.) Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant has
fulfilled two of the five factors indicating despicable conduct by alleging
physical harm in the form of bedbug bites and recklessness to the health or
safety of others despite prior notice of a defective condition at the apartment.
(Complaint, ¶ 38.) 
Plaintiff
has further alleged that Defendant was aware of the bedbug infestations in the
apartment complex because of reports from other residents. (Complaint, ¶ 21.) Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant, a corporation, authorized or ratified the conduct of
their employees by permitting and tolerating a common practice and culture of
extreme indifference by employees and failing to implement adequate policies
and procedures to prevent bedbug infestations. (Complaint, ¶ 38.)
This
is sufficient to survive a motion to strike. Therefore, Defendant’s motion to
strike 52, 71, 78, 100, 101, 116, 117, and 136 of the complaint, as well as
paragraph 9 of the prayer for relief, is DENIED.

IV.     CONCLUSION
         Accordingly, the Court SUSTAINS the
Demurrer with leave to amend and GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the Motion
to Strike.
 

Moving party is ordered to give notice.

 
 
      Dated this 3rd day of October 2024
