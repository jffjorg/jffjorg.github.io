  Case Number:  21SMCV01883    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the ex parte
application, subject to hearing argument. 
The parties entered into a stipulation by which the defense was to pay
$1.1 million (mostly in installments). 
According to plaintiff, nothing was actually paid.  Plaintiff seeks entry of a judgment for $1.1
million, plus interest at 10% per annum from the date the first payment was
due.  The agreement has an acceleration
provision and expressly provided that the court retained jurisdiction under CCP
section 664.6.  The court sees no reason
not to enter judgment.  The court will,
however, inquire as to whether the full amount of $1.1 million is appropriate
as against the individual or whether that amount ought to be $500,000.
