And here is a brief English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is inclined to grant the plaintiff's ex parte application for a judgment, pending argument at the hearing. The case involves a stipulation agreement where the defendant was to pay $1.1 million in installments, but no payments were made. The plaintiff is seeking a judgment for the full amount, plus interest at 10% per annum. The judge believes that entering judgment is appropriate, but will consider whether the judgment should be for the full amount or a reduced amount of $500,000.
