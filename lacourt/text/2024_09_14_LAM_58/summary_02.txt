And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Guy T. Reid v. California Highway Patrol Officer Cindy Nevarez. The case involves a demurrer filed by the defendant, which challenges the sufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint. The judge has sustained the demurrer in its entirety, without leave to amend.

The plaintiff had filed a single cause of action for negligence against the defendant, but the judge has found that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The plaintiff has also failed to exhaust administrative remedies and comply with the claims statute.

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike as moot. The plaintiff's allegations do not defeat the several immunities that apply to a government official exercising her duties, and the defendant is immune from suit based on the facts alleged in the complaint.

The judge has considered the plaintiff's opposition and has opted to consider it despite the plaintiff's failure to timely serve and file it. However, the judge has found that the plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies and comply with the claims statute is a fatal defect that cannot be cured by amendment.
