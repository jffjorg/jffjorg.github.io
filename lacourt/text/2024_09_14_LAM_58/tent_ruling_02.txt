Motion:                       Demurrer
and Motion to Strike

California Highway Patrol Officer Cindy Nevarez, 022707

Guy T. Reid

 
Tentative Ruling:      Defendant’s
demurrer is sustained in its entirety, without leave to amend.
 
                                    Defendant’s motion to strike is
denied as moot.
 

             
            Plaintiff Guy T. Reid filed his
initial complaint against defendant California Highway Patrol Officer Cindy
Nevarez, 022707 on February 22, 2024, alleging a single cause of action for
negligence. 
 
On July 15, 2024,
the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the initial complaint.
 
On July 25, 2024,
Plaintiff filed his operative first amended complaint (“FAC”), still asserting
a cause of action for negligence.
 
On August 16,
2024, Defendant demurred to and moved to strike portions of Plaintiff’s FAC.
 
On September 3,
2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition. Defendant contends the opposition was not
served. (See 09-09-2024 Notice of Non-Opposition.)
 
On September 9,
2024, Defendant filed a Reply and Notice of Non-Opposition.
 
Demurrer
 
            A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30,
subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)  The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the
sufficiency of a pleading “by raising questions of law.”  (Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 280, 286.)  “In the
construction of a pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its
allegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice
between the parties.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . ..” ’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)
 
Timeliness
 
            Defendant contends
Plaintiff did not timely serve his opposition. (See 09-09-2024 Notice of
Non-Opposition.)
 
            Papers opposing a
demurrer or motion to strike must be filed and served within nine (9) court
days of the hearing. The hearing is September 16, 2024; Plaintiff was required
to file and serve no later than September 5, 2024. He did not. He filed his
papers on September 9, 2024, and per his proof of service, he served Defendant
by mail on that date. Neither was timely; service of opposition papers must be
“reasonably calculated to ensure delivery to the other party or parties not
later than the close of the next business day after the time the opposing
papers ... are filed.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005(c); cf. Blake v. Ecker
(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 728, 736, fn. 6 [service of opposition by regular mail on
filing date “arguably sufficient, particularly [where] both plaintiff’s
attorney and defendant’s attorney were in the same general area (Woodland Hills
and downtown Los Angeles)”].))
 
            Notwithstanding
Plaintiff’s failure to timely serve or file his opposition, the Court opts to
consider his papers in the interests of efficiency and disposition of this
matter on the merits. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1005(b) [“a judge ... may
prescribe a shorter time” for service in a law and motion matter].)
 
Discussion
 
            The demurrer is
sustained without leave to amend. Plaintiff has not cured the deficiencies
identified in his initial complaint. He has not shown he timely exhausted his
government claims requirements or he can overcome relevant government
immunities. His initial and amended pleadings demonstrate he cannot cure these
deficiencies by amendment, and he has not carried his burden to show otherwise.
 
            Plaintiff failed
to timely exhaust his administrative remedies.
 
            “[A] cause of action against a
public employee or former public employee for injury resulting from an act or
omission in the scope of his employment as a public employee is barred if an
action against the employing public entity is barred . . . .” (Gov. Code §
950.2.) “A cause of action for such injury may not be maintained against the
public employee or former public employee whose act or omission caused such
injury until the claim has been rejected, or has been deemed to have been
rejected, in whole or in part by the public entity.” (Gov. Code, § 950.6, subd.
(a).) “Timely claim presentation is not merely a procedural requirement, but
rather, a condition precedent to plaintiff’s maintaining an action against
defendant, and thus, an element of the plaintiff’s cause of action.” (K.J.
v. Arcadia Unified School Dist. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1238)
“Complaints that do not allege facts demonstrating either that a claim was
timely presented or that compliance with the claims statute is excused are
subject to a general demurrer for not stating facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action.” (Rubenstein v. Doe No. 1 (2017) 3 Cal.5th 903, 906.) And
the claim must be presented to the government within six months of a
plaintiff’s injury (with limited exceptions that do not apply here). (See Gov.
Code, §§ 950.6, 911.2, 901, 945.4, 950.2.)
 
            Along with his FAC Plaintiff submits
a citizen complaint form he filed with the California Highway Patrol, not a claim
for money damages. (See FAC, Exh. A.) The citizen complaint was filed in July
22, 2024, which is nearly two years after the incident underlying this suit
took place. (See ibid.; compare FAC, Exhs. C-D [incident dates 10/23/22,
10/24/22, and 12/23/22].) Plaintiff’s opposition to Defendant’s prior demurrer
suggested he filed a claim for money damages in May 2024 (07-01-24 Opp., Exh.
A) – again, long after the claims period lapsed. 
 
            Plaintiff failed to exhaust his
administrative remedies within the requisite claims period. The defect is
apparent from the fact of his complaint, previously noticed materials, and
exhibits he has submitted to the Court along with past filings. The demurrer
must be sustained without leave to amend.
 
Plaintiff’s
allegations do not defeat the several immunities that apply to a government
official exercising her duties.
 
            In its July 15, 2024
ruling, the Court observed that Defendant is immunized from liability for most
of the conduct Plaintiff alleges based on Government Code section 820.2
[exercise of vested discretion], section 821 [failure to enforce an enactment],
or to a lesser extent section 812 [failure to make an arrest]. The Court found
those sections did not apply to Plaintiff’s allegations that Defendant filed a
false incident report, but those allegations are barred by the immunity in
Government Code section 822.2 [misrepresentation in course of employment]. (See
07-15-24 Minute Order, at pp. 5-7 [sections 820.2, 812, and 821 do not bar
entire negligence claim, but “crux of the Complaint is Defendant writing a
false investigation report”, immunized under section 822.2].)
 
            Defendant is immune
from suit based on the facts Plaintiff has alleged, when those facts are
accepted as true. Plaintiff has done nothing to demonstrate he can plead around
immunity upon amendment. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend on
this separate, sufficient ground.
 
Motion to Strike
 
         The motion to strike is denied as moot.
