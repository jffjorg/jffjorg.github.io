And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to deny the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendants' second amended answer and the motion to strike portions of the second amended cross-complaint. The plaintiff, Natalya Vydrug, argues that the defendants' proof of service is defective, that their verifications are improper, and that they committed perjury. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's arguments are without merit. The Judge also finds that the defendants did not make "general denials" but rather answered each paragraph of the complaint. The Judge concludes that the plaintiff's motions are denied and that the defendants' second amended answer and cross-complaint are valid.
