And here is a brief English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Samer Habbas, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The motion is granted as the Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal, and there is no prejudice to the client or disruption to the orderly process of justice. The Court notes that the next hearing is an FSC set for April 1, 2025, which should be sufficient time for Plaintiff to retain new counsel.
