And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling regarding a motion to strike the expert designation of the defendant, Newhope Pines Apartments, in a personal injury case filed by Concepción Valadez. The plaintiff alleges that she fell from the stairs of the defendant's property and sustained severe injuries. The defendant failed to designate experts prior to the trial date, and the plaintiff served its expert designation on September 19, 2023. The defendant then served its expert designation on March 26, 2024, which the plaintiff argues is untimely.

The court finds that the defendant's expert designation was indeed untimely and grants the plaintiff's motion to strike it. The court also denies the defendant's motion to accept its expert designation, grant leave to submit a late expert designation, and reopen discovery. The court finds that the defendant failed to act diligently in designating its expert witnesses and did not demonstrate good cause for the delay.

The parties are notified that if they intend to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number. If the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
