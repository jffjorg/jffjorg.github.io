Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Caltrans' petition for relief from the provisions of Government Code Section 945.4, which requires a timely claim to be filed against a public entity. Caltrans failed to file a timely claim against the County of Los Angeles, but made a written application to the County for permission to file a claim, which was rejected. The Court finds that Caltrans was diligent in investigating and pursuing the claim, and a prudent person might have made the same error under similar circumstances. The Court grants relief under Government Code Section 946.6, which is a remedial statute intended to provide relief from technical rules. The Court's decision is based on the principle to hear cases on their merits, and the County's active denial of its involvement in the case.
