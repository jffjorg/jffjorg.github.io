And here is a brief summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Adam Kligfeld and Havi Kligfeld. The motion seeks to dismiss the plaintiff's claims for negligence and premises liability arising from a trip and fall on the sidewalk in front of the defendants' residence. The court has found that the defendants have failed to meet their initial burden of showing that the plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his claims. Additionally, the court has determined that the defendants have created a triable issue of fact regarding the creation of the displacement and have failed to show that the displacement was trivial. The court has scheduled a hearing to allow the parties to present further argument on the motion.
