And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Respondent's motion for leave to take a subsequent deposition of the Claimant, Daniel Geoulla. The Claimant has argued that the motion is deficient and that the Respondent has waited too long to take the deposition. However, the Judge has found that the Respondent has good cause to take the deposition, as the Claimant was involved in two subsequent accidents after the original accident and Dr. Fox's report noted changes in the Claimant's cervical spine. The Judge has also denied the Claimant's request for sanctions, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification. The hearing is scheduled for June 20, 2024.
