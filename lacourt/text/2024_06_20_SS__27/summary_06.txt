And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to file a second amended complaint filed by Randy Mejia and Lizbeth Vargas, plaintiffs, against Luis Valenzuela, defendant. The motion seeks to amend the pleading to reflect Lizbeth Vargas's new status as an adult after she turned 18 years old. The court clerk has not accepted and filed a summons due to the discrepancy between Lizbeth Vargas's actual age and the status listed in the first amended complaint. The court finds that there is no prejudice that will come into effect if the motion is granted, and that the amendment is necessary to enable service of process. The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1) and other relevant laws and cases to support its decision. The motion is granted, and the proposed amended pleading must be filed and served within five court days.
