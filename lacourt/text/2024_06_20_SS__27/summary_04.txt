And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel by plaintiff's attorney, Patricia A. Law. Law has filed a motion citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which the Court finds to be proper grounds for withdrawal. However, the Court notes that two motions for summary judgment are set for June 25 and 26, 2024, which are only five to six days away, and that withdrawing counsel at this time would be prejudicial or disrupt the orderly process of justice. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice. The parties are advised to submit via email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument, as the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court if no one submits or appears.
