Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Plaintiffs' Requests for Admission (RFA) are deemed admitted, and has granted the Plaintiffs' request for sanctions against the Defendant. The Defendant failed to respond to the Plaintiffs' RFA within the required timeframe, and the Plaintiffs were forced to file a motion to deem the RFA admitted. The judge has ordered the Defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $1700 to the Plaintiffs, and has jointly and severally ordered the Defendant and his counsel to pay the sanctions. The judge has also ordered the Defendant to pay attorney's fees in the amount of $1804.00. The parties have until June 20, 2024 to submit their objections to the tentative ruling, and the hearing on the motion will proceed unless all parties submit to the ruling.
