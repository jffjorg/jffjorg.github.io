And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to compel arbitration filed by Defendant ARB, Inc. and joined by Defendant California Resources Corporation. The court finds that the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between Defendant ARB and the plaintiff contains clear and unmistakable provisions that require the plaintiff to submit to arbitration his state and federal statutory causes of action, as well as common law causes of action, arising out of his employment. The court also finds that Defendant CRC is equitably estopped from avoiding arbitration. The motion to compel arbitration is granted, and the matter is stayed pending arbitration proceedings.
