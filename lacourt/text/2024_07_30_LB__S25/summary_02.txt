This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to requests for production filed by Defendant Joe Kenneth Del Rio.

Specifically, the court denies Defendant's request for copies of physical insurance cards and finds that the request for information concerning veterinary treatment for the Plaintiff's dog, Bubba, is overbroad. The court orders the Plaintiff to provide further responses to certain requests for production, including licensing records, training records, and veterinary treatment records for Bubba.

The court sets a deadline for the Plaintiff's further responses and schedules a hearing for July 30, 2024.
