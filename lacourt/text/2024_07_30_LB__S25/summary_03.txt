And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the trial date in this case will be continued from September 23, 2024 to March 24, 2025. The motion to continue trial was filed by Defendant Gatekeeper, which argued that it needs more time to conduct discovery and prepare for trial. The Judge has granted the motion, citing the lack of time available for Defendant Gatekeeper to obtain discovery and prepare for trial, as well as the fact that all parties have stipulated to the trial continuance. The Judge has also scheduled a case management conference for October 29, 2024, a final status conference for March 13, 2025, and a new trial date for March 24, 2025.
