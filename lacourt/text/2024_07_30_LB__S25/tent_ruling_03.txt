All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as certain.” (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(a).) Although continuances of trials are disfavored, the Court may grant a continuance if there is an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).) Although continuances of trials are disfavored, the Court may grant a continuance if there is an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance. CRC Rule 3.1332(c). Factors that show good cause include:(1) The unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;(2) The unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;(3) The unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;(4) The substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;(5) The addition of a new party if:a. The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; orb. The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's involvement in the case(6) A party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts; or(7) A significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.In ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the determination. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) These factors may include: The proximity of the trial date; whether there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party; the length of the continuance requested; the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a continuance; the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance; if the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; the court's calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial; whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; whether the interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.Parties’ ArgumentsDefendant Gatekeeper asserts that good cause exists for the Court to continue the trial date from September 23, 2024 to March 17, 2025 because: (1) Defendant Gatekeeper just entered into the case last month and will not have enough time to conduct discovery in the four months before trial in September 23, 2024; (2) there was one stipulated trial continuance prior to Defendant Gatekeeper’s appearance in May 2024; (3) no alternative means exist to address the limited time available for Defendant Gatekeeper to obtain discovery and prepare for trial; and (4) all parties have stipulated to this trial continuance.No opposition has been filed.Tentative RulingDefendant Gatekeeper’s motion for an order continuing the trial date is GRANTED.
