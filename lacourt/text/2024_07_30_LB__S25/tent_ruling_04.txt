 Case Number:  24LBCV00330    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundThis is an alleged wrongful foreclosure action involving the residential property located at 496 East 53rd Street, Long Beach, California (“subject property”). On February 15, 2014, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Rushmore Loan Management Services, Li C; Rushmore Servicing; Meb Loan Trust VI; Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC; Affinia Default Services, LLC; ARKAS, LLC; Recontrust Company, N.A.; Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, INC.;, and all persons unknown, claiming any legal or equitable right, title, estate, lien, or interest in the property described in the complaint adverse to plaintiffs title, or any cloud on plaintiffs title thereto; and Does 1 to 50. Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action:1. Wrongful Foreclosure2. Intentional Misrepresentation3. Negligent Misrepresentation4. Cancellation of Trustee's Deed Upon Sale5. Rescission of Trustee's Sale6. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress7. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress8. Unfair Business Practices (B&P Code § 17200, et seq.)9. Quiet Title10. Declaratory Relief11. Breach Of ContractOn May 24, 2024, Defendants Meb Loan Trust VI and Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC filed the instant demurrer without a motion to strike. As of July 29, 2024, no opposition has been filed.Legal StandardA demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading. It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purpose of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true, however improbable they may be.A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no “speaking demurrers”). A demurrer is brought under Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10 [grounds], § 430.30 [as to any matter on its face or from which judicial notice may be taken], and § 430.50, subd. (a) [can be taken to the entire complaint or any cause of action within]. Specifically, a demurrer may be brought per Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e) if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted. Per Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (a), a demurrer may be brought where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. Furthermore, a demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the complaint is so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably respond. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).)However, in construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory allegations. (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd 764, 769.) And, if the facts pled in the complaint are inconsistent with facts which are incorporated by reference from exhibits attached to the complaint, the facts in the incorporated exhibits control. Further, irrespective of the name or label given to a cause of action by the plaintiff, a general demurrer must be overruled if the facts as pled in the body of the complaint state some valid claim for relief. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).)Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)Finally, Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)Judicial NoticeDefendants’ Request for Judicial Notice of Exhibits 1-8 is granted pursuant to Evid. Code, § 452.Meet and ConferDefendants’ counsel states that on May 6, 2024, he met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel concerning the issues presented in the instant demurrer, to which Plaintiff’s counsel refused to dismiss or amend the complaint. (Schneider Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.) The demurrer is therefore ripe for determination on its merits.DiscussionPlaintiff alleges the following: on or around October 14, 2006, Plaintiff re-financed the Subject Property with: (1) a first position mortgage loan in the amount of $328,000.00 secured by a Deed of Trust that was recorded on or around October 30, 2006. (Compl., ¶ 16; Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) Exh. 1); and (2) a second position mortgage loan in the amount of $23,000.00 secured by a Deed of Trust that was recorded on or around October 30, 2006 (the “DOT”). (Compl., ¶ 17; RJN Exh. 2.) Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, on or about June 20, 2023, Affinia Default Services, LLC was substituted in as trustee of the DOT pursuant to a Substitution of Trustee recorded in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on July 5, 2023. (Compl., ¶ 27; RJN Exh. 6.) Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, Plaintiff fell further and further behind on the monthly mortgage payments, resulting in a Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust being recorded on or around July 5, 2023 (the “NOD”). (Compl., ¶ 28; RJN Exh. 7.) Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, the NOD identifies that the Loan was currently in default is $39,478.56. (Ibid.) Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, on or around November 16, 2023, a Notice of Trustee’s Sale was recorded (the “NOTS”). (Compl., ¶ 29; RJN Exh. 8.) The NOTS represented the total estimated fees and charges due on the DOT was $40,588.77. (Ibid.) The foreclosure sale was completed and a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale was recorded on January 17, 2024 conveying the Property to defendant ARKAS, LLC as the highest bidder. (Compl., ¶ 32; RJN Exh. 9.)Under CCP §§ 430.10 (e), (f) and 430.50(a), Defendants demur to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th causes of action. Defendants claims that on or about March 28, 2023, the beneficial interest in the DOT was assigned to Defendant MEB Loan Trust VI pursuant to a series of Corporate Assignments of Deed of Trust recorded in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office. (RJN Exh. 3-5). On or about June 20, 2023, Defendant Affinia Default Services was substituted in as trustee of the DOT pursuant to a Substitution of Trustee recording on July 5, 2023. Plaintiff defaulted on the payment obligations of the DOT by failing to make the monthly payments beginning with the January 1, 2012 installment, and each installment thereafter. (RJN Exh. 7). Ultimately, on or around July 5, 2023, a Notice of Default (NOD) and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust was recorded. In November 2023, a Notice of Trustee’s Sale was recorded and the foreclosure sale was completed and a Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale was recorded on January 25, 2024. (RJN Exh. 8-9).First Cause of Action – Wrongful Foreclosure“[T]he elements of an equitable cause of action to set aside a foreclosure sale are: (1) the trustee or mortgagee caused an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of real property pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust; (2) the party attacking the sale (usually not but always the trustor or mortgagor) was prejudiced or harmed; and (3) in cases where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale, the trustor or mortgagor tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was excused from tendering.” (Lona v. Citibank, NA. (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 89, 104.)Plaintiff has failed to plead facts sufficient to demonstrate that Defendants engaged in illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive tactics when conducting the sale of the subject property. Plaintiff failed to reinstate or pay off the past due mortgage loan and Plaintiff has not identified any error in the sale process undertaken by Defendants. Also, Plaintiff also does not allege that he effectuated tender or was excused from tendering the amount of secured indebtedness. Defendants’ demurrer to the 1st cause of action is SUSTAINED with LEAVE TO AMEND.Second Cause of Action – Intentional MisrepresentationIntentional misrepresentation or fraud claims must include specific allegations of what, how, where, by whom, to whom and by what means the alleged representations or concealments were made. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)Plaintiff fails to plead any false statement of past or existing material fact beyond conclusory statement. (See Compl., ¶¶ 34, 55.) For intentional misrepresentation, Plaintiff has not included specific allegations as to the context of the representations or concealments. Defendants’ demurrer to the 2nd cause of action is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.Third Cause of Action – Negligent MisrepresentationThe elements of negligent misrepresentation are “(1) the misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact, (2) without reasonable ground for believing it to be true, (3) with intent to induce another's reliance on the fact misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage.” (National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Cambridge Integrated Services Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50 [citation omitted.]) Lenders do not have a common-law duty of care in negligence, to offer, consider, or approve a loan modification, to offer foreclosure alternatives, or to handle loans so as to prevent foreclosure. (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 68). For negligent misrepresentation, the element of duty of care cannot be established because Defendants are the mortgage loan service and owner of the mortgage loan. The demurrer as to the 3rd cause of action is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.Sixth Cause of Action – Intentional Infliction of Emotional DistressThe essential elements for intentional infliction of emotional distress are: (1) outrageous conduct; (2) an intent to cause or a reckless disregard of the possibility of causing emotional distress; (3) severe or extreme emotional distress; and (4) actual and proximate cause of the emotional distress by the outrageous conduct. (Symonds v. Mercury Sav. & Loan Ass’n (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1458,1468.) Outrageous conduct is conduct that “exceed[s] all bounds usually tolerated by decent society, of a nature which is especially calculated to cause, and does cause, mental distress of a very serious kind.” (Ochoa v. Superior Court (1985) 39 Cal.3d 159, 166 fn. 5.)Plaintiff has not alleged conduct that meets the “outrageous” element of an IIED claim. A foreclosure sale is not outrageous conduct. Defendants’ demurrer to the 6th cause of action is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.Seventh Cause of Action- Negligent Infliction of Emotional DistressTo state a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff must allege (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, (2) the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach proximately caused the plaintiff's damages or injuries. (Thomas v. Stenberg (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 654, 662, 142 Cal.Rptr.3d 24.) Lenders do not have a common-law duty of care in negligence, to offer, consider, or approve a loan modification, to offer foreclosure alternatives, or to handle loans so as to prevent foreclosure. (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 68). Thus, Plaintiff cannot establish that Defendant has a duty of care element. Defendants’ demurrer to the 7th cause of action is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.Eighth Cause of Action – Unfair Business PracticesA cause of action for Violation of Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq. requires the pleading of the following elements: (1) Defendant has engaged in any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice, including unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising; (2) Plaintiff's right to restitution, if any; (3) Plaintiff's right to injunctive relief, if any. (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq.)Damages are not recoverable. (Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Superior Court (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 758, 773-774.) To state a claim, there must be allegations showing unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts or practices. (Paulus v. Bob Lynch Ford, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 659, 676-677.) Since the cause of action is based on statute, pleadings must state with reasonable particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements of the violation, including the section of the statute violated and the particular facts showing that the statute was violated. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619.)Plaintiff does not identify any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act conducted by Defendants nor does Plaintiff describe with any reasonable particularity any facts supporting such violations. The demurrer as to the 8th case of action is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.Ninth Cause of Action – Quiet TitleA cause of action for quiet title requires (1) a legal description and street address of the subject property; (2) the title of the plaintiff as to which a determination is sought and the basis of the title; (3) the adverse claims to the title of the plaintiff against which a determination is sought; (4) the date as of which the determination is sought and (5) a prayer for the determination of the title of the plaintiff against the adverse claims. (Code Civ. Proc., § 761.020.) The complaint must also be verified. (Ibid.)Plaintiff alleges that he is the “owner of the Property.” (Complaint, ¶ 96.) However, Plaintiff did not fulfill the obligation under the DOT, the DOT was in default and foreclosure was completed pursuant to the DOT and California law, with the foreclosure sale and conveying the subject property to ARKAS, LLC, the highest bidder, on January 17, 2024. (Compl., ¶ 32; RJN Exh. 9.) Defendants’ demurrer as to the 8th case of action is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.Tenth Cause of Action – Declaratory ReliefThe requirements for obtaining declaratory relief are set forth in CCP §§ 1060 to 1062. CCP §1060 authorizes declaratory relief for any person interested under a written instrument, excluding a will or a trust, or under a contract, or who desires a declaration of rights or duties with respect to another, or in respect to, in, over, or upon property, or with respect to the location of the natural channel of a watercourse. In cases of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties, such a person may seek a judicial declaration of his or her rights and duties in the premises, including a determination of any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument or contract. A declaration of rights or duties may be sought either alone or with other relief, and the court may make a binding declaration of rights or duties, whether or not further relief is or could be claimed at the time. The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in form and effect, and may be had before there has been any breach of the obligation in respect to which the declaration is sought.Declaratory relief is appropriate only where there is an actual controversy, not simply an abstract or academic dispute. (Connerly v. Schwarzenegger (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 739, 746.) The controversy must be of a character which admits of specific and conclusive relief by judgment within the field of judicial determination, as distinguished from an advisory opinion upon a particular or hypothetical state of facts. (Sanctity of Human LifeNetwork v. California Highway Patrol (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 858, 872.) “The broad discretionary power of the trial court to deny declaratory relief may be invoked by general demurrer.” (General of America Ins. Co. v. Lilly (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 471.)Plaintiff’s claim for declaratory relief does not state with sufficient facts how Defendants committed an improper act and seeks to remedy a past wrong, the foreclosure sale. Defendants’ demurrer to the 10th cause of action is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.Eleventh Cause of Action – Breach of Contract“[T]he elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are (1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) ‘‘[I]t is elementary that one party to a contract cannot compel another to perform while he himself is in default.” (Lewis Pub. Co. v. Henderson (1930) 103 Cal.App.425, 429.)Plaintiff alleges he made monthly payments on the first and second loans and that “[d]espite having made the required payments on the loans, Mers, Meb, Rushmore Loan, Rushmore Servicing, Specialized Loan and Does 1-50 proceeded with foreclosure on the PROPERTY.” (Compl., ¶¶ 107-108.) Plaintiff also alleges that he “was ready, willing, able, and in fact complied with the terms of the loans.” (Compl., ¶ 109.) Plaintiff does not support these statements with any facts; he does not identify when he attempted to make payments, which payments were rejected, when these payments were rejected, whether he attempted to make a full payment or partial payment, and/or whether the bank rejected the payment(s) for insufficient funds. Defendants’ demurrer to the 11th cause of action is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.Tentative RulingDefendants’ demurrer to the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 8th, 9th, 10, and 11th causes of action are SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.Defendants’ demurrer to the 3rd and 7th causes of action is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.Plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 15 days of this order.
