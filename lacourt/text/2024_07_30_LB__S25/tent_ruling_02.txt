 Case Number:  23LBCV00692    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn April 14, 2023, Plaintiff Mary Ann Moody (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Joe Kenneth Del Rio (“Defendant”) alleging causes of action for: (1) General Negligence and (2) Intentional Tort. Plaintiff alleges the following: on or about April 14, 2021, at about 7:45 p.m., Plaintiff was walking near the Long Beach Arena accompanied by her dog, Bubba (misidentified in the complaint as Buddy). (Compl., ¶ 9; FAC ¶ 15.) Bubba was on a short leash, which at the time of this incident, Plaintiff had dropped allowing Bubba to walk on his own. (Compl., ¶ 9; FAC ¶ 15.) Defendant was nearby standing with his two dogs – both on a leash. (Compl., ¶ 10; FAC ¶ 16.) Plaintiff followed Bubba as Bubba approached affably to where Defendant was standing with his two dogs. (Compl., ¶ 11; FAC ¶ 17.) Neither Plaintiff nor Defendant’s dogs acted aggressively. (Ibid.) When Plaintiff and Bubba were approximately two to three arm’s length from Defendant, he began to yell at Plaintiff and told Plaintiff Bubba needed to be on a leash. (Ibid.) When Plaintiff approached Defendant, he became aggressive and began hitting Plaintiff in the head with his phone. (Ibid.) Plaintiff raised a plastic “chuck it” stick in self-defense but did not strike Defendant. (Ibid.) Defendant then grabbed the “chuck it” stick from Plaintiff forcibly causing damage to her fore finger. (Ibid.) Plaintiff tried to run but tripped and fell to the ground. (Ibid.) Defendant then sat or kneeled on Plaintiff and began striking her with the “chuck it” stick repeatedly. (Ibid.) Plaintiff alleges that, at the same time, one of Defendant’s dogs began to bite Plaintiff on her leg as she lay on the ground. (Compl., ¶ 12; FAC ¶ 18.)On June 24, 2024, Defendant Del Rio filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff Mary Ann Moody’s Further Responses to Requests for Production, Set Two and Request for Monetary Sanctions of $3,140.00.Legal StandardUnder Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), a court may order a party to serve a further response to a request for production of documents when the court finds that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete[;] (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)Next, the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).) A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771.)Tentative RulingDefendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Request Nos. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 42. (Moving Papers 3:7-10.)Requests Nos. 25-27 seek copies of Plaintiff’s Medical, Medicare, and/or Medi-Cal insurance cards from April 14, 2011 to the present. The Court denies Defendant’s request as copies of physical insurance cards are irrelevant and are unlikely to lead to admissible evidence. Information concerning Plaintiff’s medical treatment on April 11, 2021 and pre-existing conditions (e.g. injury for same forefinger) can be obtained through other sources.Request No. 28 asks for all documents reflecting or referring to ownership of Plaintiff’s dog that was involved in the April 14, 2021 incident. The Court finds the request overbroad. Although Plaintiff is not disputing her ownership of Bubba, records of Plaintiff’s ownership, licensing with Animal Control or adoption paperwork licenses for Bubba between 2020-2022, are ordered produced (See Request No. 29).Request Nos. 29-31 seek licensing records, training records, veterinary treatment, grooming records for Plaintiff’s dog involved in the April 14, 2021 incident. Plaintiff is ordered to produce any city/county licenses for Bubba between 2020-2022 and Plaintiff is ordered to produce any training records related to Bubba prior to April 14, 2021 (if available). The Court finds the requests for information concerning veterinary treatment for Bubba to be overboard. If Plaintiff sought treatment for Bubba as a result of the April 14, 2021 incident, Plaintiff is ordered to produce those veterinary records.Defendant withdrew Request No. 32 re grooming records.Request No. 33 requests for all documents reflecting “complaints, including concern or comments” received by Plaintiff regarding Bubba. The Court finds the request overly broad and vague. Further, the information sought by Defendant will be produced in the more narrowly defined Requests Nos. 34-38.Request Nos. 34-38 requests documents Plaintiff received from and/or sent to Animal Control, Law Enforcement, and the Long Beach Convention Center (including licensing documents, citations and bite reports) related to Bubba. The Court finds this information relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence. Plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses, if any, however, the Court limits the scope to three (3) years prior to the April 21 2021 incident.The Court finds a substantive response was provided for Request No. 39. Unless Plaintiff find new documents relevant to the request, no further response is needed for Request No. 39.Request No. 42 seeks all photographs of the harness that Plaintiff’s dog was wearing during the April 14, 2021 incident. The Court agrees such documentation may be relevant if Plaintiff allege she was attempting to grab the harness when she was struck by Defendant and that her finger was injured during that period. Plaintiff is ordered to provide a photograph of the harness Bubba was wearing on the date of the incident.Defendant’s request sanctions is denied. The Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel acted with substantial justification in objecting to several of the requests for production.Plaintiffs’ further responses are due within 20 days from the date of this order.
