And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Herbert Bagoro Amanya's application for default judgment against Roy Martin II without prejudice. The court found that Amanya's application was incomplete and did not provide sufficient information to justify the amount of damages and costs sought. Additionally, the court ruled that a party may not obtain damages in a default judgment that exceed the amount requested in the complaint. The judge has ordered Amanya to amend the complaint to include the amounts requested and will entertain a motion by Amanya for leave to amend the complaint.
