And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of El Monte has filed a demurrer to Aurelia Robles's First Amended Complaint, alleging causes of action for negligent operation, failure to discharge mandatory duty, and respondeat superior. The court finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer before filing the demurrer, as the City's counsel only sent an email to Robles's counsel, which is not a code-compliant means of meeting and conferring. As a result, the court is continuing the demurrer hearing to a date to be determined and ordering the City's counsel to meet and confer with Robles's counsel regarding the demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing on the demurrer.
