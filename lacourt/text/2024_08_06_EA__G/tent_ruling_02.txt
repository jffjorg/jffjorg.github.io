Cross-Complaint is OVERRULED
in its entirety.
Cross-Defendant Cherry
Blossom Childcare & Preschool, LLC is ordered to file its Answer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint in ten (10) days.
BACKGROUND
This
is an action for breach of contract arising from a loan agreement. In April
2022, Plaintiff Cherry Blossom Childcare & Preschool, LLC (Cherry Blossom)
entered into an oral agreement with Defendants Andrew Feil and Oak Street Properties,
LLC (Oak Street) in which Cherry Blossom agreed to loan $75,875.00 to Andrew Feil
and Oak Street for the purchase of a property in Pennsylvania. Pursuant to the
terms of their agreement, Andrew Feil and Oak Street allegedly agreed to make
monthly payments of $500 to Cherry Blossom and repay the rest of the loan when
they flipped and resold the Pennsylvania property within two years. In January
2024, Cherry Blossom alleges Andrew Feil and Oak Street breached the agreement
by failing to make a monthly payment and failing to sell the Pennsylvania
property.
On
January 19, 2024, Cherry Blossom filed a complaint against Andrew Feil, Oak
Street, and Does 1-30, alleging the (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the
warranty of good faith and fair dealing, (3) promissory estoppel, and (4)
fraud.
On
March 27, 2024, Andrew Feil and Oak Street filed an answer the Complaint and a
cross-complaint against Cherry Blossom, Michelle Feil, and Roes 1-10, alleging
causes of action for (1) contribution and indemnity and (2) declaratory relief.
On
May 28, 2024, Andrew Feil and Oak Street filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint
(FACC) against the same defendants alleging the same causes of action.
On July
2, 2024, Cherry Blossom and Michelle Feil filed the present demurrer. Prior to
filing, their counsel attempted to meet and confer telephonically with Andrew
Feil and Oak Street’s counsel and was unable to reach a resolution. (Sanchez
Siqueiros Decl.)
On
July 30, 2024, the Court overruled the demurrer as to Michelle Feil and
continued the hearing on the demurrer as to Cherry Blossom. A hearing on the
present demurrer is set for August 6, 2024, with a case management conference
also set for September 18, 2024.
ANALYSIS
Cherry
Blossom demurs to Andrew Feil and Oak Street’s second cause of action for
declaratory relief. For the following reasons, the court OVERRULES the demurrer in its
entirety.
Legal Standard
Demurrers
A
party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering
demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT
Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding,
the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.)
Declaratory Relief
“To
qualify for declaratory relief, a party would have to demonstrate its action
presented two essential elements: (1) a proper subject of declaratory relief,
and (2) an actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the
party’s rights or obligations.” (Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013)
213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909, quotation marks and brackets omitted.) “The courts do
not issue advisory opinions about the rights and duties of the parties under
particular agreements, if no actual, justiciable controversy has yet
developed.” (Otay Land Co. v. Royal Indemnity Co. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th
556, 563.)
Discussion
In
this case, while the demurrer argues the second cause of action fails because it
is duplicative of the first cause of action against Michelle Feil and does not
allege fraud against Michelle Feil with requisite specificity, the court notes
these arguments are inapplicable to Cherry Blossom. (Demurrer, p. 7:25-28, 8:6-9.)
As
to Cherry Blossom, the demurrer argues the FACC fails to allege adequate facts
to establish the existence of a contract between Cherry Blossom and Michelle
Feil. (Demurrer, p. 8:1-5.) But the FACC does so by alleging “to the extent an
agreement exists, as alleged in [Cherry Blossom]’s Complaint, any such
agreement was negotiated, entered into, and approved by [Michelle Feil].”
(FACC, ¶ 7.) It is well established that cross-complaints may incorporate the
allegations of the complaint. (Pine Terrace Apartments, L.P. v. Windscape,
LLC (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1, 17-18.)
Cherry
Blossom also argues the FACC fails to allege how Cherry Blossom damaged or
could damage Andrew Feil and Oak Street. (Demurrer, p. 8:10-15.) But Cherry
Blossom does not provide any authority for imposing a “damages requirement” in
actions for a declaratory judgment. Instead, Andrew Feil and Oak Street need
only demonstrate the existence of an actual controversy involving their rights
or obligations. Here, one such controversy exists by the very nature of Cherry
Blossom seeking to hold them liable for actions that Andrew Feil and Oak Street
allege were committed by Michelle Feil.
Accordingly,
Cherry Blossom’s demurrer to this cause of action is OVERRULED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Cherry Blossom’s demurrer to Andrew Feil and Oak Street’s FACC is OVERRULED
in its entirety.
Cross-Defendant Cherry
Blossom Childcare & Preschool, LLC is ordered to file its Answer to the First
Amended Cross-Complaint in ten (10) days.
