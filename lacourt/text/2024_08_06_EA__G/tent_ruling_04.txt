 Case Number:  24PSCV00228    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Amur Equipment Finance, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Amur Equipment Finance, Inc.’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action. In April 2022, Plaintiff Amur Equipment
Finance, Inc. (Amur) entered into a written equipment finance agreement with Defendant
3 Cornells Enterprises, Inc. (3 Cornells) in which Amur agreed to finance the
purchase of certain equipment. In support of the agreement, Defendant Wilmer
Cornell, Jr. executed a personal guaranty. In January 2023, 3 Cornells
allegedly defaulted on the terms of the agreement and agreed to a restructuring
agreement. In February 2023, 3 Cornells and Cornell again defaulted on the
payments owed. After Amur repossessed and sold the equipment at issue, Amur
alleges they owe an outstanding balance of $83,287.03.
On January
23, 2024, Amur filed a complaint against 3 Cornells, Cornell, and Does 1-100, alleging
the following causes of action: (1) breach of written agreement, (2) open book
account, (3) account stated, and (4) breach of continuing guaranty. On June 2,
2024, Amur’s process server served 3 Cornells and Cornell with substitute
service in Pomona.
On July
25, 2024, the Court entered default against 3 Cornells and Cornell after they
failed to file a timely answer. On July 29, 2024, Amur submitted the present
application for default judgment.
A case
management conference is set for August 6, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Amur
seeks default judgment against 3 Cornells and Cornell in the total amount of $108,831.48,
including $83,287.03 in damages, $22,342.08 in interest, $2,555.74 in attorney
fees, and $646.63 in costs. Because the Court finds Amur has submitted
sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS Amur’s application for default
judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Amur’s
application for default judgment is GRANTED.
