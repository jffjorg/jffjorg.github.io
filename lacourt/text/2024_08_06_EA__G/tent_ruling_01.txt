  Case Number:  23PSCV02816    Hearing Date:   August 6, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Herbert Bagoro Amanya’s Application for
Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Herbert Bagoro Amanya’s Application for
Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action. In 2017, Plaintiff Herbert Bagoro Amanya and
Defendant Roy Martin II allegedly formed a partnership to operate an adult
residential care facility through an entity named Avani Home, Inc. (Avani). In
May 2020, Amanya and Martin acquired real property in Covina for Avani’s
operations. In June 2023, Amanya alleges Martin breached their partnership
agreement by unilaterally removing Amanya from the position of officer and
director for Avani in Avani’s corporate filings. Martin allegedly now claims
the partnership and Amanya have no interest in the Covina property.
On September
13, 2023, Amanya filed a complaint against Martin and Does 1-25, alleging the
following causes of action: (1) breach of fiduciary duty, (2) breach of
contract, (3) conversion of partnership assets, (4) unjust enrichment, (5)
accounting, and (6) imposition of constructive trust. On April 19, 2024, Amanya’s
process server served Martin with substitute service in Covina.
On May
31, 2024, the Court entered default against Martin after Martin failed to file
a timely answer. On July 9, 2024, Amanya submitted the present application for
default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default/Default Judgment is set for August 6, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Amanya
seeks default judgment against Martin in the total amount of $258,766.87,
including $257,250 in damages and $1,516.87 in costs. For the following
reasons, the court DENIES Amanya’s application.
First,
the Court notes Amanya’s CIV-100 application is incomplete as it does not list
any damages or costs in paragraph two of the form despite requesting
$258,766.87 in the proposed judgment.
Second,
a party may not obtain damages in a default judgment that exceed the amount
requested in the complaint. (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822,
826.) In determining the maximum amount of damages allowable, “courts must look
to the prayer of the complaint¿or¿to ‘allegations in the body of the
complaint of the damages sought’ to determine whether a defendant has been
informed of the ‘maximum liability’ he or she will face for choosing to
default.” (People ex rel. Lockyer v. Brar (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 659,
667, quoting National Diversified Services, Inc. v. Bernstein (1985) 168
Cal.App.3d 410, 417-418.) Allegations “according to proof” are insufficient in
a default judgment proceeding as they do not inform defendants of their maximum
liability. (Yu v. Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 1024,
1032.)
Here,
neither the Complaint’s prayer nor allegations state any specific number of
damages. Accordingly, the Court cannot award any damages to Amanya and Amanya
must amend the Complaint to include the amounts requested.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Amanya’s
application for default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
The court will entertain a
motion by Plaintiff for leave to amend the Complaint.
