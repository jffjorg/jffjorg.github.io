And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's motion for a change of venue is taken off calendar due to lack of proper service. The motion was filed on January 23, 2024, but it was not accompanied by proof of service, and the time to file proof of service has expired. According to California Rules of Court, proper service and notice are required to satisfy due process. Since the Plaintiff failed to provide proof of service, the Court lacks jurisdiction to act on the motion. Therefore, the motion is taken off calendar.
