 Case Number:  22STCV09608    Hearing Date:   March 28, 2024    Dept:  1 22STCV09608           GLENN
M HEINL vs ODET BEVERLY HILLS JEWELERS, et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion for Change of Venue Code of Civil
Procedure § 397
TENTATIVE RULING: 
The motion is taken off calendar for lack of service.  Clerk to give notice to all parties.
Plaintiff Heinl’s motion consists
of a two-page handwritten pleading dated January 23, 2024.
 
The new motion is also not
accompanied by a proof of service and the time to file a proof of service has
expired. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.1300(c) (“Proof of service of the moving papers
must be filed no later than five court days before the time appointed for the
hearing.”).) “[P]ro per litigants are not entitled to special exemptions
from the California Rules of Court.” (Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284.) Proper service
and notice are required to satisfy due process. (See generally, McMillin v.
Eare (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 893, 913 (describing the “right to notice, which
is an element of due process.”).) Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed. Absent
evidence of proper notice and service, the Court lacks jurisdiction to act.
(See e.g. Lee v. Placer Title Co. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 503, 509; Code
Civ. Proc. § 1005.) 
 
Plaintiff’s motion is therefore
taken OFF-CALENDAR for lack of proper service.
