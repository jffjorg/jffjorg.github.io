And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application to transfer the case from the Alhambra Courthouse to the Burbank Courthouse or another district. The plaintiff claimed that a different judicial district would be less likely to contain a jury pool of her coworkers, co-employees, and patients, and that news of the transfer to Alhambra caused her emotional distress. However, the judge found that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient authority to support her contention and that she had not met her burden to demonstrate that the transfer would promote the ends of justice. The judge noted that the trial court has tools to address the plaintiff's concerns regarding potential jurors and therefore denied the application.
