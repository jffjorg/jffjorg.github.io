And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Leo Cono's motion for an order appointing a referee is denied in its entirety. The motion is not accompanied by a valid proof of service, and the Court lacks jurisdiction to provide relief. The action was previously dismissed, and the judge states that the Court may not appoint a referee in a dismissed action. Additionally, the judge finds that the motion relies on inapplicable legal authorities and fails to state a basis for the appointment of a referee related to the dismissed action.
