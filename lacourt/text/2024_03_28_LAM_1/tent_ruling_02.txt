CONO vs FACEBOOK.COM, INC., et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Appointing Referee
TENTATIVE RULING: 
Leo Cono’s Motion for Order Appointing Referee is DENIED in its
entirety.  Clerk to give notice to all
parties.
On November 13, 2020, Leo Cono
filed 20STCV43312 against Facebook.com, Inc., Mark Zuckerberg, and Priscilla
Chan. On June 21, 2021, the court issued an order sustaining Defendants’
demurrer without leave to amend. The court entered a judgment of dismissal on
July 12, 2021. 
 
On February 9, 2024, Leo Cono
filed the instant Motion for Order Appointing Referee, which states that it
seeks to appoint the California Highway Patrol as a referee. 
 
Discussion
 
In the motion on optional
Judicial Council form ADR-109, Cono seeks the appointment of a referee pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 639(d). (Mot. at ¶ 2(b)(d).) 
 
Cono’s motion is not accompanied
by a valid proof of service indicating service upon the parties to this action.
The “‘Certificate of Service’ - California Rule of Court 2.251 - Proof of
electronic service” solely indicates service upon “Unlimited
Civil Filing Clerk c/o Presiding Judge Samantha Jessner - Stanley Mosk
Courthouse.” Accordingly, the Court
lacks jurisdiction to provide any relief to Cono in connection with this motion.
(Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1005; 1013b; Lee v. Placer Title Co. (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 503, 509.)
 
Additionally, as noted above, the
instant action was dismissed on June 21, 2021. The Court also lacks
jurisdiction to appoint a referee in a dismissed action. Generally, “[a]
dismissal terminates an action. [Citation] A superior court thereafter has no
subject matter jurisdiction to grant relief other than costs and fees as
appropriate. [Citation] A court may also entertain a motion to vacate on grounds of mistake,
excusable neglect and so forth” under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. (Hagan
Engineering, Inc. v. Mills (2003) 115 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1008.) The Court
may also enter other orders after a dismissal not applicable here. (See e.g. Pittman
v. Beck Park Apartments Ltd. (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1009, 1022.) 
 
Moreover, Cono’s motion relies
upon Code of Civil Procedure section 639(d), which only applies to a “special
proceeding.” Even if Cono demonstrated proper service and this action remained
pending, it is not a special proceeding to which Code of Civil Procedure
section 639(d) applies. (People v. Superior Court (Laff) (2001) 25
Cal.4th 703, 725 (“The term ‘special proceeding’ applies only to a proceeding
that is distinct from, and not a mere part of, any underlying litigation.”); Aetna
Life Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 431, 435 (“this
statute does not apply to law and motion proceedings in an ordinary civil
action, as we have here.”); Code Civ. Proc. §§ 22, 23; People v. Yartz
(2005) 37 Cal.4th 529, 538 (“the term ‘civil action’ is by definition not a ‘special
proceeding’ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 22, 23, 30), and ‘civil action’ does not have
a different meaning from ‘civil suit.’”).) 
 
Cono’s motion cites “‘Rule 8.485.
Application’ - (a) ‘Writ of Prohibition’ (Extra Ordinary / Special Proceeding),”
which is inapplicable as it applies to the California Supreme Court and Courts
of Appeal, not the trial court. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 8.485(a) (“the rules in this chapter govern petitions to
the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for writs of mandate, certiorari, or
prohibition, or other writs within the original jurisdiction of these
courts.”).) Similarly, Cono’s motion cites “Rule 10.1000,” which does not
permit a trial court to transfer or reclassify an action. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
10.1000 (governing the ability of the California Supreme Court and Court of
Appeal administrative presiding judge to transfer a cause).) 
 
Cono’s motion fails to state a
basis for the appointment of a referee related to this dismissed action. 

For all the reasons stated herein, the motion is DENIED.
