And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to transfer the venue of the personal injury case from Los Angeles County to Mono County. The plaintiff, Ashley Attia, alleged that she slipped and fell at a hotel operated by the defendant, Jay Bhart Lodging, LLC, in Mammoth Lakes, Mono County. The defendant argued that venue was improper in Los Angeles County because its principal office location is in that county, but the defendant has shown that the alleged liability arose within Mono County. The judge found that the burden was on the moving party (the defendant) to establish that the venue selected by the plaintiff was improper, and the defendant met this burden by showing that the alleged liability arose in Mono County.
