And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the California Department of Healthcare Services' Special Motion to Determine Medi-Cal Lien in the amount of $253,556.81. The Department is entitled to reimbursement for the reasonable value of its Medi-Cal lien because it is reasonably probable that the Department will pay Plaintiff's future medical expenses. The Court makes this finding based on reasonable assumptions and estimates, and not absolute certainty. The amount of the Medi-Cal lien is calculated by subtracting the Department's share of attorney's fees and litigation costs from the total value of Medi-Cal benefits provided to the Plaintiff. The Court finds that the Department's lien is valid and that the Plaintiff shall reimburse the Department for the reasonable value of its Medi-Cal lien.
