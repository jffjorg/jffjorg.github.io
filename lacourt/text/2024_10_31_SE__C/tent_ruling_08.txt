Defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES’ Motion to Compel

Documents (set one) is DENIED as MOOT. 
 
 
Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
This personal injury action was filed by
Plaintiffs LAUREN PRECIADO; DIANNA FERNANDEZ; JOSE ARIAS; and ASTERIA ARIAS on
September 21, 2023. 
 
The Subject Motions to Compel Further
Responses to Request for Production of Documents were filed on May 23, 2024.
 
In a Consolidated Opposition to the Subject
Motions, Plaintiffs indicate that amended, verified responses and responsive
documents were served on October 17, 2024—after the Motions were filed. 
 
In the Reply documents filed on October 24,
2024, Defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES (“County”) admits that untimely
supplemental responses have been served, but maintains that monetary sanctions
are justified. 
 
Where supplemental responses were served after
a motion to compel further is filed, the Court has discretion to deny a motion
to compel further as moot, and just impose sanctions. (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 409.)
 
It is undisputed that supplemental responses
and documents were served after the subject Motions were filed. The sufficiency
of Plaintiffs’ supplemental responses are not at issue here. Where supplemental
responses were served after the date the Motions were filed, there is nothing
further to compel and the Motions to Compel Further Responses are DENIED as
MOOT. 
 
However,
it is also undisputed that supplemental requests were not served until after
the Subject Motions were filed. The Court finds good cause for the issuance of
reasonable monetary sanctions as follows: 
 
Plaintiff
JOSE ARIA and his counsel of record are ORDERED
to pay Defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES and their counsel of record sanctions in
the total amount of $500.00 ($250/hr. x 2 hrs.) 
no later than 90 days from the date of the Court’s issuance of this
Order. This date may be extended per agreement of the parties. 
 
Plaintiff
ASTERIA ARIA and her counsel of record are ORDERED
to pay Defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES and their counsel of record sanctions in
the total amount of $500.00 ($250/hr. x 2 hrs.) 
no later than 90 days from the date of the Court’s issuance of this
Order. This date may be extended per agreement of the parties.
