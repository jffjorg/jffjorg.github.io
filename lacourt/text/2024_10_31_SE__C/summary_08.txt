And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a personal injury action filed by four plaintiffs against the County of Los Angeles. The defendant had filed motions to compel further responses to its request for production of documents, but the judge has denied these motions as moot because the plaintiffs served supplemental responses and documents after the motions were filed. However, the judge has also imposed sanctions on two of the plaintiffs, Jose Aria and Asteria Aria, and their counsel, in the amount of $500.00 each, for serving supplemental responses and documents late. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs and their counsel to pay these sanctions within 90 days, or an extended period if agreed by the parties.
