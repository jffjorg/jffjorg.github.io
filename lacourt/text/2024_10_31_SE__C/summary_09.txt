And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint in the elder abuse and negligence action. The demurrer, filed by the defendant, KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL, is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff, LEE HERRERA, has 30 days to revise and refile their complaint to address the issues raised in the demurrer.

The court found that the plaintiff's complaint fails to adequately allege that the defendant's treatment of the plaintiff's bed sores, or lack thereof, constituted intentional, willful, or conscious refusal/failure to treat. Instead, the allegations amount to claims for professional negligence, which are insufficient to state a cause of action for elder abuse.

The court also found that the motion to strike punitive damages and attorney's fees is MOOT, as the demurrer has been sustained and the plaintiff has an opportunity to amend their complaint.

Overall, the court's tentative ruling is a significant setback for the plaintiff, as they will need to revise and refile their complaint in order to continue pursuing their claims.
