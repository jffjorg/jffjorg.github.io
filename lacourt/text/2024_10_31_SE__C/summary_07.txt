Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiffs' motion to file a second amended complaint (SAC) against the defendants, Santa Fe Inn, 6340 Sante Fe, LLC, and Jayesh Patel. The plaintiffs seek to add two new defendants and a claim for punitive damages to the existing claims of negligence - premises liability, negligence per se, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and loss of consortium. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that it would severely prejudice them by forcing them to restart discovery six months before trial. However, the court found that the liberal rules governing amendments to complaints should apply, and the plaintiffs should be allowed to make the proposed amendments. The court notes that the defendants may still seek to compel discovery, demur, move for judgment on the pleadings, move to strike, or move for summary judgment. The parties are also not foreclosed from seeking a continuance of the trial date.
