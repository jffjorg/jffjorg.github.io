Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the third cause of action for wrongful foreclosure. The plaintiff, THEE AGUILA, INC., alleges that the defendant, PICO RIVERA FIRST MORTGAGE INVESTORS LP, and others, engaged in a wrongful foreclosure of commercial real estate in Pico Rivera, California.

The judge finds that the demurrer to the third cause of action is OVERRULED. The plaintiff has adequately alleged facts to support a finding that the foreclosure was wrongful, including allegations of bid-chilling and violation of the bankruptcy stay.

The judge also rules that the statute of limitations defense is MOOT in part and OVERRULED in part. The plaintiff's claim is not barred by the statute of limitations, as the alleged wrongful foreclosure occurred in 2017, and the plaintiff did not file the lawsuit until 2022.

Additionally, the judge rules that the statute of frauds defense is not applicable, as the plaintiff's claim is based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel.

Finally, the judge rules that the tender requirement is not applicable, as the plaintiff's allegations of bid-chilling and violation of the bankruptcy stay excuse the tender requirement.
