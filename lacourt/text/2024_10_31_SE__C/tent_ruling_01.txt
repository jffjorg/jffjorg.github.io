Third Party Claimant CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE
SERVICES’s Special Motion to Determine Medi-Cal Lien is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Mason Mendez shall reimburse the
Department for the reasonable value of its Medi-Cal lien in the amount of
$253,556.81.  
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This medical malpractice action was filed on November 30,
2018. On July 8, 2021, the Court issued an order approving the compromise of
claim or action or disposition of proceeds of judgment for minor or person with
a disability. The Court approved the Settlement in the amount of $1.75 million,
allocated as follows: (1) $997,716.24 for a deposit to Plaintiff’s special
needs trust; (2) $356,702.22 for attorney’s fees to Plaintiff’s attorneys; (3)
$54,251.89 for costs and trust fees; (4) $341,329.65 to be held in the Michels
& Lew Client Trust Account pending resolution of the Department’s lien
claim. 
 
The California Department of Healthcare Services
(“Department”) now moves for reimbursement of it’s Medi-Cal lien in the amount
of $253,556.81.
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that the Department is
barred from asserting a lien against any portion of the settlement that does
not represent compensation for past expenses that Medi-Cal paid, and contends
that the Department’s net recovery should be $29,653.00.
 
“A State plan for medical assistance must-- …. provide….
that in any case where such legal liability is found to exist after medical
assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual and where the
amount of reimbursement the State can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the
costs of such recovery, the State or local agency will seek reimbursement for
such assistance to the extent of such legal liability.” (42 U.S.C.
§1396(a)(25)(A)(B).) “The director’s recovery is limited to the amount derived
from applying Section 14124.72, 14124.76, or 14124.78, whichever is less, to
the total settlement, judgment, or award amount upon resolution of all actions
or claims associated with the injury with regard to each and every defendant….”
(Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code §14124.785.) 
“Although the statutory scheme dealing with third party liability
situations [citation omitted] has been revamped since its initial adoption in
the 1960’s, the language which so troubled the trial court is virtually
identical to that contained in the statute which preceded section 14124.71….
‘When the state Medi-Cal program pays for medical services rendered to an
injured person who has a claim for damages for the injury for which he is
treated, the state is granted a lien upon the injured person’s recovery,
whether by judgment or settlement, to the extent of the Medi-Cal benefits it
has provided. [Citation.]’ [Citation Omitted.]” (Kizer v. Hirata (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 841, 844.) “[T]he superior court has no discretion to disallow a
Medi-Cal lien, filed timely and in accordance with [the] statutory scheme….” (Kizer
v. Ortiz (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1061.) 
 
Here, the Order Approving the Minor’s Compromise states, in
pertinent part: “THE COURT ORDERS a. The petition is granted and the proposed
compromise of claim or action or the proposed disposition of the proceeds of
the judgment is approved. The gross amount or value of the settlement or
judgment in favor of claimant is $1,750,000.00. b. Until further order of the
court, jurisdiction is reserved to determine a claim for a reduction of a
Medi-Cal lien under Welfare and Intuitions Code section 14124.76. The amount
shown payable to the Department of Health Care Services in item 7c(1)(d) of
this order is the full amount of the lien claimed by the department but is
subject to reduction on further order of the court upon determination of the
claim for reduction.” (07/08/21 Order App. Comp..) 
 
The Department asserts that it is entitled to a reduced
value of its Medi-Cal lien in the amount of $253,566.81 because it is reasonably probable that the Department will pay
Plaintiff’s future medical expenses. (Aguilera v. Loma Linda University
Medical Center (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 821.) 
 
Declarations in support of the Department’s position “must
establish the declarant's expertise in Medi-Cal benefits, funding and
eligibility determinations.  The
declarations must also be supported with citations to applicable statutes or
regulations regarding current Medi-Cal eligibility, the type of health care
currently available under Medi-Cal, past funding to pay for such health care,
and estimated future funding to pay for the type of health care at issue. Based
on the evidence provided, the trial court must make a determination whether it
is reasonably probable the Department will pay [Plaintiff’s] future health care
expenses.” 
(Aguilera v. Loma Linda University Medical Center, supra,
235 Cal.App.4th at 833)
 
Here, the Department submits evidence of the following:
 
·       
Physician services will be provided to Mendez so
long as he chooses to receive such services, the services are determined to be
medically necessary, and he remains Medi-Cal eligible. (Valdez Decl., ¶ 30.)
·       
It is reasonably probable that In-Home
Supportive Services (“IHSS”) will continue to be provided to Mendez so long as
he chooses to receive such services and the services are determined to be
medically necessary. The 24-hour in-home caregiving assistance services
outlined in the Life Care Plan can be performed by a non-licensed home care
provider, such as IHSS. (Garbett Decl., ¶
7.)
·       
Should Mendez require additional non-nursing
assistance at home beyond the State Plan's IHSS program, he may apply for and,
if eligible, enroll in the HCBA Waiver.  Mendez
may then choose to request HCBS WPCS to meet his additional needs, pursuant to
Welfare and Institutions Code section 14132.97. WPCS services are similar to
IHSS as to the type and scope of services. (Id., ¶ 8.)
·       
Should Mendez choose to sign up for additional
hours through the WPCS program, a waiver participant can receive up to, but not
more than, 24 hours of direct care and protective supervision services per day.
WPCS will be provided to him so long as he chooses to apply to receive such
services and the services are determined to be medically necessary. (Id.,
¶ 9.)
·       
Should Mendez choose to apply for in-home
services through HCBS Waivers, 24-hour skilled nursing care will be provided to
him so long as he chooses to enroll to receive such sen'ices and services are
determined to meet applicable medical necessity criteria. (Id., ¶ 10.)
·       
It is reasonably probable that Mendez will
remain eligible for full-scope Medi-Cal so long as his income and/or resources
remain at or below Medi-Cal eligibility limits, for the rest of his life.
(Allen Decl., ¶ 8.)
·       
It is reasonably probable that Medi-Cal will pay
for all of the medical services and medical items enumerated in Mendez’s Life
Care Plan except for services relating to a conservator, fiduciary, and
therapeutic recreation. (Saunders Decl., ¶ 8.) 
·       
Examples of services included in the Life Care
Plan are dental services, hospital outpatient services, in-home services, inpatient
hospitalizations, laboratory and diagnostic services, medical supplies, occupational
therapy, orthotic and prosthetic appliances and supplies, physical therapy. physician
services, psychology services, and speech therapy. (Id., ¶ 9.)
·       
Medi-Cal will continue to operate in California
and provide services to the population currently served, and that it may expand
in the future to provide additional services or to cover additional
populations. (Walker Decl., ¶
24.)
 
Based on the above, the Court determines that it is
reasonably probable that the Department will pay Plaintiff’s future medical
expenses.  The Court makes this finding
based upon reasonable assumptions and estimates; absolute certainty is not
required. (Aguilera, supra, at 832.) Therefore, the Department is
entitled to a reduced value of the Medi-Cal lien in the amount of $253,556.81 calculated
as follows: 
 
$352,652.56 (value of Medi-Cal benefits already provided) 
 
--       $88,163.14 (the Department’s share of
attorney’s fees pursuant to Section 14124.76)
 
--       $10,932.61 (the Department’s share of
litigation costs pursuant to Section 14124.72)
 
=        $253,556.81
 
The Special Motion to Determine Medi-Cal Lien is GRANTED as
set forth above.
