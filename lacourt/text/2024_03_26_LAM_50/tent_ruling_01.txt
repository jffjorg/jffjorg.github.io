Background
Plaintiffs Norma Olaso, deceased,
by and through her personal legal representative and successor in interest,
Nelson Olaso, and Nelson Olaso (jointly, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action on
June 4, 2021 against Defendants Alexandria Care Center, LLC dba Genesis
Healthcare aka Alexandria Care Center, Summit Care, LLC, and Lucy Teroganesyan.
The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) elder abuse and neglect, (2)
violation of patient rights, (3) negligence, and (4) wrongful death. 
Defendants Alexandria Care Center, LLC, Genesis HealthCare LLC, and
Lusine Ter Oganesyan (collectively, “Defendants”) now demur to the first and
second causes of action of the Complaint. Defendants also move to strike
portions of the Complaint. Summit Care, LLC joins in Defendants’ demurrer and
motion to strike. Plaintiffs oppose the demurrer and motion to strike. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter,
the Court notes that Defendants’ counsel’s declarations filed in support of the
demurrer and motion to strike indicate, inter alia, that “[o]n
May 12, 2023…I sent a meet and confer letter to plaintiffs’ counsel Christopher
Oliver indicating that defendants intended to prepare, file, and serve a
demurrer to the elder abuse and violation of resident rights causes of action
contained in plaintiffs’ complaint. The letter set forth the law regarding
elder abuse and corporate ratification and violation of resident rights. The
letter also set forth the grounds to move to strike punitive damage and
attorney fee allegations.” (Laughlin Decls., ¶ 2.) Defendants’ counsel further states that “[o]n May 15, 2023, Mr.
Oliver wrote back to me advising that plaintiffs respectfully disagree with the
defense position and that plaintiffs will not be filing an amended complaint.”
(Laughlin Decls., ¶ 3.) 
The Court notes that Defendants’
counsel’s declarations do not demonstrate that the parties met and
conferred in person, by telephone, or by video
conference, or that Defendants’
counsel attempted to do so. Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis
added.) In addition, “[b]efore filing a motion to
strike pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in
person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining
if an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a), emphasis
added.) Such meeting and conferring
must be done in good faith with an effort to try to resolve the issues subject
to the demurrer and motion to strike. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Defendants’
demurrer and motion to strike is continued to _______________, 2024 at 2
p.m. in Dept. 50. 
Defendants
are¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiffs within 10 days of the date of
this order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the
parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, Defendants are to¿thereafter¿file
and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in
compliance with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a)(3) and Code
of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.
