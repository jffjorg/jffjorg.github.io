Ruling:

Reasoning:
  - The defendants did not meet their burden to show that the plaintiffs' first cause of action for elder abuse/neglect has no merit.
  - The court found that the defendants did not submit admissible evidence to show that they did not withhold or deny goods or services necessary to meet Sanikhatam's basic needs, or that they did not cause Sanikhatam's injuries.
  - The court also found that the defendants did not meet their burden to show that the second, third, and fourth causes of action have no merit.

  - The court sustained some of the plaintiffs' evidentiary objections to Sanikhatam's medical records.
  - The court found that the defendants' request for summary adjudication was improper and defective.
  - The court noted that even if the defendants had properly noticed their request for summary adjudication, they would not have met their burden to show that the plaintiffs' causes of action have no merit.

Order:
  - The court orders the plaintiffs to give notice of this ruling.
  - The court denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication.
