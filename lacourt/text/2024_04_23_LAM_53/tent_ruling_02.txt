court notes that evidentiary objection number 1 “objects to [the moving
defendants’] attempt to seek implied judicial notice as to the truth of the

cited any evidence in support of this assertion in their memorandum of points
and authorities or separate statement. 
(Mot., p. 12:11-18; Def. Separate Statement, pp. 1:23-2:18.)
