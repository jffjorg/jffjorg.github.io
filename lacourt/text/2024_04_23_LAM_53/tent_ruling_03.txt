RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Attorney’s Fees
The court

DISCUSSION
Defendants Teresa Gorman Martinez and Ruben Martinez, trustees of the
GM Defined Benefit Pension Plan (“Defendants”) move the court for an order
awarding them attorney’s fees, to be paid by plaintiffs Shai Harris, as
successor trustee of the H. McClenon Trust dated December 12, 2019 and as
trustee of the ADH Harris Trust dated January 14, 2020 (“Plaintiffs”), in the
total amount of $12,061.
 “In any action on a contract, where the
contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are
incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in
addition to other costs.”  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)  “California
courts liberally construe the term ‘on a contract’ in Civil Code section
1717.  [Citations.]  ‘ “As long as the action ‘involve[s] a contract,
it is “ ‘on [the] contract’ ” within the meaning of section 1717.’ ” ’”  (Yoon
v. Cam IX Trust (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 388, 393 [internal citations omitted].)
First,
the court finds that this action is “on a contract” within the meaning of Civil
Code section 1717.  (Civ. Code,
§ 1717, subd. (a); Yoon, supra, 60 Cal.App.5th at p.
393.)  Plaintiffs’ First Amended
Complaint (1) asserted one cause of action for the administering of an
unconscionable contract or clause, (2) alleged that Defendants administered an
unconscionable contract of adhesion, and (3) requested that the court not
enforce the contract.  (FAC pp. 1:21-25, 3:8-14.)  Thus, the court finds that Plaintiffs’ action
“involve[s] a contract” and therefore is an action on a contract.  (Ibid.; Yoon, supra, 60
Cal.App.5th at p. 393 [internal quotations omitted].) 
Second,
the court finds that the contract that is the subject of this action includes
an attorney’s fees provision. 
Specifically, the “Promissory Note Secured by Deed of Trust” dated
August 25, 2021 (1) states that Plaintiffs, as borrowers, agreed to pay to
“EXHIBIT D, the Beneficiary,” the amount of $738,000; (2) includes as an
attachment “Exhibit D,” which named Defendants under the title “Lender
Vesting;” and (3) includes as an exhibit the “Deed of Trust [¶] and Assignment
of Rents,” which includes a provision stating that (i) “If . . . (2) there is a
legal proceeding that might significantly affect Lender’s interest in the
Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument[,]” then the lender
(i.e., Defendants) may appear in court and “pay[] reasonable attorneys’ fees to
protect its interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security
Instrument,” and (ii) any amounts disbursed by the lender under that section
“shall become additional debt of the Borrower secured by this Security
Instrument.”  (Goldstein Decl., Ex. A, p.
1; Goldstein Decl., Ex. D to Ex. A; Ex. A, Deed of Trust, § 8.)  
The
court finds that this language “provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which
are incurred to enforce [the promissory note], shall be awarded . . . to one of
the parties” (i.e., Defendants), and therefore is an attorney’s fees provision
within the meaning of section 1717.[1]  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)  
Third,
the court finds that Defendants are the prevailing parties on the contract
because the court sustained their demurrer to Plaintiffs’ First Amended
Complaint without leave to amend on August 10, 2023, and thereafter entered
judgment of dismissal in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs on October
30, 2023. 
Fourth,
the court finds that Defendants have established a lodestar amount of $9,367
for reasonable attorney’s fees. 
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. . . . .¿ The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community
for similar work.¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted).)¿ “[T]he verified
time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.”¿ (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359,
396.)¿ 
Defendants have submitted the declaration of Jason Goldstein, who
attests to the qualifications, skill, and experience of the attorneys that
worked on this action.  (Goldstein Decl.,
¶¶ 18-20.)  The court finds that the
hourly rates requested are reasonable. 
(Goldstein Decl., ¶ 14 [stating (1) Goldstein’s hourly charge to be
$515, (2) Tran’s hourly billing rate to be $495, and (3) Neumann’s hourly
billing rate to be $375].)  The court
also finds that the 22.20 hours expended by Defendants’ attorneys in litigating
this action, as verified by counsel, are reasonable.  (Goldstein Decl., ¶ 15; Goldstein Decl.,
Ex. C.) 
Thus, the court finds that Defendants have established a lodestar amount
of $9,367.  The court further grants
Defendants’ request for an award of attorney’s fees incurred in preparing the
pending motion for attorney’s fees.  The
court finds that $1,996.50 ((0.6 hours x Goldstein’s $515 hourly rate) + (4.5
hours x Neumann’s $375 hourly rate)) is reasonable considering that Plaintiffs
did not file an opposition and Defendants therefore did not prepare and file a
reply.  (Goldstein Decl., ¶¶ 24-25.) 
The court therefore grants Defendants’ motion and orders that
Defendants shall recover a total amount of $11,363.50 in attorney’s fees from
Plaintiffs. 
ORDER
            The court grants defendants Teresa
Gorman Martinez and Ruben Martinez, trustees of the GM Defined Benefit Pension
Plan’s motion for attorney’s fees. 
            The court orders that defendants
Teresa Gorman Martinez and Ruben Martinez, trustees of the GM Defined Benefit
Pension Plan, shall recover a total of $11,363.50 in attorney’s fees from
plaintiffs Shai Harris, as successor trustee of the H. McClenon Trust dated
December 12, 2019 and as trustee of the ADH Harris Trust dated January 14, 2020,
pursuant to Civil Code section 1717.
            The court orders defendants Teresa
Gorman Martinez and Ruben Martinez, trustees of the GM Defined Benefit Pension
Plan to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
