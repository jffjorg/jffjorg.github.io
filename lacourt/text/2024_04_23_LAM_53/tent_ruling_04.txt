The court notes that Defendants have also cited a provision in the promissory
note that states that, if the note is not paid when due, then Plaintiffs (as
borrowers) agree to pay “all costs of collection and any reasonable attorneys’
fees incurred by the Beneficiary thereof on account of such collection . . .
.”  (Goldstein Decl., Ex. A, p. 1.)  However, that provision appears to be
expressly limited to the recovery of attorney’s fees incurred in collecting a
debt from Plaintiffs, which is not the subject of this action.   (Ibid.)
