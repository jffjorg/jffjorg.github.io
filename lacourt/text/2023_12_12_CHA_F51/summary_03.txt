And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Kelvin J. Lo, the attorney for Zeeba Automotive Group, to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff. Lo filed the motion on November 9, 2023, and served his client by mail, verifying their mailing address through email correspondence. He also served the remaining parties by mail and cited irreconcilable differences and a deterioration of the attorney-client relationship as the reason for his withdrawal. Since the next hearing date is a case management conference on December 12, 2023, Lo's withdrawal does not raise the risk of unduly prejudicing his client.
