 Case Number:  23CHCV01000    Hearing Date:   December 12, 2023    Dept:  F51 MOTION TO BE
RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV01000

 
Motion filed: 11/9/23 
 
MOVING ATTORNEY: Kelvin J. Lo (“Counsel”)
CLIENT: Plaintiff Zeeba Automotive Group (“Plaintiff”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Counsel as attorney
of record for Plaintiff. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is granted.
 
Here, Counsel filed this motion to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff on 11/9/23. Counsel served his client by
mail, and has filed a declaration stating that the client’s mailing address was
verified by email correspondence. (Decl. of Kelvin J. Lo, ¶ 3b.) Counsel also
filed a proof of service showing that the requisite documents were served on all
remaining parties by mail on 11/9/23.
 
Counsel properly filed an
accompanying notice of the motion using Judicial Council form MC-051, a
declaration in support of his motion using form MC-052, and a proposed order
granting the motion using form MC-053. In the MC-052 declaration, Counsel cited
irreconcilable differences and a deterioration of the attorney-client
relationship such that Counsel must withdraw from representation of Plaintiff. (Lo
Decl., ¶ 2.) The next hearing date in this action is a case management
conference, set for 12/12/23, the same date as the instant hearing. No trial
date has been set. Therefore, Counsel’s withdrawal does not raise the risk of
unduly prejudicing his client. 
 
Accordingly, the statutory
requirements for the motion have been satisfied, and Counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff is GRANTED.
