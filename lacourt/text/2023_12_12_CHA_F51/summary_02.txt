The judge has tentatively ruled that the unopposed motion to set aside the sister-state judgment against the Defendant, WH Willson 16 LLC, is granted. The motion was filed by the Plaintiff, Wilson 495, LLC, after the Montana court vacated the default judgment against the Defendant in the underlying case. The judge agrees with the Plaintiff that the sister-state judgment against the Defendant should also be vacated because the underlying judgment has been rendered invalid. The judge references California Civil Procedure Code sections 473 and 1710.40 in support of the ruling. The judge concludes that the unopposed motion is granted, and the judgment against the Defendant is vacated.
