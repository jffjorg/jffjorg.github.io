ASIDE/VACATE JUDGMENT

Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCP00273

 
Motion filed: 8/21/23
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Wilson 495, LLC, a Montana
limited liability company (“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant WH Willson 16 LLC, a
California limited liability company (“Defendant”)
NOTICE: ok 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order setting aside the Court’s entry
of sister state judgment against Defendant.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is granted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a sister-state judgment
case wherein on 1/11/23, Plaintiff obtained a default judgment against
Defendant in connection with Wilson 495, LLC v. WH Willson 16, LLC,
Cause No. DV-22-408A, Montana Eighteenth Judicial District, Gallatin County
(the “Montana Case”). Plaintiff sought to enforce the judgment in California
and on 6/28/23, obtained a sister-state judgment against Defendant. After this
Court entered judgment, Defendant filed a motion to set aside the default
judgment in the Montana Case. On 7/28/23, the Montana court granted Defendant’s
motion. (Ex. 2 to Decl. of Jordan Cohen.) Because the Montana Case judgment has
effectively been rendered invalid, Plaintiff seeks an order from this Court
setting aside the sister-state judgment.
 
On 8/21/23, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion to set aside. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The court may, … on motion of
either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or
order.” (Code Civ. Proc §
473, subd. (d).) Moreover, a sister-state judgment “may be vacated on any
ground which would be a defense to an action in this state on the sister state
judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
1710.40.)
 
Here, Plaintiff contends that
because the default judgment against Defendant in the underlying Montana Case
has been vacated by that court, the sister-state judgment against Defendant in
this Court should likewise be vacated. The Court agrees. Accordingly, the
unopposed motion is granted.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The unopposed motion is granted, and the judgment against
Defendant is vacated.
