VGrassroots Coalition et
al. v. California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 21STCV03657
Tentative decision on
motion for attorney’s fees: granted in part



 
 
            Petitioners
Grassroots Coalition and the Ballona Ecosystem Education Project (collectively,
“Grassroots”) seeks a $601,992.50 award of attorney’s fees from Respondent
California Department of Fish and Wildlife (“CDFW”).  
            The
court has read and considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply, and
renders the following tentative decision. 
 
            A.
Statement of the Case
            1. Petition
            Petitioners,
which are non-profit organizations, commenced this proceeding on January 28,
2021, alleging a cause of action for mandamus pursuant to the California
Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”).  The
verified Petition alleges in pertinent part as follows.
            The Ballona Wetlands is an approximately 600-acre remnant
of 1700 acres of marshy land in the late 1800s. 
Proponents of the Ballona Wetlands Restoration Project
(“Project”)
have asserted that the Ballona Wetlands was 70% saltwater marsh, which the
Project seeks to restore.  Analysis by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) instead suggests that the area
was a mixture of dynamic and freshwater marsh and vegetated wetland (salt
marsh), not a 70% saltwater monoculture. 

            The constant full-tidal salt marsh
the Project seeks to achieve will mean a massive disturbance of soil.  It would also cause both polluted Santa
Monica Bay water and urban run-off from the Ballona Creek channel to harm the
water quality and habitat in the wetlands. 
The habitat in the Ballona Wetlands is a rare coastal seasonal
freshwater/brackish water marsh ecosystem. 

            Project opponents identified a
freshwater alternative consistent with the historical and natural topography of
Ballona Wetlands, but CDFW ignored that alternative without further
analysis.  
            The project description in the Final
Environmental Impact Report (“FEIR”) is inaccurate and misleading
insofar as it discusses “restoration” but would remove existing freshwater
wetlands and replace it with a non-naturally occurring full tidal estuarine
environment.  
            The FEIR fails to identify a
preferred alternative and instead identifies a range of alternatives in
violation of the CEQA mandate for a stable project description.
            Most
of the studies relied on in the FEIR were prepared before 2012 and do not
reflect the current baseline.  The
FEIR fails to properly study baseline conditions with a proper hydrological
study or analyze the extent to which the wetlands and underlying aquifers
currently are being drained by related development.  
            The
FEIR fails to consider the change in circumstances that CDFW was required to
cap drains as required by a lawsuit filed against it by Grassroots.  
            The
FEIR fails to evaluate impacts to the oil and gas infrastructure caused by the
Project, as well as to aquifers underlying the Ballona Wetlands, which are
potential sources of drinking water.
            Project
opponents raised several unmitigable impacts to wildlife and plants in part
because the Project would excavate 2.5 million cubic yards of sensitive wetland
habitat.  The FEIR fails to analyze and
improperly deferred mitigation for impacts to habitat and wildlife.
            The
FEIR fails to properly evaluate the Project’s impacts to the existing and
historical gas and oil infrastructure, or to the aquifers underlying the
Reserve.  It also fails to properly
evaluate or mitigate direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to several
endangered, protected, and special status wildlife species.  The FEIR instead chose to improperly defer
study and mitigation of impacts to habitats and wildlife.
            The
FEIR does not acknowledge that the Project would violate Coastal Act section
30240 because it disrupts wetlands for flood control purposes.  
            The
FEIR dismisses the Project’s impact on climate change via the illogical
conclusion that the release of carbon dioxide gases from 2.5 million cubic
yards of soil will have an insignificant unmitigable effect.  CDFW did not analyze the sequestration of
these gases by existing wetlands.
            CDFW
did not reasonably respond to comments or discuss disputes between
experts.  Its responses also materially
changed the Draft EIR (“DEIR”) such that it should have been recirculated.  Although the Project is on a registered
Sacred Site, CDFW failed to consult with Native American tribes before FEIR
certification.
            The
FEIR improperly segments future portions of the Project and related projects
that would be necessitated by approval of the Project.
            Petitioners
seek a writ of mandate compelling CDFW to set aside certification of the
Project’s FEIR and vacate related approvals. 
Petitioners also seek an injunction enjoining CDFW from altering the
Reserve’s environment until an EIR is certified that complies with CEQA.  Grassroots also seeks attorney’s fees and
costs. 
 
            2. Course of Proceedings
            On
February 11, 2021, CFDW signed a Notice and Acknowledgement for the Petition.
            On
March 8, 2021, Department 54 (Hon. Maurice A. Leiter) found this case related
to: Defend Ballona Wetlands et al. v. California Department of Fish and
Wildlife, (“Defend”) 21STCP00240; Protect Ballona Wetlands v.
California Department of Fish and Wildlife, (“Protect”) 21STCP00237;
and Ballona Wetlands Land Trust v. CDFW, (“Land Trust”)
21STCP00242, (collectively, “Ballona Cases”).
            On
May 3, 2021, Department 1 reassigned the Ballona Cases to this court (Dept.
85).
            On
July 15, 2021, the court consolidated the Ballona Cases for purpose of trial
only, including consolidated briefs by Petitioners.
            On
August 10, 2021, the court related Grassroots Coalition et. al v. California
State Coastal Conservancy (“Grassroots v. Conservancy”), 21STCP02237
to the Ballona Cases.
            On
August 2, 2022, the parties stipulated to try Grassroots v. Conservancy
separately from the Ballona Cases.
            On
September 28, 2022, CDFW filed Answers to each of the Ballona Cases.
            On
March 14, 2023, the court granted an ex parte application allowing
Petitioners Protect and Land Trust to file a joint reply brief separately from
Petitioners Defend and Grassroots, which would file their own joint reply
brief.
            On
May 17, 2023, the court granted the Petition in part.  CDFW had failed to disclose and analyze the
proper flood control design parameters in the DEIR and FEIR.  The project description also failed to
adequately commit CDFW to specific performance criteria when exercising its
authority to reduce restoration goals based on disturbance to other habitats
without any supplemental environmental review, or to change hydrology or
dissolved oxygen performance goals if current goals are not met.  The issued writ would require CDFW to set
aside the FEIR and any Project approvals, prepare and certify a legally
adequate EIR for the Project if it chooses to proceed, and suspend any Project
activity that could result in an adverse change or alteration to the physical
environment until then.
            On
July 14, 2023, Grassroots appealed the court’s decision.
            On
August 8, 2023, CDFW filed a cross-appeal.
            On
September 12, 2023, Grassroots was notified its appeal was in default for
failure to timely pay the deposit for a reporter’s transcript or the $50 fee
for holding the deposit in trust.
            On
September 14, 2023, CDFW filed abandonment of its cross-appeal.
            
            B.
Applicable Law
            CCP section 1021.5 (“section 1021.5”) codifies the “private
attorney general” exception to the general rule that each side bears its own
fees unless the parties contracted otherwise.  See CCP §1021. 
Section 1021.5 permits a trial court to award fees to a successful party in any
action that: “has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting
the public interest if (a) a significant benefit has been conferred on the
general public or a large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden
of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such
fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery. 
The issue is committed to the trial court’s discretion.  Flannery v.
California Highway Patrol, (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 634. 
            Courts
take a “broad, pragmatic view of what constitutes a ‘successful party’” in
order to effectuate the policy underlying section 1021.5.  Graham v.
DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 565.  The party seeking
attorney’s fees need not prevail on all
of its alleged claims in order to qualify for
an award.  Harbor v. Deukmejian, (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1078, 1103; Daniels
v. McKinney, (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 42, 55.  The party is considered
successful under section 1021.5 if the litigation “contributed substantially to
remedying the conditions at which it was directed.” Planned Parenthood v.
Aakhus, (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 162, 174.  In other words, the
“successful” party under section 1021.5 is the party that succeeds on “any
significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties
sought in bringing suit.”  Maria P. v. Riles, (1987) 43 Cal.3d
1281, 1292; see Tipton-Whittingham v. City of Los Angeles, (2004)
34 Cal.4th 604, 610.  A prevailing party who qualifies for an award under
section 1021.5 are entitled to compensation for all hours reasonably spent by
their counsel.  Serrano v. Unruh, (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 632–33. 
            Unlike the
separate substantial benefit doctrine, “the ‘significant benefit’ that will
justify an attorney fee award need not represent a ‘tangible’ asset or a
‘concrete’ gain but, in some cases, may be recognized simply from the
effectuation of a fundamental constitutional or statutory policy.” Woodland
Hills Residents Assn., Inc. v. City Council, (1979) 23 Cal.3d 917,
939.  “[T]he benefit may be conceptual or doctrinal and need not be actual or
concrete; further, the effectuation of a statutory or constitutional purpose
may be sufficient.”  Braude v. Automobile Club of Southern Cal.,
(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 994, 1011.  Moreover, the extent of the public
benefit need not be great to justify an attorney fee award.  See, e.g.,
Protect Our Water v. County of Merced, (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 488, 496
(significant public benefit where litigation prompted agency to improve methods
of creating and managing its CEQA records). The trial court determines “the
significance of the benefit, as well as the size of the class receiving
benefit, from a realistic assessment, in light of all the pertinent
circumstances, of the gains which have resulted in a particular case.”  Woodland
Hills, supra, 23 Cal.3d at 939–940. 
            The party
seeking attorney’s fees must show that the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit
placed a burden on the plaintiff “out of proportion to his individual stake in
the matter.” Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal. 3d at 941. 
Although cases refer to this requirement as the “financial burden” criterion,
nothing in the language of CCP section 1021.5 limits the consideration of the
necessity and financial burden clause to solely financial interests.  Hammond
v. Agran, (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 115, 125.  “The idea is that the
litigation for which fees are claimed must transcend one's interests, whether
pecuniary or not.”  Id. at 127.  The question is whether
advancement of the public interest was merely coincidental to the attainment of
the party’s personal goals.  Bowman v. City of¿Berkeley (“Bowman”)
(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 173, 181.  The party seeking attorney’s fees bears
the burden of establishing that its litigation costs transcend its personal
interests.  Save Open Space Santa Monica Mountains v. Superior Court,
(“Save Open Space”) (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 235, 247.  The trial
court's application of the financial burden criterion involves a “realistic and
practical comparison of the litigant's personal interest with the cost of
suit.” Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. Bd. of
Supervisors (“Families Unafraid”), (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 505, 515. 
            The petitioner bears
the burden of proof as to the “reasonableness” of any fee claim.  CCP §1033.5(c)(5).  This burden requires competent evidence as to
the nature and value of the services rendered. 
Martino v. Denevi, (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.  “Testimony of an attorney as to the number of
hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of
attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” Id.  “‘The reasonable market value of the
attorney's services is the measure of a reasonable hourly rate.  [Citations.] This standard applies regardless
of whether the attorneys claiming fees charge nothing for their services,
charge at below-market or discounted rates, represent the client on a straight
contingent fee basis, or are in-house counsel.  [Citations.]’” 
Center For Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino, (“Center”)
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 619.
A plaintiff’s
verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs,
expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred.  See Hadley v. Krepel, (1985)
167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.  “In challenging
attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is
the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged,
with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.  General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”  Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez,
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.
            In determining whether
the requested attorney’s fees are reasonable, the court’s “first step involves
the lodestar figure—a calculation based on the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the lawyer’s hourly rate.  The lodestar figure may then be adjusted,
based on consideration of facts specific to the case, in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”  Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp.,
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774 (“Gorman”).  In adjusting the lodestar figure, the court
may consider the nature and difficulty of the litigation, the amount of money
involved, the skill required and employed to handle the case, the attention
given, the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case. EnPalm
LLC v. Teitler, (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774; see also PLCM
Group, Inc. v. Drexler, (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.
 
            C.
Statement of Facts
            1.
Petitioner’s Evidence
            a.
The Court’s Decision
            Grassroots’
primary goal in this action was to strike down CDFW’s approval of the Ballona
Wetlands Restoration Project and the certification of the FEIR.  Cardiff Decl., ¶2.  This case was the most important event in
Grassroots’ existence, and the Petition’s denial would have invalidated 30 years
of advocacy.  Cardiff Decl., ¶24.
            The
court’s May 17, 2023 decision (“Decision”) granted the Petition in part.  Cardiff Decl., Ex. A (“Decision”).  It noted that the substantial evidence review
was appropriate for any factual determinations. 
Decision, p. 5.  This was
especially true when the agency has been delegated the regulatory authority in
a particular field.  Decision, p. 5.  Here, CDFW’s mission is to manage
California's diverse, fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the habitats upon
which they depend, for their ecological values and for their use and enjoyment
of the public.  Decision, p. 5.  
            The
Decision divided the Petitioners’ arguments into seven points: (1) it was
impossible to identify the preferred Project from the three restoration
alternatives in the project description, (2) the project description's
reference to “restoration” was misleading, (3) the project description failed
to include the correct flood control design standard, (4) the Project’s
restoration performance criteria were indefinite and lacked a binding
framework, (5) the FEIR failed to include a vegetation map, (6) the FEIR failed
to consider a reasonable range of alternatives by excluding a freshwater
alternative, and (7) the FEIR’s
analysis of environmental impacts was inadequate.  Decision, p. 20.
            The
court agreed with two of these arguments. 
As to flood control designs, the FEIR failed to list the 68,000 cubic-feet-per-second
standard the Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) would impose, analyze the flood
impacts of the Project under that flow standard, and analyze the wildlife and
habitat impacts of a levee design change under that standard.  Decision, p. 35.
            As
to restoration performance criteria, the conceptual plan authorized shifts in
target habitats or performance goals if CDFW determines that corrective action
to meet the original criteria would cause unacceptable disturbance to other
habitats or animal populations. 
Decision, p. 45.  CDFW would not
need a supplemental environmental review or obtain public comment to make this
shift.  Decision, p. 45.  This makes the environmental cost of the
Project as a whole unascertainable. 
Decision, p. 46.  A commitment to
supplemental review could easily rectify this, but the FEIR did not provide for
it.  Decision, p. 46.  
            The
Decision required a writ directing CDFW to set aside the FEIR and any Project approvals,
prepare and certify a legally adequate EIR for the Project if it chooses to
proceed, and suspend any Project activity that could result in an adverse
change or alteration to the physical environment until CDFW complies.  Decision, p. 66.  
            Although
some portions of the Decision were adverse to Grassroots, the result is
favorable.  Cardiff Decl., ¶27.  It compels CDFW to set aside the EIR, reanalyze
the flood calculations, and revise, recirculate, and reconsider
public comments on the new EIR.  Cardiff Decl., ¶27.  Grassroots can now rely on this additional administrative
process to advocate to prevent the bulldozing, excavating and burying of the
ecological reserve.  Cardiff Decl., ¶27.
            Grassroots
only appealed the Decision because it was concerned that certain issues, such
as whether project goals can preclude consideration of a freshwater alternative,
would otherwise become precedent in administrative or judicial
proceedings.  Cardiff Decl., ¶27.  
 
            b. Reasonableness of Fees
            (1) Hourly Rate
            Todd Cardiff (“Cardiff”) graduated
from law school in 2002 and founded the environmental law firm Coast Law Group
LLP in 2003.  Cardiff Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.  He sold his partnership and started his own
practice in 2008.  Cardiff Decl.,
¶6.  He has since been a primary attorney
on numerous environmental, public interest, and free speech cases.  Cardiff Decl., ¶8.  
            Cardiff worked this case at a
partial contingency rate of $100 per hour to cover overhead.  Cardiff Decl., ¶3.  The extended litigation timeline and
Grassroots’ inability to pay this fee further reduced the effective rate.  Cardiff Decl., ¶3.  
            Cardiff’s last approved rate was
$700 per hour in McCann v. City of San Diego (“McCann”), Case No.
37-2019-00011813-CU-TT-CTL in August 2022. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2.  The city
did not contest Cardiff’s proposed rate of $700 per hour.  Cardiff Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2.  The McCann court held that $700 per
hour was on the high end of the range a client might expect to pay attorneys
with similar experience for similar work with similar stakes in San Diego
during the relevant timeframe.  Cardiff Decl.,
¶9, Ex. 2.  The blended hourly rate with
the two other attorneys in that case was $550.58.  Cardiff Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2.  
            Paul Best (“Best”) began work as a
paralegal in 2000 after years of work in media production.  Best Decl., ¶3.  The last case he worked on was a contract
case where the contract had an attorney’s fee provision.  Best Decl., ¶4.  His approved rate in that fee motion was $125
per hour.  Best Decl., ¶4.  $125 is well within the range of fair market
rates for a paralegal with that experience. 
Best Decl., ¶4.
            In 2017, the court in United
Walnut Taxpayers v. Mt. San Antonio Community College District, Case No.
BC576587, approved an hourly rate of $175 for Best.  Cardiff Decl., ¶10.  There is no reason the fair market rate for
his work would have fallen since then. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶10.  
            Paralegal Kimberly Coffin (“Coffin”)
has been a paralegal for 20 years. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶11.  She was
employed at another firm and only worked for Cardiff for one day in this
case.  Cardiff Decl., ¶11.  Cardiff believes Coffin’s old firm charged
$100 per hours for her work, but he could not obtain a declaration from Coffin
to confirm this.  Cardiff Decl., ¶11.
 
            (2). Hours
            (a). Billings
            The Legal Billing software tracks
time spent on tasks by the second, but Cardiff converts this to tenths of an
hour for billing.  Cardiff Decl., ¶12.  Based on Legal Billing’s data, Cardiff
prepared spreadsheets reflecting the time spent on this case between January
2021 and September 2023.  Cardiff Decl.,
¶13, Ex. 3.  They show that Cardiff spent
434.20 hours on this case, Best 12.7 hours, and Coffin 5 hours.  Cardiff Decl., ¶14, Ex. 3.   
            Of Cardiff’s 434.20 hours, he spent 32.1
hours preparing this motion for attorney’s fees.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3.  He expects to spend another 20 hours
reviewing the opposition and preparing the reply to this motion.  Cardiff Decl., ¶¶ 14-15.
            Of the 434.20 – 32.1 = 402.1 hours
Cardiff spent on the merits of the case, 6.2 hours were to draft the
Petition.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3.  7.9 hours were to draft notices of
commencement, notices of acknowledgement, notices to the attorney general,
notices to related agencies, final judgments, and other routine documents.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3, pp. 3, 7, 12, 14,
20, 34, 38.
            Other items discuss administrative
tasks.  10.9 hours were for other forms
of document preparation, exhibit preparation, bookmarking, and file format
conversion.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3,
pp. 22, 30, 36. Cardiff spent 3.1 hours to prepare and procure the record,
including through stipulations and emails. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3, pp. 10-13, 19-21.  
            After receipt of the record, Cardiff
then spent 30.7 hours to review the record, EIR, and other evidence.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3, pp. 4, 19-20, 23,
28.  He has also billed 17 hours for
legal research and review of notice issues, statutes, case law, definitions,
and the judge.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex.
3, pp. 1, 4, 5, 7, 11, 16-17, 19, 22, 27, 35.
            As to the briefs on the merits,
Cardiff spent 96.4 hours to draft the opening brief and 56.8 to draft the reply
and related requests for judicial notice. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3, pp. 23-26, 28-32.  Of these, 36.1 of the opening brief’s hours
and 18.3 of the reply brief’s hours were for “content and space”, to check
citations or formatting, or to integrate or revise existing drafts.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3, pp. 25-26, 28,
31-32.
 
            (b). Rationale
            Although Cardiff’s hours may seem
unreasonable, they reflect the nature and complexity of the case, the FEIR, the
administrative record, and CDFW as a respondent.  Cardiff Decl., ¶16.  The FEIR asserted that the Project would
provide a significant benefit to the environment.  Cardiff Decl., ¶17.  Cardiff realized that demonstrating this and
overcoming the presumption the CDFW enjoyed would require a significant
investigation.  Cardiff Decl., ¶17.  
            A cursory reading of Project site
studies seems to support CDFW’s position that it used to be an open water
tidally influenced salt marsh.  Cardiff
Decl., ¶18.  Cardiff consulted Margot
Griswold (“Griswold”) in numerous calls to understand the ecology of the
Ballona Wetlands.  Cardiff Decl., ¶18.  Cardiff’s hours spent talking to “MG” include
1.9 hours on May 22, 2021, 0.7 hours on February 23, 2022, 0.4 hours on January
27, 2023, 0.7 hours on May 1, 2023, and 0.2 hours on May 7, 2023.  Cardiff Decl., Ex. 3, pp. 9, 17, 28, 32.
            Cardiff also contacted Travis
Longcore (“Longcore”), an expert whose studies CDFW has cited.  Cardiff Decl., ¶19.  His advice helped form arguments why the
Project did not constitute “restoration.” 
Cardiff Decl., ¶19.  That argument
did not prevail in court, but it had substantial factual merit and was
reasonable to develop.  Cardiff Decl.,
¶19.  Longcore also explained how the
levees and public access trails would fragment the habitat.  Cardiff Decl., ¶19.  Cardiff spent 0.2 hours talking to “TL” on
May 8, 2023.  Cardiff Decl., Ex. 3, p.
33.
            Cardiff consulted two civil
engineers, Kevin Wohlmut (“Wohlmut”)
and the anonymous “TM.”  Cardiff Decl.,
¶20.  They possess specialized knowledge
of flood control levees and flood calculations. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶20.  This helped
Cardiff understand why the FEIR’s use of improper flood control standards
undermined its ability to evaluate the Project’s impact.  Cardiff Decl., ¶20.  Cardiff spoke to KW for 0.5 hours on December
9, 2021, and 0.4 hours on January 10, 2022. 
Cardiff Decl., Ex. 3, p. 15.  Cardiff
spoke to TM for 0.9 hours on December 10, 2021, 0.1 hours on January 10, 2022,
and 0.1 hours on January 11, 2022.  Cardiff
Decl., Ex. 3, pp. 15-16.
            Various experts in geological survey
maps also questioned the 1.7 million cubic yards of fill allegedly placed in
one area.  Cardiff Decl., ¶21.  TM provided topographical maps showing no elevation change in the area from before
the construction at issue to afterwards. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶21.  Grassroots
eventually chose not to brief this argument due to space limitations, but it
was reasonable to investigate the argument as a challenge to one of the
justifications supporting the “restoration” project.  Cardiff Decl., ¶21.  
            Cardiff had to intensively review
the 100,000-page administrative record. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶22.  For example,
the applicable Corps requirements preclude burrowing animals from living on the
levees.  Cardiff Decl., ¶22.  To find this, Cardiff had to locate a draft
Operation and Maintenance Plan that the record’s index only identified as part
of the “project description.”  Cardiff
Decl., ¶22.  
The Operation and
Maintenance Plan cited the Army Corps Standards, “Guidelines for Landscape
Planting and Vegetation Management at Levees, Floodwalls, Embankment Dams, and
Appurtenant Structures” (“Guidelines”). 
Cardiff Decl., ¶22.  Cardiff had
to find those Guidelines online.  Cardiff
Decl., ¶22.  These Guidelines are what
require and describe the removal of various burrowing animals on “earthen dams”
like levees.  Cardiff Decl., ¶22.  An outdated copy of the Guidelines was also
in the record, but it would not have been available to any members of the
public who wanted to comment on the FEIR. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶22.  
            The original draft of the opening
merits brief was 60 pages, 20 more than the 40 pages the court authorized.  Cardiff Decl., ¶23.  Cardiff worked 15 hours a day for three days
to consider the different arguments, decide which ones to delete, and edit the
remaining ones for clarity and accuracy. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶23, Ex. 3.  Cardiff
was also the primary drafter of the combined reply brief.  Cardiff Decl., ¶23.  
            Best spent 3.5 hours for this case
on January 26, 2023, 8.4 on April 21, and 0.8 to prepare his declaration in
this action.  Best Decl., ¶5; Cardiff
Decl., Ex. 3.  He has spent a total of
12.7 hours on this case.  Best Decl.,
¶5.  Cardiff has ensured these hours only
reflect time worked on this case, not the related cases.  Cardiff Decl., ¶10.
 
            (3) Lodestar and Multiplier
            Based on the listed hours, the total
lodestar as of the opening brief for this motion is 434.20 x $700 = $303,940
for Cardiff, 12.7 x $175 = $2,222.50 for Best, and 5 x $100 = $500 for Coffin
for a total of $303,940 + $2,222.50 + $500 = $306,662.50.  Cardiff Decl., ¶14.  The anticipated 20 hours for the reply to this
fee motion add 20 x $700 = $14,000 in fees, for a total of $320,622.50.  Cardiff Decl., ¶14.
            Cardiff took this case at a
substantially reduced rate.  Cardiff
Decl., ¶25.  This was a highly technical
case with a large administrative record, a highly deferential standard of
review, and a substantial risk of losing the case.  Cardiff Decl., ¶25.  Failure would have financially hurt Cardiff’s
office and Grassroots.  Cardiff Decl.,
¶25.  The case load requirements
precluded Cardiff from accepting other CEQA work, including an offer from Preserve
Wild Santee.  Cardiff Decl., ¶26.  Cardiff also had to work over the
holidays.  Cardiff Decl., ¶26, Ex.
3.    
            Cardiff therefore asks for a 2.0
lodestar multiplier for his hours. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶25.  This
multiplier would exclude the 32.1 hours he spent to prepare this motion and the
anticipated 20 hours for the reply to this fee motion ($14,000).   Cardiff Decl., ¶29.  It would therefore add 402.1 x $700 = $281,470
to the requested fees.  Cardiff Decl.,
¶29.  The total requested amount is
therefore $601,992.50.  Cardiff Decl.,
¶30.
 
            2.
CDFW’s Evidence
            CDFW
has settled the attorney’s fees and costs in the related actions.  Sasaki Decl., Exs. A-C.  The settlement agreements for Protect and
Land Trust identify those petitioners as the parties that drafted the sections
of the opening brief concerning the two issues on which the court granted the
Petition.  Sasaki Decl., Exs. A-B.  Counsel for the two petitioners spent 233.9
hours and 248 hours on this case, respectively. 
Sasaki Decl., Exs. A-B.  The
settlement agreements awarded $128,975 in fees for Protect and $146,015.50 in
fees for Land Trust.  Sasaki Decl., Exs.
A-B. 
            At
the May 9, 2023 hearing, the Petitioners for the four actions explained each of
them wrote specific sections of the opening brief.  Sasaki Decl., Ex. D.  They decided to have each attorney address
the arguments that attorney wrote. 
Sasaki Decl., Ex. D.  Counsel for Protect
argued the flood control-related issues. 
Sasaki Decl., Ex. D.  Counsel for
Land Trust argued the FEIR should not allow CDFW to change performance criteria
at will.  Sasaki Decl., Ex. D.  
 
            D.
Analysis
            Petitioner
Grassroots seeks attorney’s fees based on a $320,622.50 lodestar plus a 2.0
multiplier for all but 32.1 of Cardiff’s hours spent on the fee motion, for a
total of $601,992.50.  
 
            1.
Entitlement
            a. Successful Party
            Courts take a “broad, pragmatic view of what constitutes a
‘successful party’” in order to effectuate the policy underlying section
1021.5.  Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., supra, 34 Cal.4th
at 565.  A successful party under section 1021.5 is the party that
succeeds on “any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the
benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.”  Maria P. v. Riles, supra,
43 Cal.3d at 1292.
            Grassroots’ primary goal in
this action was to strike down CDFW’s approval of the Ballona Wetlands
Restoration Project and the certification of the FEIR.  Cardiff Decl., ¶2.  The Decision ordered CDFW to set aside the FEIR and
any Project approvals, prepare and certify a legally adequate EIR for the
Project if it chooses to proceed, and suspend any Project activity that could
result in an adverse change or alteration to the physical environment until
CDFW complies.  Mot. at 7; Decision, p. 66.  DCFW does not dispute that Grassroots is a successful party for the
purposes of section 1021.5. 
 
            b. Enforcement
of an Important Right Affecting the Public Interest 
            The
first prong of the section 1021.5 test — whether a petitioner’s action has
resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest
— requires a determination of the strength or societal importance of the right
involved.  Roybal v. Governing Bd. of
Salinas City Elementary School Dist., (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1143,
1148.  The right, whether constitutional
or statutory, must be an important right affecting the public interest, not
something involving trivial or peripheral public policies.  Ibid. 
The societal importance of a right generally is determined by
realistically assessing the significance of that right in terms of its
relationship to the achievement of fundamental legislative goals.  Robinson v. City of Chowchilla, (2011)
202 Cal.App.4th 382, 394.  
            Litigation
brought to enforce the provisions of CEQA has been held to involve important
rights affecting the public interest, and the private attorney general theory
applies to such suits.  Mot. at 7; San
Bernardino Valley Audubon Soc'y v. County of San Bernardino (1984) 155
Cal.App.3d 738, 754.  
The court found that the FEIR failed to account for the
impact of the Project under the flow standards that the Corps would
impose.  Decision, p. 35.  The Project also had unascertainable impacts
insofar as it allowed CDFW to change its performance goals without supplemental
environmental review.  Decision, pp.
45-46.  The writ prevented CDFW from
implementing this Project with these deficiencies.  This outcome affected a public interest.
 
            c. Significant Benefit Conferred
on the General Public
            The
second prong of the section 1021.5 test is whether plaintiff’s action has
conferred a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, on the
general public or a large class of persons. 
The trial court must determine the significance of the benefit and the
size of the group favorably impacted by making a realistic assessment, in light
of all the circumstances, of the gains which have resulted in a particular
case.  Bui v. Nguyen, (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1357, 1366.
            Title
14 of the California Code of Regulations (“14 CCR”) defines the Ballona
Wetlands as an ecological reserve.  14
CCR §630(b)(10).  All ecological reserves
are maintained for the primary purpose of developing a statewide program for
protection of rare, threatened, or endangered native plants, wildlife, aquatic
organisms, and specialized terrestrial or aquatic habitat types.  14 CCR §630(a). 
            The
further along a project is before environmental review begins, the stronger the
incentive to ignore environmental concerns that could be dealt with more easily
at an early stage of the project.  Laurel
Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California, (1988) 47
Cal. 3d 376, 395.  Mot.at 8. 
The writ has prevented CDFW from proceeding with the Project
or causing an adverse change to the physical environment before it takes
additional steps to consider the impact. 
Decision, p. 66.  The Petition
helped protect an ecological reserve and yielded a significant benefit to the
public at large.
 
            d. Necessity and Financial Burden
of Private Enforcement 
            The
third prong asks whether the necessity and financial burden of private
enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.  This prong encompasses two issues: (1)
whether private enforcement was necessary and (2) whether the financial burden
of private enforcement warrants subsidizing the successful party’s
attorneys.  Lyons v. Chinese Hospital
Assn., (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1348.
            When
a private suit is against the governmental agencies that bear responsibility
for the action at issue, the necessity of private, as compared to public,
enforcement is often clear. Mot. at 9; Woodland Hills, supra, 23 Cal.3d at 941; Committee to
Defend Reproductive Rights v. A Free Pregnancy Center (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d
633, 639.  
            Grassroots
brought suit against CDFW to ensure that the Project complied with CEQA.  Mot. at 9. 
Private enforcement was necessary.
            Grassroots
does not own any property or business affected by the state of the Ballona
Wetlands.  Mot. at 9.  CDFW does not dispute that Grassroots does
not obtain any financial benefit from the Decision.  The financial burden of private enforcement
makes a section 1021.5 attorney’s fee award appropriate.
 
            e.
Conclusion
            Grassroots
is entitled to attorney’s fees under section 1021.5.
 
            2.
Reasonableness
            The court employs the lodestar
analysis when looking to determine the reasonableness of an attorney’s fee
award.  The lodestar figure is calculated
by multiplying the number of hours reasonably spent by the reasonable market
billing rate.  Serrano v. Priest,
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 48.
 
            a. Hourly Rate
            Generally, the reasonable
hourly rate used for the lodestar calculation is the rate prevailing in the
community for similar work.  Center, supra,
188 Cal.App.4th at 616.  In making its
calculation, the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the
legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney
requesting fees, the difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that
skill was applied, and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing
fees in the community and rate determinations in other cases.  569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc., (“569 East”) (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 426, 437.  
            CDFW
does not dispute Best’s hourly rate of $175 or Coffin’s rate of $100.  Cardiff Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.  It asserts that Cardiff’s $700 hourly rate is
excessive.  Opp. at 10.  
            Cardiff
bases his rate on McCann, where the city did not contest his proposed
hourly rate of $700.  Cardiff Decl., ¶9,
Ex. 2.  Grassroots cites Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy, 215 Cal. App. 4th 972, 1009, which noted
that rate determinations for the plaintiff’s attorney in other cases can be satisfactory
evidence of the prevailing market rate. 
Reply at 7.  
            The
court is familiar with the prevailing rate in Los Angeles for this type of
case.  Cardiff’’s proposed hourly rate of
$700 is too high.  It is true that the
court must impose the prevailing rate for attorneys in the Los Angeles
community and not the lower rate prevailing in the San Diego area.  However, even the court in McCann
acknowledged a rate of $700 per hour was on the “high end” of the range a client
might expect to pay attorneys with similar experience for similar work with
similar stakes in San Diego during the relevant timeframe.  Cardiff Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2.  Cardiff was also only one of three attorneys
in that case, whose blended rate was $550.58. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶9, Ex. 2.  Opp. at
10-11.[1]
Cardiff’s hourly rate is reduced to $500.  Best’s hourly rate remains $175, and Coffin’s
hourly rate remains $100.
 
            b.
Reasonableness of Hours
            The petitioner bears the burden of
proof as to the reasonableness of any fee claim.  CCP §1033.5(c)(5).  This burden requires competent evidence as to
the nature and value of the services rendered. 
Martino v. Denevi, (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.  “Testimony of an attorney as to the number of
hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of
attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed time records.” Id.
            “In challenging
attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is
the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged,
with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.  General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”  Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez,
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488; Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guarantee Assn., (2008) 163 Cal. App. 4th 550, 564.
            CDFW asserts that Cardiff’s
434.20 billed hours are excessive.  Opp.
at 6.  Of these 434.20 hours, Cardiff
spent 402.1 hours on the merits case and 32.1 hours preparing this motion for
attorney’s fees.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex.
3.  Cardiff expects to spend 20 hours
preparing the reply for the fee motion. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶¶ 14-15.  CDFW
does not dispute Best’s 12.7 hours or Coffin’s 5 hours.  Cardiff Decl., ¶14, Ex. 3.  
            Grassroots acknowledges
that Cardiff’s billed hours may seem unreasonable.  Cardiff Decl., ¶16.  Cardiff argues they reflect the complex
nature of the case, the EIR, the administrative record, and the CDFW as a
respondent.  Cardiff Decl., ¶16.  Cardiff had to overcome the deferential
standard of review that CDFW enjoyed as the agency responsible for ecological
preservation.  Cardiff Decl., ¶17;
Decision, p. 5.  Cardiff had to consult
with experts about the original nature of the Project site, whether the Project
constituted “restoration,” why the FEIR’s use of improper flood control standards undermined its
ability to evaluate the Project’s impact, and the difference in topographical maps.  Cardiff Decl., ¶¶ 18-21.
            CDFW notes that it
settled with the Petitioners in Protect and Land Trust, and
the settlement agreements state that the Petitioners’ attorneys spent 233.9 and
248 hours, respectively, on this action. 
Sasaki Decl., Exs. A-B.  CDFW asks
the court to reduce Grassroots’ hours to a comparable amount.  Opp. at 7-8. 

CDFW cites no authority authorizing the use of settlement
agreements to determine the lodestar, and Grassroots is correct that the
Petitioners in those two cases may have negotiated the number of hours and
reduced their fee demand.  Reply at 2.  The court also does not believe that the settlement
agreements can be considered for the truth of the hours expended by the
attorneys for these other Petitioners.  The
court does find, however, that the hours listed in the settlement agreements are
reasonable.  
            The
settlement agreements correctly state that Protect and Land Trust were
responsible for the only two successful arguments at trial.  Sasaki Decl., Exs. A-B.  Opp. at 7.  Grassroots argues that Cardiff was the first
attorney to work on the consolidated opening brief and the last to edit
it.  Cardiff Decl., ¶23, Ex. 3.  Reply at 3. 
He performed legal research on project description issues, identified adverse
case law, and supplied the other attorneys with documents from the record to
support their arguments.  Reply at
3.  
Crediting these points, the fact remains that the counsel in
Protect and Land Trust wrote the prevailing sections of the joint brief, and also
argued those issues at trial.  All Petitioners
chose to rely for argument at trial on the attorney who prepared that particular
section of the joint opening brief.  Sasaki
Decl., Ex. D.  Protect prepared and argued
the flood control-related issues, and Land Trust prepared and argued the issue
that the FEIR should not allow the CDFW to change performance criteria at will.
 Sasaki Decl., Ex. D.  These are the arguments on which the
Petitioners prevailed.  Decision, pp. 35,
45-46, 66.  The Petitioners did not
prevail on any of Grassroots’ arguments, and this fact warrants a significant
reduction in Cardiff’s hours.
CDFW also correctly asserts that less experienced lawyers
with lower rates could have performed a significant portion of the work Cardiff
performed.  See SOURCE, supra,
235 Cal. App. 4th at 1186-87.  Grassroots
argues that SOURCE does not support adjusting Cardiff’s hourly rate to
account for the overbilling.  Reply at
6.  There, the real party-in-interest
pointed to specific hours partners spent on administrative tasks the law clerks
could have performed.  235 Cal. App. 4th
at 1187.  If CDFW had identified specific
items in the Cardiff’s spreadsheet, Grassroots would have agreed to cuts for
those hours.  Reply at 6.  CDFW’s broad cites to pages of the
spreadsheet that it asserts reflect such ministerial tasks are
insufficient.  Opp. at 10; Reply at
7.  
CDFW’s failure to seek specific reductions for some issues
does not mean that the court cannot reduce Cardiff’s hours when they are
unreasonable.  
Cardiff asserts he has extensive experience as the primary
attorney on numerous environmental cases. 
Reply at 6; Cardiff Decl., ¶8. 
This case was also the most important event in Grassroots’ existence,
and the Petition’s denial would have invalidated 30 years of advocacy.  Cardiff Decl., ¶24.  Cardiff therefore would not have trusted a
junior attorney to perform the disputed work. 
Reply at 6.  
Cardiff’s’ concern that the job must be done correctly and
not left to an associate is undermined by the fact that he is apparently a sole
practitioner.  More important, CDFW
cannot be tasked with paying attorney fees for clerical and other work that
should be paid at a lower rate.  Cardiff expended 10.9 hours for document
preparation, exhibit preparation, bookmarking, and file format conversion.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3, pp. 22, 30, 36.  He also spent 3.1 hours to prepare and
procure the record.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29,
Ex. 3, pp. 10-13, 19-21.  These are
clerical tasks and Cardiff should have been able to trust his paralegal of 20
years to undertake them.  Opp. at
10.  
            Although some tasks required
a lawyer instead of a paralegal, an attorney billing at a lower rate could have
conducted these tasks.  Cardiff spent 7.9
hours to draft routine documents such as notices of commencement, notices of
acknowledgement, notices to the attorney general, notices to related agencies.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3, pp. 3, 7, 12, 14,
20, 34, 38.  None of these require a
particular level of expertise.  Cardiff also
billed 17 hours for legal research and review of notice issues, statutes, case
law, definitions, and the judge.  Cardiff
Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3, pp. 1, 4, 5, 7, 11, 16-17, 19, 22, 27, 35.  Although Cardiff needed to understand the
issues, he did not need expertise to conduct the research itself.  
            Cardiff spent 96.4
hours to draft the opening brief and 56.8 to draft the reply and related
requests for judicial notice.  Cardiff
Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3, pp. 23-26, 28-32.  This
is a total of 153.2 hours for drafting the briefs.  54.4 of these hours were for “content and
space”, to check citations or formatting, or to integrate or revise existing
drafts.  Cardiff Decl., ¶29, Ex. 3, pp.
25-26, 28, 31-32.  This is excessive,
particularly since Cardiff was responsible for only a portion of the briefs.[2]
CDFW notes that, although Grassroots cites Cardiff’s
consultation with experts, the consultations actually took little of Cardiff’s
billed time.  Opp. at 8.  He spent 3.9 hours with Griswold (Cardiff
Decl., Ex. 3, pp. 9, 17, 28, 32), 0.2 hours with Longcore (Cardiff Decl., Ex. 3,
p. 33), 0.9 hours with Wohlmut (Cardiff Decl., Ex. 3, p. 15), and 1.1 hours
with an expert only known as TM (Cardiff Decl., Ex. 3, pp. 15-16).  Opp. at 8.
            CDFW
questions Cardiff’s assertion that editing the briefs took substantial
time.  Opp. at 9; Cardiff Decl., ¶23.  The court authorized a 40-page opening brief,
and Cardiff asserts that the draft brief was 60 pages.  Cardiff Decl., ¶23.  However, the court also authorized
Petitioners to file an appendix with no page limit, and the Petitioners filed a
25-page appendix.  Opp. at 9, n. 2.  CDFW questions why one attorney would
disproportionately bear the burden of editing the briefs.  Opp. at 9. 
Cardiff adequately explains that he performed the final edit to get the
opening brief within the 40-page limit. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶23.  Cardiff’s
editing is not a basis to reduce his hours.
In sum, CDFW’s general objections are well taken.  Cardiff
neither drafted nor argued the prevailing issues and instead focused on issues
that were lost at trial.  These facts
warrant a significant reduction in Cardiff’s hours to be reasonable.  He further performed tasks that could have
been performed by a paralegal or lower billed attorney.  The court concludes that Cardiff expended 246
reasonable hours on the merits.  
 
            (2).
Fee Motion
            Cardiff
billed 32.1 hours on his fee motion and anticipates another 20 hours for the
reply and to attend the hearing.  Cardiff
Decl., ¶¶ 14-15, 29, Ex. 3.  The total is
52.1 hours.  These hours are somewhat unreasonable
and are reduced to 40.1 hours. 
 
(3). Conclusion
            CDFW
has shown that Cardiff’s hours must be reduced significantly.  Cardiff’s reasonable hours on the merits are
reduced to 246.  Best’s 12.7 hours and
Coffin’s 5 hours are reasonable. 
Cardiff’s 52.1 hours for the fee motion are reduced to 40.1 hours.
            
            c.
Lodestar and Motion Fees
            Cardiff’s permitted
rate is $500 per hour for 246 hours, for a total lodestar of $500 x 246 = $123,000.  Best’s and Coffin’s fees total $2,222.50 +
$500 = $2,722.50.  Cardiff Decl., ¶14.   The
total lodestar is $123,000 + $2,722.50 = $125,722.50.  Cardiff’s reasonable hours 40.1 hours for
this fee motion total $500 x 40.1 = $20,050. 
The total fees are $145,772.50.
 
            3.
Multiplier/Negative Multiplier    
            The lodestar for purposes of a
multiplier or negative multiplier is $125,722.50.  Grassroots requests a 2.0
multiplier.  Cardiff Decl., ¶¶ 25,
29-30.   Mot. at 13-15.  CDFW requests a negative multiplier between
0.4 and 0.6 because Grassroots did not obtain all its desired results.  
“[T]he unadorned lodestar figure reflects the general local
hourly rate for a fee bearing case; it does not include any compensation for
contingent risk, extraordinary skill, or any other factors a trial court may
consider under Serrano III.”  Ketchum
v. Moses, (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138. 
The factors to consider for adjustment to the lodestar include the
novelty and difficulty of the litigation, the extent to which the litigation
precluded other employment by the attorneys, the contingent nature of the fee
award, the fact that an award against the state would ultimately fall on the
taxpayers, the fact that the attorneys received public and charitable funding
for the purpose of bringing lawsuits of the character involved, and the fact
that the moneys awarded would inure not to the benefit of the individual
lawyers but the organizations employing them. 
Ramos v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 615,
622-23.
            Conversely,
a trial court may reduce attorney fees based on the plaintiff’s lack of
success.  SOURCE, supra,
235 Cal. App. 4th at 1185.  A
petitioner’s lack of success on legally distinct causes of action can weigh
against a positive multiplier or warrant imposition of a negative
multiplier.  Chavez v. City of Los
Angeles, (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 989; Californians for Responsible Toxics
Management v. Kizer, (1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 961, 975.  Opp. at 17-18.  
 
            a.
Contingent Nature of the Work and Loss of Other Opportunities
            Cardiff
worked this case at a partial contingency rate of $100 per hour to cover
overhead.  Cardiff Decl., ¶3.  The extended litigation timeline and
Grassroots’ inability to pay this fee further reduced how much it actually
paid.  Cardiff Decl., ¶3.  Cardiff asserts that he could not accept
other CEQA cases because of the demands of this case.  Cardiff Decl., ¶26.
            CDFW
notes that taking the case on a partial contingency basis with a $10,000
initial payment mitigates the risk a multiplier is supposed to reflect.  SOURCE, supra, 235 Cal. App.
4th at 1187-88.  Opp. at 12.  In SOURCE, the appellate court found
that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it chose not to award a
multiplier.  Id. at 1188.  It also noted that the expenditure of 246
hours over one year did not preclude the law firm from taking on other
fee-generating work.  Id.
            Grassroots
cites Sonoma Land Trust v. Thompson, (2021) 63 Cal. App. 5th 978,
986-87, where the prevailing party’s insurance policy covered the first $500,000
in legal fees before counsel proceeded on a contingent basis.  Reply at 8. 
Although this mitigated the risk, the non-contingent portion of the fee
award represented less than a quarter of the lodestar and only 18% of the fair
market value of the total fees.  Id.
at 987.  The court granted a 1.4 multiplier.  Id.
            Although
Grassroots identifies a possible alternate client Cardiff could have accepted (Cardiff
Decl., ¶26), it provides no details about the nature of the lost case or whether
the fees would have been contingent. 
Opp. at 12.  In any case,
Grassroots has failed to demonstrate that this case kept Cardiff from accepting
other work.
            While
Cardiff has not shown that he lost any specific opportunities due to this case,
the partly contingent nature of the case somewhat favors a multiplier.  
            
            b.
Importance to the Public
            Grassroots
asserts the importance of the matter to the public warrants a fee multiplier.  CDFW’s failure to disclose deficiencies in
Project flood calculations left the public unable to intelligently evaluate the
Project.  After proper analysis, CDFW may
find the environmental pricetag of the Project is too high and risky for
critical wetlands.  Mot. at 14-15.  
            As
CDFW notes, a case’s purported importance to the public is not a factor
generally recognized in the determination whether a multiplier is warranted in
a section 1021.5 case because it is already a factor in the lodestar award.  Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bak, NA, (2001)
92 Cal.App.4th 819, 838.  Opp.
at 13.
            In
reply, Grassroots cites Krumme v. Mercury Ins. Co., (“Krumme”) (2004),
123 Cal. App. 4th 924, 947, as upholding a 1.5 lodestar based on significant
public benefit.  Reply at 10.
Grassroots has misinterpreted Krumme.  The defendant had asked that the attorney’s
fees award be “vacated, reduced, or remanded” solely because the plaintiff
obtained injunctive relief and failed to obtain the requested relief of
restitution. Id. at 947.  In
ruling that the petitioner was entitled to section 1021.5 fees, the court concluded
that the defendant attempted to elevate one section 1021.5 factor above all
others.  Id.  The court did not address the validity of the
multiplier except to note that the trial court reduced the requested multiplier
of 2 to 1.5.  Id.       Krumme
did not imply that public benefit can justify a multiplier in a section 1021.5
case.  
            The
purported importance of the matter to the public is not a factor for a fee
multiplier.
 
            c.
Novelty, Difficulty, and Complexity
            Grassroots
asserts this action was difficult and complex because of the deferential
standard of review.  Mot. at 14.  The Decision noted that the substantial
evidence review was appropriate for any factual determinations.  Decision, p. 5.  This was especially true when the agency has
been delegated the regulatory authority in a particular field.  Decision, p. 5.  CDFW’s mission is to manage California's
diverse, fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the habitats upon which they
depend, for their ecological values and for their use and enjoyment of the
public.  Decision, p. 5.
            CDFW
asserts that this heightened standard did not apply to the two arguments on
which the Petitioners prevailed.  The
court agreed that the FEIR failed to list the flow standard the Corps would
impose, analyze the flood impacts of the Project under that flow standard, and
analyze the wildlife and habitat impacts of a levee design change under that
standard.  Decision, p. 35.  As to restoration performance criteria, the
ability CDFW would have to shift habitats or performance goals without supplemental
environmental review or additional public comment rendered the Project’s environmental
costs unascertainable.  Decision, pp. 45-46.  Because neither of these arguments were based
on fact, only the rejected arguments were subject to higher judicial deference
to CDFW.  Opp. at 13.
            This
case was complex, primarily because of its factual detail.  It was not novel, however, and the difficulty
for Grassroots was lessened by the joint effort of Petitioners.  This factor does not favor a multiplier.  
            
            d. Lack of Success
CDFW cites San Diego Police Officers Ass’n v. San Diego
Police Dept, (“San Diego Police”) (1999)
76 Cal. App. 4th 19, 24, which approved a negative multiplier because the
plaintiff achieved very limited success and the portion of its writ petition on
which it prevailed did not involve complex issues of law.  Opp. at 13. 

In San Diego Police, the plaintiff police union sought
pursuant to Penal Code section 148.6 to compel the San Diego Police Department
to issue an advisory warning and require the complainant's signature in every
instance in which a person makes a complaint regarding a police officer.  Id. at 21.  The Police Department asserted that Penal
Code section 148.6 only requires it to issue the advisory when a member of the
public complains of misconduct by a police officer during the performance of
his or her duties.  Id.  The trial court agreed but granted the
petition in part, requiring the Police Department to issue the advisory even
when the misconduct might arise to the level of a criminal offense.  Id. at 22.  The appellate court affirmed and approved the
trial court’s negative multiplier on the basis that the vast majority of the
police union’s effort was expended on issues where the Police Department
prevailed.  Id. at 24.
            Grassroots
cites (Mot. at 11) Sundance v. Municipal Court, (“Sundance”) (1987),
192 Cal. App. 3d 268, 273, which addressed the trial court’s reduction in fees based
on hours on which the plaintiffs did not prevail.  Id. 
The appellate court noted that an attorney cannot be expected to know
which potentially meritorious legal theories will prevail.  The result is what matters, and the rejection
or failure to reach alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome is not a
sufficient reason for reducing a fee.  Sundance,
supra, 192 Cal. App. 3d at 274.  The
matter was remanded to the trial court to exercise discretion whether the time
spent on the unsuccessful legal theory was reasonably incurred.  Id. at 273-74.
            CDFW
asserts (Opp. at 15-16) that the facts in this case are similar to Sokolow
v. County of San Mateo, (“Sokolow”) (1989) 213 Cal. App. 3d 231.  There, the Mounted Patrol of San Mateo County
(“Patrol”), a private group with a close association with the county sheriff’s
department, had a male-only policy.  Id.
at 235-36.  It rejected Sonya Sokolow’s
attempts to join the privage group.  Id.
at 238.  Sokolow asked the sheriff’s
office to inform Patrol that its current relationship could not continue if it
continued to discriminate against women. 
Id. at 239.  Sokolow’s
motion for summary judgment asked the trial court to order the Patrol to admit
her as a member, or alternatively an order requiring the County to cut all ties
with the Patrol.  Id.  The trial court granted her motion and ruled that
Patrol could either amend its policy to allow female membership or sever its
relationship with the sheriff’s department via specific steps.  Id. at 240-41.  The trial court denied Sokolow attorney’s
fees because she did not receive the primary relief sought of membership in
patrol.  Id. at 242.  
            The
appellate court reversed, holding that Sokolow was entitled to recover section
1021.5 attorney fees because she received some of the relief sought.  Id. at 246.  On remand, the trial court had discretion to
limit the fee award on the basis of partial success.  Id. at 249.  It distinguished the current facts from Sundance
as a case where the prevailing party pursued unsuccessful legal theories but
still obtained all the results it sought. 
Sokolow could not be said to have achieved all the results sought.  Id. at 250.  She sought to compel Patrol to admit women
into its ranks or to compel the county to eliminate its reliance on Patrol
services.  Id.
at 250.  These were important goals
which she failed to achieve.  Id.  Thus, the court remanded for the trial court
to evaluate the impact on fees of her limited success.  Id.
The question becomes whether the seven arguments discussed
in the Decision reflect different legal theories or different requests for
relief.  CDFW argues that each of the
seven arguments represents a different form of relief.  Opp. at 16. 
Petitioners argued that the project description's reference to
“restoration” was misleading, the FEIR did not include a vegetation map, and it
failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives by excluding a freshwater
alternative.  Decision, p. 20.  Although the Decision compelled CDFW to set
aside any Project approvals and prepare a legally adequate EIR for the Project
if it chooses to proceed (Decision, p. 66), it did not order CDFW to change any
of those things when it does.  Opp. at
16.  The two arguments that did prevail
were not even part of Grassroots’ petition. 
Id.
            Grassroots
correctly points out that its principal requested relief was a writ of mandate
compelling CDFW to set aside certification of the Project’s FEIR and vacate
related approvals.  Reply at 9.  The Decision grants this relief and requires the
CDFW to prepare and certify a legally adequate EIR for the Project based on the
Decision’s findings.  Decision, p.
66.  Grassroots argues that, in doing so,
CDFW will have to reanalyze and reconsider the Project as a whole and respond
to new public comments on it.  This
includes the issues on which the Decision rules against the petitioners.  Reply at 9. 

            This
argument is overstated.  The court agrees
that Grassroots’ principal goal was to have the Project approvals and FEIR set
aside.  Yet, another important goal for
Grassroots was to show that the project description in the FEIR was
inaccurate and misleading insofar as it discussed “restoration” but would
remove existing freshwater wetlands and replace it with a non-naturally
occurring full tidal estuarine environment. 
Grassroots also admits that it appealed the Decision because it
was concerned that certain issues, such as whether project goals can preclude
consideration of a freshwater alternative, would otherwise become precedent in
administrative or judicial proceedings. 
Cardiff Decl., ¶27.  Grassroots
lost on these issues and it fails to support its position that CDFW will have
to readdress them in any subsequent EIR.
            In
sum, Grassroots achieved its principal goal of setting aside the FEIR and
Project approvals, but it did not succeed on all of its significant goals. This
partial success does not favor a multiplier.
 
            c.
Other Factors
It is undisputed that the burden of a multiplier would ultimately
fall on the taxpayers.  There is no
evidence that Grassroots’ attorney received public and charitable funding for
the purpose of bringing lawsuits of the character involved or that the moneys
awarded would inure not to the benefit of Grassroots and not Cardiff.  These factors disfavor a multiplier.
 
            e.
Conclusion
            The
request for a multiplier is denied.  The
request for a negative multiplier also is denied.  
 
            E.
Conclusion
            Grassroots’ motion for attorney
fees is granted in the amount of The
total fees are $145,772.50.
