And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering reducing Cardiff's billed hours and rate for work performed on a case. CDFW argues that Cardiff's process of reviewing the record, FEIR, and other evidence was unnecessary and should have been straightforward. However, the judge finds that Cardiff's effort to find applicable Guidelines was reasonable, as it required searching the administrative record's index and locating a draft Operation and Maintenance Plan. The judge notes that even with this process, Cardiff still had to find the Guidelines online and that the outdated copy available in the administrative record was not sufficient for the public to comment on the EIR. The judge is not addressing CDFW's argument in detail, but notes that the citation to the Corps during the public comment period did not inform Cardiff what part of Corps standards was relevant.
