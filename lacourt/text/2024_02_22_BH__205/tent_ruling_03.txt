 Case Number:  23SMCV00402    Hearing Date:   February 22, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   VAHE ZAKARYAN,    Plaintiff, v.  STATE FARM MUTUAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COMPANY, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV00402     Hearing Date:  February 22, 2024      [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANT’S MOTIONS TO COMPEL    PLAINTIFF’S FURTHER RESPONES TO    SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE,    REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE,    AND REQUESTS FOR MONETARY    SANCTIONS       This action arises from an alleged bad faith denial of an insurance claim.  This hearing is on Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s motion to compel Plaintiff Vahe Zakaryan’s further responses to special interrogatories (set one) and requests for production (set one).   This Department’s rules require the parties first to meet and confer to attempt to informally resolve all discovery disputes.  If the parties cannot agree, the parties are to schedule an Informal Discovery Conference.  An IDC or permission from the Court must occur prior to filing any motions to compel further discovery responses.  Neither happened here.    On a motion to compel further responses, this Department’s rules also require the moving party to file a joint statement consisting of four columns: the first column will identify the number of the discovery request; the second, the text of the discovery request; the third, the text of the response, and the fourth, brief bullet-point statements, one from each party as to why a further response should or should not be compelled.  No joint statement was filed.   Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES without prejudice Defendant’s motions to compel further responses to their requests for production (set one) and special interrogatories (set one).    IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: February 22, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B. Moreton, Jr. Judge of the Superior Court
