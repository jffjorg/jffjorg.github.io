**Summary in English Text**

This tentative ruling concerns a motion by Plaintiffs Shayne Stalnaker and Aimee Stalnaker to vacate a dismissal of their case against Defendants Oasis West Realty dba The Beverly Hilton and Beny Alagem. The case arises from a slip and fall incident at the Beverly Hilton, where Shayne Stalnaker claims he sustained serious and permanent injuries requiring surgery. The Plaintiffs' counsel failed to inform the Court about a medical emergency involving his father and his own illness at the January 3 Order to Show Cause (OSC), which led to the dismissal of the case. Despite this, the Court grants the motion to set aside dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure §473(b) due to the excusable neglect of the Plaintiffs' counsel. The action is reinstated, and a case management conference is set for April 3, 2024.
