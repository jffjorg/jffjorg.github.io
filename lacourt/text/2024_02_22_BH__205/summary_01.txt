And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to renew its motion to amend the complaint and answer to the cross-complaint. The plaintiff, SHEGERIAN & ASSOCIATES, APC f/k/a SHEGERIAN & ASSOCIATES, INC., seeks to add nine claims and eleven affirmative defenses based on the alleged failure of the defendant, HIGH NOON OFFICE, LLC, to disclose the presence of a diesel generator that produced carcinogenic chemicals in the Clocktower Building. The plaintiff argues that the court's denial of the defendant's motion for summary judgment is a new fact or circumstance warranting the grant of its previously denied motions to amend. However, the court disagrees, finding that the plaintiff's motions to amend would still prejudice the defendant and result in the reopening of discovery after discovery had already closed. The court also denied the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents.
