And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling denies without prejudice Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's motions to compel Plaintiff Vahe Zakaryan's further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production. The motions were filed without a joint statement as required by the court's rules and without an informal discovery conference or meeting and conferencing to resolve the discovery disputes. The court finds that the Defendant did not comply with the necessary procedures and therefore denies the motions. The ruling is tentative and subject to change after the hearing on February 22, 2024."
