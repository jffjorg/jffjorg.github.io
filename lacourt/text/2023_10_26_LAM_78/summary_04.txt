And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled to dismiss the case without prejudice. The plaintiff, Arthur Tsatryan, filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife, Polina Tsatryan, and others, alleging fraud, defamation, and wrongful eviction arising from their divorce proceedings. The judge has determined that the case is barred by the doctrine of res judicata, which means that the same issues have already been decided in a prior proceeding. The judge has reviewed the parties' arguments and has found that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff is attempting to relitigate issues that were already decided in the family court case, which is not permitted. The judge has ordered the case to be dismissed without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can refile the lawsuit if he can raise new and different claims.
