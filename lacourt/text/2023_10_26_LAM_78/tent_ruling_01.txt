Case No.:  20STCV39307 Hearing Date:  October 26, 2023    [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:  PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT LEVIN’S  FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE  The motion is DENIED.Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant Levin’s further responses to his Request for Production (“RPDs”), Set One. This is Plaintiff’s third attempt to compel Levin’s further responses to the same set of RPDs. The first, filed in April 2022, was denied without prejudice because Plaintiff failed to participate in IDC and meet and confer. The second was denied in April 2023 on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer in good faith and failed to serve Levin’s counsel with the motion. Plaintiff moves to compel further responses for a third time. However, the Court notes Plaintiff again failed to participate in IDC. Although Plaintiff participated in IDCs concerning Defendant Levin’s motions to compel further, Plaintiff did not schedule an IDC concerning the instant motion. Moreover, Plaintiff has not provided a declaration regarding his efforts to meet and confer as required.The Court also notes that Plaintiff failed to include a separate statement listing each inspection demand to which he is requesting a further response as required by Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345(a)(3). For these reasons, as well as the reasons in Defendant’s opposition, the motion is denied with prejudice. The Court declines to impose sanctions this time.Moving party to provide notice.DATED:  October 26, 2023______________________Hon.
