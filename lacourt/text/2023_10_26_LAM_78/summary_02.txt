And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant Nazeli Mkrtchayan's motion to set aside a default judgment entered against her. The court has found that the Plaintiff's proof of service shows that Nazeli Mkrtchayan was personally served on October 17, 2021, at her correct address, 13203 Vanowen Street, Apt. 6, North Hollywood, CA 91605. The Defendant claims that she was not served and that the description on the proof of service does not match her, but the court has found that the Defendant's declaration is not credible. The court notes that the Defendant does not dispute the address on the proof of service and that she has not overcome the presumption that the facts stated in the proof of service filed by a registered process server are true and that service of process is valid.
