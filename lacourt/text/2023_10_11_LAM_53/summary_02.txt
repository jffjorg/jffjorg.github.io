And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has received a motion for reconsideration from the plaintiff, Roberto Valencia Martinez, regarding the court's previous order granting the defendant, Ford Motor Company, a motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff argues that there has been a material change in the law regarding the enforcement of arbitration agreements by nonsignatory defendants. The court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with this motion and has reviewed relevant case law.

The court finds that the recent appellate cases, Ford Motor Warranty Cases, Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co., and Kieler v. Superior Court of Placer County, have disagreed with and rejected Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020), which the court previously relied on in granting the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The court concludes that these cases demonstrate that there has been a material change in the law and that the weight of authority now supports the plaintiff's position that the defendant cannot enforce the arbitration agreement at issue.

The court also finds that other factors warrant reconsideration, including the importance of this change of law and the plaintiff's promptness in filing this motion. Therefore, the court exercises its discretion to grant the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration and vacates its previous order granting the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The court issues a new order denying the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.
