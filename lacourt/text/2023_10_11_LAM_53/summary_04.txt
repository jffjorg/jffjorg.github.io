Summary in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying defendant Restore a Floor's motion to set aside an order releasing a mechanic's lien. The order was released on March 6, 2023, and defendant claims that the court took the order against it through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The judge finds that defendant has not met its burden to show that the order was taken against it through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The judge notes that defendant did not provide a satisfactory reason for not filing evidence of the release with the court, not appearing at the hearing to present the release, or serving plaintiffs with the release once defendant received notice of the petition. The judge also finds that defendant's failure to file an opposition to the petition does not constitute excusable neglect. The judge denies defendant's motion and orders plaintiffs Mac Calva and Tatyana Nosenko to give notice of this ruling.
