  Order RE:
 
motion to be relieved as counsel for
  defendant david porat 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Walter E. Teague, III  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant David Porat
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Walter E. Teague III (“Defendant’s Counsel”) moves to be relieved as
counsel of record for defendant David Porat (“Defendant”).
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court
should also consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished
without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿ 
The court
finds that Defendant’s Counsel has served Defendant with the moving
papers at Defendant’s last known address, which Defendant’s Counsel has
confirmed, within the past 30 days, is current. 
(MC-052, ¶ 3, subds. (a)(2), (b)(1)(d).)  The court also finds that Defendant’s Counsel
has shown sufficient reasons why the motion should be granted, and why counsel
has brought the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision
(2) instead of filing a consent under section 284, subdivision (1).
The court
therefore grants Defendant’s Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant
David Porat. 
Walter E.
Teague, III will be relieved as counsel of record for defendant David Porat effective
upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed “Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil” on the client.  
 
 
 
 
The court
orders Walter E. Teague, III to give notice of this ruling and the “Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil” to defendant David Porat and to all other
parties who have appeared in this action.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 11, 2023
