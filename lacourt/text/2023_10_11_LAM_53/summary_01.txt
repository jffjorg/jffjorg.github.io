English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Nancy Del Socorro Diaz Martinez's request for a continuance of the hearing on Defendant Champion Power Equipment, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The continuance is granted because Plaintiff was unable to depose additional witnesses due to Defendant's delay in producing witnesses for deposition. The judge finds that Plaintiff's counsel's declaration shows that the facts to be obtained by the proposed deponents are essential to opposing the motion, and that Plaintiff has shown good cause for a continuance. The hearing is continued to February 22, 2024, and the trial date is continued to May 29, 2024.
