And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant's Counsel, Walter E. Teague, III, permission to withdraw as counsel for defendant David Porat. The motion was uncontested and the court found that Defendant's Counsel has served the defendant with the necessary papers and has shown sufficient reasons for the withdrawal. The court notes that the decision to grant or deny the motion is within its discretion, and it must consider whether the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue prejudice to the client's interests. The court orders Defendant's Counsel to give notice of the ruling and the signed "Order Granting Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil" to the defendant and all other parties involved in the case. The withdrawal will take effect upon the filing of proof of service of the signed order.
