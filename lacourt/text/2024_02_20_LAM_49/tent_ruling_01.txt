Defendant then made repeated misrepresentations regarding the status of the shipment. At the time of the FAC’s filing, Defendant had not delivered the gloves or returned the $825,000.00. Plaintiff now moves for an assignment order assigning all income paid by Shopify, Inc. to Judgment Debtor Monza Eyewear, LLC, and an order prohibiting judgment debtor Monza from assigning its right to payment from Shopify.

Grundon” was, in fact separately filed concurrently with the notice of motion, as well as a separate proposed Order.  The “Declaration of Dan Clarkson” is no where to be seen in the court file.With certain exceptions not applicable here, a party filing a motion “must” serve and file a supporting memorandum. (See Rules 3.1112(a) & 3.1113(a); see also Rule 3.1114 [providing exceptions for certain motions].) “The memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (Rule 3.1113(b).) “The court may construe the absence of a memorandum as an admission that the motion…is not meritorious and cause for its denial.” (Rule 3.1113(a).)Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for Assignment Order is OFF CALENDAR.Plaintiff to give notice. IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:  February 20, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
