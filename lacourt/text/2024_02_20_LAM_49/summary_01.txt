And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion for assignment order is off calendar due to a procedural defect. The plaintiff, TDI, LLC, is seeking an assignment order of all payments due from Shopify, Inc. to judgment debtor Monza Eyewear, LLC, and an order prohibiting judgment debtor Monza from transferring or changing the right of payment from Shopify, Inc. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Sam Vaziri Vance, Inc., failed to deliver goods and make payments, and made repeated misrepresentations. The plaintiff filed a one-page notice of motion, but failed to include a supporting memorandum, as required by the court rules. The judge notes that the absence of a memorandum can be considered an admission that the motion is not meritorious and may cause its denial. The plaintiff is free to refile and reserve in a proper manner.
