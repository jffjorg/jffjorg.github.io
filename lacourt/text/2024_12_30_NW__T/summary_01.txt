And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary adjudication filed by Plaintiff Blair Williams against Defendant Peak Foreclosure Services, Inc. The motion was denied as to all three issues presented. The Court granted Plaintiff's request for judicial notice, but denied Plaintiff's evidentiary objections. The Court found that the motion was duplicative and failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1350 and rule 3.1354. The Court also found that the motion was unpersuasive because there was a triable issue of fact as to notice of the judgment lien and whether Defendant had knowledge of the judgment lien. The Court noted that the issue of notice or knowledge was reviewed at the prior hearing and still exists in the instant motion. The Court denied the motion as to the second and third causes of action, and denied the motion as to the third issue. The Court ordered that the Clerk give notice of the ruling.
