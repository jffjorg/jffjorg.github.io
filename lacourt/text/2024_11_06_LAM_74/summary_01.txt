And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to Defendant Zhan Liu's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. The Defendant is seeking to set aside the default judgment entered against her in 2018 for failing to pay a promissory note. The Defendant argues that she was deprived of the opportunity to present her defense due to extrinsic fraud, which occurred when her husband, Moses Wong, arranged to have her served with process at their joint home in Pasadena while she was living in China to complete a graduate degree. The Defendant's mother, who lacked English proficiency, received the mail and gave it to Moses's secretary without informing the Defendant. The Defendant did not learn of the lawsuit or default until June 2024.

The Judge finds that the Defendant has shown extrinsic fraud and therefore grants the motion to vacate the default judgment. The Judge also concludes that the Defendant has met her burden of showing a meritorious defense and a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense in the earlier proceeding. The Defendant must also show diligence in seeking to set aside the judgment after discovery, which she has done by promptly filing the motion to vacate in August 2024.
