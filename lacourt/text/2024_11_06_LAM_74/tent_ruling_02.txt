 Case Number:  21STCV18756    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2024    Dept:  74 Defendant Viking River
Cruises, Inc’s Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award and Plaintiff Christian
Barragan’s Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award.
The court denies plaintiff’s untimely motion filed on July
23, 2024, to vacate the arbitration award because, in addition to the motion’s
untimeliness, the grounds that plaintiff identifies in plaintiff’s notice of
motion (page 2 lines 8-16) and motion (pages 11-19) do not describe an
arbitrator exceeding the arbitrator’s authority under controlling statutory and
case law. (9 U.S.C. § 10; Code of Civ. Proc. § 1286.2)
The court grants defendant’s motion filed on April 10, 2024,
to confirm the arbitration award.
