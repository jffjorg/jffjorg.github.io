And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is issuing a tentative ruling on plaintiff Fredy Roldan's motion to compel arbitration. Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants Cordova Construction Services, Inc., Barrett Business Services Inc, and Does 1-10 for disability discrimination and wage and hour violations. Plaintiff also filed a motion to compel arbitration on February 8, 2024. However, the court sustained defendant's objection to Fedy Roldan's Declaration for lack of certified translation, which means plaintiff has not authenticated the exhibits attached to the declaration. As a result, plaintiff has not provided an authenticated copy of the arbitration agreement. The court finds that plaintiff has not met its burden of showing the existence of an enforceable arbitration agreement and therefore denies the motion to compel arbitration.
