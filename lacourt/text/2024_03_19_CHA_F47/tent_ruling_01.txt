Case #22CHCV01395
 
MINOR’S
COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 2/13/24.
 
MINOR: Ryan Vakilian
GAL: Niosha Vakilian (parent)
DEFENDANTS: Amalia Gamboa and Northridge Kopen Ramen,
Inc.
 
RULING: The petition is granted.  
 
This action arises out of an incident that occurred on
10/13/22 at a Kopen Ramen restaurant in Northridge, California.  On that date, Plaintiffs Pouya Vakilian,
Minor Ryan Vakilian and Niosha Vakilian (collectively, Plaintiffs) were at the
restaurant when Defendant Amalia Gamboa, in the course and scope of her
employment with Defendant Northridge Kopen Ramen, Inc. (collectively,
Defendants), placed a hot cup of tea close to Minor who grabbed the cup
spilling the tea on his left arm and leg causing his skin to be burned.  Pouya and Niosha, Minor’s parents, witnessed
the incident.  Minor has not completely
recovered from the injuries as it is unknown whether two areas of slight
discoloration on his left arm will disappear.
 
On 12/15/22, Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendants for general negligence/negligent infliction of emotional
distress.  On 3/16/23, Defendants
answered the complaint.  On 1/18/24, a
Notice of Settlement was filed and on 2/13/24, Plaintiffs filed and served the
instant petition seeking approval of the compromise of the Minor’s claim.  
 
In compromise of the Minor’s claim, Defendants have
agreed to pay $75,000.00.  
 
Minor incurred 
$2,262.10 in medical expenses paid by petitioner as a result of the
incident which are to be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.    
 
Plaintiff’s attorney seeks to recover $18,750.00 in
attorney’s fees and $2,982.45 in costs from the Minor’s settlement.  
 
Minor will receive the remaining $51,005.45 which is to
be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity.
