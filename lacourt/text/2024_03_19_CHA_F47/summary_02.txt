And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendant, Tanya L'Heureux, Administrator of the Estate of Scott S. Emling, to the entire complaint filed by the plaintiff, Charles Yazbeck. The demurrer is based on the ground that there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action, specifically the probate action regarding the validity of the alleged will. The court has granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the probate action and has determined that the instant case is subject to demurrer on the same ground.

The court has found that the defects in the pleading cannot be cured by amendment and has therefore sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The defendant's request for sanctions is denied, as the court finds that the plaintiff's counsel did not engage in bad faith or willful conduct in failing to respond to the defendant's meet and confer efforts. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend, as it is not willing to dismiss the instant action, which is what the defendant has requested.

The hearing date is set for March 19, 2024.
