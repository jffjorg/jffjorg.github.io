The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the petition filed by Pouya Vakilian, Ryan Vakilian, and Niosha Vakilian (collectively, Plaintiffs) for a compromise of Minor Ryan Vakilian's claim against Amalia Gamboa and Northridge Kopen Ramen, Inc. (collectively, Defendants). The incident occurred on October 13, 2022, when Amalia Gamboa, in the course and scope of her employment, placed a hot cup of tea close to Minor at a Kopen Ramen restaurant, causing burns to his left arm and leg. The Minor has not fully recovered from the injuries, and the parties have agreed to a compromise of $75,000, with $2,262.10 in medical expenses to be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. The Plaintiff's attorney will recover $18,750.00 in attorney's fees and $2,982.45 in costs, and the remaining $51,005.45 will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity for the Minor.
