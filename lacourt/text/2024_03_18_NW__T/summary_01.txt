Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reconsidered the stipulation to continue the trial and has granted it due to the plaintiff's discovery abuse. The defendant had filed a motion to compel verified, code-compliant responses to RFP Set Two, as the plaintiff's previous responses were not in compliance with the code. The motion was unopposed, and the court has granted it. The court orders the plaintiff to provide verified, code-compliant responses and produce documents by April 2, 2024, and to identify any documents covered by attorney work product or attorney-client privilege in a privilege log. The court also awards the defendant reasonable monetary sanctions in the sum of $1,770 against the plaintiff for discovery abuse.
