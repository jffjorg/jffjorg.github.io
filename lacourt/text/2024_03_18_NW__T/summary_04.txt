And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled to stay the action pending possible transfer to the Central District, Complex Litigation Program. The plaintiff has filed a putative class action, which should have been filed in the Central District. According to LASC Local Rule 2.3(a)(1), every class action must be filed in the Central District. Additionally, California Rules of Court, rule 3.400(c), states that all class actions are presumed to be complex and at filing are assigned to the Complex Litigation Program of the court. The judge is requiring the payment of the complex case fee and first appearance fee at the time of filing. If class action claims are added to the case after the original filing of the complaint, a party must follow the procedure provided in Government Code Section 70616(a) to transfer the case to the Complex Litigation Program.
