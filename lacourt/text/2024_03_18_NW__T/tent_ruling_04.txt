The

District. 
LASC Local
Rule 2.3(a)(1) “Every class action must be filed in the Central District”
Local Rule 3.3(k)(8):
“Recognizing that class actions are defined as provisionally complex pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 3.400(c), considering the factors which make
a case complex enumerated
in California Rules of Court, rule 3.400(b), and consistent with the policy to
determine as soon as reasonably practicable whether a case is complex under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.403, all class actions are presumed to be
complex and at filing are assigned to the Complex Litigation Program of the
court. Pursuant to Government Code Section 70616(a), the complex case fee and
first appearance fee must be paid at the time of the filing of the first paper
in a class action proceeding. If class action claims are added to the case
after the original filing of the complaint, and a party wants the case
transferred to the Complex Litigation Program, the party must follow the
procedure provided in subsection (4).”
