And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses in part, in the sum of $40,858. The plaintiff, Amir Boroumand, is the prevailing party in the case against FCA LLC, and is entitled to reasonable fees for the time reasonably expended by his counsel. However, the judge finds that the hours expended by counsel are excessive due to the straightforward nature of the legal issues and the simplicity of the work. The judge reduces the hours charged by counsel to 50 hours for Sina Rezvanpour and 20 hours for Sam Azimtash, and denies the plaintiff's request for a 0.3 enhancement. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for costs and expenses due to the failure to file a Cost Memorandum.
