 Case Number:  22VECV01708    Hearing Date:   March 18, 2024    Dept:  T   22VECV01708 AMIR BOROUMAND  vs FCA [TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Plaintiff Amir Boroumand’s Motion for  Attorneys Fees, Costs, and Expenses is GRANTED IN PART in the sum of  $40,858.  The motion for fees is  inappropriately made and is not considered.    Introduction  Plaintiff Amir Boroumand  (Plaintiff) moved for attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses against Defendant  FCA LLC (Defendant).  Plaintiff requested  a total of $102,596.64, which includes $78,248.00 in fees; $874.24 in costs and  expenses, and a 0.3 multiplier or $23,474.40.   An opposition was due March 5, 2024 and the Court file reflects that  none was filed.  Plaintiff’s reply  further asserted that no opposition was filed.  Plaintiff’s request for judicial  notice is DENIED as not being relevant. Plaintiff asserted entitlement to  attorneys’ fees as the prevailing party per Civil Code section 1794(d).  The statute provided in pertinent part that  Plaintiff is entitled to “a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and  expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined  by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer.”  (Id.)   There is no dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing party.   Statutory attorney fees are  ordinarily determined by the court pursuant to the “lodestar” or “touchstone”  method. However, the Court’s discretion is somewhat limited in fee awards under  the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.   The statute takes a different approach from customary statutory or  contractual provisions.  The statute  requires an “initial determination of the actual time expended; and then to  ascertain whether under all the circumstances of the case the amount of actual  time expended and the monetary charge being made for the time expended are  reasonable.  These circumstances may  include, but are not limited to, factors such as the complexity of the case and  procedural demands, the skill exhibited and the results achieved. If the time  expended or the monetary charge being made for the time expended is not  reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court must take this into  account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.” In the situation of a contingency  fee arrangement, the court in Nightingale stated, “for purposes of section  1794, subdivision (d), a prevailing buyer represented by counsel is entitled to  an award of reasonable attorney fees for time reasonably expended by his or her  attorney.”  (Robertson v. Fleetwood  Travel Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817-818 (citing  to Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104-105, fn.  6.)  Plaintiff’s Counsel provided that  they took the case on a contingency basis.   (Sina Rezvanpour’s Decl. par. 22.)   Because the case was taken on a contingency basis, Plaintiff is entitled  to reasonable fees for the time reasonably expended, not actual time  expended.   The time and rates charged  were:  (1) 109.4 hours at $600/hr. by  Sina Rezvanpour (totaling: $65,640.00); (2) 23.5 hours at $500/hr. by Sam Azimtash  (totaling: $11,750.00); and (3) 5.2 hours at $165.00/hr. by Paralegal Maria  Batista (totaling: $858.00).  The Court  finds that the hours expended to be excessive because the legal issues  presented were straightforward and the work simple for such experienced  lawyers.  The Court noted that this  action was filed on October 24, 2022 and settled approximately one year later,  on November 1, 2023, which is seen to be a relatively short period of  time.  The Court further noted that there  were 3 CMC’s, 1 OSC and no motions to compel nor depositions taken.  The entries in the invoice did not reflect  any legal work/issues that were extraordinary.   The hours charged by Sina Rezvanpour is reduced to 50 hours and for Mr. Azimtash  to 20 hours for the reasonable work performed.   Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees is reduced to $40,858 (which  includes $30,000 for Sina Rezvanpour; $10,000 for Sam Azimtash; and $858.00 for  Maria Batista).   Counsel cited the case  of 22VECV00383 Llerenas v FCA as an example of fees obtained in that case of  approximately $65,000.  In that case,  there were multiple court appearances, multiple motions to compel, a motion to  enforce the settlement, multiple IDC and retention of an expert.  The work billed for in that case far exceeds  the time and complexity required for this case. It is Plaintiff’s burden of proof  to show that the enhancement is primarily to compensate counsel at a rate  reflecting the risk of nonpayment in contingency cases as a class.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,  1138.)  The aim is to compensate  attorneys at fair market value as an inducement to accept these cases.  (Id.)   Plaintiff failed to provide any facts to show that the hourly rates are  below fair market value.  Plaintiff  failed to meet their burden to show grounds for an enhancement.  The request for a 0.3 enhancement is DENIED. Plaintiff’s motion for fees is  GRANTED in Part and DENIED in Part.   Plaintiff’s fees are reduced to $40,858.00 and Plaintiff’s request for  an enhancement is DENIED.   As for Plaintiff’s request for  costs and expenses of $874.24, the relief is not properly raised in the noticed  motion because a Cost Memo was not filed.   (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700.)   The Court noted that a Cost Memo was attached as Exhibit G to the Sina  Rezvanpour declaration.  Plaintiff’s  failure to file the Cost Memo made the request defective.  The Court did not consider the motion’s  request for costs and expenses.  Costs  are determined by filing a Cost Memorandum and are tested by a Motion to Tax  costs.   IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
