And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiffs to serve responses to their discovery requests. The plaintiffs, Gerardo Martinez, Jr. and Leila Martinez, did not oppose the motion and failed to serve responses to the defendant's discovery requests. As a result, the judge has ordered the plaintiffs to serve verified responses without objections to the discovery requests within 20 days of the date of the order. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, imposing a reduced amount of $570 on Gerardo Martinez, Jr. and $855 on Leila Martinez for their failure to serve timely responses.
