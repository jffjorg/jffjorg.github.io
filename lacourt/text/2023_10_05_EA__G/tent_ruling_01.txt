  Case Number:  22PSCV01615    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  G Defendant Mingwen Yao’s Motion to Set Aside Default
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Defendant Mingwen Yao’s Motion to Set Aside Default is
DENIED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of settlement action. On August 10, 2020, Plaintiff Qihui Yang entered into a written
agreement with Mingwen Yao in which Yang agreed to invest $30,000 in Yao’s business, Worldyao Group (Worldyao), for a period of four
months in exchange for investment profits of $15,000. After Yao failed to
produce any profits or return Yang’s original investment, Yang filed an action
against Yao and Worldyao on October 28, 2021. On February 23, 2022, Yang and Yao entered into a
confidential settlement agreement in which Yao agreed to pay Yang back in the
amount of $35,200. Specifically, Yao agreed to pay monthly installments of
$3,000 at a fixed of interest rate of $352 until paid in full. After making
five payments, Yang alleges Yao stopped making any further payments despite
several demands from Yang.
On
November 1, 2022, Yang filed a complaint against Yao, Worldyao, and Does 1-50,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of written agreement, (2)
breach of confidential settlement agreement, (3) fraud and intentional
misrepresentation, (4) promissory estoppel, (5) unjust enrichment, and (6)
intentional infliction of emotional distress. On November 3, Yang’s registered
process server personally served Yao and Worldyao in Diamond Bar.
On December 12, 2022, default was entered against
Yao. On December 13, default was entered against Worldyao.
On January 9, 2023, Yang submitted an application
for default judgment that was denied by the court on March 30. On April 24,
Yang submitted another application for default judgment that was granted by the
court on June 12.
On September
7, 2023, Yao filed the present motion. A hearing on the motion is set for
October 5.
ANALYSIS
Yao
seeks to set aside the entry of default the grounds of mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, and excusable neglect. For the following reasons, the court DENIES Yao’s motion.
Legal Standard
Whenever
an application for relief from default judgment is made no more than six months
after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by the moving
party’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect, the court may vacate any (1) resulting default
entered by the clerk against the moving party or (2) resulting default judgment
or dismissal entered against the moving party, unless the court finds that the
default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the moving party’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., §473, subd.
(b).) “The six-month time limit for granting statutory relief is jurisdictional
and the court may not consider a motion for relief made after that period has
elapsed.” (Manson, Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36,
42 (Manson).) That “six-month period runs from entry of default, not
entry of judgment.” (Id.)
Courts
liberally grant motions to vacate default judgments when relief is promptly
sought and the opposing party is not prejudiced as the law strongly favors
resolution on the merits. (Kramer v. Traditional Escrow, Inc. (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 13, 28.) Courts only require “slight evidence” to support vacating
a default and resolve all doubts in favor of the party seeking relief. (Ibid.)
However, “[t]he only occasion for the application of section 473 is where a
party is unexpectedly placed in a situation to his injury without fault or
negligence of his own and against which ordinary prudence could not have
guarded.” (Hearn v. Howard (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1206, quoting Elms
v. Elms (1946) 72 Cal.App.2d 508, 513.)
Discussion
In
this case, Yao’s motion to set aside default was filed on September 7, 2023,
which is more than six months after the entry of default on December 12, 2022.
Although Yao claims the motion is timely because it was filed within six months
of the entry of default judgment, the “six-month period runs from entry of
default, not entry of judgment.” (Manson, supra, 176 Cal.App.4th
at p. 42.) Accordingly, because Yao did not timely request relief pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), the court DENIES Yao’s motion.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Yao’s
motion to set aside default is DENIED.
