Summary in English text:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Mingwen Yao's motion to set aside default. The motion was filed on September 7, 2023, which is more than six months after the entry of default on December 12, 2022. The Judge applied the legal standard of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, which requires that relief be sought within six months of the entry of default. The Judge found that Yao did not timely request relief and therefore denied the motion. The case involves a breach of settlement action, where Yao failed to make payments to Yang after entering into a confidential settlement agreement.
