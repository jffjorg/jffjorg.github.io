```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Bhuvneshwari Corporation's motion to dismiss the complaint filed by Fine Hospitality Group, LLC. The motion was based on the doctrine of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction, which allows a court to assume jurisdiction over a dispute to the exclusion of other courts. However, Bhuvneshwari failed to provide evidence to support its arguments and did not request the court to take judicial notice of a pending action in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange. Therefore, the court cannot analyze whether the doctrine is applicable and has denied the motion without prejudice.
