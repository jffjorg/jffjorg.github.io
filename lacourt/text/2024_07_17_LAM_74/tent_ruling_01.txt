  Case Number:  22STCV20052    Hearing Date:   July 17, 2024    Dept:  74 McDaniel v.
Colaianni et al.
Defendants’ Motion to Correct and
Confirm Arbitration Award
 
BACKGROUND 
            Plaintiff
April McDaniel sued defendants Rodrigue Colaianni and Lisa Colaianni aka Lisa
Leroy on September 14, 2022 for (1) breach of contract, (2) negligence, (3)
fraud, (4) negligent misrepresentation, and (5) concealment. Plaintiff alleged
Defendants knowingly sold her a home replete with construction defects after
Defendants negligently remodeled it.
            On
October 31, 2022, the parties stipulated to arbitrate their claims and stay
court proceedings in the interim.
            The
arbitrator, Ernest C. Brown, issued a twenty-six-page Final Award on April 19,
2024, awarding Plaintiff $391,114.50, accruing simple interest at 10% annually
from the date of the award. (D.Ex. 10, 26:2-7 (“Award”).)
            On
May 28, 2024, Defendants filed the instant “Motion to Confirm the Arbitration
Award With Corrections by Striking the Award of Attorneys’ fees and
Pre-Judgment Interest”. On July 3, 2024, Plaintiff opposed. On July 10, 2024,
Defendants replied.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            “Any party to an arbitration in which an award has
been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under [section 1285] is
duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made ... , unless
in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as
corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Id., §
1286.) 
            “[T]he
court ... shall correct the award and confirm it as corrected if the court
determines that: (a) There was an evident miscalculation of figures or an
evident mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred to
in the award; (b) The arbitrators exceeded their powers but the award may be
corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy
submitted; or (c) The award is imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the
merits of the controversy.” (Id., ¶ 1286.6.)  
“[A]n
arbitrator's decision is not generally reviewable for errors of fact or law,
whether or not such error appears on the face of the award and causes
substantial injustice to the parties.” (Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase¿(1992)
3 Cal.4th 1, 6.) An arbitrator does not exceed their powers by assigning an
erroneous reason for their decision. (Id. at 28.) “Arbitrators do not
exceed their statutory powers merely by rendering an erroneous decision on a
legal or factual issue, so long as the issue was within the scope of the
controversy submitted to the arbitrators.” (Roehl v. Ritchie (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 338, 348.) 
 
DISCUSSION  
            1.
Attorneys’  Fees
            Defendants
move the Court to strike the arbitrator’s $87,320.00 attorneys’ fees award.
            Defendants
mistakenly suggest that “the award of attorneys’ fees and the award of interest
[by the arbitrator] are reviewed de novo” but the authorities they cite
refer to the standard a higher court applies when reviewing a lower court’s
fees determination. (Mot., 3:27-28.)  When a trial court reviews an arbitrator’s decision,
the standard is more deferential, as described above. (See Moncharsh, supra,
3 Cal.4th at p. 6.)
Defendants
argue Plaintiff is not entitled to fees because she did not attempt to mediate
with them before resorting to legal action. The arbitrator found differently. The
Final Award includes findings that on May 25, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel
demanded “prompt mediation”, and between June and August 2022, Plaintiff
requested “that Respondents participate in an early mediation” and “Respondents
and its [sic] counsel did nothing and refused to agree to mediate”.
(Award, 14:20-26, 15:7-14.)
Defendants
ask the Court to reverse the arbitrator’s factual determinations, not to
correct them. The Court cannot do so. “[P]arties who enter into arbitration
agreements are presumed to know the arbitrator’s decision will be final and
binding; ‘arbitral finality is a core component of the parties’ agreement to
submit to arbitration.’ ” (SingerLewak LLP v. Gantman (2015) 241
Cal.App.4th 610, 616, quoting Moncharsh, supra, at pp. 6, 10.) The
Court defers to the arbitrator’s finding of fact – that Plaintiff tried to
mediate and Defendants refused. The arbitrator was thus empowered to award fees.
            2.
Prejudgment Interest
            Defendants
contend “the arbitrator’s award is not clear and unequivocal as to the scope of
interest awarded.” (Mot., 10:23-25 [heading].) The contention is unavailing because
the award is straightforward. The arbitrator awarded Plaintiff 10% simple
annual interest beginning on the date of the award. That rate will continue
after judgment. The arbitrator simply formalized the date on which damages were
capable of being ascertained for purposes of post-award, prejudgment interest.
            3.
Attorneys’ Fees for This Motion
            A
party entitled to attorneys’ fees in an arbitration award is similarly entitled
to fees incurred to confirm it, where fees are otherwise authorized by the
parties’ contract. (See Carole Ring & Associates v. Nicastro (2001)
87 Cal.App.4th 253, 260-261.) The prevailing party’s right to fees extends from
Code of Civil Procedure section 1293.2, entitling a party to costs after a
successful petition to confirm, and Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(a)(10),
incorporating attorneys’ fees within costs when authorized by contract.
Here,
the parties’ contract authorized a fees award. (See Mot. Ex. 1, ¶ 25 [reasonable
fees to prevailing party “[i]n any action, proceeding, or arbitration” between
the parties “arising out of [their] Agreement”].) The arbitrator determined
Plaintiff to be the prevailing party and awarded fees. The Court awards
Plaintiff the costs of litigating this petition based on section 1293.2, and
per section 1033.5, those costs include Plaintiff’s fees.
Plaintiff’s
two attorneys charge a reasonable hourly rate of $400.00 based on their
experience and qualifications. (Markow Dec., ¶¶ 17-19.) Counsel Ari Markow
estimates his colleague spent 15.4 hours “reading and analyzing Defendants’
motion, conducting legal research, and writing the opposition”, and Markow himself
spent 2.2 hours “discussing the motion, case status, and strategy with
Plaintiff, and reviewing and finalizing [counsel’s] declaration and related
exhibits.” (Id., ¶ 21 [typo omitted].) Markow estimated 3.5 hours
reviewing a reply brief and appearing at the hearing.
Plaintiff’s
counsel’s billing is slightly excessive. 2.2 hours spent meeting with the
client about a single law and motion matter is unnecessary, as is 3.5 hours to
review the reply and prepare for the hearing on a straightforward legal issue.
The Court will award 15.0 hours, in total, to review the motion and reply and
prepare the opposition, and 1.0 hours to prepare for and attend the hearing,
which can be accomplished remotely. 
            The
Court awards $6,400.00 in attorneys’ fees.
            4.
Prejudgment Interest
            The
Court also calculates interest from April 19, 2024, through date of judgment as
follows: ten percent, divided by three-hundred sixty five, multiplied by the
total award of $391,114.50, results in a $107.15 per diem accrual.
Eighty-nine (89) days passed between the award on April 19, 2024 and the
judgment on July 17, 2024; $107.15 multiplied by 89 is $9,536.35.
 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court denies Defendants’ petition to correct the arbitration award.
The
Court confirms the award as rendered and enters judgment for Plaintiff against
Defendants, jointly and severally, in the amount of $413,450.85, inclusive of
attorneys’ fees and interest accrued to the date of judgment.
