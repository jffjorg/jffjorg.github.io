Trade LLC v. Lin et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Continue Trial
and Related Dates
  The
court denies plaintiff’s motion to continue trial without prejudice to plaintiff’s
renewing its request to continue trial when plaintiff files and serves a timely
motion for summary judgment. The court is mindful of its obligation to hear
timely motions for summary judgment despite a congested court calendar. (Cole
v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88; Sentry Ins.
Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529-530.) No impediment
existed to plaintiff filing and serving a motion for summary judgment. When
plaintiff files and serves a timely motion for summary judgment, the
court will satisfy the court’s obligation under Cole and Sentry by
continuing trial.
