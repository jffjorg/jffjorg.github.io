 Case Number:  23STCV01749    Hearing Date:   November 2, 2023    Dept:  68 Motion to be Relieved as Counsel

D&O
TradeCo Inc. vs. Gredale LLC; 23STCV01749
Moving
Party: Counsel for Defendant Gredale LLC

Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel
Richard Davis of
Fickel & Davis and Dustin A. Huffine of Huffine Chung LLP, counsel of
record for Defendant Gredale LLC, seek to be relieved as counsel for that party. Counsel
filed motions with the required Forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. Counsel’s
declarations state that the client has not paid outstanding fees and costs
advanced on its behalf resulting in a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship.
Absent a showing
of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted. (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) Counsel’s motion complies
with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362 and meets its requirements. 
Before the Court
grants the motions, the Court would ask for confirmation that the corporate
Defendant has found new representation or does not need representation before
granting the motion because corporations may not represent themselves. (Merco
Constr. Engineers, Inc. v. Municipal Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 724.)
