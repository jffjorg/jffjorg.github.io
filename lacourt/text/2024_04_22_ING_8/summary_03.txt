And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively denied the petition, finding that the requested records are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) due to copyright and state law protections. The Court finds that the public interest in protecting the rights of owners of original works and the rights of architects to have the sole power to grant individuals use of their work outweighs the public interest in disclosure. The Court also finds that providing copies of the records would result in a chilling effect on architects and other design professionals working on development projects in the City, who would be reluctant to provide their work to the City for proposed developments.
