And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in an employment action brought by Plaintiff Kathleen Sullivan against Defendant Los Angeles Community College District. The Defendant issued a subpoena to Plaintiff's labor union, seeking various communications and records related to Plaintiff's employment. The Plaintiff seeks to modify or quash the subpoena, arguing that notices to employee were not served on certain individuals and that the records are not relevant to the case.

The Court grants the Motion in part, excluding one request and limiting all remaining requests to January 2016 until the present. The Court finds that notices to employee are not required for certain individuals who are only involved in the record as representatives of the Plaintiff's union. However, the Court notes that a notice should have been provided to a regular witness whose employment records are at issue.

The Court also limits the scope of the subpoena to only records related to Plaintiff's employment with the Defendant, finding that the records are directly relevant to the allegations in the Complaint. The Court declines to award sanctions, given the mixed results of the Motion. The Court encourages counsel to submit on the tentative ruling and notes that counsel may participate remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
