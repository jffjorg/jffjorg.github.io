And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses an employment action brought by Defendant Total Airport Services, LLC against Plaintiff Maria Lizarraga. The Defendant seeks to issue contempt and terminating sanctions against the Plaintiff, compel her to appear for a deposition, and pay monetary sanctions. The Court finds that terminating sanctions are premature and punitive, and that the primary issue is a scheduling problem. The Plaintiff has failed to provide clear availability for a deposition, and the Court orders the deposition to take place on March 11, 2024, to allow for review of other discovery. The deposition will be in-person, as requested by the amended notice of deposition. The Court awards reduced monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,000 due to the Defendant's Motion arising from months of silence from the Plaintiff's counsel on the issue of a deposition date. The trial date is continued to March 24, 2025, and all associated deadlines are tethered to the new trial date.
