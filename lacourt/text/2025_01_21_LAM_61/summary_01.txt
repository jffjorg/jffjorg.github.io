And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Cedric Price and Precision Dental. The parties had agreed to settle the case orally, but disagreed on a prospective waiver of appellate rights related to attorney fees and costs. The Judge finds that the parties did not explicitly and unambiguously state an intent to waive prospective appellate rights, and that the settlement agreement was not intended to be final as to all issues. The Judge also notes that the parties have already stipulated to the dismissal and modification of the preliminary injunction, and that the dates for filing and serving the upcoming motions can be determined by reference to the hearing date.
