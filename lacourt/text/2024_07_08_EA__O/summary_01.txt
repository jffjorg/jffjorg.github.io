Significant Statements:

  - "What is needed—and what is missing here—is a CONNECTION between the forum and the specific claims at issue … The plaintiffs were not residents of California, did not claim to have suffered harm in California … [and] all the conduct giving rise to the nonresidents' claims occurred elsewhere."
  - "The essential foundation of specific jurisdiction is present because Ford had advertised, sold, and serviced those two car models in both States for many years."
  - "Lenso Wheels did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of California law."
  - "The relatedness factor is satisfied when a company SYSTEMATICALLY serves a CONSUMER market for a product in the forum State."

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the hearing pending jurisdictional discovery and supplemental briefing. The case involves a negligence claim filed by Melissa Moors and Kayleah Moors against Wheels International Inc. DBA Lenso Wheels and others. Lenso Wheels has moved to quash service of summons and cross-complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. The judge has concluded that the purposeful availment requirement is met because Lenso Wheels has advertised and sold wheels to California residents. However, the judge is not satisfied that the relatedness factor is met because there is no evidence that Lenso Wheels has systematically served a consumer market in California. The judge is granting jurisdictional discovery to provide evidence on the strength of the relationship between Lenso Wheels, California, and the litigation.
