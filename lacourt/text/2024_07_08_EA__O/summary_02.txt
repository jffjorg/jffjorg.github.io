And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a future court hearing. The case involves a decedent who is presumed to be a California resident, and the plaintiffs have amended their complaint to include EMS Distributing LLC as a defendant. The plaintiffs allege various causes of action against EMS, including negligence and product liability. The judge is considering the issue of jurisdiction, specifically whether EMS is subject to general jurisdiction in California. The judge notes that EMS is a Florida-based corporation and may not be directing its activities towards California, which could affect its jurisdictional status. The judge also discusses the concept of purposeful availment, which requires that the defendant purposefully and voluntarily direct its activities towards the forum state. The judge will continue to consider these issues and may take the deposition of Richard Stokes and conduct written discovery to gather more information.
