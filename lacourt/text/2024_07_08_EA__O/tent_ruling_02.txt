[1] It is presumed that
decedent is a California resident. 
 


[2] On January 21, 2022,
Plaintiffs amended their Complaint to include EMS Distributing LLC.
Specifically, against EMS, Plaintiffs allege causes of action (COAs) for
negligence, strict liability – design/manufacturing defect, strict liability –
failure to warn, product liability – negligence and failure to warn, and a
survivor action. 
 


[3] Their motion was unopposed, the
insurance paid the maximum amount, and evidence shows that if it was not for
the detached tire from Defendant Esqueda’s vehicle, then Defendant Adrianna
Jimenez would have not run over decedent. 
 


[4] According to the
motion, EMS is the seller/distributor of the wheels and Axe Wheels fulfilled
Esqueda’s order and the subject wheels. As for Esqueda, Ulloa, In and Out Tire,
and Affordable Wheel Repair, they may have at some point prior to the incident repaired,
maintained, and/or installed the subject wheel that detached from Esqueda's
vehicle
 


[5] The wheel was not purchased
in California because EMS placed the order from its place of business in
Arizona. 
 


[6] See also LG,
infra, 80 Cal.App.4th at p. 365. 
 


[7]           As for general jurisdiction, a
corporation‘s continuous activities within the state have been found “so
substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of
action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.” (International
Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 318 (1945); see Daimler AG v.
Bauman (2014) 134 S.Ct. 746, 751, 754.) 
 


[8] See Opp. p. 8 [EMS conceding
general jurisdiction not met because EMS is not directing its activities from
California and it is a Florida based corporation]. 
 


[9] “[P]urposeful availment exists whenever the defendant
purposefully and voluntarily directs its activities toward the forum state in
an effort to obtain a benefit from that state.” (Snowney v. Harrah’s
Entertainment, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1054, 1067.)
 


[10] As will be discussed below, there is a difference
between selling to distributors and consumers (i.e., residents of the forum
state).  


[11] The holding in Ford would seem to undermine
Lenso’s position that privity of contract is required. (Reply p. 4:12-13
[“Stated differently, there is no privity between Lenso Wheels and Mr.
Esqueda.”].) Put differently, a car manufacturer is not in privity with the
buyer of that vehicle (as buyer purchases the car from a dealership), but that
does not preclude a finding of specific jurisdiction. 


[12] EMS seeks to take the deposition of
Richard Stokes and conduct written discovery limited to jurisdictional issues
regarding the scope of Lenso Wheels' contacts with California.
