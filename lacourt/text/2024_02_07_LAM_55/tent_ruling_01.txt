  Case Number:  22STCV34350    Hearing Date:   February 7, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Answers to Form
Interrogatories and for Sanctions Against Defendant, Kyeung Suk Yeh aka
Christine K. Yeh; Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Answers to Form Interrogatories and
for Sanctions Against Defendant, Yoon Hee Yeh aka Charles Y. Yeh.
In this case, WATERS, LLC and WATERS & RUSS, LLC (“Plaintiffs”)
seek damages against YOON HEE YEH and KYEUNG SUK YEH (“Defendants”) for allegedly
breaching the terms of their personal guaranty by failing to pay past due debts.
Plaintiffs have filed two motions to compel Defendant
to serve initial responses to form interrogatories, without objections, and to
pay monetary sanctions, because no responses have been served.
Plaintiffs sufficiently show that they served each Defendant
with the form interrogatories, but Defendants failed to serve timely responses.
(Poteet Decl., Exs. A, B.) Defendants did not file oppositions to the motions and/or
make any showing of substantial justification. The Court therefore grants the unopposed
motions and awards sanctions. 
On or before 3/6/24, Defendant KYEUNG SUK YEH and
Defendant YOON HEE YEH shall serve initial responses, without objections, and
in full compliance with the California Discovery Act, CCP §2016.010 et seq.,
as to the form interrogatories served by the plaintiffs.
On or before that same date, Defendant KYEUNG SUK YEH and
Defendant YOON HEE YEH each shall pay discovery sanctions in the sum of $2,760.00
to plaintiffs, the Court finding the absence of substantial justification.    E.g., CCP   § 2023.030.
