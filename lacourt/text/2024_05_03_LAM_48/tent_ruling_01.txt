[TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
May 3, 2024



 
On March 10, 2022, Plaintiffs
Michael Gonzalez, April Bran, and Michael Angel Gonzalez filed this action
against Defendants Hotel Byron, Frank McHugh as Trustee of the Christine O’Donovan
Trust, and Frank McHugh-O’Donovan Foundation Inc.
On
November 6, 2023, Frank McHugh-O’Donovan Foundation Inc. (“Defendant”) filed a
demurrer.  Plaintiffs did not file a
timely opposition.
At
the February 26, 2024 hearing, the Court continued the hearing.  Later, Plaintiffs filed an opposition.
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendant
asks the Court to take judicial notice of (1) a July 16, 2008 grant deed
conveying the property from Frank McHugh as Trustee to Albany Investment
Properties LLC; (2) an August 4, 2008 deed of trust, assignment of rents, security
agreement, and fixture filing executed by Albany Investment Properties LLC for
the benefit of Frank McHugh as Trustee; and (3) an October 8, 2008 assignment
of deed of trust from Frank McHugh as Trustee, granting Frank McHugh-O’Donovan
Foundation Inc. all rights and interests in the deed of trust.
The
Court may take judicial notice of the legal effect of documents’ language when
the effect is clear, but it may not take judicial notice of the truth of
statements of fact recited within the documents.  (Fontenot v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 265.)  The request is
granted only to that extent. 
DISCUSSION
A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747.)  When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context, accepting the alleged facts as true.  (Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406.)  “Because a demurrer
challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside
the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.”  (Arce ex rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health
Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 556.)
A.        The Complaint and Judicially Noticeable
Facts Do Not Show That Defendant Does Not Own the Property.
Defendant
contends that it never owned the property that is the subject of this
habitability action.  (Demurrer at p. 4.)
Plaintiffs
allege that Defendant owns, operates, and manages the property.  (Complaint ¶ 6.)  Plaintiffs moved into the property in 2018 and
suffered an infestation of bedbugs beginning in March 2021.  (Complaint ¶¶ 14-17.)
The
property was conveyed to Albany Investment Properties LLC on July 16,
2008.  (RJN, Ex. 1.)  On October 8, 2008, Defendant was granted all
rights and interests in the deed of trust. 
(RJN, Ex. 3.)  The legal effect of
these documents is the property transfer and deed of trust conveyance in 2008.  They do not, however, show that Defendant did
not own or manage the property thereafter during Plaintiffs’ tenancy.
The
demurrer is overruled.
B.        Plaintiffs Sufficiently Allege the
Terms of the Contract (Ninth Cause of Action).
Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs do not set forth the material terms of the contract that
was breached.  (Demurrer at p. 5.)  Plaintiffs do not attach a copy of the lease
to the complaint.
The
standard elements of a claim for breach of contract are (1) the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach,
and (4) damage to plaintiff therefrom.  (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v.
New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)  “A written
contract may be pleaded by its terms—set out verbatim in the complaint or a
copy of the contract attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by
reference—or by its legal effect.”  (McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc.
(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.)  To plead a contract by its legal
effect, a plaintiff must “allege the substance of its relevant terms. 
This is more difficult, for it requires a careful analysis of the instrument,
comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal conclusions.”  (Ibid.)
Plaintiffs
allege that they entered into a written contract with all Defendants “for the
lease of Plaintiffs’ room in the residential hotel in compliance with
California Health & Safety Code.” 
(Complaint ¶ 103.)  “Plaintiffs
did all of the significant things that the contract required them to do, most
notably, payment of the lease price for the Plaintiffs’ room in the residential
hotel.”  (Complaint ¶ 104.)  Defendant breached the contract by failing to
provide Plaintiffs a habitable room, “as evident by the presence of a bedbug
infestation in Plaintiffs’ room in the residential hotel.”  (Complaint ¶ 106.)  This sufficiently alleges the material terms
upon which Plaintiffs’ claim is based.
The
demurrer is overruled.
CONCLUSION
The
demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant is
ordered to file an answer within 10 days. 
(California Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(j)(1).)
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
