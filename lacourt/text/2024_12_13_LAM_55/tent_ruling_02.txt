 Defendant requests

case. The request for judicial notice is granted.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. Wilson v. Transit Authority of City of Sacramento
(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must
be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. “A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not on the evidence or facts alleged.” E-Fab, Inc. v.
Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315. As such, courts
assume the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual
allegations. Ibid. However, it does not accept as true deductions,
contentions, or conclusions of law or fact. Stonehouse Homes LLC v. City of
Sierra Madre (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 531, 538. 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment”); Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency
(2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A demurrer should not be sustained without
leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of
action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can
be cured by amendment.”). The burden is on the complainant to show the Court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.
 
ANALYSIS
Defendant demurs to causes of action two through eight. Defendant
argues that as a corporate employee, he is not liable for these wage and hour
violations because he is not an “employer” under the law. 
The Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC) defines “employer”
as “any person … who directly or indirectly, or through an agent or any other
person, employs or exercises control over the wages, hours, or working
conditions of any person. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, § 11140, subd. 2(F). In Martinez
v. Combs (2010) 49 Cal.4th 35 (Martinez), the California
Supreme Court held that in an action for unpaid wages under Labor Code section
1194, “the IWC's definition of ‘employer’ does not impose liability on
individual corporate agents acting within the scope of their agency.” Martinez,
supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 66. 
However, Labor Code section 558.1, subdivision (a) provides
that “[a]ny employer or other person acting on behalf of an employer, who
violates, or causes to be violated, any provision regulating minimum wages or
hours and days of work in any order of the Industrial Welfare Commission, or
violates, or causes to be violated, Sections 203, 226, 226.7, 1193.6, 1194, or
2802, may be held liable as the employer for such violation.” Such “‘other
person acting on behalf of an employer’ is limited to a natural person who is
an owner, director, officer, or managing agent of the employer….” Lab. Code
section 558.1, subd. (b). Section 558.1 allows for a private right of action. Seviour-Iloff
v. LaPaille (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 427, 443.
While Plaintiff alleges Defendant was Plaintiff’s employer
in the Complaint, that is a legal conclusion, and the Court does not assume it
is true in ruling on the Demurrer. See Complaint at ¶ 6. In the
Opposition, Plaintiff does not argue that Defendant was his employer, but
rather that he is an “other person acting on behalf of an employer” who is an “owner,
director, officer or managing agent of the employer.” As such, Plaintiff argues
Defendant is liable under Labor Code section 558.1. 
To plead a cause of action under Labor Code section 558.1, a
plaintiff must allege that the defendant violated, or caused to be violated, an
IWC order or Labor Code sections 203, 226, 226.7, 1193.6, 1194, or 2802 (“enumerated
provisions”). In Usher v. White (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 883, 896 (Usher),
the Court held “‘violates, or causes to be violated’ in section 558.1,
subdivision (a) have an ordinary meaning.” Additionally, the court held that an
owner violates or causes to be violated “if, when acting on behalf of an
employer the ‘owner’ has personal involvement in the enumerated violations in
section 558.1; or, absent personal involvement, has sufficient participation in
the activities of the employer—including, for example, over those responsible
for the alleged wage and hour violations—such that the ‘owner’ may be deemed to
have contributed to, and thus have ‘cause[d]’ such violations.” Usher, supra,
(2021) 64 Cal.App.5th at p. 886. In Usher, the court held that an owner
was not liable, where the undisputed facts showed she did not participate in
the decision of the company to classify plaintiffs as independent contractors
improperly. Id. at p. 897. Additionally, the owner proffered evidence
showing her involvement in the operation and management of the company was extremely
limited. Ibid. 
Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant was the Founder and
Chief Executive Officer of Air Tutors LLC and that he “had ultimate authority
as it related to many decisions, including corporate policymaking, paying
employees' wages, and the hiring and firing of employees.” Complaint ¶ 27. Additionally,
Plaintiff alleges Defendant was the “primary, if not sole decision maker and
author of its corporate policies as to [wages, overtime, meal periods and rest
breaks, wage statements, and determinations of employees’ exempt or non-exempt
status].” Defendant argues that this is insufficient because Plaintiff does not
allege how Defendant “personally caused or contributed to the alleged Labor
Code violations. Reply at p. 3: 22. 
However, while “personal involvement in the enumerated violation” is one
way to establish liability, it is not the only way. Usher, supra, (2021)
64 Cal.App.5th at p. 886. As the court explained in Usher, liability may
also be established when the defendant has “sufficient participation in the
activities of the employer—including, for example, over those responsible for
the alleged wage and hour violations—such that the ‘owner’ may be deemed to
have contributed to, and thus have ‘cause[d]’ such violations.” As alleged, Defendant
was CEO, with direct control over corporate policies and employees, and the
primary or sole author of the allegedly violative policies. Compl. at ¶¶ 7, 27.
At the pleading stage, that is sufficient to show that he caused the
violations.
