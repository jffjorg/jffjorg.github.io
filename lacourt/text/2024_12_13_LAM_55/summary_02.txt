And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Hasan Ali. The demurrer was filed in response to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Sakari Singleton, which alleged various Labor Code violations. The judge has determined that the demurrer is overruled, and Defendant has 20 days to answer the complaint.

The judge's ruling is based on the allegations in the complaint, which state that Defendant was the CEO of Air Tutors LLC and had direct control over corporate policies and employees. The judge found that these allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action under Labor Code section 558.1, which allows for a private right of action against "any employer or other person acting on behalf of an employer" who violates any provision regulating minimum wages or hours and days of work.

The judge also cited several case law decisions in support of her ruling, including Usher v. White, which held that liability under Labor Code section 558.1 can be established even if the defendant did not personally participate in the alleged wage and hour violations, but instead had "sufficient participation in the activities of the employer." The judge concluded that Defendant's alleged role as CEO and primary author of corporate policies was sufficient to establish liability under Labor Code section 558.1.
