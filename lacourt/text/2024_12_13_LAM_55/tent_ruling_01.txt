  Case Number:  22STCV00035    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS: Hearing on Petitions of
Petitioner Charquinta Ochoa for Approval
of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceedings of Judgment for Minors
Nevaeh Ochoa and Nyla Ochoa.
 
Petitioner’s Petitions for Minor Compromise are granted.
            
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs Charquinta Ochoa, Nevaeh Ochoa (age 11), and Nyla Ochoa (age 9), filed this action against
Francisco Navarrete, Khaleia Felix, Jason Felix, Jarod Felix, Tamira Felix,
Lanaira Thomas, Wardell Wells, Wilbur Scott, and Roxann Felix.
(“Defendants”), alleging habitability
issues. 
Petitioner, Charquinta Ochoa,
who is the mother and guardian ad litem of the minor Plaintiffs, filed petitions requesting Court approval of
settlements of the two minor claimants who, as Defendants’ tenants, allegedly
suffered from uninhabitable conditions and emotional distress. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Courts must decide whether to approve a compromise by
determining if petitioners, such as guardians, are acting in the best interests
of minors. E.g., Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subd. (a); Scruton v. Korean Air
Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1607. “[T]he protective role the
court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a role to assure that
whatever is done is in the minor's best interests…. [I]ts primary concern is
whether the compromise is sufficient to provide for the minor's injuries, care
and treatment.”  Goldberg v. Superior
Court (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382. Judicial discretion in approving
petitions for minors’ compromises, and ordering distributions, and local court
policies, must be applied in the best interests of minors, in a case-by-case
method, tailored to the circumstances. Christensen v. Superior Court
(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 139, 142-144.
A petition for court approval of a compromise under Code of
Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court rules
7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384(a). Some
of the Probate Code and the Code of Civil Procedure apply to compromises as to
minors’ claims. See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950. In large part, the
Local Rules incorporate by reference the California Rules of Court and
statutory provisions. See Super. Ct. LA County, Local Rules, rule 4.115
et seq.
A payment of attorneys’ fees on the minor’s behalf must be
approved as being reasonable by the court. Niles v. City of San Rafael
(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 230, 244. “The trial court itself must develop and resolve
any counterarguments on behalf of the minor, lest the attorney receive an
excessive award of fees.” Gonzalez v. Chen (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 881,
887.
 
ANALYSIS
The proposed settlement is for $135,000, of which $125,000.00
is to be paid to Petitioner Charquinta Ochoa, and $5,000.00 is to be paid to
each minor plaintiff and deposited in a blocked account. The Court finds that
the minors’ settlement amounts are typical among the many like cases seen in
this court, as to minors who lived in uninhabitable conditions, fully
recovered, and required no medical treatment. No costs or attorney’s fees are
to be deducted from the minors’ share of the settlement. Accordingly, the Court
finds the settlement reasonable and in the minors’ best interest.
Petitioner also submitted MC-355 forms for Claimants ordering
the funds deposited in each Claimant's blocked account, stating, "No
withdrawals of principal or interest shall be made from the blocked account or
accounts without a written order under this case name and number, signed by a
judge, and bearing the seal of this court, until the minor attains the age of
18 years. When the minor attains the age of 18 years, the depository, without
further order of this Court, is authorized and directed to pay by check or
draft directly to the former minor, upon proper demand, all moneys including
interest deposited under this order. The money on deposit is not subject to
escheat." Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.953(a). Petitioners have attached
the name, branch, and address of each depository for Claimants' settlement
funds.
 
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, both petitions are granted as
requested. The Court will sign and file proposed orders filed by the
petitioner. 
Petitioner is ordered to deliver a certified or filed
endorsed copy of the Orders to Deposit Funds in Blocked Account to a manager at
the financial institution where the funds are to be deposited and promptly file
with the Court a Receipt and Acknowledgment of Order for the Deposit of Money
to Blocked Account” (Judicial Council form MC-356) signed by the depository. Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.953; Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 4.115(e)(2).
