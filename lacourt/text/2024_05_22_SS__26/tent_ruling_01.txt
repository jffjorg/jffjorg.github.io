ANALYSIS:
 
On January 22,
2019, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
filed this subrogation action against Defendants Christopher Hernandez (“Defendant”) and Maria Hernandez. On August
4, 2022 Plaintiff filed a copy of the
parties’ settlement agreement with a request for dismissal and retention of
jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The Court dismissed
the action pursuant to the stipulation on August 25, 2022. (Stip and Order,
filed 08/25/22.) 
 
On March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment. To
date, no opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Plaintiff has demonstrated the settlement agreement complies with
the statutory requirements set forth above as it was signed by both parties and
their attorneys. (Motion, Mahfouz II Decl., Exh. A, p. 3.)
 
Furthermore,
the request for retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the
parties, before the action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of
jurisdiction to conform to the statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If, after a suit has been dismissed, a party
brings a section 664.6 motion for a judgment on a settlement agreement but
cannot present to the court a request for retention of jurisdiction that meets
all of these requirements, then enforcement of the agreement must be left to a
separate lawsuit.”].) The parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction
complies with these requirements because it was made in writing to the Court
before the action was dismissed. (Motion, Mahfouz II Decl., Exh. A, ¶8.) 
 
The settlement provides that
Defendant would pay Plaintiff $5,539.77 through an initial payment from
Defendant’s insurer of $2,739.77, followed by Defendant’s monthly payments
starting on July 1, 2020. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶4.) The settlement agreement
also provides that in the event of Defendant’s default, Plaintiff may seek
judgment in the demand of the Complaint ($14,100.39), plus interest on that amount
at the legal rate from July 1, 2020, plus all costs of suit and reasonable
attorney’s fees, less any monies paid. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶¶1, 7.) Payments
of $3,889.77 were made towards the settlement, after which Defendant defaulted.
(Id. at ¶¶7, 9 and Exh. 2.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is
entitled to entry of judgment against Defendant in the amount of $10,210.62
principal ($14,100.39 - $3,889.77) plus interest of $526.50, which accrued at
the legal rate of seven percent per annum since the default date of September
1, 2023, costs of $495.75, and attorney’s fees of $813.01. (Id. at ¶12.)

Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED.
JUDGMENT IS TO BE ENTERED IN PLAINTIFF’S FAVOR AND AGAINST DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER HERNANDEZ IN THE AMOUNT OF
$10,210.62 PRINCIPAL; INTEREST OF $526.50, WHICH ACCRUED AT THE LEGAL RATE OF
