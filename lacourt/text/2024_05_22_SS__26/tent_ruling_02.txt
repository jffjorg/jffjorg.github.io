ANALYSIS:
 
On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff Dianeth A. Jimenez Velazco
(“Plaintiff”) filed the instant 
action for violation
of Consumer Legal Remedies Act, violation of Business & Professions Code
section 17200, et seq., and claim against surety against Defendants
Norma E. Flores Sandoval dba Coco Auto Sales (“Defendant Sandoval”), Newport
Acceptance Corp. (“Defendant NAC”), and Western Surety Company (“Defendant
Western”). The action arises out of Plaintiff’s purchase of a motor vehicle
regarding which certain facts were not disclosed. (Compl., filed 02/14/24,
¶¶16-43.) Defendants Western and NAC filed answers on April 9, 2024 and April
18, 2024, respectively. 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration
against Defendants Sandoval and NAC on March
14, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281, et seq., which provides in relevant part: 
 
On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate
the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy
exists, unless it determines that:
 
(a) The right to compel arbitration has
been waived by the petitioner; or 
(b) Grounds exist for the revocation of
the agreement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subds. (a)-(b).) Plaintiffs
provide evidence of the existence of the arbitration agreement in the Retail
Installment Sales Contract (“RISC”). (Motion, Heydari Decl., Exh. 1, p. 5.) On April
26, 2023, Plaintiff requested that Defendants NAC and Sandoval agree to
arbitrate the parties’ dispute. (Id. at Heydari Decl., ¶4 and Exh. 2.)
Defendants NAC and Sandoval have not agreed to arbitration. (Id. at ¶6.)
Also, Plaintiff’s request to AAA to arbitrate the dispute against Defendants NAC
and Sandoval was denied due to their failure to comply with AAA’s policies. (Id.
at ¶¶7-10 and Exhs. 3-4.) Therefore, Plaintiff has demonstrated that they are
entitled to an order compelling Defendants Sandoval and NAC to arbitrate
pursuant to the terms of the arbitration agreement. Plaintiff’s request that
the arbitration be held at either AAA or JAMS is its right under the
arbitration agreement. (Id. at Exh. 1, p. 6.)
 
The burden now shifts to Defendants to demonstrate waiver of
Plaintiff’s right to arbitrate or grounds to rescind the arbitration agreement.
As no opposition has been filed, however, no such grounds to deny the Motion
has been shown.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Dianeth A. Jimenez Velazco’s Motion to Compel
Arbitration is GRANTED. THE ACTION IS ORDERED TO ARBITRATION AT EITHER AAA OR
JAMS AND STAYED PENDING ARBITRATION. 
 
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING STATUS OF ARBITRATION IS SET
