And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Defendants. The Judge sustained the demurrer to the first and third causes of action (sexual harassment and hostile work environment) with leave to amend, and overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action (retaliation). The Judge found that the Plaintiff's claims for sexual harassment and hostile work environment are not pleaded with particularity, and that the Plaintiff has not shown a concerted pattern of harassment. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's retaliatory actions. The Plaintiff has 30 days to amend the complaint.
