And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Jan Building, Inc. v. Padilla's Company, Inc., et al. The plaintiff, Jan Building, Inc., alleges that the defendant, Padilla's Company, Inc., et al., failed to adequately perform contracts and failed to have proper licensing. The defendant has filed a demurrer to the complaint and a motion to strike certain paragraphs of the complaint.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for fraud with 20 days leave to amend. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the complaint with 20 days leave to amend.

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for fraud. The plaintiff has failed to allege specific facts regarding who made the representations, their authority to speak or act on behalf of the defendant, and when and where the representations were made.

The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's allegations regarding alter ego liability are insufficient. The plaintiff has only pled boilerplate conclusions in the complaint and has failed to allege sufficient facts to support the contention that the belief is true.

The judge has also ruled that the defendant's motion to strike certain paragraphs of the complaint is moot upon the sustaining of the demurrer to the third cause of action.

The judge has ordered the defendants to give notice of this ruling.
