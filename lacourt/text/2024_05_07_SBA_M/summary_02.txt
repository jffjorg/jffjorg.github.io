And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"Pursuant to the motion filed by Milender White Residential SoCal Corp., I have granted the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in this case. The arbitration agreement between the parties reflects a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a quick and inexpensive method for resolving disputes. The plaintiff, Techno-Advanced, Inc., executed an arbitration agreement with the defendant, Milender White Residential SoCal Corp., which requires arbitration of disputes arising under the agreement. The defendant met its initial burden to show the existence of a valid arbitration clause between the parties. Therefore, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the arbitration clause should not be enforced. Since the plaintiff filed no written opposition to the motion, the defendant's motion is granted. An OSC re: Arbitration Status is set for [date], and the defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling."
