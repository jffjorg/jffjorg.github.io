Background
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint was filed on August 7, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff is the general contractor for
a construction project (“Project”) located at 1700 S. Pacific Coast Highway,
Redondo Beach, California. Plaintiff entered into sub-contracts with Padilla’s
Company, Inc. for rough grading and shoring, and, later, for concrete masonry.
Defendant failed to adequately perform the contracts and failed to have the
proper licensing to perform the contracts. 
 Plaintiff alleges the following
causes of action: 1. Disgorgement (B&P 7031(b)); 2. Disgorgement (B&P
7031); 3. Fraud; 4. Negligence; 5. Unlawful, Fraudulent, and Unfair Business
Practices (B&P 17200 et seq.); 6. Breach of Contract; 7. Breach of
Contract.
 
            Meet and Confer
             
            Defendants filed meet and confer
declarations in sufficient compliance with both CCP § 430.41 and CCP §
435.5.  (Decls., David. D. Marvizi.) 
 
            Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v.
Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
All demurring Defendants demur to the
third cause of action for fraud for failure to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action and uncertainty. CCP § 430.10(e)(f).  Each of the individual Defendants Jaime
Padilla, Francisco Martin Padilla, and Miguel Angel Padilla demur to all the causes
of action for failure to state sufficient facts.  
            Third
Cause of Action for Fraud 
            The
demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
Plaintiff fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action. 
            “A
complaint for fraud must allege the following elements: (1) a knowingly false
representation by the defendant; (2) an intent to deceive or induce reliance;
(3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting damages.”  Service by Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co.
(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816. “[T]he elements of an action for fraud and
deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the defendant must have concealed or
suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to
disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally
concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4)
the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he
did if he has known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of
the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff must have sustained
damage.” Boschma v. Home Loan Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230,
248.
            “Every
element of the cause of action for fraud must be alleged in the proper manner
and the facts constituting the fraud must be alleged with sufficient
specificity to allow defendant to understand fully the nature of the charge
made.”  Tarmann v. State Farm Mut.
Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.  Plaintiff must state facts which “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.”  Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.
            Plaintiff
has failed to allege specific facts as to who made the representations, their
authority to speak or act on behalf of Padilla’s Company, Inc., to whom the
representations were made, and when and where the representations were made.
The allegations are conclusory. In addition, Plaintiff has failed to allege specific
facts to meet the elements of knowledge of falsity, intent to deceive,
justifiable reliance, and damages. 
            Defendants’
demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
            Defendants
Jaime Padilla, Francisco Martin Padilla, and Miguel Angel Padilla Demurrer
            Defendants’ demurrer is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiff fails to state facts sufficient to state
a cause of action.
            “In California, two conditions must
be met before the alter ego doctrine will be invoked.  First, there must be such a unity of interest
and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the separate
personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality
exist.  Second, there must be an
inequitable result if the acts in question are treated as those of the
corporation alone.”  Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523,
538.
            Among the factors to be considered
in applying the alter ego doctrine are commingling of funds and other assets of
the two entities, the holding out by one entity that it is liable for the debts
of the other, identical equitable ownership in the two entities, use of the
same offices and employees, and use of one as a mere shell or conduit for the
affairs of the other.  See, Id. at 538-539.  Other factors include inadequate
capitalization, disregard of corporate formalities, lack of segregation of
corporate records, and identical directors and officers.  See Id.
at 539.  No one characteristic
governs.  The courts must look at the
totality of the circumstances to determine whether the doctrine should be
applied.  See, Id.
            Plaintiff
has only pled boilerplate conclusions in the Complaint parroting back some of
the elements noted above, with respect to alter ego liability. (Complaint, ¶¶
10-12.)  The allegations regarding alter
ego liability are made on information and belief. “[P]laintiff may allege on
information and belief any matters that are not within his personal knowledge,
if he has information leading him to believe that the allegations are true and
thus a pleading made on information and belief is insufficient if it merely
assert[s] the facts so alleged without alleging such information that lead[s]
[the plaintiff] to believe that the allegations are true.”  Gomes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.
(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1158–1159 (internal citations and quotations are
omitted; emphasis in original.)  As to
the allegations made on “information and belief,” Plaintiff failed to allege sufficient
facts that would support the contention that the belief is true. Again, as
noted above, Plaintiff simply provided a recitation of some of the essential
elements of alter ego liability with no actual underlying facts and simply
recited elements of alter ego liability based on “information and belief.”
            Defendants’
demurrer to the Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
            Motion to
Strike  
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any
time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  CCP § 436(a). 
The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court.  CCP § 436(b).  The grounds for a motion to strike are that
the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws.  CCP §
436.  The grounds for moving to strike
must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
Defendants move to strike the following
paragraph of the Complaint: “Paragraph 34, 7:25-28 – “Defendants acts as
alleged herein were malicious, fraudulent and/or oppressive and were undertaken
in the conscious disregard of the rights of Plaintiff. Defendants (sic) actions
entitle Plaintiff to an award of punitive damages in an amount appropriate to
punish to make an example of Defendants, according to proof.” 
 
The motion to strike is moot upon the
sustaining of the demurrer to the third cause of action. 
 
Defendants are ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
