I.INTRODUCTION 
 
On October 5, 2020, Plaintiff Sarmen Essagholian initiated
this action against Defendants Letter Four, Inc. (“Letter Four”), Lauren Adams
(“Adams”), Jeremy Baker (“Baker”), Alfred Jr. Anderson (“Anderson”), Shieda
Monique Brown Anderson, and Willie D. Campbel arising from a motor vehicle
collision. Plaintiff alleges Anderson caused the collision when he was driving
the vehicle as an agent, servant, or employee of the other defendants.
Plaintiff asserts causes of action for negligence and negligent hiring,
supervision, or retention of employee against Letter Four, Adams, and Baker
(collectively, “the Letter Four Defendants”). 
 
On December 17, 2021, the Letter Four Defendants filed a
motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff filed an opposition on April 1, 2022,
and Letter Four Defendants filed a reply on April 8, 2022. The motion was heard and granted on April 14, 2022.

 
On June 17, 2022, the Letter Four Defendants filed a motion
for attorneys’ fees.
 
On September 22, 2022, the Court granted in part the Letter
Four Defendants’ motion for attorney’s fees. Pursuant to that order, Letter
Four Defendants were limited to recover their attorneys’ fees incurred after
February16, 2022, in connection with their summary judgment motion, including
reviewing Plaintiff’s opposition, drafting the reply brief, and preparing for
and attending the hearing. Letter Four Defendants were directed to file a
proposed order and revised calculation of their attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff was
permitted to file an objection to the proposed order if he took issue with the
fee calculation. 
 
On September 28, 2022, the Letter Four Defendants submitted
their proposed order seeking $22,534.60 in attorneys’ fees. 
 
On October 10, 2022, Plaintiff filed an objection to the
proposed order. 
 
On June 23, 2023, the Court calendared a hearing for the
motion for attorneys’ fees for September 8, 2023. 
 
On September 8, 2023, the Court continued the motion for
attorneys’ fees to allow the Letter Four Defendants to provide further
briefings, justifying their attorneys’ fee request.  
The Letter Four Defendants filed such briefing on
November 3, 2023.  No responsive pleading
was filed.
 
                
II.LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Section 2033.420 provides that
if, in response to a request for admission, a responding party fails to admit
the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter, and if the
requesting party is forced to and subsequently does prove the genuineness of
that document or the truth of the matter, the requesting party may move the
court for an order requiring the responding party to pay the reasonable
expenses incurred in making the proof, including reasonable attorneys’
fees.  An award is mandatory unless the Court finds any of the following:
(1) an objection to the request was sustained or a response to it was waived
under CCP § 2033.290; (2) the admission sought was of no substantial
importance; (3) the party failing to make the admission had reasonable ground
to believe that that party would prevail on the matter; and (4) there was other
good reason for the failure to admit.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.420, subd.
(b).) 
 
The determination of whether
there were no good reasons for denying the requested admission, whether the
requested admission was of substantial importance, or the amount of expenses to
be awarded, if any, is within the sound discretion of the trial court.  (Bloxham v. Saldinger (2014) 228
Cal.App.4th 729, 753.)  If it is clear from the evidence introduced by
either party that the party who denied for lack of information or belief had
access to the information at the time the requests for admission were propounded,
sanctions are justified because the party who denied the admission has a duty
to investigate.  (Smith v. Circle P
Ranch Co. (1978) 87 Cal.App.3d 267, 275.)  A request for admission has
“substantial importance” when the matter requested is central to the
disposition of the case.  (Brooks v.
American Broadcasting Co. (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 500, 509.)  In
evaluating whether there was “good reason” to deny a request to admit “a court
may properly consider whether at the time the denial was made the party making
the denial held a reasonably entertained good faith belief that the party would
prevail on the issue at trial.  (Laabs
v. City of Victorville (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1242,
1276.)   
 
            
III.PROCEDURAL ISSUE 
 
The Letter Four Defendants’
response was filed a day late. On November 3, 2023, Defendants filed a
Declaration from paralegal Donna M. Henrikson. The Henrikson declaration
indicates that as a result of miscalendaring, the briefs were not filed until
November 3, 2023, a day after the Court’s deadline. While the documents were
not filed timely, the Court finds this delay slight. The Court will consider The
Letter Four Defendants’ response.
 
             
IV.DISCUSSION 
 
Sean Fredin’s declaration states
that entries not clearly related to the summary judgment motion were redacted.
The depositions of plaintiff and co-defendant Anderson were included because
this information was used in the reply to Plaintiff’s opposition. The remaining
conferences and correspondences were connected to the summary judgment motion.
(Dec. Fredin, ¶ 6.) Therefore, the total amount connected solely to the summary
judgment motion are $14,016.10. 
            
            After
reviewing the billing entries from February 16, 2022, to April 14, 2022, the
Court finds that the entries to correspond to the summary judgment motion,
except for four. There were four instances of conferences with various
individuals, for .25 hours on 3/30/2022, 4/11/2022, 4/13/2022, and 4/14/2022.
While the other entries indicate the matters concerned the summary judgment
motion, the court finds these four entries insufficient to determine if they
were for the summary judgment motion. The Court also agrees with Defendants
that the requested amount for the depositions of Plaintiff and Co-Defendant are
proper. 
 
            Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED, minus $325 associated with the insufficient
entries above. Therefore, the fees total $13,691.10. 
 
             
IV.CONCLUSION 
 
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is
GRANTED in the amount of $13,691.10.
