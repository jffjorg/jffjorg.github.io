And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by defendants Michelle Presnell, Ashley Presnell, and Peter Presnell to plaintiff Heidi Yu Ling Yu's second amended complaint. The complaint alleges two causes of action: involuntary dissolution of Eagle Cargolink Inc. and declaratory relief. The court rules that the demurrer to the cause of action for involuntary dissolution is overruled. The court finds that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to show that liquidation is reasonably necessary to protect plaintiff's rights or interest. The court also rules that the demurrer to the cause of action for declaratory relief is overruled, as the defendants have failed to establish the fundamental element of res judicata, a prior proceeding or lawsuit.
