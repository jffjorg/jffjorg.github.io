And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the ex parte application to continue the trial. The application has been denied because no good cause has been shown for the continuance. The Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ) has not been filed, which would have allowed the court to advance the hearing if it was timely filed. The judge notes that even if the motion was already filed, it could be set for hearing on statutory notice on February 28, 2024, which is 30 days before trial, without the need to continue the trial. The judge emphasizes that it is not the reservation for the hearing that triggers relief, but rather the filing of the motion.
