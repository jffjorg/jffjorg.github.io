 Case Number:  23VECV00155    Hearing Date:   December 14, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECV00155 ANAIT GRIGORIAN vs ORA ILOULIAN
Tentative ruling: Ex parte application to continue trial is denied.  No good cause shown.  The MSJ has not been filed. If the motion had been filed, the court could advance the hearing as long as the motion has been timely filed.  It is not the reservation for the hearing that triggers relief but the filing of the motion.  In the absence of a motion having been timely filed, the court does not grant relief.  The court notes that if the motion was already filed, the court could set it for hearing on statutory notice on February 28, 2024, which is 30 days before trial without the need to continue the trial.
