Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jacob White, et al. vs Lanark Court Apartments, Statewide Management, Inc., Mireya Arellano, Karla Galo, and Iris Abrham. The defendants demurred to the first amended complaint, arguing that the plaintiff's allegations of battery, breach of contract, and public nuisance were insufficient. The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the battery claim, finding that the plaintiff's allegations did not rise to the level of reckless misconduct or willful and wanton negligence. The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the breach of contract claim, finding that the plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to plead each element of the claim. The judge has also overruled the demurrer as to the public nuisance claim, finding that the plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to plead a nuisance that affected a considerable number of persons at the same time. The defendants are ordered to answer the complaint within 20 days.
