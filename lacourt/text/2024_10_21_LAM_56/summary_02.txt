Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant Rockley Photonics, Inc. to provide further responses to requests for production of documents, Set One. The plaintiff had argued that the defendant's responses were evasive and incomplete, while the defendant argued that the requests were excessive and overly broad. The judge found that the plaintiff had failed to provide specific facts establishing good cause to compel further responses and that the plaintiff had not met her burden to compel further responses. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's declaration in support of the motion was a recitation of communications and correspondence between the parties' respective counsel and did not make a showing of good cause.
