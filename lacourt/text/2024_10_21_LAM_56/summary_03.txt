And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike the complaint as protected activity under anti-SLAPP law. The defendants, Paramount Pictures Corporation, Criterion Collections, Inc., and Janus Films, LLC, argued that the production and distribution of the film Romeo and Juliet, including the inclusion of a scene depicting the couple waking up the morning after their first night of marriage, is a protected activity under anti-SLAPP law. The judge found that the distribution of the film is a protected activity and that the plaintiffs, Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting, did not consent to the inclusion of the scene in the film and its distribution.

The judge also found that the plaintiffs' claims lack merit because they did not dispute the defendants' evidence of their consent to the inclusion of the scene in the film and its distribution. The judge noted that the plaintiffs' contracts with the defendants granted them the right to record and distribute the film, and that the plaintiffs' subsequent conduct in the decades that followed since the film's original release speaks to their implied ratification and approval of the film.

The judge also rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the 2023 re-release of the film was digitally enhanced in such high definition and detail that the scene became impermissibly explicit and thus a misappropriation of their likeness without their consent. The judge found that the plaintiffs' claims lack merit and granted the motion to strike the complaint as protected activity under anti-SLAPP law.
