And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two separate issues. The first issue is a motion to set aside the default of Defendant Bayer, which was entered on December 26, 2023. The judge grants the motion, finding that Defense was legally entitled to an automatic extension of their time to respond, and that Plaintiff's counsel failed to provide adequate notice of the intent to enter default. The judge also notes that counsel's legal and ethical obligation not to use defaults as a trap was not followed.

The second issue is a demurrer to the first seven causes of action in the Complaint. The judge sustains the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has failed to state sufficient facts to support the claims. The judge notes that the plaintiff's attempt to rescind the settlement agreement is flawed because he failed to either return the settlement funds or allege his inability to return them.
