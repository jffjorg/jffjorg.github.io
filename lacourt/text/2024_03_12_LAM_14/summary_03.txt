And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying, without prejudice, Defendant Ruiz's motion to compel the case into arbitration and stay the proceeding until the completion of arbitration. The motion was filed late, and the court is giving Defendant Ruiz an opportunity to re-file with proper notice.

The judge is also denying Defendant Emrani Firm's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Raymond Ghermezian, APC, and seeking sanctions of $2,499.50. The motion was filed late, and the court finds that the parties could have resolved this issue through a phone call rather than a motion. The judge notes that the parties have a history of poor communication and recommends that they use phone calls and meetings to resolve disputes rather than relying solely on email.
