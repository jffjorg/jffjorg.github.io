ANALYSIS: 
 
On June 1, 2023, Plaintiff CW General Construction,
Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action
against Defendants Kelsey Schilit and David Meredith (“Defendants”). The First
Amended Complaint was filed on January 18, 2024. Defendants filed the
instant Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint on April
18, 2024. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on May 1, 2024 and Defendants replied on May 8, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
The Demurrer is accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Demurrer, Setian Decl. ¶4.)
Defendants demur on the grounds that the Complaint fails to allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)
The First Amended Complaint alleges causes of action for breach of contract and
common counts. 
 
Allegations in the First
Amended Complaint
 
Plaintiff and Defendants had
an oral agreement for Plaintiff to remove existing carpet flooring at the
property located at 4657 Natoma Avenue, Woodland Hills, California (“the
subject Property”) and replace it with hardwood floors. (FAC, ¶BC-1.) The
agreement included labor and materials in accordance with the scope of work
contained in the attached invoice for a total contract price of $40,650.00. (Ibid.) Defendants made a
partial payment of $15,079.41 but breached the contract by refusing to pay the
remaining balance of $25,570.59. (Id. at ¶¶ BC-1, BC-2.) Plaintiff
performed all obligations except those it was prevented or excused from
performing. (Id. at ¶BC-3.) As a result of Defendants’ breach, Plaintiff
suffered damages. (Id. at ¶¶BC-4, BC-6.) 
 
The attached invoice shows
that Defendant Schilit was billed on November 3, 2022 for a balance of
$25,570.79 relating to demo carpet work, installation of plywood, sanding
floors, buffing flooring, and application of coating. (Id. at Exh. A.) The invoice also shows that a
payment was made in the amount of $15,079.41. (Ibid.) 
 
1st Cause of Action for
Breach of Contract
 
A cause of action for breach of
contract must allege “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the
resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (D’Arrigo Bros. of California v. United
Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790, 800.) As pointed out in
the Demurrer, an oral contract may be pled according to its effect, by which a
plaintiff must allege the substance of its relevant terms, which requires a
careful analysis of the instrument, comprehensiveness in statement and
avoidance of legal conclusions. (Citing Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v.
Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 993.) 
 
The First Amended Complaint
sufficiently alleges the substance of the agreement’s relevant terms. It is
alleged that the work was to be performed as set forth in the invoice; the
invoice provides sufficient detail regarding the work to be performed in nine
separate line items. (FAC, Exh. A.) Defendants argue that relevant terms, such
as the materials used, square footage, and amount of time the alleged project
took, are omitted. They do not explain why these terms should be considered
relevant to the agreement; those items were not included in the scope of work by
either party as set forth in the invoice. Defendants also argue the invoice
does not confirm the agreement because an unsigned invoice does not create a
contract or any contractual obligation. (Citing C9 Ventures v. SVC-West,
L.P. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1501.) It is not Plaintiff’s contention
that the invoice itself creates the agreement, however, only that it confirms
what the parties orally agreed. Finally, Defendants argues that Plaintiff has
not affirmatively alleged that the work was completed or adequately performed.
The First Amended Complaint need not set forth evidentiary facts demonstrating
that Plaintiff performed its obligations or was excused from them; it is
sufficient that Plaintiff alleges the ultimate fact of its performance at
paragraph BC-3. (See Logan v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1982)
136 Cal.App.3d 116, 126.) 
 
Therefore, the Demurrer to the
first cause of action for breach of contract is overruled.
 
2nd Cause of Action for Common
Counts
 
Defendants demur to the second
cause of action on the grounds that the underlying breach of contract cause of
action fails. As discussed above, however, the first cause of action is
sufficiently alleged. The Demurrer to the second cause of action is also
overruled.
 
Conclusion
 
 
Defendants Kelsey Schilit and
David Meredith’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is OVERRULED.
DEFENDANTS ARE TO FILE AND SERVE AN ANSWER TO THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
