And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies non-party Bobby Marcellus Gould's motion to substitute himself as successor in interest to decedent Simone Palmer. The motion was filed on May 9, 2024, and no opposition has been filed. The court found that the supporting declarations did not comply with the statutory requirements set forth in the California Code of Civil Procedure. Specifically, the declarations failed to provide the date and place of Palmer's death, as well as supporting facts to show that Gould is the beneficiary of Palmer's estate or that he succeeds to a cause of action or to a particular item of property. The motion is denied without prejudice.
