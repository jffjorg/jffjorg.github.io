```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain's renewed motion to compel third parties to produce documents. The renewed motion seeks the same relief as previously sought and denied in the first motion to compel third parties to produce documents. The court lacks jurisdiction to reconsider the prior ruling because the renewed motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, which requires a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide evidence earlier. The purpose of this jurisdictional bar is to protect the court from repetitive motions and incentivize parties to efficiently marshal their evidence.
