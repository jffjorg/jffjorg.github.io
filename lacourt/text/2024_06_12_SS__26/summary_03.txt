And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is that the defendants' demurrer to the first amended complaint is overruled. The defendants, Kelsey Schilit and David Meredith, must file and serve an answer to the first amended complaint within 20 days of this order. The court found that the first amended complaint sufficiently alleges the substance of the oral agreement between the parties, and that the breach of contract cause of action is sufficient. The court also found that the demurrer to the second cause of action, which is based on common counts, is also overruled.
