And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for a determination that the settlement between J&J Tree Service, Inc. and Plaintiff Babajoni Behroz was made in good faith. The motion was unopposed and the judge grants it. The judge notes that the settlement was made in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6 and that the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488 were considered. The judge also cites City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, which states that when no opposition is filed, a barebones motion with a brief background of the case is sufficient. The judge concludes that the settlement was made in good faith and grants the motion. As a result, all pending and future claims against J&J Tree Service, Inc. are dismissed.
