And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the papers filed in this case and is issuing a tentative ruling. The case involves a lawsuit filed by Alvin Pruitt against the City of Santa Monica and others for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The City of Santa Monica has made a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which means it is asking the court to rule in its favor without the need for a trial.

The judge has deemed admitted certain facts based on requests for admission made by the City of Santa Monica. These facts include that the City of Santa Monica is not liable for any injuries suffered by Pruitt, that it did not act negligently, and that any harm suffered by Pruitt was not caused by the City's actions.

Based on these admitted facts, the judge has concluded that Pruitt's complaint does not state facts sufficient to state a cause of action against the City of Santa Monica. Therefore, the judge is granting the City's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The judge is giving Pruitt (or his successor-in-interest) 30 days to amend his complaint.
