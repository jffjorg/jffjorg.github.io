 Case Number:  22STCV22794    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
July 14, 2022, Plaintiff Doris Figueroa (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Mi Jacalito (“Mi Jacalito”) and Does 1-25 for premises liability. 
On August
17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing personal service on Mi
Jacalito of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents
on February 1, 2023.  The same day, the
clerk entered Mi Jacalito’s default. 
On
January 5, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant Nicolas
Tovar (“Tovar”) as Doe 1.  The Court also
granted Plaintiff’s request to amend the complaint to replace the incorrect
name Mi Jacalito with the defendant’s true name, Mi Jacalito Restaurant, Inc. 
On September
3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service on Tovar
of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on April
2, 2024.  The same day, the clerk entered
Tovar’s default. 
On
November 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for Court judgment against Mi
Jacalito and Tovar.  Plaintiff also filed
copies of statements of damages served on Mi Jacalito and Tovar.  Each statement of damages listed $100,000.00
for pain, suffering, and inconvenience, $25,000.00 for emotional distress,
$11,172.00 for past medical expenses, and “unknown” future medical expenses. 
On
November 20, 2024, the Court dismissed Does 2-25 without prejudice at Plaintiff’s
request. 
PARTY’S REQUEST         
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Mi Jacalito and Tovar and
award Plaintiff $136,794.25, consisting of $125,000.00 in general damages,
$11,172.00 in special damages, and $622.25 in costs. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
The
relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed
the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal injury cases where
damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount listed in the statement
of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585, subd. (b).) “The notice
requirement of section 580 was designed to insure fundamental fairness.” (Becker
v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures
that “defendants in cases which involve a default judgment have adequate notice
of the judgments that may be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment
other than that which is demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has
been deprived of his day in court—a right to a hearing on the matter
adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.)  A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction
if it awards damages in excess of the amount specified in the complaint or
statement of damages. (Id. at p. 494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff has submitted a complete default judgment
application with all required information.  The Court grants the application and awards
Plaintiff $136,794.25 against Mi Jacalito and Tovar,
jointly and severally. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Doris Figueroa’s application
for default judgment against Defendants Mi Jacalito
Restaurant, Inc. and Nicolas Tovar filed on November 12, 2024.  The Court awards Plaintiff Doris Figueroa $136,794.25
 against Defendants Mi Jacalito Restaurant, Inc. and Nicolas Tovar, jointly and
severally. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
