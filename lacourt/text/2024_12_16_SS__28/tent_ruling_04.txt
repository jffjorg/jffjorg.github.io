 Case Number:  23STCV11174    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  28 On
October 2, 2024, Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (“Defendant”) filed
a notice of lodging six exhibits (exhibits 20, 23, 25, 27, 28, and 33) under
seal in support of Defendant’s motion for summary judgment or, in the
alternative, summary adjudication (“motion for summary judgment”).  In addition to the motion for summary
judgment, Defendant moves for an order sealing the six lodged exhibits. 
The
Court cannot locate the six exhibits which Defendant lodged under seal.  As a result, the Court continues the hearing
on the motion for summary judgment and the motion to file the exhibits under
seal to the next available date on the Court’s calendar. 
The
Court orders Defendant to lodge additional copies of the six exhibits with the
Court.  Defendant should lodge one set of the exhibits in the same format as the exhibits which Defendant previously
lodged.  If possible, Defendant should also lodge electronic versions of the exhibits.  Videos may be hosted on third-party websites,
and a link may be provided on the sealed exhibit list.
