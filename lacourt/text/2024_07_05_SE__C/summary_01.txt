And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on an ex parte application by Pacific Employers Insurance Company and Century Indemnity Company to intervene in a sexual misconduct action. The intervenors seek to participate in the jury instruction conference(s) solely to present and argue for limited jury instructions and special interrogatories that clarify the jury's findings on the timing of the claimed bodily injury and allocation of that injury. However, the judge finds that the application is untimely, filed just two court days prior to trial, and that the intervenors have not complied with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 387. Therefore, the court denies the ex parte application for leave to intervene.
