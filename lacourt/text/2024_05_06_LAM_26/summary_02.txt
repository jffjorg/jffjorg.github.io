And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the judgment and grant judgment in her favor. The plaintiff had filed an unlawful detainer action against the defendant, and the court had granted the defendant's motion for judgment. The plaintiff had failed to present a transcript of the proceedings and had not demonstrated compliance with the strict procedural mandates of an unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff's motion was untimely filed, as she had failed to file a notice of intention to move for a new trial within 15 days of the notice of entry of judgment. The plaintiff had also failed to file a notice of appeal within 60 days of the clerk's service of the notice of entry of judgment. The court had properly entered judgment in favor of the defendant, and the plaintiff's motion to set aside the judgment was denied.
