  Case No.:  23STCV22226
 
  Hearing Date:  May 6, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to be relieved as counsel
 



 
On March 8, 2024, Charles M. Ray of Ray
& Seyb LLP (“Counsel”), filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel
for Plaintiff Janel Castillo (“Client”).
Counsel has filed a form MC051 and MC-052 and
has lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form MC-053 pursuant
to CRC Rule 3.1362.  
The MC-052 form states that Counsel served
Client via mail at Client’s last known mailing address which Counsel states he
has confirmed as current within 30 days of the motion by text message conversation.
Counsel states that Client’s lack of communication for needed responses to move
the case forward has resulted in an irreparable situation where Counsel cannot
continue to represent Client.
The Court notes, however, that the
proposed order on form MC-053 is incomplete leaving most paragraphs unchecked, and
therefore fails to comply with CRC Rule 3.1362(e). Counsel is ordered to submit
a completed proposed order on form MC-053 filling in all relevant sections,
most importantly no. 8 which must give notice to Client of all upcoming
hearings.
Accordingly, the Court will grant this
motion, but only on the condition that Counsel presents a completed proposed
order on form MC-053 by the date of hearing on the motion. 
Upon receipt of the properly completed
proposed order, the Court will sign it and file it, after which Counsel is
directed to file and serve a copy on Client. The signed Order will be effective
only upon Counsel’s filing of the proof of service of the signed Order upon Client
at Client’s last known address. Counsel will remain the attorney of record
until Counsel files proof of service of the signed Order as to Client. Counsel
is ordered to serve copies of the instant order and the signed form MC-053
order on all parties, and file proof of service of such within 3 days.
