And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is issued by Judge Teresa Sanchez Gordon in response to a motion filed by Counsel, Charles M. Ray, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, Janel Castillo. Counsel claims that Janel's lack of communication has resulted in an irreparable situation, making it impossible for him to continue representing her. The Court notes that the proposed order submitted by Counsel is incomplete and fails to comply with California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1362(e), requiring notice to the client of upcoming hearings. Therefore, the Court grants the motion conditionally, requiring Counsel to complete the proposed order correctly and serve Janel Castillo with the signed order.
