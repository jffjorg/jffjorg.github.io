[TENTATIVE] order RE:
PLAINTIFF RAYMOND GHERMEZIAN, A
  PROFESSIONAL LAW CORPORATION’S motion TO FILE INTERPLEADER OF FUNDS,
  DISCHARGE OF LIABILITY, AND RECOVERY OF ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS



 
Procedural Background
On July
25, 2022, Plaintiff Raymond Ghermezian, A Professional Law Corporation (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant Complaint in Interpleader against Defendants Celia Vargas,
Precise Imaging, Wilshire Radiology; Ronald Fisk, M.D., Gary Chen, M.D., Bobby
Moussazadeh, M.D., Umi Of Gardena; Skye Anesthesia; Huntington Park Advanced
Imaging, CCC Surgery Center, Golden West Medical Center, Gardena Hospital,
Beverly Radiology; MDR Network Care, LLC, Bay City Surgery Center, California
Orthopedic Micro Surgery Institute, Inc., and California Radiology.   
The
Complaint alleges that in October of 2020, the case of Celia
Vargas v. Northgate Gonzalez. LLC., et. al., Los Angeles Superior Court
Case No. BC578062, was settled. After the settlement was completed the sum
of $23,520.49 remained in Plaintiff’s trust account after fees and costs were
deducted. The Defendants in this lawsuit lay claim to this remaining sum of money.
(Complaint, ¶¶22-23.)
On
September 2, 2022, Defendant Celia Vargas answered the Complaint. 
On
September 26, 2022, Defendant Beverly Radiology answered the Complaint.
On
October 19, 2023, Defendant Bay City Surgery Center was dismissed.
Default
has been entered as to all the other Defendants.   
On October
26, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to grant interpleading of all the funds,
dismiss Plaintiff, discharge it of all liability, and for attorney’s fees and
costs.
Legal
Standard
Interpleader is
a procedure whereby a person holding money or personal property to which
conflicting claims are being made by others, can join the adverse claimants and
force them to litigate their claims among themselves. (See Code of Civ.
Proc. § 386; Hancock Oil Co. v. Hopkins (1944) 24 Cal. 2d 497, 508; City
of Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122-23.)
Once the
stakeholder’s right to interplead is established, and he or she deposits the
money or personal property in court, he or she may be discharged from liability
to any of the claimants. This enables the stakeholder to avoid a multiplicity
of actions, and the risk of inconsistent results if each of the claimants were
to sue him or her separately. (Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 857, 874; City of Morgan Hill, supra, 71 Cal.App.4th
at 1122.)
“An interpleader
action is traditionally viewed as two suits: one between the stakeholder and
the claimants to determine the stakeholder's right to interplead, and the other
among the claimants to determine who shall receive the funds interpleaded ...
As against the stakeholder, claimants may raise only matters which go to
whether the suit is properly one for interpleader; i.e., whether the elements
of an interpleader action are present.” (State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v.
Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 612.)
If the defendant
stakeholder claims no interest in the funds or property held, he or she need
not file an interpleader cross-complaint. He or she may simply apply to the
court for permission to deposit the money or property with the court clerk, and
for an order discharging him or her from further liability to the adverse
claimants. Such an order will also substitute the adverse claimants as parties
to the action; or, if only money is involved, simply dismiss the stakeholder.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386(a), 386.5.) The motion must be supported by an
affidavit by the stakeholder establishing the ground for interpleader. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 386(a).) The supporting affidavit must also state that the
moving party is “a mere stakeholder with no interest in the amount or any
portion thereof and that conflicting demands have been made upon him for the amount
by parties to the action…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.5.) Notice of the motion
must be served on each of the adverse claimants to the funds or property. (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 386(a), 386.5.) “Where a deposit has been made pursuant to
Section 386, the court shall, upon the application of any party to the action,
order such deposit to be invested in an insured interest-bearing account.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386.1.)
Pursuant to §
386(f), the court may also “enter may enter its order restraining all parties
to the action from instituting or further prosecuting any other proceeding in
any court in this state affecting the rights and obligations as between the
parties to the interpleader until further order of the court.” (Cal. Civ. Proc.
§ 386(f).)
The stakeholder
may seek reimbursement for its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6; UAPColumbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.) The court may order payment thereof out of the funds
deposited by the stakeholder. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386.6.)
 
Discussion
            Plaintiff was the attorney of record
for Defendant Celia Vargas in the matter of Celia Vargas v. Northgate
Gonzalez. LLC., et. al., Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC578062. The
underlying matter was settled in the amount of $50,000.00. Medical bills/liens
on the matter totaled $146,085. The subject of this action is the remaining
funds in the attorney client trust account. Plaintiff represents that it has no interest in the funds, that it has
received conflicting demands upon the subject bond funds, and that Plaintiff has
not been successful in negotiating with Defendants’ conflicting demands. (Ghermezian
Decl., at ¶¶5-6, 9.)  
As all claimants
have been served with the Summons and Complaint, served with the instant
motion, and have either answered, been dismissed, or defaulted, relief is
proper. (CCP §§ 386 and 386.5.) However, it is unclear how much the disputed
funds are. In its motion, Plaintiff represents that $17,500 was placed in
plaintiffs IOLTA attorney client trust account and has remained in said account
since the settlement of this matter in fall of 2018. (Motion at p. 3.) Yet, Plaintiff represents in its Complaint filed
in 2022 that the remaining funds are $23,520.49. (Complaint, ¶¶22, 25.)
Plaintiff has not provided this information in its declaration and the Court is
unable to ascertain the amount of the funds at issue. Accordingly, the motion
must be continued to allow Plaintiff to file a declaration clarifying the amount
of the funds. The Court will address the request for attorney’s fees and costs
once this matter is clarified.
Conclusion and ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion
is CONTINUED to June 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Plaintiff is ordered to file and
serve a supplemental declaration no later than May 29, 2024. 
Moving Party to give notice.
