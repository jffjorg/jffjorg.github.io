Significant Statements:
- "An interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two suits: one between the stakeholder and the claimants to determine the stakeholder's right to interplead, and the other among the claimants to determine who shall receive the funds interpleaded ... As against the stakeholder, claimants may raise only matters which go to whether the suit is properly one for interpleader; i.e., whether the elements of an interpleader action are present."

And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the matter of Raymond Ghermezian, A Professional Law Corporation v. Celia Vargas, et al. The Plaintiff seeks to interplead the remaining funds in the attorney client trust account, discharge liability, and recover attorneys' fees and costs. The court has continued the motion to June 6, 2024, and ordered the Plaintiff to file a supplemental declaration clarifying the amount of the funds at issue. The court has also ordered the Plaintiff to pay for its costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred. The court notes that the Plaintiff has not provided the amount of the funds in its declaration and that it is unclear how much the disputed funds are. The court will address the request for attorney's fees and costs once the amount of the funds is clarified.
