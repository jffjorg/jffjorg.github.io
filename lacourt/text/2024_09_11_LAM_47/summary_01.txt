Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, City of Los Angeles, has moved for a protective order to prevent the plaintiff, Nicole Mehringer, from taking depositions of the Board of Rights Members who presided over her termination hearing. The court has analyzed the motion and finds that the defendant has not satisfied its statutory obligations to meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing the motion. However, the court will address the motion on its merits to facilitate an expedient resolution.

The court finds that the Board of Rights Members may only be deposed if the conduct or statements they would be required to testify about fall within one of the exceptions listed in Evidence Code section 703.5. The court concludes that the plaintiff has not met the heavy burden to demonstrate that the depositions are proper, as the Board Members' decision to deny the plaintiff's Pitchess motion has already been litigated and the court finds that the plaintiff's argument that the Board Members' refusal to disclose Pitchess documents and hostile remarks to her counsel and counsel's arguments "calls the Board members' impartiality into serious question" is not well taken.

Accordingly, the court grants the defendant's motion for protective order and orders that the depositions of the Board of Rights Members not be taken.
