Case No./Name.:         20STCV07562 DANIELA ALVAREZ vs
MICHAEL K. OBENG, M.D., et al.
Motion:                              MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
Moving Party:                 Defendant Michael K. Obeng, M.D.’s Counsel 
Responding Party:      Unopposed
Notice:                                Sufficient
 
Ruling:                               MOTION TO BE RELIEVED IS DENIED.
 
 
Background
 
Defendant Michael K. Obeng, M.D.’s (Defendant)
counsel of record, Levi R. Uku (Counsel), moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendant.
Counsel contends relief is necessary because there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
The Court has discretion to allow
an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process
of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
 
A motion to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the
client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).)
 
Analysis and Conclusion
 
Counsel has
filed Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). Counsel seeks to be relieved as
counsel on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship and communication. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for
withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the
attorney to withdraw).) 
 
However, the
Court notes that Counsel failed to provide notice within the minimum statutory
period. Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1005(b), moving papers must be served and filed at
least 16 court days before the hearing. If served by mail, the period is
extended by five calendar days.  Applying
this, 16 court days before the current hearing was November 18, 2024. Adding five calendar days for service by mail, and this motion needed
to be served and filed by November 13, 2024. Because this motion was not filed
and served until November 18, 2024, it is untimely. Furthermore, the proof of
service does not reflect that the declaration (MC-052) was also served on the
parties and Defendant. 
 
Additionally,
the final status conference is scheduled for February 7, 2025. Trial is set for
February 21, 2025. This action was filed on February 24, 2020. Given the age of
the case and proximity to the final status conference date, the Court is
concerned that a withdrawal may prejudice Defendant. Counsel has not explained
in the declaration how he has taken reasonable steps to avoid reasonably
foreseeable prejudice to the rights of Defendant. (See Cal. Rules Prof.
Conduct, rule 1.16(d).) 
 
Lastly, the
Court notes that Counsel did not write the correct information on all future
proceedings. For example, the final status conference and trial times are
incorrect in the Order and MC-052. Counsel must review this information. 
 
Thus, the
present motion is DENIED.
