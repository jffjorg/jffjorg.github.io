And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve a minor's compromise and has determined that all required information has been provided and all necessary attachments have been filed. The court finds the proposed settlement of $250 to be fair and reasonable, with $62.50 going towards attorneys' fees, $120 towards costs, and $67.50 going to the claimant, Jesus Melchor. The court grants the petition and excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference. The court also sets an order to show cause regarding compliance with payment, to be heard on a future date.
