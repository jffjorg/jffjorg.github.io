And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Pink Sparrow's motion to deem the contents of its Requests for Admissions, Set Two, admitted. The motion was filed because Plaintiff Amanda Pham failed to respond to the requests within the required timeframe. The judge finds that the failure to respond waives any objections and that the requests are deemed admitted. The judge also orders Plaintiff to pay sanctions of $1,385 to Pink Sparrow's counsel within 20 days. The parties are advised to submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person at the hearing.
