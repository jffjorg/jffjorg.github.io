And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendant's counsel to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed because of a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and failure to provide notice within the minimum statutory period. The judge denied the motion because it was untimely, and the proof of service did not reflect that the declaration was served on the parties and defendant. The judge also expressed concerns that a withdrawal may prejudice the defendant, as the case is nearing the final status conference and trial dates. The judge noted that the defendant's counsel failed to provide the correct information on future proceedings and did not explain how they took reasonable steps to avoid foreseeable prejudice to the defendant's rights.
