And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling denying a petition to approve a minor's compromise. The case was removed to federal court on February 10, 2023, and since then, no filings have been made indicating that the case has been remanded or that the state court has jurisdiction. As a result, the court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the petition. Under federal law (28 U.S.C. ยง 1446), jurisdiction of the state court ends upon removal, and the state court cannot proceed unless the federal court remands the case. The petition is therefore denied, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
