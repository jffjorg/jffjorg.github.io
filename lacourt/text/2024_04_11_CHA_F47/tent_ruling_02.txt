This action arises out of Plaintiff Jana Burkholder’s
(Plaintiff) tenancy from on or about 3/28/20 to on or about 5/15/23 in an
apartment allegedly owned, controlled and/or managed by Defendant PMI Cielo LLC
(Defendant).  Plaintiff alleges that
during her tenancy the apartment suffered from numerous habitability issues
that negatively impacted her health.
 
On 9/12/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant
for: (1) Tortious Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability – Violations of
Civil Code 1941; (2) Breach of Contract – Civil Code 3300, et seq.; (3) Breach
of Quiet Enjoyment – Civil Code 1927; (4) Private Nuisance – Civil Code 3501,
et seq.; (5) Premises Liability – Civil Code 1714; (6) Retaliation; (7) Negligence;

(8) Retaliatory Eviction; (9) Constructive Eviction; (10)
Violation of Civil Code 1940.2; 
(11) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (12) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress; (13) Violation of Business and Professions
Code 17200, et seq.; (14) Fraud; and (15) Violation of Civil Code 1950.5.  The parties were unable to resolve the issues
Defendant has with the complaint; therefore, on 2/2/24, Defendant filed and
electronically served the instant demurrer to the 1st – 6th
and 8th – 15th causes of action in the complaint and the
motion to strike portions of the complaint regarding punitive damages; physical
and mental discomfort in the 2nd cause of action; and request for
monetary damages in the 13th cause of action.
 
On 4/3/24, 3 court days late, Plaintiff filed and
electronically served an opposition to the demurrer and a non-opposition to the
motion to strike.  See CCP
1005(b).  Plaintiff “objects” to the
demurrer and motion to strike based on service claiming that although Plaintiff
agreed to accept email service with defense counsel Elmira Daniely, since the
demurrer and email came from someone else in defense counsel’s office, it “went
unnoticed.”  (See Harris
Decl.).  Plaintiff’s attorney also claims
that the proofs of service for the demurrer and motion to strike state that the
documents were served by first class mail and were never received in the
mail.  However, the proofs of service
attached to the documents state that service was made “by electronic service,”
not U.S. Mail.
 
As of the morning of 4/9/24, no replies have been
filed.  The hearing on the demurrer and
motion to strike will be continued to give Defendant the opportunity to reply
to the opposition and non-opposition. 
Any replies are due to be filed and served at least 5 court days before
the continued hearing date.
