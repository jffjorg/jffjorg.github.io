And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The petition for pre-suit discovery filed by Petitioner Estanislao Rosales is denied. The petition sought an order permitting Petitioner to obtain an independent medical examination of Respondent Saul Islas prior to surgery or any invasive medical procedure, depose Respondent prior to the independent medical examination, and subpoena the medical treatment records, including imaging, of Respondent for the independent medical examiner. The Court finds that the petition is denied due to Petitioner's failure to serve the petition and notice of hearing in the same manner as provided for the service of a summons at least 20 days before the hearing date as required by CCP 2035.040(a)-(c). The matter is dismissed.
