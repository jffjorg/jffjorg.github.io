And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has decided to continue the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike. The defendant, PMI Cielo LLC, filed the demurrer and motion to strike on February 2, 2024, alleging that certain causes of action in the complaint are without merit. The plaintiff, Jana Burkholder, filed an opposition to the demurrer and non-opposition to the motion to strike on April 3, 2024. The court has determined that the parties need more time to file and serve replies to each other. Therefore, the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike will be continued to give the defendant the opportunity to reply to the opposition and non-opposition.
