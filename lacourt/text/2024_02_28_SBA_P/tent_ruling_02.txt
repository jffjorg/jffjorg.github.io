Plaintiff Mira Costa Band Boosters, Inc. is ordered to file and serve its first amended complaint within 20 days of this proceeding.BACKGROUNDOn 12/05/2023, plaintiff Mira Costa Band Boosters, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants ZNK Partners, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, dba Lone Star Percussion (“Lone Star”), Yamaha Corporation of America (“Yamaha”), and Does 1 through 10, inclusive, asserting one cause of action for breach of contract.The Complaint alleges the following. Yamaha is a corporation existing by the laws of California and authorized to do business in Los Angeles County. Compl., ¶ 3. “[I]n order to purchase Yamaha musical percussion equipment, Yamaha required customers to conduct business through one of its ‘authorized dealers,’ which Yamaha held out to the public as being a viable company in which to purchase Yamaha musical equipment.” Compl., ¶ 6. On three (3) separate occasions, Plaintiff purchased $32,688.75 worth of Yamaha musical equipment from Lone Star, Yamaha’s authorized dealer, for a public high school in Manhattan Beach, California. Compl., ¶¶ 6-9 (alleging Plaintiff purchased the musical equipment in March 2022 (for$21,194.82), June 2022 (for $6,391.44), and July 2022 (for $5,102.49)); Exhibits A to C – copies of the three (3) sale orders. The defendants, including Yamaha, breached the sale orders by failing to furnish the musical equipment Plaintiff had purchased. Compl., ¶ 12.On 1/23/2024, Yamaha filed the instant demurrer, arguing that the Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.On 2/15/2024, Plaintiff filed its opposition.On 2/21/2024, Yamaha filed its reply.LEGAL STANDARDA demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747. When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. Wilson v. Transit Authority of City of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not on the evidence or facts alleged.” E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315. As such, the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. Ibid. However, it does not accept as true deductions, contentions, or conclusions of law or fact. Stonehouse Homes LLC v. City of Sierra Madre (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 531, 538.A demurrer may be sustained “only if the complaint fails to state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.” Sheehan v. San Francisco 49ers, Ltd. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 992, 998.“If a complaint does not state a cause of action, but there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment, leave to amend must be granted.” Milligan v. Golden Gate Bridge Highway & Transportation Dist. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1, 6.DISCUSSIONA. Meet and Confer“Before filing a demurrer pursuant to … [section 430.20], the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).The Court finds that Yamaha has satisfied the meet and confer requirement. (See Declaration of Jordan D. Grotzinger, filed January 23, 2024, ¶ 3 [testifying the parties met and conferred via phone but could not resolve the issues raised in the demurrer].)B. First Cause of Action for Breach of ContractYamaha argues Plaintiff’s breach of contract fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because the Complaint neither alleges that Plaintiff had any contract with Yamaha nor alleges facts to show an agency relationship between Yamaha and Lone Star such that Yamaha could be deemed to have been Lone Star’s guarantor. In support of the latter argument, Yamaha cites Alvarez v. Felker Mfg. Co. (1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 987, which stated: “‘One who receives goods from another for resale to a third person is not thereby the other’s agent in the transaction: whether he is an agent for this purpose or is himself a buyer depends upon whether the parties agree that his duty is to act primarily for the benefit of the one delivering the goods to him or is to act primarily for his own benefit.’ [Citation].” Id. at p. 1000.In opposition, Plaintiff insists that it has adequately pleaded its breach of contract claim by alleging that (1) Lone Star was Yamaha’s agent and (2) Yamaha made affirmative representations regarding requiring purchase through its authorized agents, which includes Lone Star.In reply, Yamaha reiterates the arguments in its moving papers.A breach of contract “claim requires a showing of ‘(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.’ [Citations.]” D’Arrigo Bros. of California v. United Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 790, 800.Here, Plaintiff seeks to hold Yamaha liable under its alleged agency relationship with Lone Star. “Agency is the relationship which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other so to act.” Gordon v. ARC Manufacturing, Inc. (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 705, 718 (“Gordon”). Stated differently, “‘[a]n agent “is anyone who undertakes to transact some business, or manage some affair, for another, by authority of and on account of the latter, and to render an account of such transactions.” (3 Cal.Jur.3d, Agency, § 1, p. 10.) “The chief characteristic of the agency is that of representation, the authority to act for and in the place of the principal for the purpose of bringing him or her into legal relations with third parties...The significant test of an agency relationship is the principal’s right to control the activities of the agent. It is not essential that the right of control be exercised or that there be actual supervision of the work of the agent; the existence of the right establishes the relationship.” Violette v. Shoup (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 611, 620; see also Gordon, supra, 43 Cal.App.5th at p. 718 (“In order to create an agency, the principal must confirm authority upon the agent.”).Here, the Court finds that the Complaint has not alleged facts sufficient to show that Lone Star entered the sale orders pursuant to and on behalf of Yamaha, or that Yamaha controlled Lone Star’s actions with regard to sale orders. Indeed, the Complaint makes conclusory and contradictory allegations, including that Yamaha was Lone Star’s employee. See Compl., ¶ 5 (“At all times herein mentioned, each of the defendants was the agent and employee of each of the remaining defendants and was acting within the scope of such agency and employment”).Therefore, the Court agrees with Yamaha that the Complaint has failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a breach of contract claim against the defendant.For those reasons, the Demurrer is sustained, with leave to amend.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
