Plaintiff seeks an order compelling further responses to four sets of different discovery. Accordingly, Plaintiff is ORDERED to pay three extra filing fees to the Court for the motions.Motion to Compel Further ResponsesUnder Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, subdivision (a), Section 2031.310, and2033.290 subdivision (a), parties may move for a further response to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for admission where an answer to the requests are evasive or incomplete or where an objection is without merit or too general. A motion to compel further response to requests for production has an additional requirement to “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(b)(1).)Notice of motions to compel further responses to discovery must be given within 45 days of service of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c), 2033.290, subd. (c).) The motions must also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b), 2031.310, subd. (b), 2033.290, subd. (b).) California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 (a)(3)).Where the court grants a motion to compel further responses, sanctions shall be imposed against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel, unless the party acted with substantial justification, or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.310, subd. (h), 2030.300, subd. (d); 2033.290, subd. (d).)Plaintiff requests that the Court compel Defendant to respond further to form interrogatories nos. 4.1, 12.1; special interrogatories nos. 4, 5, 6, 9, 15, 42; requests for production nos. 7, 8, 9, 21; and requests for admission nos. 3, 4, 9.Meet and ConferThe Court finds the meet and confer requirement to be satisfied based on Joshua Greer’s declaration, wherein he states that he sent a meet and confer letter via email to Defendant’s counsel on October 2, 2023, detailing the issues with the discovery responses. (Greer Decl. ¶ 4.) Greer also states that on October 10, 2023, the parties engaged in a teleconference and discussed the outstanding discovery issues at length. (Id. ¶ 5.) The parties then attended an IDC with the Court on November 21, 2023, where Defendant agreed to provide supplemental responses, with a deadline on January 19, 2024. (Id. ¶ 6.) The Court and Counsel also stipulated to keep all remaining hearing dates on calendar. (See November 21, 2023 Minute Order.)Form InterrogatoriesPlaintiff seeks further responses to interrogatories nos. 4.1, 12.1. The form interrogatories at issue seek information regarding any applicable policy of insurance and the name, address, and telephone number for relevant individuals. Defendant’s responses consist of objections and incomplete information.As to FROG no. 4.1, Defendant claims that the information sought is protected by attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine, but it fails to explain how. The Court finds that identification of any relevant and applicable insurance policies that might apply are subject to response.As to FROG no. 12.1, Defendant has not included all the information sought as there are omitted persons including property managers, neighbors, vendors, code enforcement officers and handymen. Plaintiff states that at the IDC, the parties discussed the extensive amount of maintenance information that Defendant was required to provide, yet the response was not supplemented.Thus, further responses are ordered as to FROGS nos. 4.1 and 12.1.Special InterrogatoriesPlaintiff seeks further responses to special interrogatories nos. 4, 5, 6, 9, 15, and 42. The special interrogatories at issue seek information regarding the amount of rent, fees, and other costs Defendant received from Plaintiff during the lease period for leasing the rental unit; the identity of all property managers for the property during the lease period, any communications with a resident of the property regarding a claim of mold at the property (specifically against unit #104 and #107) from January 1, 2021 to present; details of maintenance performed in the rental unit during the lease period; and any notifications by Plaintiff of any health conditions suffered at the premises.As to SPROG nos. 4 and 5, the Court finds Defendant’s objections to be without merit. The information of how much rent, fees, and other costs Defendant received is relevant to the issue of damages, and Defendant fails to show how this information is private and confidential, protected by attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine.As to SPROG no. 6, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to a response about the identity of individuals managing the property. Defendant fails to show that the objections are valid.As to SPROG nos. 9, 15, and 42, the Court finds Plaintiff’s objections to be without merit. The Court agrees with Plaintiff in that the discovery request involves questions about issues with mold at the property and its, which is likely to lead to admissible testimony and evidence. Further, this discovery request is narrowly tailored to a time period and specific unit numbers, and specific rental unit for no. 15. Also, the request as to Plaintiff’s notifications regarding health conditions goes to the reasonableness of the response times, the issue of punitive damages, and damages calculations. Thus, these requests are relevant and reasonably tailored to the issues at hand.Thus, further responses are ordered as to SPROGS nos. 4, 5, 6, 9, 15, and 42.Requests for ProductionPlaintiff seeks further responses to requests for production nos. 7, 8, 9, and 21. The requests for production seek information regarding communications between Defendant and property managers and J.K. Residential Services Inc., relating to the management and maintenance rental unit during the lease period; and documents relating to any water leak at the rental unit from January 2016 to the present. The Court finds these requests to be relevant to the issues in this case or likely to lead to admissible testimony and evidence. Defendant’s objections are as follows: vague, ambiguous, not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, legal conclusion, premature disclosure of expert information, disclosure of private and confidential business information, and protected by attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine. The Court finds these objections to be without merit. Plaintiff is entitled to further responses.Thus, further responses are ordered as to requests for production nos. 7, 8, 9, and 21.Request for AdmissionsPlaintiff seeks further responses to requests for admission nos. 3, 4, and 9. The requests for admissions seek Defendant to admit that it had a duty to keep the premises habitable; a duty to ensure quiet enjoyment of premises for all tenants; and that no maintenance was performed on the roof of the rental unit between January 7, 2023 and February 5, 2023. Defendant fails to respond to these requests, and instead provides objections, nearly identical to those in the requests for production and the other discovery requests. However, the Court finds that these discovery requests are relevant to the issues in this action and seeks a straightforward legal question. Plaintiff is entitled to a yes or no response.Thus, further responses are ordered as to requests for admission nos. 3, 4, and 9.SanctionsCCP §§ 2030.300(d), 2031.310(h), and 2033.290(d) provides that the Court must impose monetary sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to [interrogatories, requests for production, and requests foradmissions] unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”Plaintiff requests $2,576.40 as to the motions to compel further responses. This is calculated at .5 hours meeting and conferring, 3.2 hours researching and drafting the motion, 1 hour for reply, and 1 hour for attending the hearing, at an hourly rate of $452. The Court declines to award .5 hours for meet and confer attempts and 1 hour for reply since no opposition was filed. The Court finds the 3.2 hours for the instant motion and 1 hour for attending the hearing to be reasonable. The Court also finds the hourly rate to be reasonable. Thus, the Court awards sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,898.40. Sanctions are payable to moving party on or before March 29, 2024.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
