And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by Yamaha Corporation of America, defendant, and has sustained it with leave to amend. The complaint filed by Mira Costa Band Boosters, Inc., plaintiff, alleges one cause of action for breach of contract against Yamaha, alleging that Yamaha made affirmative representations regarding requiring purchase through its authorized agents, including Lone Star Percussion, and that Yamaha failed to furnish the musical equipment purchased by plaintiff. The court finds that the complaint has failed to allege facts sufficient to show that Lone Star entered the sale orders pursuant to and on behalf of Yamaha, or that Yamaha controlled Lone Star's actions with regard to sale orders. The court grants leave to amend the complaint to cure the defects identified. The plaintiff is ordered to file and serve a first amended complaint within 20 days of this ruling.
