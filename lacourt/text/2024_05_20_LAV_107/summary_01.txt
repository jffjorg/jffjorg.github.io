Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike, and grants the plaintiff's motion to strike. The plaintiff initiated the lawsuit on January 4, 2024, alleging causes of action for negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike on April 9, 2024. The plaintiff filed an opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike on May 10, 2024.

The court finds that the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike are untimely, as they were filed after the deadline for responsive pleadings. The court also finds that the defendant's counsel did not comply with the mandatory meet and confer requirement before filing the demurrer and motion to strike.

The court also denies the defendant's motion to strike, as the complaint adequately pleads a basis for punitive damages. The complaint alleges that the defendant intentionally misrepresented facts to his insurance company and committed an intentional tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court finds that these allegations adequately plead malice and support a claim for punitive damages.

The court orders that the demurrer and motion to strike are denied, and that the complaint is allowed to proceed. The court also orders that the defendant shall not file any new pleadings or motions without leave of court.
