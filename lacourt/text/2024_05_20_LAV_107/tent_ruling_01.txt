COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
 
(1)
  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike
(2)
  Defendant’s Demurrer
(3)
  Defendant’s Motion to Strike
 
                        



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]:

 
 
I. BACKGROUND
On January 22, 2022, plaintiff Mathew Gleizer (“Gleizer”) was operating a
vehicle with plaintiff Daniel Tubi (“Tubi” and, together with Gleizer,
“Plaintiffs”) as a passenger, which was involved in a collision with a vehicle
being operated by defendant Matthew Safapour (“Defendant” and, together with
Plaintiffs, “Parties”). (Complaint p. 4.) 
 
On January 4, 2024, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint
(the “Complaint”) alleging causes of action for (1) negligence and (2)
intentional infliction of emotional distress.
 
On March 28, 2024, Defendant filed a declaration of his counsel in support
of a 30-day extension of time in which to file a demurrer or motion to strike,
to which Plaintiffs objected the same day.
 
On April 9, 2024, Defendant filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) and a motion
to strike (“Defendant’s Motion”). The same day, Plaintiffs filed a motion to
strike the Demurrer (“Plaintiffs’ Motion”). Defendant opposed Plaintiffs’
Motion on April 23, 2024, and Plaintiffs replied to Defendant’s opposition on
May 10, 2024. Plaintiffs opposed the Demurrer and Defendant’s Motion on May 7,
2024. 
 
II. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
 
A.  
Timeliness
 
Plaintiffs have not filed a proof of service of the Complaint in this case.
Plaintiffs state that they served Defendant by personal service on February 26,
2024. (Plaintiffs’ Objection to Volk Decl. p. 2.) Per California Code of Civil Procedure §¿430.40, subdivision
(a), a demurrer to a complaint should be filed within 30 days after service of
the complaint. Per California Code of Civil Procedure §¿435, subdivision
(b)(1), a motion to strike should similarly be filed within 30 days after
service of the complaint. Thus, the Demurrer and Defendant’s Motion should have
been filed by March 27, 2024.
 
California Code of Civil Procedure
§ 430.41, subdivision (b) states, in relevant part, 
 
The parties shall meet and confer at
least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. If the parties
are not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the
responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic
30-day extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading, by filing
and serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due, a
declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet
and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet
and confer.
 
If Plaintiffs served Defendant by personal service on February 28, 2024,
then in order to qualify for the 30-day extension of time in which to file a
demurrer or motion to strike, Defendant must have filed and served his
declaration under California Code of
Civil Procedure § 430.41, subdivision (b) by March 27, 2024. Since
Defendant did not file and serve this declaration until March 28, 2024, it is
untimely and therefore, the Demurrer and Defendant’s Motion are similarly
untimely.
 
However, without a proof of service
of the Complaint, we cannot confirm the date on which Defendant was served by
what means. Additionally, judges have discretion as to
whether to consider or strike an untimely demurrer or pleading. (McAllister
v. County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281; Tuck v. Thuesen
(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 193, 196 (disapproved on other grounds by Neel v.
Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176).) As we
are unable to confirm that the Demurrer and Defendant’s Motion are untimely, we
exercise our discretion to decline to strike the Demurrer and Defendant’s
Motion. We therefore consider the Demurrer and Defendant Motion on their
merits.
 
B.  
The Meet and Confer Requirement
 
California Code of Civil Procedure §¿430.41, subdivision (a) and §¿435.5, subdivision (a)
requires parties to “meet and confer” in good faith before the filing of a
demurrer or a motion to strike, respectively, to attempt to informally resolve
the objections raised in the demurrer or the motion to strike. Each section
requires that such meet and confer be done “in person or by telephone.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.1, subd. (a),
435.5, subd. (a).)
 
Defendant submits with each of the Demurrer and
Defendant’s Motion a declaration by his counsel explaining that she reached out
to Plaintiffs’ counsel by e-mail in an attempt to meet and confer and that
Plaintiffs’ counsel responded by e-mail declining to amend the Complaint. (Volk
Decl. ¶¶ 2–3.) Plaintiffs argue that Defendant thus admits to having met
and conferred. However, an e-mail exchange is insufficient to meet this
requirement. 
 
Parties have not met and conferred. We remind both
Parties of their obligation to meet and confer with each other in good faith
before the filing of a demurrer or a motion to strike.
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.   Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike
 
Plaintiffs moves to strike the Demurrer,
Defendant’s Motion, and “related papers.” (Plaintiffs’ Notice of Motion p. 2.) 
 
“The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to
Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a)
Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (b)
Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 436.) California
Code of Civil Procedure § 435, subdivision (a)(2) defines a “pleading” as
“a demurrer, answer, complaint, or cross-complaint.”
 
Thus, Plaintiffs may not move to
strike Defendant’s Motion but may move to strike only the Demurrer.
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion raises the same arguments that
Plaintiffs raised in their objection to the declaration of Defendant’s counsel
in support of a 30-day extension of time in which to file a demurrer or motion
to strike. Plaintiffs contend that the Parties met and conferred before
Defendant’s counsel’s declaration, that Defendant’s counsel interchanges the
words “demurrer” and “motion to strike,” and that her declaration was untimely.
We consider two of these arguments above and decline to strike the Demurrer on
those grounds.
 
Plaintiffs point out that “[Defendant’s
counsel’s] Declaration states under penalty of perjury that she intends to file
a ‘demurrer.’ However, [Defendant’s counsel’s] meet and confer letter dated
March 14, 2024, only contemplated a motion to strike.”
 
Defendant’s counsel’s declaration in support of a
30-day extension of time in which to file a demurrer or motion to strike
extends the time in which Defendant may file a “responsive pleading.” Moreover,
these errors are not grounds on which a motion to strike may be granted under California Code of Civil Procedure
§ 436.
 
Accordingly, this court DENIES
Plaintiffs’ Motion.
 
B.   The Demurrer
 
Defendant demurs to both of the Complaint’s
causes of action on the grounds that neither “sets forth [any] factual
allegations to show [Plaintiffs] are entitled to an allegation of punitive
damages.” (Demurrer p. 7.)
 
A motion to strike, not a demurrer, is the
appropriate means to attack punitive damages in a pleading. (Grieves v. Superior Court¿(1984)
157 Cal.App.3d 159, 163 [“Since a demurrer¿does not lie to a¿part¿of a
cause of action, petitioners' punitive damage allegations were not subject to
real parties' demurrers. There is no cause of action for punitive¿damages.
Punitive or exemplary damages are remedies available to a party who can plead
and prove the facts and circumstances. Punitive damages are merely incident to
a cause of action, and can never constitute the basis thereof."].)
 
The Demurrer states that it is
brought on the grounds that “the Court does not have jurisdiction over the
claims asserted; that [the Complaint] does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, or which contains allegations rendering the cause
of action uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible.” (Demurrer p. 6.) However,
the Demurrer does not argue any of these grounds beyond its challenge to the
Complaint’s prayer for punitive damages, which is not properly the subject of a
demurrer.
 
Defendant’s reply to Plaintiffs’
opposition to the Demurrer contends that “Plaintiffs failed to provide facts or
information to support their causes of action” and that “[t]here are no facts
supporting either legal theory or especially the claims against Defendant.”
(Reply pp. 2–3.) However, “the general rule of motion practice is
that new evidence is not permitted with reply papers” and
“[a] trial court has discretion whether to accept arguments or
evidence made for the first time in reply.” (Jack v. Ring LLC
(2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 1186, 1210, 1212.) As raising new arguments in reply
papers deprives the opposing parties a fair opportunity to respond, we decline
to consider new arguments Defendant raises in his reply.
 
Accordingly, this court DENIES the
Demurrer.
 
C.  
Defendant’s Motion to
Strike
 
Defendant moves to strike from the
Complaint Plaintiffs’ prayer for punitive damages and certain paragraphs
containing factual allegations about “lies and misrepresentations” that
Plaintiffs allege Defendant made to his insurance company following Parties’
vehicle collision. (Defendant’s Motion pp. 7–9.) 
 
A motion to strike is appropriate to
attack a claim for punitive damages. (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984)
157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.) “In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation
of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief
must be pled by a plaintiff.¿In passing on the correctness of a ruling on a
motion to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to
strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clausen
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255 (internal citations
omitted).) “Further, even though certain language pleads ultimate facts or
conclusions of law, such language when read in context with the facts alleged
as to defendants' conduct may adequately plead the evil motive requisite to
recovery of¿punitive¿damages.” (Monge v. Superior Court (1986) 176
Cal.App.3d 503, 510.) 
 
“In order to state a prima facie claim
for¿punitive¿damages, a complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the
general¿punitive¿damage¿statute,¿Civil Code section 3294.” (Turman v.
Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
California Civil Code section 3294 authorizes the recovery of punitive damages
“[i]n an action for the breach of an obligation
not arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence
that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice….” 
(Civ. Code § 3294(a).) “In order to justify an award of punitive¿damages, the
defendant must be guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. He must act with the
intent to vex, injure or annoy, or with a conscious disregard of the
plaintiff's rights.” (Silberg v. California Life Ins. Co. (1974) 11
Cal.3d 452, 462 (internal citations omitted).) “[M]alice in fact is required
rather than implied malice.¿However, malice does not require actual intent to
harm.¿Conscious disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient where the
defendant is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or her conduct
and he or she willfully fails to avoid such consequences.” (Angie M. v.
Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1228 (internal citations
omitted).) “In order to justify an award of punitive damages on this basis, the
plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of his¿conduct, and that he wilfully and deliberately failed to
avoid those consequences.” (Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d
890, 895–96.)  
 
“Punitive¿damages¿may not
be¿pleaded¿generally.” (Today’s IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1137, 1193.) “The mere
allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an
award of¿punitive¿damages.” (Grieves, supra at 166.) And,
“conclusory characterization of defendant's conduct as intentional, wilful and
fraudulent is a patently insufficient statement of ‘oppression, fraud, or
malice, express or implied,’ within the meaning of¿section 3294.” (Brousseau v.
Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.) “Not only must there be circumstances
of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to
support such a claim.” (Grieves, supra at 166; Today’s IV,
Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, supra
at 1193 [“In addition to the requirement that the operative complaint set forth
the elements as stated in¿section 3294, it must include¿specific¿factual
allegations showing that defendant's conduct was oppressive, fraudulent, or
malicious to support a claim for¿punitive¿damages.”].) 
 
The Complaint alleges that Defendant “intentionally
misrepresented facts regarding the collision to his insurance carrier” and “attempted
to shift his responsibility and liability to Plaintiffs by lying about the
facts of the cause of the collision to his insurance carrier.” (Complaint p.
5.) The Complaint also alleges that Defendant’s “lies and misrepresentations
were made with a discriminatory intent to cause, or with a reckless disregard
for the probability to cause, Plaintiffs humiliation, mental anguish, and
substantial and enduring emotional distress.” (Id. at p. 6.) The
Complaint alleges that Defendant acted “with the knowledge that Plaintiffs’
emotional and physical distress would thereby increase, and with a wanton and
reckless disregard for the deleterious consequences to Plaintiffs.” (Ibid.)
The Complaint thus alleges that Defendant committed the intentional tort of
intentional infliction of emotional distress with either intent to harm
Plaintiffs or the knowledge that Plaintiffs’ harm would result from his
actions. Following Angie M. v. Superior Court, supra, 37
Cal.App.4th 1217 at 1228 and Taylor v. Superior Court, supra, 24
Cal.3d 890 at 895–96, these allegations adequately plead malice. These
allegations about Defendant’s intentions are not conclusory in context because
they follow allegations that Defendant’s “lies and misrepresentations” in his
report to his insurance carrier contradicted earlier statements he made to
Plaintiffs immediately after the vehicle collision, which are facts from which
one may infer Defendant’s knowledge or intentionality. (Complaint p. 5.) Thus,
the Complaint adequately pleads a basis for punitive damages.
 
Accordingly, this court DENIES
Defendant’s Motion.
