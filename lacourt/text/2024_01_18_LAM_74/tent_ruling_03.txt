 Case Number:  23STCV00827    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  74 Danny Young
v. Hyo Min Lee, et al.
Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a dispute at the Wilshire Fremont Condominium Homeowners Association,
Inc. (Defendant).
            On
January 17, 2023, Plaintiff Danny Young (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendant and others. In the complaint, Plaintiff alleges the following causes
of action against Defendant: “statutory violation,” and negligence.
            On
October 4, 2023, Defendant filed this motion for judgment on the pleadings.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A
motion for judgment on the pleadings has the same function as a general
demurrer but is made after the time for demurrer has expired. Except as
provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 438, the rules governing demurrers
apply. (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995,
999.)  
DISCUSSION  
Third Cause of Action – Statutory
Violation of Civil Code section 4177[1]
            Defendant first argues this cause of
action fails because Plaintiff was not an owner of a unit in the condominium
complex when he filed his complaint. (Complaint, ¶ 1; Martin v. Bridgeport
Community Assn., Inc. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1024, 1032; Farber v. Bay
View Terrace Homeowners Assn. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1007, 1011.) But
Plaintiff does not claim he seeks to enforce the CC & R’s or the
Davis-Stirling Act, nor does he claim any damages to his former condominium
unit. (Opposition, p. 5-6.) Instead, Plaintiff seeks damages personal to
himself. (Complaint, ¶¶ 28, 31, 32, 39, 40, 84, 85.) Plaintiff has not, however,
alleged how Civil Code section 4177 provides for such damages. Thus, the court
grants Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings with leave to amend.
Fourth Cause of Action – Negligence
            Defendant contends this cause of
action fails because Plaintiff was not an owner of a unit in the condominium
complex when he filed his complaint. (Complaint, ¶ 1; Martin v. Bridgeport
Community Assn., Inc., supra, 173 Cal.App.4th at p, 1032; Farber v. Bay
View Terrace Homeowners Assn., supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at p. 1011.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendant caused him severe emotional distress by accusing
him of financial mismanagement when he served on the board. (Complaint, ¶¶ 39,
40.) This misrepresentation (whether stated negligently, as implied by the
cause of action’s title, or intentionally as alleged in paragraph 87) allegedly
caused Plaintiff to suffer severe emotional distress. (Complaint, ¶¶ 40, 89.)
Thus, Plaintiff alleges facts sufficient to support a cause of action that does
not rest on his owning a condominium when he filed his complaint. The court
denies Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings for this cause of
action.
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings for the third
cause of action with leave to amend. The court denies Defendant’s motion for
judgment on the pleadings for the fourth cause of action.
Defendant
shall give notice.
