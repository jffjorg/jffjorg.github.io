  Case Number:  19STCV07203    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  74 Margaret
Shaw v. Dorina Schiro, et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File
Second Amended Complaint
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a dispute over premises liability.
            On
February 28, 2019, Plaintiff Margaret Shaw (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendants Dorina Schiro, Alfred Joseph Verdi, Graham Nudd, and Laura
Nudd (Defendants).
            On
October 14, 2020, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint.
            On
July 22, 2022, Defendant Laura Nudd died.
            On
July 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion for leave to file a second amended
complaint.
LEGAL STANDARD
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “[t]he court may, in
furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to
amend any pleading.”  Amendment may be
allowed at any time before or after commencement of trial. (Code Civ. Proc., §
576.) “[T]he court’s discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit
amendment of the pleadings. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it
is a rare case in which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” (Howard
v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 (internal
citations omitted).) “If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of
the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse
permission to amend . . .”  (Morgan v.
Sup. Ct. (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in
trial, loss of critical evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v.
Tokai Bank, Ltd. New York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.) 
A
motion to amend a pleading before trial must include a copy of the proposed
amendment or amended pleading, which must be serially numbered to differentiate
it from previous pleadings or amendments. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a).) The motion must also state what allegations
are proposed to be deleted or added, by page, paragraph, and line number.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(a).) Finally, a separate supporting declaration
specifying the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and
proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered,
and the reason the request for amendment was not made earlier must also
accompany the motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.134(b).) 
DISCUSSION 
            Plaintiff
seeks to amend the operative complaint so that it includes the Estate of Laura
Nudd as a defendant. As a preliminary matter, the court finds that Plaintiff
has substantially complied with the applicable California Rules of Court. But Defendants
argue the court should deny this motion because it is premature. Under Probate
Code section 9370, an action pending against the decedent at the time of death
may not be continued against the decedent’s personal representative unless the
plaintiff has filed a creditor’s claim with the decedent’s estate, the claim
has been denied, and the plaintiff has applied to the court in which the action
is pending for an order to substitute the personal representative in the
action. (Prob. Code, § 9370.) Here, however, Plaintiff filed a creditor claim
on July 17, 2023. (Jarchi Decl., ¶ 1; Ex. 6.) And Plaintiff’s creditor claim
has been denied by operation of law. (Prob. Code, § 9256 [“If within 30 days
after a claim is filed the personal representative or the court or judge has
refused or neglected to act on the claim, the refusal or neglect may, at the
option of the creditor, be deemed equivalent to giving a notice of rejection on
the 30th day.”].) Thus, Plaintiff may continue this action against the Estate
of Laura Nudd.
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.
