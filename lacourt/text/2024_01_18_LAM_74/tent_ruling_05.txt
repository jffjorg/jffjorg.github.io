 Case Number:  23STCV09516    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  74 Mario Tovar
v. General Motors, LLC 
Plaintiff Mario Tovar’s Motion to
Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set One) from
Defendant General Motors, LLC and Request for Sanctions.
 
The
court considered the moving papers. No opposition was timely
filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b)
[“All papers opposing a motion . . . shall be filed with the court and a copy
served on each party at least nine court days . . . before the hearing.”].)
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a defective 2021 Cadillac Escalade.
            On
April 28, 2023, Plaintiff Mario Tovar (Plaintiff) filed this complaint against
Defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant). 
            On
June 6, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with discovery, including the requests
for production of documents (RFPs).
            Defendant
never responded to the RFPs at issue.
            On
November 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel Defendant’s responses.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
            If
the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed such a motion,
the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)¿
DISCUSSION  
            The
court will grant this motion because Defendant never provided responses to the
RFPs at issue.
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s responses to requests for
production of documents (set one). Defendant shall serve Code-compliant
responses by January 28, 2024. The court denies Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions because the request is untethered to any attorney’s fees and costs
that Plaintiff may have incurred in bringing the motion.
Plaintiff
shall give notice.////////////////Mario Tovar
v. General Motors, LLC 
Plaintiff Mario Tovar’s Motion to
Deem Admitted Requests for Admission (Set One)
 
The
court considered the moving papers. No opposition was timely
filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b)
[“All papers opposing a motion . . . shall be filed with the court and a copy
served on each party at least nine court days . . . before the hearing.”].)
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a defective 2021 Cadillac Escalade.
            On
April 28, 2023, Plaintiff Mario Tovar (Plaintiff) filed this complaint against
Defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant). 
            On
June 6, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with discovery, including the requests
for admission (set one) (RFAs).
            Defendant
never responded to the RFAs at issue.
            On
November 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to deem admitted the RFAs.
LEGAL STANDARD
            If a party to whom requests for
admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the requesting party
may move for an order that the truth of any matters specified in the requests
be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b).) Further, the Court¿shall¿make this order, “unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing¿on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) ¿
            While tardy
responses may defeat the motion, they will not avoid monetary sanctions. (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c) [“It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction [Citation] on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure
to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.”].)  
DISCUSSION  
            Given
Defendant’s failure to respond to the RFAs at issue, the court grants
Plaintiff’s motion to deem the truth of the matters in the RFAs admitted. The
court notes that Plaintiff has not requested sanctions.
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Plaintiff’s motion to deem the RFAs
admitted. The court awards no sanctions.
Plaintiff shall give
notice.
