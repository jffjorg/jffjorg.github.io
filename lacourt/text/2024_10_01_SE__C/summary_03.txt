Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Plaintiff Xiomara Verela Mendoza's motion to set aside the Court's order deeming matters admitted in part. The Court finds that Plaintiff's counsel's failure to review the Court's order on October 13, 2023, was due to excusable neglect, as counsel was busy with another matter and did not review the email until October 16, 2023. However, the Court notes that Plaintiff has not responded to Defendant's Request for Admissions No. 4, and therefore, those admissions shall stand. The Court orders Plaintiff to serve responses to Defendant's Request for Admissions (Set One) Nos. 1-3 within 10 days.
