And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Firestone Plaza, LLC, has filed a demurrer arguing that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has ruled that the complaint sufficiently explains the specific access barriers the plaintiff encountered, including the location of the alleged barrier, the way in which the barrier denied the plaintiff full and equal use or access, and the date or dates of each particular occasion on which the claimant encountered the specific access barrier. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled.

The defendant has also moved to strike language in the complaint pertaining to injunctive relief, arguing that such relief is only available under state law and not under federal law. The judge has ruled that the complaint seeks injunctive relief under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which is different from state law. Therefore, the motion to strike is denied.

The judge has granted defendant's request for judicial notice of the list of cases commenced by plaintiff in Los Angeles Superior Court, pursuant to Evidence Code Section 452(d).
