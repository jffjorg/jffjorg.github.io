And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the defendant's motion to continue or advance the motion for summary judgment in a child sexual assault case by a clergyman. The defendant argues that further discovery is needed and that the plaintiff's deposition is set for December 4, 2024. The judge notes that the court does not have availability on December 13, 2024, the alternative trial date proposed by the defendant. The judge also references California Rules of Court, rules 3.1202(c) and 3.1332, subdivision (c), which outline the grounds for granting ex parte relief and the reasons for granting a continuance. The judge orders the moving party to give notice and notes that the parties are not foreclosed from seeking a trial continuance in Dept. F.
