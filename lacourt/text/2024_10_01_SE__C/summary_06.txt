And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff A.F.'s motion to compel further responses to Request for Production of Documents. The court finds that Defendant County of Los Angeles has substantially complied with requests related to policies and procedures, so the motion to compel further response to those requests is denied. However, the court finds that Defendant has not fully complied with requests related to social workers' confidential employment files, and grants the motion to compel further response to those requests. The court also orders Defendant to provide a privilege log in response to Request No. 123, as it has not fully complied with that request. The court sets a deadline of 45 days for Defendant to provide further responses, or a later date by agreement of the parties.
