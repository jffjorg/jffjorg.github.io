ADD-ON
Tentative Ruling 
Defendants Fayez Sedrak and O&C Hillside
Resources Management Company’s Motion for Reconsideration is GRANTED in part as
set forth below.  
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Background

On June 21, 2021, Plaintiff The Windmill Co., Inc.
(“Plaintiff”) filed suit against Fayez Sedrak and O&C Hillside Resources
Management Company (collectively “Defendants”) alleging Breach of Contract,
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and Declaratory
Relief. Plaintiff alleges that on January 3, 2020, Plaintiff entered into a
Sale of Business Agreement with Defendants to purchase the business known as
ARCO AM PM located at 13550 Beach Blvd., La Mirada, CA 90638 (“Subject
Property”) for $1,590,0000.00.  Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants failed to perform on the agreement and refused to sell
the business to Plaintiff resulting in lost profits.
On May 16, 2023, Plaintiff issued a Subpoena for the
Deposition of Third-Party Accountant John Soldat.  Soldat is the third-party tax preparer for
Defendants and provides no other services other than tax return
preparation.  The subpoena requested the
following: 
“a. Any and all DOCUMENTS
relating to Profit & Loss statements (“P&Ls”) for each year (cash basis
and accrual), audited (if applicable), including but not limited to bank
records, credit card statements, and receipts that support the P&Ls; Any
and all DOCUMENTS pertaining to journal entries regarding any and all
bookkeeping record pertinent to O&C Hillside ARCO AMPM located at 13550
Beach Blvd., La Mirada, CA 90638 from 01/01/2015 to present date. 

“b. Any and all DOCUMENTS YOU submitted to Tesoro relating
to sale of the ARCO AMPM located at 13550 Beach Blvd., La Mirada, CA 90638 from
01/03/2020 to present date. 
“c. Any and all DOCUMENTS YOU submitted to ABC relating to
sale of ARCO AMPM located at 13550 Beach Blvd., La Mirada, CA 90638, from
01/03/2020 to present date. 
“d. Any and all email or phone call records (including but
not limited to call logs) from Fayez Sedrak or any person on behalf of O&C
Hillside to YOU, pertaining to request for tax returns, profit and loss
statements, and journal entries related to bookkeeping, relating to sale of
ARCO AMPM located at 13550 Beach Blvd., La Mirada, CA 90638, from 01/03/2020 to
present date. TAX RETURNS ARE NOT DEMANDED TO BE PRODUCED.” 
Soldat did not have responsive documents for Items “b” and
“c.” He produced a Privilege Log and then a Supplemental Privilege Log for
Items “a” and “d.”  Soldat’s Privilege
Log claimed four (4) privileges: Tax Preparer Privilege; Tax Return Privilege;
Financial Information Privilege with no court Order Under Civil Code section
3295; Invasion of Privacy.
Soldat’s deposition began on May 22, 2023, but it was
suspended pending resolution of this discovery dispute.
On January 3, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion to compel resumption of Soldat’s deposition testimony and production
of documents.  The Court ordered
Soldat to appear for resumption of deposition within 30 days or within such
time as agreed upon by the parties.  The
Court also imposed sanctions in the amount of $2,785.00, inclusive of fees,
against Defendants and Counsel, jointly and severally, payable within 30 days.
On January 16, 2024, Defendants timely filed the instant
motion for reconsideration on the grounds that nearly all the documents
referenced in Soldat’s privilege log are irrelevant and
violate the privacy rights of third parties. 


Legal Standard
Pursuant to¿Code Civ. Proc. §1008(a):¿ 
“When an application for an order has been made to a judge,
or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code of Civ. Proc., §1008(a).)¿ 
A court acts in excess of jurisdiction when it grants a
motion to reconsider that is not based upon “new or different facts,
circumstances or law.”¿ (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal. App. 4th
1494, 1499.)  There is a strict requirement of diligence, meaning the
moving party must present a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the
evidence, different facts, or law earlier.¿ (Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58
Cal. App. 4th 674, 690.)¿ A motion for reconsideration is properly denied when
it is based on evidence that could have been presented in connection with the
original motion.¿ (Morris v. AGFA Corp. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1452,
1460;¿Hennigan v. White (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 395, 406.) ¿
Discussion 
Defendants state that after the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion
on January 3, 2024, Soldat disclosed the documents to Counsel for Defendants. (Benge
Decl., ¶9.) Upon review, Counsel for Defendants discovered that nearly all the
documents are irrelevant and violate the privacy rights of third parties. (Ibid.)
Soldat explains, “When I responded to the Subpoena I
mistakenly identified every communication to and from me and Fayez Sedrak
because of the language of the Subpoena. I mistakenly included all
communications as listed in my computer to and from me with the entire Sedrak
Family and businesses who are clients and who have nothing to do with this
lawsuit, O&C Hillside Resources Management Co., or the sale of the ARCO Gas
Station located at 13550 S. Beach Blvd., La Mirada, CA 90638.” (Soldat Decl.,
¶1.) “My designation of these documents on my Privilege Log was an error and
the product of misunderstanding what the Subpoena requested.” (Id., ¶5.)
Defendants argue that Soldat’s misunderstanding of the
scope of Plaintiff’s subpoena arose from the language in paragraph (a) of the
subpoena which states: “a. Any and all DOCUMENTS relating to Profit & Loss
statements (“P&Ls”) for each year (cash basis and accrual), audited (if
applicable), including but not limited to bank records, credit card statements,
and receipts that support the P&Ls; Any and all DOCUMENTS pertaining to
journal entries regarding any and all bookkeeping record pertinent to O&C Hillside ARCO AMPM located at 13550 Beach Blvd., La
Mirada, CA 90638 from 01/01/2015 to present date.” According to Defendants,
the semicolon after “P&Ls” indicated to Soldat that he was to produce
profit and loss statements regardless of which company the profit and loss
statements pertained to.  Thus, Soldat
produced communications between himself and the entire Sedrak Family, even
though they have nothing to do with this lawsuit. (Soldat Decl., ¶1.)
Defendants’ motion for reconsideration is GRANTED in part.  The Court determines that the Soldat
declaration is new evidence that Defendants could not reasonably have produced
in connection with the original motion.  The
Court grants Defendants’ motion for reconsideration to dispel any perceived
ambiguity in Plaintiff’s subpoena.  Towards
that end, the Court expressly limits Paragraph (a) of the subpoena to documents
relating to O&C Hillside’s profit and loss statements, and the basis for
those profit and loss statements, from January 1, 2025 to the present.  Any confidential third-party information
contained within said documents shall be redacted.  No tax returns, specific entries in the tax
returns, or records that are an “integral part” of the tax returns shall be
disclosed. (Brown v. Superior Court (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 141, 143-44.) Defendants’
other objections and claims of privilege are overruled.   Soldat
is ordered to appear for resumption of deposition with 30 days or within such
time as agreed upon by the parties.  In
all other respects, the Court’s January 3, 2024 ruling shall remain
unchanged.  
The Court declines Defendants’ request to review Soldat’s
document production in camera. 
Copies of the document production provided to the Court by Defendants
are to be returned to Defendants.
