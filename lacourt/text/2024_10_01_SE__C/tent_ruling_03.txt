Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Xiomara Verela Mendoza’s Motion to
Set Aside the Court’s Order deeming matters admitted is GRANTED in part as set
forth below.  
Defendant to give notice.
 
Background 
Plaintiff Xiomara Verela Mendoza (“Plaintiff”) alleges that
her 2009 Mercedes Benz S550 was stolen from her driveway on or about October 5,
2020.  When the vehicle was recovered a
week later, it had been vandalized. 
Plaintiff alleges that her insurer, Defendant Interinsurance Exchange of
the Automobile Club, Inc. (“Defendant”), has improperly refused to repair or
pay her the value of the vehicle pursuant to her automobile insurance
policy.  In a Complaint filed on August
25, 2021, Plaintiff brings causes of action for: 1) breach of insurance
contract, 2) bad faith breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, and 3) Declaratory Relief.  
On February 16, 2023, Defendant served Form Interrogatories
(sets one and two), Special Interrogatories (set one), Requests for Admission
(set one), and Requests for Production of Documents (set one).  Defendant moved to compel responses after Plaintiff
failed to serve responses by the due date. 

A hearing was held on October 11, 2023.  In its ruling, the Court stated, “it is not
clear if Plaintiff served responses [to Defendant’s Request for Admissions]
prior to the date of this hearing … The Court has not received a copy of
Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s Requests for Admission, if any such
response was served. Therefore, Defendant’s request to Deem Matters Admitted is
GRANTED, however, Plaintiff may by the end of this week file with the Court a
declaration with her responses if any such response was served prior to the
date of this hearing. This Order will become final on Friday October 13, 2023,
should no declaration be filed.” (10/11/23 Minute Order.) The Court then took
the matter under submission.  Plaintiff
did not file a declaration by the end of the week, so the Court’s ruling became
final on October 13, 2023.  
On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to set
aside the Court’s October 13, 2023 order deeming matters admitted.  Plaintiff argues the motion should be granted
on the basis of excusable neglect. (CCP § 473, subd. (b).) 
Legal Standard
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (CCP § 473,
subdivision (b).) 
The purpose of mandatory relief is to alleviate the
hardship on parties who lose their day in court due to an inexcusable failure
to act by their attorneys. (Rodriguez v. Brill (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th
715, 723.) “Section 473 is often applied liberally where the party in default
moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the motion will not
suffer prejudice if relief is granted. [Citations.] In such situations ‘very slight
evidence will be required to justify a court in setting aside the default.’ [Citations.]
[¶] Moreover, because the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the
merits, any doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the
party seeking relief from default.” (Fasuyi v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167
Cal.App.4th 681, 695.)
Discussion
Here, the Court’s order deeming matters admitted became
final on October 13, 2023.  Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to set aside the order on April 2, 2024, which is within
the six-month time period specified in CCP § 473.  Hence, the motion is timely.  
Plaintiff asserts that responses to Defendant’s Request for
Admissions were served on October 5, 2023, six days before the October 11, 2023
hearing. (Motion, Ex. A.) Counsel for Plaintiff, Vincent Davis, states that “a
staff attorney” attended the October 11, 2023 hearing on Defendant’s motion to
compel discovery responses. (Davis Decl., ¶3.) On October 13, 2023, Davis
received an email containing a copy of the Court’s order. “At the time I
received the email, I was deeply involved in pursuing another matter, and was
unable to review the email on receipt. At the end of the day, the receipt of the
Order had slipped my mind and I did not review or see the order that day.” (Id., ¶5.) On Monday, October 16, 2023, I
reviewed all my emails pending and it was then I discovered that it was too
late to supply copies of Plaintiff's responses to Defendant's Requests for
Admission, which we had served on to Defendant's counsel's office on October 5,
2023. (Id., ¶6.) “My failure to review that
email was the consequence of my inadvertent neglect in not reviewing the
pertinent email on receipt.” (Id., ¶7.) 

Defendant argues, among other things, that Plaintiff’s
counsel admits to receiving notice of the Court’s ruling on October 13, 2023,
but counsel waited nearly six months before filing the instant motion.  Defendant also argues it will be prejudiced
if the Court grants the requested relief because Defendant can no longer prevail
on its motion for judgment on the pleadings set for October 10, 2024.  
Because the motion is timely, and it remains unclear whether
Plaintiff served responses before the hearing date, the Court finds excusable
neglect under CCP § 473.  However, it is
undisputed that Plaintiff has not responded to Defendant’s Request for
Admissions No. 4 (“Admit that the EXCHANGE is not guilty of malice, oppression
or fraud under Civil Code, section 3294.”) Thus, Plaintiff’s constructive
admission to that request shall stand.   
Accordingly, the motion to set aside the Court’s October
13, 2023 order deeming matters admitted is GRANTED in part as set forth
above.  Plaintiff to serve responses to
Defendant’s Request for Admissions (Set One) Nos. 1-3, without objections,
within 10 days.
