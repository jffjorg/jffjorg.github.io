Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant, Advance Group 69-89 ETAT, granting their motion to quash service of summons and set aside the entry of default. The defendant argued that the summons and complaint were not properly served upon their registered agent for service, Richard J. Julian, at the correct address. The plaintiff, Kenneth Crawford and Jamod Rambo, effectuated substitute service on an incorrect address and failed to oppose the motion. The court finds that the plaintiff has not satisfied their burden of demonstrating that service was properly effectuated upon the defendant. As a result, the defendant's motion is granted, and the entry of default is set aside and vacated. The defendant is ordered to answer within 10 days.
