And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between C Cooper and Optum Services, Inc., et al. The case is an employment dispute and involves a request for a temporary restraining order and order to show cause re preliminary injunction to prevent the arbitration of Cooper's claims. The judge has continued the ex parte application to October 8, 2024, and ordered the defendants to file a responsive brief forthwith. The judge's determination is guided by two factors: the likelihood that Cooper will prevail on the merits at trial and the interim harm that Cooper is likely to sustain if the restraining order is denied compared to the harm that the defendants are likely to suffer if the order is issued. The judge has noted that the scope of available preliminary relief is limited by the scope of relief likely to be obtained at trial, and that a trial court may not grant a restraining order unless there is some possibility that the plaintiff would ultimately prevail on the merits of the claim.
