 Case Number:  24NWCV02923    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  C Cooper
vs. Optum Services, Inc., et al., Case No. 24NWCV02923
 
This
is an employment case. It is also a continuance. Plaintiff moves ex parte for a
temporary restraining order and order to show cause re preliminary injunction
to prevent the arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims.
 
“[T]rial courts
should evaluate two interrelated factors when deciding whether to issue [a
restraining order]. The first is the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail
on the merits at trial.¿The second is the interim harm that the plaintiff is
likely to sustain if the [restraining order] were denied as compared to the
harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the [order] were issued."¿(Church
of Christ in Hollywood v. Super. Ct. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1244,
1251.)¿“The trial court’s determination must be guided by a 'mix' of the
potential-merit and interim-harm factors; the greater the plaintiff’s showing
on one, the less must be shown on the other to support [a restraining order] .
. ..¿ Of course, ‘[t]he scope of available preliminary relief is necessarily
limited by the scope of the relief likely to be obtained at trial on the
merits.’¿ . . .¿ A trial court may not grant a [restraining order], regardless
of the balance of interim harm, unless there is some possibility that the
plaintiff would ultimately prevail on the merits of the claim.”¿(Id. at
pp. 1251-1252.)¿
