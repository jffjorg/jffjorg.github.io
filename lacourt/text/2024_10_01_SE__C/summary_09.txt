Significant Statements:

  - Economic loss consists of damages for inadequate value, costs of repair and replacement of the defective product or consequent loss of profits – without any claim of personal injury or damages to other property.
  - Where a purchaser’s expectations in a sale are frustrated because the product he bought is not working properly, his remedy is said to be in contract alone, for he has suffered only economic losses.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion for summary judgment filed by Mercedes-Benz of Ontario (dba Jones Ontario Acquisition, LLC). The plaintiff, Maria Eugenia Tellez, has alleged that the defendant breached its duty to repair her 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLA vehicle, which had defects and nonconformities within the warranty period. However, the defendant has argued that the fifth cause of action for negligent repair is barred under the economic loss rule because the plaintiff did not suffer personal injury or property damage as a result of the alleged negligent repairs.

The judge has found that the defendant has made a prima facie showing that no triable issue of material fact exists, and the burden now shifts to the plaintiff to raise a triable issue of material fact. Since the motion is unopposed, the plaintiff fails to meet her burden of proof. Therefore, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted, and the case will proceed no further.
