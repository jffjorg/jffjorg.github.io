Defendant Advance Group 06-89’s unopposed Motion
to Quash Service of Summons and Set Aside Entry of Default is GRANTED.  Defendant to answer within 10 days.  
Defendant to give notice. 
 
Background
In a Complaint filed on April 3, 2023, Plaintiffs KENNETH
CRAWFORD and JAMOD RAMBO (“Plaintiffs”) sued Defendant ADVANCED GROUP 06-89
d/b/a NORTHWIND APARTMENT (“Defendant”) for “harassment, fictitious filing
documents, discrimination fraud, and defamation.” (Complaint, ¶1.) 
Defendant moves to quash service of summons and set aside
entry of default on the grounds that the summons and complaint were not
properly served upon Defendant’s registered agent for service.  The Court has granted relief for Defendant on
the same grounds before.  
Default was first entered against Defendant on May 8, 2023.  On October 17, 2023, the Court granted Defendant’s
motion to quash service of summons and set aside default due to improper
service.  Plaintiffs served the summons at
16227 Eucalyptus Avenue #38, Bellflower, CA 90706, but the business address for
Defendant’s registered agent for service of process, Richard J. Julian, is
15320 Barranca Parkway, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92618. (10/17/23 Minute Order
(incorrectly noting that service was purportedly made at “16627 Eucalyptus
Avenue”).) 
On November 11, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an Amendment to
Complaint naming “ADVANCED GROUP 69-89 ETAT” as the correct entity instead of Northwind
Apartment.  
On April 11, 2024, Plaintiffs effectuated
substitute service upon “LAURA KEEFER APARTMENT MANAGER” at 16227 Eucalyptus
Avenue, #38, Bellflower, CA 90706.  (Amended
Proof of Service filed May 20, 2024.) 
On May 20, 2024, default was entered.  
On May 23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed proof of service by mail
upon Defendant at 16227 Eucalyptus Avenue, #38,
Bellflower, CA 90706.  
The instant motion was filed on July 5, 2024.
Legal Standard 
“A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of motion
for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of
summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her . .
. .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a).)  “[C]ompliance with the
statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal
jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24
Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)  “[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a
rebuttable presumption that the service was proper” but only if it “complies
with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.”  (Id. at
pp. 1441-1442.)  When a defendant moves to quash service of the summons
and complaint, the plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give
the court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective
service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866,
868.)  “A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not been
proper service of process.”  (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 801, 808.) 
Discussion 
Defendant argues service of
summons was once again improper because the summons should have been served
upon Defendant’s registered agent for service of
process, Richard J. Julian, at 15320 Barranca Parkway, Suite 100, Irvine, CA
92618. (Chang Decl., ¶6, Ex. 4.) Instead, Plaintiffs effectuated substitute
service upon “LAURA KEEFER APARTMENT MANAGER” at 16227 Eucalyptus Avenue, #38,
Bellflower, CA 90706.  
Plaintiffs have not opposed the
motion.  The
Court finds that Plaintiffs have not satisfied their burden of demonstrating
that service was properly effectuated upon Defendant.  
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to quash service of summons
is GRANTED.
CCP § 473(d) provides in pertinent part: “The court may,
upon motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes
in its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order
directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party,
set aside any void judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.(d).)
For the reasons stated above, entry of default is SET ASIDE
AND VACATED.  Defendant to answer within
10 days.
