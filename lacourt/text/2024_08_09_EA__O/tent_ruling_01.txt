  Case Number:  24PSCV00070    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiffs’
Application for Entry of Default Judgment re: Joseph Acosta is DENIED because
can’t hold individual officer/director liable for corporate acts. In the
alternative, default judgment is CONTINUED because of bankruptcy proceedings. 
 
Background
 
This case
arises from a home renovation project. Plaintiffs ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ and KINDRA
SANCHEZ[1]
allege the following against Defendants EFREN LUNA (owner of Safari); JOSEPH
ACOSTA (vice-president of Safari); and SAFARI LANDSCAPING & POOLS
(“Safari”): In October 2022, Plaintiffs entered into a contract with Safari for
installation of a pool and spa and remodel of their backyard. Though the
parties agreed to a completion date of July 3, 2023 and though Plaintiffs have
paid for 95% of the contract price in the amount of $231,395.00, the vast
majority of the work has yet to be completed. 
 
On January 9,
2024, Plaintiffs filed suit asserting the following causes of action (COAs): 1.     Breach Of Contract 2.     Breach Of Implied Covenant Of Good
Faith And Fair Dealing  3.     Common Count: Money Had And Received 4.     Intentional Misrepresentation 5.     False Promise 6.     Negligent Infliction Of Emotional
Distress 7.     Intentional Infliction Of Emotional
Distress 
 
On January
23, 2024, Luna filed his answer.
 
On May 22,
2024, default was entered against Joseph Acosta.
 
On May 29,
2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant application for entry of default judgment as
to Joseph Acosta.
 
On June 17,
2024, Efren filed a Notice of Stay of Proceedings indicating that the case is
stayed with regard to all parties.
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs
seek entry of default judgment as to Acosta in the total amount of $133,829.00,
which includes $132,764.00 in damages.
 
The
application is denied for the following two reasons. 
 
First,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 585, a party seeking judgment on
the default by the Court must file a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment. Here, however, Plaintiffs
have not filed an application for separate judgment as to Acosta. 
 
Second,
Plaintiffs seek to hold Acosta (and Luna) individually liable. However, it is
well-established that corporate officers and
directors cannot ordinarily be held personally liable for the acts or
obligations of their corporation. However, they may become liable if they
directly authorize or actively participate in wrongful or tortious
conduct. (Frances T. v. Village Green Owners Assn. (1986) 42 Cal.3d
490, 503-504; see also Wyatt v. Union Mortgage Co. (1979) 24 Cal.3d 773,
858.) Here, the complaint is premised upon breach of contract.
Therefore, as there are no allegations of wrongful act(s) performed in the name
of the corporation, the individual defendants shielded from liability. To the
extent that Plaintiffs may rely upon their 4th and 5th
COAs for intentional misrepresentation and false promise, respectively, those
are not well pled. Effectively, guided by the instructions set forth in Kim
v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, absent a properly pled complaint, default judgment
is improper. Should Plaintiffs seek to amend their complaint, the application
is denied with prejudice. 
 
Bankruptcy 
 
Notwithstanding, as soon as a bankruptcy case is filed,
an automatic stay immediately goes
into effect and generally prevents creditors (and other parties) from taking
most actions against property of the bankruptcy estate, the debtor, and the
debtor's property. Here,
according to the CM-180 form filed by Luna on 6/17/24, a bankruptcy case has
been filed (6:24-bk-11500-WJ) and the form mentions Safari. Therefore, until
the bankruptcy court order lifts the stay has been entered or the stay has
expired, taking any actions in this case is premature. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing two defects, the
application is denied (with or without prejudice TBD). Notwithstanding, the
default judgment hearing will be continued pending the bankruptcy proceeding.
