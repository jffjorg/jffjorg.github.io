Summary in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiffs' application for entry of default judgment against Joseph Acosta, citing two reasons. First, the application does not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 585. Second, the Plaintiffs seek to hold Acosta individually liable for the acts of the corporation, but it is established law that corporate officers and directors cannot be held personally liable for the acts of the corporation unless they directly authorize or actively participate in wrongful or tortious conduct. The Judge has also found that the Plaintiffs' complaint is not properly pled and that they may need to amend it to seek default judgment. Additionally, the Judge has stayed the proceedings due to the bankruptcy case filed by Safari. The default judgment hearing will be continued pending the outcome of the bankruptcy proceeding.
