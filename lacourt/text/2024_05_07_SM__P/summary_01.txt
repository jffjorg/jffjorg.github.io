And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendant Fadia in the case of Tabibiazar et al v. Fadia et al. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims for nuisance, intentional and negligent trespass/encroachment, and injunctive and declaratory relief are barred by the statute of limitations, which expired in 2023. The judge overrules this argument, finding that the complaint alleges continuing nuisance and that the statute of limitations is extended.

The defendant also argues that the intentional and negligent trespass/encroachment claims are uncertain and that punitive damages are not pled with sufficient specificity. The judge overrules these arguments, finding that the claims are sufficiently alleged and that punitive damages require specific allegations of malice, fraud, or oppression.

The defendant's motion to strike is also denied in part, as the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages is not pled with sufficient specificity. However, the judge grants the motion to strike as to the claim for punitive damages in connection with the injunctive relief claim, as money damages are excluded from equitable relief.

The judge also denies the defendant's motion to strike the claim for damages according to proof.
