And here is the English text summary:

The Court's tentative ruling concerns the distribution of surplus funds following a trustee's sale of property in Calabasas. The plaintiff, Ress Financial Corporation, was appointed trustee under a deed of trust dated June 28, 2018, executed by defendant Dix. The trustee sold the property on October 31, 2023. The defendants, Aposta, Inc. and Intellectual Capital Management & Servicer Inc., assert an interest in the funds.

The Court finds that the surplus funds should be distributed according to the priority of payments as set forth in California Civil Code section 2924k(a). The Court rules that the monies collected from any person ordered to make restitution must be first applied to victim restitution, prior to payment of other obligations. In this case, the restitution payment priority is to defendant Smith, who obtained a default judgment against defendant Dix and was ordered to pay restitution of $128,254.11 on March 29, 2021. The Court holds that the entire amount of the surplus funds is payable to Smith, as it exceeds the amount that was interpled.
