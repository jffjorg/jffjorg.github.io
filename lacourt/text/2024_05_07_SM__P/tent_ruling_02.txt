Ress
Financial Corporation v. Dix, et al., Case No. 24SMCV00766
Hearing
date May 7, 2024
Defendants
Aposta, Inc. and Intellectual Capital Management & Servicer Inc.’s Motion
for Order Distributing Surplus Funds 
Plaintiff
Ress Financial Corporation filed an interpleader against defendants Dix, Smith,
Aposta, Inc. and Intellectual Capital Management & Servicer regarding
surplus funds following trustee’s sale. Plaintiff was appointed trustee under a
deed of trust (DOT) dated June 28, 2018, executed by defendant Dix encumbering property
in Calabasas. Plaintiff sold the property on October 31, 2023; moving defendants
assert an interest in the funds.
Civil Code
section 2924k(a) states “[t]he trustee, or the clerk of the court upon order to
the clerk pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 2924j, shall distribute the
proceeds, or a portion of the proceeds, as the case may be, of the trustee’s
sale conducted pursuant to Section 2924h in the following order of priority:
(1) to the costs and expenses of
exercising the power of sale and of sale, including the payment of the
trustee’s fees and attorney’s fees permitted pursuant to subdivision (b) of
Section 2924d and subdivision (b) of this section…(2) to the payment of the
obligations secured by the deed of trust or mortgage which is the subject of
the trustee’s sale…(3) to satisfy the outstanding balance of obligations
secured by any junior liens or encumbrances in the order of their priority…” 
California
Constitution, Art. I, sec. 28(b)(13)(A) states “[i]t is the unequivocal
intention of the People of the State of California that all persons who suffer
losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to seek and secure
restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes causing the losses they
suffer.” “All monetary payments, monies, and property collected from any person
who has been ordered to make restitution shall be first applied to pay the
amounts ordered as restitution to the victim.” Cal. Const., Art. I, §
28(b)(13)(C).
On March 18,
2019 Aposta and Intellectual Capital Management acquired and purchased an
Abstract of Judgment secured and recorded on the property as junior lien for
$28,626.24. They renewed the judgment on January 25, 2022 for $59,689.
Defendant
Smith obtained default judgment against defendant Dix on April 8, 2020 and
recorded the Abstract of Judgment on May 6, 2020. Defendant Dix was disbarred
and ordered to pay restitution of $128,254.11 to Smith on March 29, 2021. 
Per the
Constitution, monies collected from any person ordered to make restitution must
be first applied to victim restitution, prior to payment of other obligations. Smith
has priority over Aposta/Intellectual Capital Management. The first $128,254 is
payable to Smith. This exceeds the amount that was interpled, so the entirety
of the funds is payable to Smith.
