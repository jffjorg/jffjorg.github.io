And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiff's claims for unpaid wages and inheritance. The judge finds that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel, as the same issues were previously litigated in the probate court. The judge also finds that there is no employment relationship between the plaintiff and Hoffman, and therefore the plaintiff's claim for unpaid wages is untenable. The judge notes that the plaintiff's reliance on Hoffman's promises of inheritance was not reasonable and foreseeable, and that the plaintiff was not injured by her reliance. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's claims are without merit and that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment.
