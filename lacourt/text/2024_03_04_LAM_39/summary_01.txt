And here is the summary in English text:

This is the Judge's tentative ruling on various motions filed in the case of Michael Amini v. 4525 Rosemead Blvd., LLC, et al. (Case No. 21STCV41076). The case involves a dispute over a failed property and business purchase, and the parties have filed motions to quash subpoenas, enforce subpoenas, and request sanctions.

The Judge has denied Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas because the Court lacks sufficient information to resolve the issue. The Judge has also denied Defendant's motion to enforce the subpoenas because the motions were not served on the third parties as required. The Judge has denied all requests for sanctions because neither party has been mindful of the Court's time in connection with these motions.

The Judge has also set a final status conference for July 11, 2025, and a trial date of July 29, 2025. The parties are required to prepare and file joint trial documents by July 3, 2025, and to disclose all witnesses and exhibits they intend to present at trial.
