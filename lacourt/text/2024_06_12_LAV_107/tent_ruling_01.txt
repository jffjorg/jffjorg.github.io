COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: Default Judgment
  
                        



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
[Tentative] Ruling
Plaintiff's default judgment application is valid in all respects except: 
 

The demand of
     the complaint, $63,539.29 is different from the principal amount
     set forth on both the CIV-100 and JUD-100, which both give a principal
     amount of $63,359.29. Specifically, the amount requested in default is
     less than the demand of the complaint given the 5 and 3 are switched, in
     what appears to be a typo. This value should be corrected.

 

CIV-100 Item
     No. 2 includes “$14.01” as General Damages; however, this amount is
     unsupported and it’s not clear what it is from—the late fee of 14.01 for late
     charges associated with Loan 1 are already included in the principal
     damages amount. The $14.01 in General Damages should be struck or
     explained by Plaintiff as it appears to be duplicative of the amount in
     the Demand (once the typo is corrected). 

 

Attorneys’
     Fees Calculation is incorrect. Counsel incorrectly applied 3% when it
     should have been 2%, inflating the attorney fee request by $100 (assuming
     Counsel’s fee request is based on the “principal amount” of $60,000 [the
     loans not including interest that accrued prior to filing the
     complaint and late fees, totaling $3,539].) Attorneys’ fees request
     must be reduced by $100. 

 

Interest
     Calculation is unclear and possibly unsupported. The Demand of Complaint
     includes interest and late fees for the time period between the payments
     becoming due and the complaint being filed (February to July 2023);
     however, Plaintiff also includes interest in the amount of
     “$7,290.57”.  It is not clear if
     this amount is based on a prejudgment interest rate of 10% or the 11% and
     15% interest rates of the loans themselves. The interest calculation does
     not include the number “7,290.57” so it is not clear how Plaintiff arrived
     at this value. Plaintiff must submit more information supporting the
     prejudgment interest request specifically setting forth the calculation
     based on 10% interest on the principal amounts of the loans from the date
     the complaint was filed until now. 

 
Plaintiff's default judgment application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
