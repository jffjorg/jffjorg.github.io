Statement
of the Case
 
On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant and
Bedford Avenue LLC and Does 1-20 alleging four causes of action for (1) Breach
of Contract; (2) Common Count; (3) Claim & Delivery; and (4) Conversion.
The complaint alleges that Defendant defaulted on a written Retail Installment
Sale Contract for the purchase of a 2019 Mercedes-Benz SL550R with serial No.
WDDJK7DA7KFO56 128 (the “Vehicle”).
 
Summary of
Applicable Law
 
“Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff
may apply pursuant to this chapter for a writ of possession by filing a written
application for the writ with the court in which the action is brought.”  (CCP § 512.010(a).)
            
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b), the application
must be submitted under oath and include:
 
(1) A showing of the basis of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff
is entitled to possession of the property claimed. If the basis of the
plaintiff's claim is a written instrument, a copy of the instrument shall be
attached.
 
(2) A showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of
the manner in which the defendant came into possession of the property, and,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the reason for the detention.
 
(3) A particular description of the property and a statement of its value.
 
(4) A statement, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief
of the plaintiff, of the location of the property and, if the property, or some
part of it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take
possession, a showing that there is probable cause to believe that such
property is located there.
 
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution against the
property of the plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from
such seizure.
 
Before the hearing on the Writ of Possession, the Defendant must be served
with (1) a copy of the summons and complaint; (2) a Notice of Application and
Hearing; and (3) a copy of the application and any affidavit in support
thereof.  (CCP § 512.030.)
 
“The writ will be issued if the court finds that the plaintiff's claim is
probably valid and the other requirements for issuing the writ are
established.”  (CCP § 512.040(b).)  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  (CCP §
511.090.)  
 
Prior to the issuance of a writ of possession, the Plaintiff must file an
undertaking “in an amount not less than twice the value of the defendant's
interest in the property or in a greater amount.”  (CCP § 515.010(a).)  
 
Analysis


1.         Notice
 
Notice appears proper. Plaintiff filed proofs of service on defendants
Bruce Halprin and Bedford Avenue LLC on April 29, 2024. 
 
2.         Basis of Plaintiff’s
Claim
 
            Plaintiff seeks a writ of
possession based on its claim that Defendant defaulted on monthly payments
required under a written Retail Installment Sale Contract that the parties
entered into for the sale/purchase of the Vehicle. After applying all payments
received, there is due, owing and unpaid from Defendants, the principal balance
of $63,683.01, late charges of $333.62, insufficient funds charge of $30.000,
plus interest in the amount of $1,756.50, for a total of $65,803.13, plus other
costs and interest. (Declaration of Todd McClurg in Support of Application
(“McClurg Decl.”), ¶ 17.) 
 
3.         Wrongful Detention
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(2), the application
must include “a showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the
defendant, of the manner in which the defendant came into possession of the
property, and, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the
plaintiff, of the reason for the detention.”
Plaintiff has demanded payment from Defendants and that Defendants return
the Vehicle to Plaintiff. (McClurg Decl., ¶¶ 17, 19.) Defendant refused. (Id.)
 
4.         Description and Value of
Property
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(3), the application
must include a particular description of the property and a statement of its
value.
 
The approximate value of the Vehicle is $54,215.00, according to Kelley
Blue Book. (McClurg Decl., ¶ 21.)
 
5.         Statutory Statements
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(4)-(5), the
application must include: 
 
(4) A statement, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief
of the plaintiff, of the location of the property and, if the property, or some
part of it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take
possession, a showing that there is probable cause to believe that such
property is located there.
 
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution against the
property of the plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from
such seizure.
 
Plaintiff is informed and believes that the Vehicle is located at 26632
Alsace Dr., Calabasas, CA 91302. (McClurg Decl., ¶ 20.) Plaintiff requests that
in the event the Vehicle is behind a locked door, garage, gate or other locked
facility that the County Sheriff be authorized to demand entry, break locks
and/or charge into private property upon Defendant’s refusal of entry. (Id.)
 
6. Undertaking. 

 
Code of Civil Procedure section 515.010 requires an undertaking to be filed
before the writ issues in the amount of “not less than twice the value of the
defendant’s interest in the property.” However, “[i]f he court finds that the
defendant has no interest in the property, the court shall waive the
requirement of the plaintiff’s undertaking and shall include in the order for
issuance of the writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to
satisfy the requirements of subdivision (b) of Section 515.020.” (CCP §
515.010, subds. (a) and (b).)
 
Based on the total balance of $65,803.13 and estimated Vehicle value of
$54,215.00, no equity exists for Defendants as they owe more than the value of
the Vehicle. The undertaking requirement is waived pursuant to CCP §
515.010(b). 
 
Defendants request that a redelivery bond be required by Defendants in the
sum of $67,000.00, which is the account balance, plus an additional $1,000.00,
for estimated attorneys’ fees and court costs pursuant to CCP § 515.020(b).
 
Conclusion
 
The application for writ of possession is GRANTED.
