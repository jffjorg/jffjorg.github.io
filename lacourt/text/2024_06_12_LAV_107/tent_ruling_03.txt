COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: Demurrer to the
  Complaint by Defendants
  
                        



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
Tentative Ruling:
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the
Complaint is sustained in part and overruled in part.
 
Background: 

 
            On
February 8, 2024, Plaintiff Asha Enterprises, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint for damages and equitable relief against defendants Wilmington Savings
Fund Society, FSB (“WSFS”), California TD Specialists (“TD”), New Yok Mortgage
Trust, Inc. (“NYMT”), and DOES 1-10 alleging six causes of action for (1) Set
Aside Foreclosure Sale, (2) Quiet Title, (3) Cancel Trustee’s Deed, (4)
Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, (5) Negligent Misrepresentation, and (6)
Intentional Misrepresentation. The complaint alleges as follows:
 
            On
March 15, 2022, Plaintiff purchased the real property located at 4252 Tosca
Road, Woodland Hills, CA 91364 (the “Property”). (Compl., ¶ 8.) Thereafter,
Plaintiff borrowed $846,000 against the Property from Conventus, LLC. (Id.,
¶ 9.) The note was secured by a Deed of Trust. (Id., ¶ 9.) On March 17,
2023, two weeks before Plaintiff’s note came due, Conventus recorded an
assignment of the Deed of Trust to defendant WSFS as Trustee of the Residential
Mortgage Aggregation Trust. (Id., ¶¶ 10-11.) Defendant NYMT served as
WSFS’s agent with respect to the loan and the loan servicer. (Id., ¶
10.) On April 1, 2023, when the note came due, Plaintiff contacted Conventus to
request an extension. (Id., ¶ 12.) Neither Conventus nor WSFS informed
Plaintiff of the assignment. (Id., ¶ 13.) 
 
            On
May 29, 2023, WSFS substituted defendant TD as Substitute Trustee. (Id.,
¶ 14.) On June 9, 2023, TD executed a Notice of Default and Election to Sell
under Deed of Trust, and recorded the same on June 13, 2023. (Id., ¶
15.) On August 15, 2023, NYMT told Plaintiff that the lender would reinstate
the loan and extend the maturity date to October 1, 2023. (Id., ¶ 18.) 
 
            On
September 19, 2023, TD recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale, providing notice of
a trustee’s sale of the Property on October 11, 2023. (Id., ¶ 19.)
Plaintiff therefore contacted NYMT regarding the terms of the offer to
reinstate or extend the loan, and informed NYMT that the Property was under
contract to be sold for $1,350,000, an amount that would pay off the loan. (Ibid.)
On October 4, 2023, NYMT informed Plaintiff that the offer was no longer
available, and an expedited payoff demand had been ordered. (Id., ¶ 21.)
However, after further communication, NYMT stated on behalf of WSFS that the
sale would be postponed to October 24, 2023 to allow Plaintiff to close its
sale to a third party and allow the loan to be paid off in full through the
sale escrow. (Id., ¶22.) 
 
            Despite
NYMT’s statements to Plaintiff that it would cooperate with the payoff, NYMT and WSFS failed to provide a
payoff demand to the escrow and title company handling the sale of the Property for
Plaintiff. (Id., ¶ 23.) Between October 11 and 24, 2023 Plaintiff advised WSFS,
NYMT and TD that Plaintiff’s pending escrow for sale of the Property was
scheduled to close on October 31, 2023 and requested both entities to postpone
the trustee’s sale for another
week so that the payoff the loan could be made through the sale escrow. (Id.,
¶ 23.) Both TD and NYMT (on behalf of WSFS) agreed. (Id., ¶ 24.)
However, the trustee’s sale went forward anyway on October 24, 2023. (Id., ¶
24.) WSFS was the winning bidder with a credit bid of $910,057.51. (Id., ¶ 24.)
The price at which Plaintiff was selling the Property in escrow was
$1,350,000.00. (Id., ¶ 24.) As a result of the misrepresentations of the
Defendants, Plaintiff lost the Property and the difference between the trustee’s
sale price and escrow sale price
in the total sum of $439,942.49. (Id., ¶ 24.) If Defendants had not represented
that they would continue the trustee’s sale, Plaintiff would have filed a voluntary petition for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to preserve the Property
and permit the sale escrow to close with Bankruptcy Court approval. (Id., ¶
26.)
 
            After
the sale was completed and within the statutory redemption period, Plaintiff
requested Defendants for the right to redeem the Property. (Id., ¶ 25.)
Defendants refused. (Id., ¶ 25.) 
 
            On
April 17, 2024, Defendants NYMT and WSFS (“Defendants”) filed a demurrer to the
complaint. No opposition has been filed. 
 
Analysis
 
Meet and Confer
 
            Before filing a demurrer or motion
to strike, the moving party must meet and confer in person or by telephone with
the party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would
resolve the objections to the pleading. (CCP §§ 430.41, 435.5.) 
 
            The requirement is met. (See Shakibi
Decl.)
 
Legal
Standard
 
            A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole
v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not,
however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in
the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible
in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [internal citations omitted].)
 
First
Cause of Action to Set Aside Trustee’s Sale
 
            “The elements of the tort of
wrongful foreclosure are: ‘ “(1) the trustee or mortgagee caused an illegal,
fraudulent, or willfully oppressive sale of real property pursuant to a power
of sale in a mortgage or deed of trust; (2) the party attacking the sale
(usually but not always the trustor or mortgagor) was prejudiced or harmed; and
(3) in cases where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale, the trustor or
mortgagor tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was excused from
tendering” ’; and (4) ‘ “no breach of condition or failure of performance
existed on the mortgagor’s or trustor’s part which would have authorized the
foreclosure or exercise of the power of sale.” ’ ”(Majd v. Bank of America,
N.A. (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 1293, 1306-1307; CACI no. 4920.)
 
            Here, Plaintiff alleged that (1) the
sale was “wrongful” and that Plaintiff was “misled” (Compl., ¶ 31); (2)
Plaintiff was harmed (id., ¶ 25); and (3) Plaintiff was excused from
tendering (id., ¶ 30). However, Plaintiff repeatedly acknowledges that
it failed to repay the loan when the note became due. Plaintiff failed to meet
the fourth element. Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the first cause of
action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
Second
Cause of Action for Quiet Title
 
            An action for quiet title seeks “to
establish title against adverse claims to real or personal property or any
interest therein.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 760.020, subd. (a).) In an action for
quiet title, Plaintiff must plead (1) “[a] description of the property that is
the subject of the action,” specifically the location of tangible personal
property and the legal description and street address or common designation of
real property, (2) “[t]he title of the plaintiff as to which a determination
under this chapter is sought and the basis of the title,” (3) “[t]he adverse
claims to the title of the plaintiff against which a determination is sought,”
(4) “[t]he date as of which the determination is sought,” and (5) “[a] prayer
for the determination of the title of the plaintiff against the adverse
claims.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 761.020.)
 
            Plaintiff (1) described the property
(Compl., ¶ 8); (2) alleged its ownership in fee simple of the Property (id.,
¶ 35); (3) described Defendants’ adverse claims to Plaintiff’s title (id.,
¶ 34); identified the date as of which the determination is sought as October
24, 2023 (id., ¶ 38); and (5) included a prayer for the determination of
Plaintiff’s title. (Id., ¶ 38.) Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the
second cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
Third
Cause of Action for Cancellation of Trustee’s Deed
 
            “To prevail on a claim to cancel an
instrument, a plaintiff must prove (1) the instrument
is
void or voidable due to, for example, fraud; and (2) there is a reasonable
apprehension of serious injury including pecuniary loss or the prejudicial
alteration of one’s position.” (Thompson v. Ioane (2017) 11 Cal.App.5th
1180, 1193–94 [citing U.S. Bank National Assn. v. Naifeh (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th
767, 778].)
 
            Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a
basis for the cancellation of Trustee’s deed based on Defendants’ waiver of
Plaintiff’s performance before Plaintiff’s sale of the Property to a third
party. As a result, Plaintiff suffered damages in excess of $400,000.
Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the third cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
Fourth
Cause of Action for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
 
            The Court agrees with Defendants
that declaratory relief and injunctive relief are not stand-alone causes of
action, but rather remedies. Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s
fourth cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
Fifth
and Sixth Causes of Action for Negligent and Intentional Misrepresentation
 
            Defendants
demur to these causes of action on the ground that they’re barred by the
economic loss rule. The
economic loss rule requires a purchaser to recover in contract for purely
economic loss due to disappointed expectations, unless she, he or they can
demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise. (Robinson Helicopter, Inc. v. Dana Corp
(2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988.) In Robinson the court held that
the economic loss rule did not bar the alleged fraud claim against the
manufacturer because there were affirmative intentional misrepresentations of
fact via the manufacturer providing false certificates of conformance. (Id. at
991.) To proceed on a fraudulent concealment claim, plaintiff still must show
that the fraud by concealment exposed “plaintiff to liability for personal
damages independent of the plaintiff’s economic loss.” (Id. at 993.)
 
            Here, Plaintiff has failed to meet
the requirement of pleading damages independent of economic loss. The Complaint
only alleges loss of the Property and monetary damages. (See Compl., ¶ 52.)
Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s fifth and sixth causes of
action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
