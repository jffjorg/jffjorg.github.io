And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the application for writ of possession in favor of Mercedes-Benz Financial Services, the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks to recover possession of a 2019 Mercedes-Benz SL55OR motor vehicle with serial No. WDDJK7DA7KFO56 128, which was allegedly defaulted on by the defendant, Bruce Halprin. The plaintiff has demanded payment from the defendants and the return of the vehicle, but the defendant has refused. The judge finds that the plaintiff's claim is probably valid and that the requirements for issuing the writ are established. The judge also waives the requirement of an undertaking by the plaintiff, as the defendant's debt exceeds the value of the vehicle. The defendant's requested redelivery bond is denied.
