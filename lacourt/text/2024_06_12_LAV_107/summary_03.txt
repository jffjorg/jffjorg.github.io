Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' demurrer to the complaint is sustained in part and overruled in part. The plaintiff, Asha Enterprises, LLC, filed a complaint against the defendants, Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, et al., alleging six causes of action, including wrongful foreclosure, quiet title, cancellation of trustee's deed, and declaratory relief. The court found that the plaintiff's first cause of action, alleging wrongful foreclosure, was defective and sustained the demurrer. The court overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action, alleging quiet title, because the plaintiff adequately pleaded its title to the property. The court also overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action, alleging cancellation of trustee's deed, because the plaintiff alleged a basis for cancellation based on the defendants' waiver of the plaintiff's performance. The court sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, alleging declaratory relief, because it is not a stand-alone cause of action. The court also sustained the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action, alleging negligent and intentional misrepresentation, because the plaintiff failed to plead damages independent of economic loss.
