COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: 
Motion
  to Strike Answer



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
I.
BACKGROUND
 

Factual

 
Plaintiff Riviera Champ, LP, a California limited partnership (“Plaintiff”)
owns real property located at 28375 Collins St., Tarzana, CA 91356 (the
“Property”), encumbered by another building owned by Plaintiff and a deed of
trust in favor of Clear Valley, LLC (the “Trust Payee”). (Compl. ¶¶ 6-7.) On
October 5, 2023, via US Mail, Plaintiff mailed its monthly payment for the deed
of trust using check number 1716 from its account at City National Bank (the
“Check”) to the Trust Payee. (Compl. ¶ 8.) On November 9, 2023, Plaintiff was
notified that Clear Valley, LLC had not received the Check or any payment due
for October 2023 on the deed of trust. (Compl. ¶ 9.) With this notice,
Plaintiff inspected the Check online and discovered that the check was
deposited by Defendant Plainjainebeauty, LLC, a California limited liability
company (“Defendant”), a company that was previously unknown to Plaintiff.
(Compl. ¶¶ 10-11.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant “washed or otherwise
erased” the Check to replace Clear Valley LLC’s name as payee and include it
for own name and address. (Compl. ¶ 11.) Plaintiff subsequently filed a
Fraudulent Check Affidavit with City National Bank and filed an Investigative
Report with the Los Angeles Police Department in connection with the alleged
fraudulent deposit of the Check. (Compl. ¶¶ 12-13.) To date, Plaintiff has not
received the amount deposited on the Check from any source. (Compl. ¶ 14.)
 

Procedural

 
On January 9, 2024, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint
(the “Complaint”) against Defendant and DOES 1 through 100. The Complaint alleges
the following causes of action: (1) conversion, (2) money had and received, (3)
violation of Penal Code §496, (4) civil conspiracy and (5) constructive trust. 
 
On February 28, 2024, an answer (the “Answer”) responding to the summons
was filed by MaryJaine Morales (“Morales”), pro per, stating that she played no
part in stealing, washing, or cashing any checks. (Answer, p. 2.) Morales further
states that she is a victim of fraud herself because her business information
was stolen. (Id.)
 
On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel, Joel Shackelford, appeared at a Case
Management Conference (“CMC”) where the Court permitted him to file a motion to
strike Defendant’s Answer for a failure to be represented by counsel, and noted
Plaintiff’s indication that it would possibly amend the Complaint to add an
additional defendant, Morales. (5/9/24 Minute Order.) The CMC was then
continued until July 17, 2024. (5/10/24 Notice of Continued CMC.)
 
On May 13, 2024, Plaintiff moved to strike the Answer to the Complaint. As
of the date of this hearing, an opposition has not been filed. 
 
II. PROCEDURAL
MATTERS
 

Timeliness of Filings

 
 Per Code of Civil Procedure §430.40(b),
a plaintiff has only 10 days after service of an answer to file a demurrer to
the answer. Since a motion to strike an answer may be brought, “within the time
allowed to respond to a pleading,” a motion to strike an answer must likewise be
filed within 10 days after service of the answer. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 435(b)(1),
435(b); CRC Rule 3.1322(b).)  Judges have
discretion as to whether to consider or strike an untimely demurrer or
pleading.  (McAllister v. County of
Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281; Tuck v. Thuesen (1970) 10
Cal.App.3d 193, 196, disapproved on
other grounds by Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand
(1971) 6 Cal.3d 176.)
 
Here, the Answer was filed on February 28, 2024; however, there is no proof
of service indicating when or by what means the Answer was served on Plaintiff.  At the May 9, 2024 CMC, Plaintiff sought to
strike the Answer; however, the Court instructed Plaintiff to file a motion to
strike the Answer.  Plaintiff’s motion to
strike was then filed on May 13, 2024. The Court finds the motion to strike was
timely filed. 
 
 
III. LEGAL STANDARD
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436, subd. (a).) The court may
also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id. at § 436, subd. (b).) The grounds
for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of
judicial notice. (Id. at § 437.)
 
A natural person may represent himself and present his own case to the
court although he is not a licensed attorney. (Paradise v. Nowlin, (1948)
86 Cal. App. 2d 897, 898.) A corporation is not a natural person. It is an
artificial entity created by law and as such it can neither practice law nor
appear or act in person. Out of court it must act in its affairs through its
agents and representatives and in matters in court it can act only through
licensed attorneys. A corporation cannot appear in court by an officer who is
not an attorney and it cannot appear in propria persona. (Paradise, at 867.)
 
 
“It is a longstanding rule that ”[c]orporations and other unincorporated
associations must appear in court through an attorney.” (Defendant-Beam Ltd.
Partnership v. Roller Derby Skates, Inc. (2004) 366 F.3d 972,
973-974.) 
 
 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
 
Here, Plaintiff argues that the Answer must be stricken because as filed in
propria persona by a member of the limited liability company, rather than an
attorney, the Answer is not in conformity with the laws of California.
 
Plaintiff moves to strike on the grounds that a natural person cannot
represent a corporation. A corporation cannot appear in court by an officer who
is not an attorney, and it cannot appear in propria persona. (Paradise,
at p. 898.) However, Defendant is not a corporation, but a limited liability
company. The Court finds the same reasoning applies equally to a limited
liability company, which, like a corporation, is legal entity separate and
apart from its members. (PacLink Communications Internat., Inc. v. Sup. Ct.
(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 958, 963 [“A limited liability company is a hybrid
business entity formed under the Corporations Code and consisting of at least
two ‘members’ who own membership interests. The company has a legal existence
separate from its members. Its form provides members with limited liability to
the same extent enjoyed by corporate shareholders, but permits the members to
actively participate in the management and control of the company.” (Citations
omitted.)].)
 
Here, the Answer filed by Defendant was not filed in conformity with the
law given it was filed by an entity without attorney representation; rather,
Morales, the owner of Defendant, filed the Answer as a self-represented
litigant.  As discussed above, an entity
cannot be self-represented, and as such, the Answer was filed not in conformity
with the law. 
 
Accordingly, this court GRANTS the Motion to Strike Answer with leave to
amend.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
