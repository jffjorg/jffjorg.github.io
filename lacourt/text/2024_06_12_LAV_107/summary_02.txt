```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to strike the answer filed by the defendant, Plainjainebeauty, LLC, due to the fact that it was filed in propria persona, or on behalf of oneself, rather than through a licensed attorney. The judge finds that a corporation or limited liability company cannot appear in court without the assistance of an attorney. In this case, the answer was filed by MaryJaine Morales, the owner of the defendant, without the assistance of an attorney. The judge concludes that the answer was not filed in conformity with the law and grants the motion to strike the answer with leave to amend.
