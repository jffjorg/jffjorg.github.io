And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to transfer, consolidate, and coordinate the case with an earlier-filed case in Orange County. The two cases involve common questions of fact and law regarding the alleged conversion of modular units. The judge finds that the cases meet the standards of Section 404.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which allows for coordination of non-complex cases. The judge also finds that consolidation of the actions is proper under Section 1048 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The judge orders the plaintiff to file the transfer fee and schedules a status conference for 120 days to discuss the transfer of the case.
