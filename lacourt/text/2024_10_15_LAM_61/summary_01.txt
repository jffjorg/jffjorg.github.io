And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Renaissance Imaging Medical Associates, Inc., has moved for summary judgment or adjudication on all causes of action. The judge has granted the motion as to the seventh and eighth causes of action (FEHA claims and Labor Code § 226 claim) and as to the prayer for punitive damages. The motion is otherwise denied.

The judge found that the defendant has met its burden of showing that the plaintiff, Analee Santos, voluntarily resigned her position and did not suffer an adverse employment action. However, the judge also found that triable issues exist as to whether the plaintiff's resignation was truly voluntary, given the circumstances surrounding her resignation.

The judge also denied the defendant's arguments regarding the viability of the plaintiff's claims under FEHA, FMLA, and CFRA, finding that triable issues exist as to whether the defendant failed to accommodate the plaintiff's medical leave and interactive process.

The judge's ruling is tentative and subject to change after hearing from both parties at the scheduled hearing on October 15, 2024.
