And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the Special Motion to Strike the Cross-Complaint of Defendant Robert Cruz, as to the allegations identified in the motion. The court finds that the allegations of the Cross-Complaint are barred by the litigation privilege, which applies to prelitigation communications involving the subject matter of the ultimate litigation. The court also finds that the defendant's claims arising from the protected activity of the prelitigation negotiations are not legally sufficient and are not supported by competent and admissible evidence.

The court awards attorney fees to the prevailing defendant in the amount of $12,900.00, representing 24 hours of attorney work at $535 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. The court finds that the hours expended and the rate charged are reasonable for motions of this type, given the experience of the attorney.

The court's ruling is based on the authority of the anti-SLAPP statute, which protects prelitigation negotiations and communications involving the subject matter of the ultimate litigation. The court also relies on the litigation privilege, which applies to prelitigation communications involving the subject matter of the ultimate litigation.
