BACKGROUND
 
On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff David Kermani, as Trustee of the David
Kermani Trust (“Plaintiff”) brought suit alleging two causes of action for (1) breach
of written lease and (2) breach of written guaranty of lease against Defendants
Gold Coast Crave, LLC and Cory Rooney aka Mark C. Rooney (“Defendants”).  Plaintiff now moves for summary judgment, or
in the alternative summary adjudication, on the following issues:
 
(1) Issue No. 1: Plaintiff is entitled to summary
adjudication in its favor on Plaintiff's First Cause of Action for Breach of
Written Lease against Gold Coast; and 
 
(2) Issue No. 2: Plaintiff is entitled to summary
adjudication in its favor on Plaintiff's Second Cause of Action for Breach of
Written Guaranty of Lease against Guarantor.
 
            Plaintiff’s motion is unopposed.
 
LEGAL STANDARDS – MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT/ADJUDICATION
 
“[T]he party moving for
summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue
of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.] There
is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a
reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party
opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.” ¿(Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850 (hereafter Aguilar).)
¿“[T]he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production
to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of
material fact; if he carries his burden of production, he causes a shift, and
the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to
make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material
fact.” ¿(Ibid.; Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 1463, 1474 [summary judgment standards held by Aguilar apply
to summary adjudication motions].)  
 
Further, “the trial court
may not weigh the evidence in the manner of a factfinder to determine whose
version is more likely true.  Nor may the
trial court grant summary judgment based on the court's evaluation of credibility.”  (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th. at p. 840
[cleaned up]; see also Weiss v. People ex rel. Department of Transportation
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 840, 864 [“Courts deciding motions for summary judgment or
summary adjudication may not weigh the evidence but must instead view it in the
light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences
in favor of that party”].)  
 
A party may move for
summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action, affirmative defenses,
claims for damages, or issues of duty if that party contends that there is no
merit to the cause of action, defense, or claim for damages, or if the party
contends that there is no duty owed.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).)  “A motion for summary adjudication shall be
granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative
defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.”  (Ibid.)  A cause of action has no merit if: (1) one or
more elements of the cause of action cannot be separately established, even if
that element is separately pleaded, or (2) a defendant establishes an
affirmative defense to that cause of action. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (n); Union Bank v. Superior
Court (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 583.) 
Once the defendant has shown that a cause of action has no merit, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact
exists as to that cause of action.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (o)(2); Union Bank v. Superior Court, supra, 31 Cal.App.4th at p.
583.)  Additionally, in line with Aguilar,
“[o]n a motion for summary adjudication, the trial court has no discretion to
exercise.  If a triable issue of material fact exists as to the challenged
causes of action, the motion must be denied. If there is no triable issue of
fact, the motion must be granted.”  (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise Corp.
v. Superior Court (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 309, 320.) 
 
DISCUSSION

 
“To prevail on a cause of
action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2)
the plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
the defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.”  (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)  
 
Similarly, “A lender is
entitled to judgment on a breach of guaranty claim based upon undisputed
evidence that (1) there is a valid guaranty, (2) the borrower has defaulted,
and (3) the guarantor failed to perform under the guaranty.”  (Gray1 CPB, LLC v. Kolokotronis (2011)
202 Cal.App.4th 480, 486.)
 
Here, Plaintiff has provided the
Declaration of David Kermani, which indicates as follows:
 
3. On or about August 6, 2020, Plaintiff, as
landlord, and defendant Gold Coast Crave, LLC, a New York limited liability
company ("Tenant" or "Gold Coast"), as tenant, entered into
that certain written Commercial Lease Agreement (the "Original
Lease") and that certain First Amendment to the Lease and Landlord's
Consent (the "First Amendment" and together with the Original Lease,
the "Lease" or "Commercial Lease") concerning the Premises.
The term of the Lease was for five (5) years, commencing on September 1, 2020
and ending on August 31, 2025. The Lease provided for the payment of monthly
base rent, pursuant to paragraph 3.A.(4) and Exhibit A to the Lease ("Base
Rent") of: 
 
(i) $6,500.00 per month from September 1, 2020 to
August 31, 2021; 
 
(ii) $9,200.00 per month from September 1, 2021
to August 31, 2022; 
 
(iii) $9,476.00 per month from September 1, 2022
to August 31, 2023; 
 
(iv) $9,760.28 per month from September 1, 2023
to August 31, 2024; and 
 
(v) $10,053.08 per month from September 1, 2024
to August 31, 2025. 
 
In addition to Base Rent, Tenant agreed to pay,
as additional rent, Tenant's share of property taxes and property insurance,
pursuant to Paragraph 14 of the Lease. Tenant also paid a security deposit
under the Lease in the sum of $9,200.00 (the "Security Deposit").
Attached to the concurrently filed Appendix of Evidence ("Appendix")
as Exhibit "2" is a true and correct copy of the referenced
Commercial Lease, which is incorporated by reference herein.  
 
4. Concurrently with the execution of the Lease,
defendant Cory Rooney, an individual, aka Mark C. Rooney
("Guarantor") executed a Guaranty of Lease (the
"Guaranty"), which provides that Guarantor "jointly, severally,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee[s] the prompt payment by Tenant of
all rents and all other sums payable by Tenant s under said Lease and the
faithful and prompt performance by Tenant of each and every one of the terms,
conditions and covenants of said Lease to be kept and performed by
Tenant." Attached to the Appendix as Exhibit "3" is a true and
correct copy of the Guaranty, which is incorporated by reference herein. Tenant
and Guarantors are collectively, "Defendants".
 
5. I was directly involved in negotiations
concerning the Lease and the Guaranty, including the signing of same. I was
also directly involved in personally collecting rent checks from Tenant. I also
have personal knowledge of leasing commissions, advertising costs, property
taxes, and prope1iy insurance expenses relating to the Premises. I also have
personal knowledge of all rent payments by Tenant and all defaults by Tenant in
the payment of rent under the Lease. I also have personal knowledge of the New
Lease, defined in paragraph 7 of this declaration. 
 
6. Pursuant to the terms of the Lease, Tenant
entered into possession of the Premises on or about September 1, 2020, but
Defendants have not performed under the Lease and Guaranty, respectively, by
failing to pay Plaintiff certain Base Rent under the Lease. 
 
7. Furthermore, in violation of, without
limitation, paragraph 25 of the Lease, on or about January 11, 2023 (the
"Abandonment Date"), Tenant abandoned the Premises and surrendered
the keys to Plaintiff. Thereafter, Plaintiff diligently pursued mitigating its
damages and secured a new lease (the "New Lease") concerning the
Premises with a new lessee. The term of the New Lease is from July 15, 2023
through July 15, 2025. The new lessee began paying base rent only on July 15,
2023 at the rate of $5,000.00 per month through July 14, 2024, and the new
lessee is obligated under the New Lease to pay base rent only at the rate of
$5,500.00 per month for the period from July 15, 2024 through July 15, 2025.
 
8. Gold Coast under the Lease and Guarantor under
the Guaranty remain jointly and severally liable for rental damages which were
not mitigated by the New Lease, and which are available under, without
limitation, paragraph 25 of the Lease and California Civil Code Section 1951.2
on account of the termination of the Lease due to Gold Coast's failure to perform
under the Lease by its non-payment of rent and its abandonment of the Premises.

 
9. In view of Tenant's failure to perform under
the Lease, and pursuant to paragraphs 3.A.(4), 25 and rent schedule in Exhibit
"A" to the First Amendment, there remains the gross amount of rental
damages owing to Plaintiff, as a result of Gold Coast's failure to perform
under the Lease, in an amount of $340,372.32 for the period from December 1,
2021 through August 31, 2025 (the "Period"), comprised of: 
 
(i) Base Rent for the period from December 1,
2021 through August 31, 2022, at the rate of $9,200.00 per month, in the total
sum of $82,800.00, exclusive of interest, reasonable attorney's fees and costs;
plus 
 
(ii) Base Rent for the period from September 1,
2022 through August 31, 2023, at the rate of $9,476.00 per month, in the total
sum of $113,712.00, exclusive of leasing commissions, advertising costs,
interest, reasonable attorney's fees and costs; plus 
 
(iii) Base Rent for the period from September 1,
2023 through August 31, 2024, at the rate of $9,760.28 per month, in the total
sum of $117,123.36 exclusive of leasing commissions, advertising costs,
interest, reasonable attorney's fees and costs; plus 
 
(iv) Base Rent for the period from September 1,
2024 through August 31, 2025, at the rate of $10,053.08 per month, in the total
sum of $120,636.96 exclusive of leasing commissions, advertising costs,
interest, reasonable attorney's fees and costs; plus 
 
(v) Tenant's share of property tax during the
period from September 1, 2020 through August 31, 2025, at the rate of
$16,260.00 per year, in the total sum of $81,300.00; plus
 
(vi) Tenant's share of property insurance during
the period from September 1, 2020 through August 31, 2025, at the rate of
$1,200 per year, in the total sum of $6,000.00; less 
 
(vii) Rent reduction on account of mitigation
under the New Lease at the Premises for the period from July 15, 2023 through
July 14, 2024, at the rate of $5,000.00 per month, in the total sum of
$60,000.00; less 
 
(viii) Rent reduction on account of mitigation
under the New Lease at the Premises for the period from July 15, 2024 through
July 15, 2025, at the rate of $5,500.00 per month, in the total sum of
$66,000.00; less 
 
(ix) Rent reduction at the Premises, per separate
agreement of Plaintiff and Tenant, during the period from December 1, 2021
through January 2023, at the rate of $1,500.00 per month, in the total sum
$21,000.00; less
 
(x) Rent payments made by Gold Coast since
November 1, 2021 in the total sum of $25,000.00; less
 
(xi) Application of the Security Deposit under
the Lease in the sum of $9,200.00 for the month of December 2021. 
 
10. As past due rent and other charges under the
Lease are due and owing by Defendants to Plaintiff in an amount of $340,372.32
through the Period, Guarantor is personally, jointly and severally, liable to
Plaintiff for $340,372.32.
 
(Kermani Decl. ¶¶ 3-10.)  
 
Attached as Exhibit 2 is a fully
executed copy of the lease agreement, which matches the description in
Kermani’s declaration, except that the lease agreement indicates Defendant was
to pay a “Security Deposit” in the amount of $9,200 plus an “Additional
Security Deposit” in the amount of $9,200 due on January 1, 2021, whereas the
Kermani declaration addresses only a single security deposit in the amount of
$9,200.  Attached as Exhibit 3 is a copy
of the Guaranty, signed by “Mark Cory Rooney” as described in the Kermani
Declaration.
 
While Plaintiff’s evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff has incurred
damages, before the Court can enter a specific monetary judgment in favor of
Plaintiff, Plaintiff must provide a supplemental declaration addressing the
“Additional Security Deposit” of $9,200 (i.e. whether Defendant actually paid
it and whether an additional $9,200 should be deducted from the amount
Plaintiff claims.)  Further, if the
additional $9,200 should be deducted from the judgment, the proposed judgment
should so reflect.
 
Notwithstanding the
inconsistency regarding the “Additional Security Deposit” in the amount of
$9,200, Plaintiff has demonstrated the elements of both claims are
satisfied.  Namely, Plaintiff has
demonstrated (1) the existence of the lease agreement (Kermani Decl. ¶ 3 and
Ex. 2); (2) Plaintiff’s performance (Kermani Decl. ¶ 6); (3) Defendant’s breach
(Ibid.); and (4) Plaintiff’s damages (Kermani Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9-10.)  Further, Plaintiff has demonstrated (1) the
existence of a valid guaranty (Kermani Decl. ¶ 4 and Ex. 3); (2) Defendant’s
default (Kermani Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8); and (3) Defendant’s failure to perform under
the guaranty (Ibid.)
 
Moreover, because default has
been entered against Defendant Gold Coast, the proper procedural vehicle to
obtain a judgment against it is to request a default judgment.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 585.)  Summary judgment is not a “default judgment.”  (English
v. IKON Business Solutions, Inc. (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130,
137-138.)  Importantly, Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision
(b), which outlines the procedure for a party to request relief from a default
judgment, does not apply to summary judgments.  (Ibid.)  Thus,
granting Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment as to Defendants Gold Coast
would deprive it of its rights and remedies as a defaulted
defendant.  Thus, the Court will deny the motion regarding Defendant
Gold Coast.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
With respect to Defendant Gold Coast Crave, LLC, Plaintiff’s motion
for summary judgment or in the alternative motion for summary adjudication is
denied as procedurally defective.  
 
Concerning Defendant Cory Rooney, the Court continues the hearing on
the motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative motion for summary
adjudication, to August 1, 2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.  Plaintiff shall file and serve on or before July
19, 2024 supplemental papers addressing the issue noted above.
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
