TENTATIVE
RULING
 
            The
Court GRANTS the Motion for Relief from Waiver of Objections. 
 
            Evidentiary
Objections : Overruled .
 
            Defendant
objects to the following portions of Andrew V. Jablon’s Declaration: 
 
            OBJECTION
NO. 1: Paragraph 5, page 10, lines 21-22: “Upon receiving the RFAs and Form
Interrogatories (collectively, the ‘Discovery’), it was forwarded to a legal
assistant for calendaring, as is the custom and practice of RPB.” Lack of
personal knowledge (Evid. Code § 702(a))
            OBJECTION
NO. 2: Paragraph 6, page 10, lines 23-26: “Instead of calendaring the Discovery
as a ‘timed entry’ – i.e., a task to be completed by a specific time on a
specific day (as per counsel’s firm policy) – that would be readily visible on
the calendar, it was erroneously calendared as an untimed ‘event’ such that it
was lost among a multitude of autogenerated entries – e.g., holidays, national
days, etc. on the same day.” Lack of personal knowledge (Evid. Code § 702(a))
 
Reasoning
 
            California
Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.280(a) provides: If a party to whom requests for
admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules
apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for admission are directed waives any
objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product . . . . The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.
(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
 
Substantial Compliance 
 
            On
March 15, 2024, nZania served verified responses to the RFAs under California
Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.210, § 2033.220, and § 2033.230, along with
responses to corresponding Form Interrogatory 17.1. (See Mot. for Relief, Exh.
2 – Plaintiff’s Responses to RFAs.) The Court finds that Plaintiff’s responses
were substantially compliant.  If
Defendants believe otherwise, they may move to compel a further response if
appropriate.
 
 
Excusable Neglect 
            
            On
January 23, 2024, defendant Buchalter, a Professional Corporation (“Buchalter”)
served Requests for Admission to Plaintiff nZania, LLC (Set One) (the “RFAs”)
and Form Interrogatories – General, Set No. Two (the “Form Interrogatories”) on
nZania, by electronic mail. (Jablon Decl. ¶ 5.) The RFAs consisted of
seventy-five (75) requests for admissions of fact and genuineness of documents.
(Id. at ¶ 5.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that “instead of calendaring
the Discovery as a “timed entry” – i.e., a task to be completed by a specific
time on a specific day (as per counsel’s firm policy) – that would be readily
visible on the calendar, it was erroneously calendared as an untimed “event”
such that it was lost among a multitude of autogenerated entries – e.g.,
holidays, national days, etc. on the same day.” (Id. at ¶ 6.) As a
result of the miscalendaring of the response date, Plaintiff’s counsel states
that he was not alerted of the response date and inadvertently missed the
February 26, 2024, deadline. (Id. at ¶ 7.) Pursuant to California Code
of Civil Procedure § 2033.250, § 2033.260 and § 1010.6, responses to the
Discovery were due on February 26, 2024. Defendants’ reliance on Huh v. Wang
is meritless, because in that case the attorney miscalendared a Motion for
Summary Judgment, not a discovery request. (Huh v. Wang, 158 Cal.App.4th
1406, 1423 (2007).) 
 
            In
Comunidad en Accion v. Los Angeles City Council, relief from waiver was
granted where the attorney failed “to enter the date on the calendar.” (Comunidad
en Accion v. Los Angeles City Council, 219 Cal.App.4th 1116,1135 (2013).)
Defendants argue that this case is distinguishable because the attorney in Comunidad
failed to enter the date into the calendar but here, the date was calendared as
an untimed event. The Court does not find that distinction persuasive.  The error here is  analogous to the error in Comunidad.
Notably, Plaintiff’s counsel states that “there have been no other calendar
errors or missed deadlines in this action or the prior related action.” (Supp.
Jablon Decl. ¶¶ 10.)Thus, this is excusable neglect. 
 
            Therefore,
the Court finds that Plaintiff satisfied its burden. The Court GRANTS the
Motion for Relief from Waiver of Objections.
