And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge granted the plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of objections. The defendants had objected to certain portions of the plaintiff's counsel's declaration, specifically paragraphs 5 and 6. The judge found that the plaintiff's responses to the discovery requests were substantially compliant and that the plaintiff's counsel's mistake in missing the deadline was excusable neglect. The judge noted that this case is analogous to Comunidad en Accion v. Los Angeles City Council, where relief from waiver was granted due to an attorney's failure to enter a date on the calendar. The judge also distinguished Huh v. Wang, where the attorney miscalendared a motion for summary judgment, from the present case.
