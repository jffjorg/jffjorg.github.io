And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, dismissing the defendant's demurrer to the first amended complaint. The judge found that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged conversion of their funds by the defendant, and that the defendant's claims of holding the funds pending investigation are insufficient. The judge also denied the defendant's demurrer to the causes of action for unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, and professional negligence. The judge overruled the defendant's demurrer to the 4th cause of action for violation of Penal Code Section 496, finding that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the funds were stolen from them.
