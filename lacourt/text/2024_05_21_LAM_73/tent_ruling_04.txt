APPLICATION AND ORDER FOR APPEARANCE AND

TENTATIVE RULING
 
GRANTED
 
BACKGROUND
 
On June 27,
2018, Plaintiffs Kimheng “Sam” Lao and Lily Chang filed this lawsuit against
Defendant Kim Sharma alleging causes of action for:
C/A 1: Breach
of Written Contract 
C/A 2: Breach
of Oral Contract 
C/A 3:
Promissory Fraud and Deceit 
 
Plaintiffs are
married and own a produce distribution company.  Defendant Kim Sharma is
the owner of an agricultural business called “Ms. Asia Fresh” or “Agrorincon S.
De P.R. DE R.L.” On October 5,
2017, Plaintiffs and Defendant entered a promissory note agreement for
Plaintiffs to lend Defendant $100,000 (and to allow Defendant to borrow further
funds) in exchange for Defendant to ship quality produce and other sellable
goods to Plaintiff’s company per separate invoices (deducting 30% of the total
invoice as payment to the agreement).  In the event of default, Plaintiffs
could terminate the agreement and demand payment of monies owed due within 7
business days. Interest on unpaid principal balance accrues at the rate of 1.5%
per annum.  Between September 2017 through January 2018, Plaintiffs made 9
wire transfers to Defendant, totaling $155,000.  Between December 5, 2017
and January 22, 2018, Defendant made approximately 6 ships to Defendant, but
nearly all goods were of such low quality that they were unsellable (thus in
violation of the agreement).  No further shipments were made after January
22, 2018. On May 10,
2018, Plaintiffs sent a letter to Defendant, notifying her of the breach and
demanding monies due and payable.  
 
On August 23,
2019, the Court entered Judgment for Plaintiffs and against Defendant in the
total amount of $107,004.95. 
 
On January
18, 2024, Plaintiffs (now Judgment Creditor) filed the instant Application and
Order for Appearance and Examination — Enforcement of Judgment against
Defendant Sharma (now Judgment Debtor). 
 
No opposition or other response
has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
 
“The judgment
creditor may apply to the proper court for an order requiring the judgment
debtor to appear before the court, or before a referee appointed by the court,
at a time and place specified in the order, to furnish information to aid in
enforcement of the money judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (a).) 
 
“If the
judgment creditor has not caused the judgment debtor to be examined under this
section during the preceding 120 days, the court shall make the order upon ex
parte application of the judgment creditor.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd.
(b).) 
 
“If the
judgment creditor has caused the judgment debtor to be examined under this
section during the preceding 120 days, the court shall make the order if the
judgment creditor by affidavit or otherwise shows good cause for the order. The
application shall be made on noticed motion if the court so directs or a court
rule so requires. Otherwise, it may be made ex parte.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
708.110, subd. (c).) 
 
“The judgment
creditor shall personally serve a copy of the order on the judgment debtor not
less than 10 days before the date set for the examination. Service shall be
made in the manner specified in Section 415.10. Service of the order creates a
lien on the personal property of the judgment debtor for a period of one year
from the date of the order unless extended or sooner terminated by the court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (d).) 
 
“The order
shall contain the following statement in 14-point boldface type if printed or
in capital letters if typed: ‘NOTICE TO JUDGMENT DEBTOR. If you fail to appear
at the time and place specified in this order, you may be subject to arrest and
punishment for contempt of court and the court may make an order requiring you
to pay the reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the judgment creditor in this
proceeding.’” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (e).)
 
B.     Discussion
 
Judgment Creditor applies for an
order for Judgment Debtor to appear for examination. (Application, Items 1.a.,
4, 5.a.) The Application form used is Judicial Council Form AT-138/EJ-125, and
it includes the statutorily-required notice. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 708.110, subd. (e).) Judgment Creditor has a judgment against Judgment
Debtor, and Judgment Creditor has not applied to have Judgment Debtor appear
within the last 120 days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
The Court GRANTS Judgment Creditor’s
Application and Order for Appearance and Examination — Enforcement of Judgment
against Judgment Debtor.  
 
Judgment Creditor shall file proof
of service no less than 72 hours in advance of the next hearing.  ¿ 
 
C.    
Conclusion

 
Judgment Creditor’s
Application and Order for Appearance and Examination — Enforcement of Judgment
against Judgment Debtor is GRANTED.  
 
Judgment Creditor shall
file proof of service no less than 72 hours in advance of the next hearing.
