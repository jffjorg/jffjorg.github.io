And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's application for an order for appearance and examination of the judgment debtor is granted. The plaintiff's motion for modification of the amount of attorneys' fees is denied. The court finds that the defendant has a valid reason for the order, and the judgment creditor has not caused the judgment debtor to appear for examination within the last 120 days. The court also finds that the plaintiff's motion for modification of attorneys' fees is an improper motion for reconsideration and lacks new evidence or circumstances that would justify reconsidering the court's previous holding.
