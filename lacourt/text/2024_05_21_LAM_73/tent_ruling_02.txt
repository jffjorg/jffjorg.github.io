JACOB WOOHER (23STCV26561) Counsel for Plaintiff:  Kimi Kim (Pro Per)Counsel for Defendant: Kevin Hermansen (Law Office of Daniel J. Bramzon & Associates, P.C.) (1)   APPLICATION AND ORDER FOR APPEARANCE AND EXAMINATION – ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT AGAINST JUDGMENT DEBTOR (filed on 04/02/24)(2)   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR MODIFICATION OF THE AMOUNT OF ATTORNEYS FEES (filed on 04/29/24) TENTATIVE RULING Defendant’s Application for Order for Appearance and Examination – Enforcement of judgment Against Judgment Debtor is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s Motion for Modification of the Amount of Attorneys Fees is DENIED. BACKGROUND On October 31, 2023, Plaintiff Kimi Kim filed this lawsuit against Defendant Jacob Woocher alleging causes of action for:C/A 1: Fraud Intentional Misrepresentation C/A 2: Conversion Theft C/A 3: Legal Malpractice The Complaint alleges that Defendant lied, committed perjury and submitted falsified documents in his representation of an unlawful detainer action. The unlawful detainer action was filed by Plaintiff and Defendant provided legal representation to the defendants in that underlying action. On December 20, 2023, Defendant filed a Special Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Complaint pursuant to C.C.P Section 425.16 (Anti-Slapp). On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of the entire action without prejudice. On March 21, 2024, the Court granted the Motion for Attorneys Fees filed by Defendant. The Court stated in its Minute Order: “The court finds that Woocher would have prevailed on his anti-SLAPP motion as to the fraud cause of action. Woocher is therefore entitled to attorneys’ fees pursuant to section 415.16, subdivision (c).” (Court’s 03/21/24 Minute Order, p. 1.) On April 11, 2024, the Court entered Judgment for Defendant against Plaintiff in the total amount of $5,565.00.  On April 2, 2024, Defendant (now Judgment Creditor) filed an Application and Order for Appearance and Examination — Enforcement of Judgment against Plaintiff (now Judgment Debtor).  On April 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Modification of the Amount of Attorneys Fees. ANALYSIS A.     Defendant’s Application and Order for Appearance and Examination a.     Legal Standard “The judgment creditor may apply to the proper court for an order requiring the judgment debtor to appear before the court, or before a referee appointed by the court, at a time and place specified in the order, to furnish information to aid in enforcement of the money judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (a).)  “If the judgment creditor has not caused the judgment debtor to be examined under this section during the preceding 120 days, the court shall make the order upon ex parte application of the judgment creditor.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (b).)  “If the judgment creditor has caused the judgment debtor to be examined under this section during the preceding 120 days, the court shall make the order if the judgment creditor by affidavit or otherwise shows good cause for the order. The application shall be made on noticed motion if the court so directs or a court rule so requires. Otherwise, it may be made ex parte.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (c).)  “The judgment creditor shall personally serve a copy of the order on the judgment debtor not less than 10 days before the date set for the examination. Service shall be made in the manner specified in Section 415.10. Service of the order creates a lien on the personal property of the judgment debtor for a period of one year from the date of the order unless extended or sooner terminated by the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (d).)  “The order shall contain the following statement in 14-point boldface type if printed or in capital letters if typed: ‘NOTICE TO JUDGMENT DEBTOR. If you fail to appear at the time and place specified in this order, you may be subject to arrest and punishment for contempt of court and the court may make an order requiring you to pay the reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the judgment creditor in this proceeding.’” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (e).) b.     Discussion Judgment Creditor applies for an order for Judgment Debtor to appear for examination. (Application, Items 1.a., 4, 5.a.) The Application form used is Judicial Council Form AT-138/EJ-125, and it includes the statutorily-required notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subd. (e).) Judgment Creditor has a judgment against Judgment Debtor, and Judgment Creditor has not applied to have Judgment Debtor appear within the last 120 days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.110, subds. (a), (b).)  The Court GRANTS Judgment Creditor’s Application and Order for Appearance and Examination — Enforcement of Judgment against Judgment Debtor.   Judgment Creditor shall file proof of service no less than 72 hours in advance of the next hearing.  ¿  B.     Plaintiff’s Motion for Modification of Attorneys Fees Plaintiff seeks an order modifying the amount of attorneys fees granted to Defendant on March 21, 2024. However, the Court finds the instant motion to modify attorneys fees is an improper motion for reconsideration.  (CCP § 1008.)    The moving party must present new facts, circumstances, or law to meet its burden on a motion for reconsideration.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a); see also Mink v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.)  The party seeking reconsideration of an order shall state by affidavit what application was made before, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts or circumstances are claimed to be shown.  (Code Civ. Proc, § 1008.)  Further, “…the party seeking reconsideration must provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.”  (Glade v. Glade (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1457.)  The legislative intent was to restrict motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a party offers the court some fact or circumstance not previously considered and some valid reason for not offering it earlier.  (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)  A disagreement with a ruling is not a new fact that will support the granting of a motion for reconsideration.  (Id.)  Here, the Court has already heard Defendant’s motion for attorneys fees. Plaintiff filed an opposition on March 19, 2024. After the motion was heard and argued, the Court granted Defendant’s motion on March 21, 2024. In the instant motion, Plaintiff does not present any new laws, facts, or circumstances that would justify reconsidering the Court's previous holding.  Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to modify attorneys fees is DENIED. III. CONCLUSION Judgment Creditor’s Application and Order for Appearance and Examination — Enforcement of Judgment against Judgment Debtor is GRANTED.  Judgment Creditor shall file proof of service no less than 72 hours in advance of the next hearing. The Motion for Modification of the Amount of Attorneys Fees is DENIED.
