Summary in English text:

The Judge has denied Nike USA, Inc.'s motion for a protective order to prevent a second session of deposition for Gil Blank, Director of Brand Imaging. Blank's deposition took place on August 11, 2023, and Nike USA, Inc. contends that the deposition time was wasted by asking Blank questions about irrelevant matters. However, the Judge finds that Nike USA, Inc. has not shown good cause for the protective order. The Judge notes that the first session of deposition was shorter than the seven-hour limit, and although some time was wasted, it was partly caused by Blank's decision to review the entire document. The Judge also takes into account that Defendants' counsel had a legitimate reason for suspending the deposition due to a health issue. As a result, the Judge denies Nike USA, Inc.'s motion for a protective order, allowing Defendants to take the remaining 53 minutes of Blank's deposition.

## English Summary

The Judge denied Nike USA, Inc.'s motion for a protective order that would have prevented a second deposition session for Gil Blank, Nike's Director of Brand Imaging. 

Nike argued that Defendants wasted time during the first deposition session by asking Blank questions about the lease and construction, matters outside his personal knowledge. However, the Judge found that the deposition was shorter than the allowed seven hours and that the delay in examining documents was partly due to Blank's own decision to review the entire document before answering questions. The Judge also considered Defendants' explanation for the early termination of the first session, citing a health issue. 

Ultimately, the Judge determined that Nike had not shown "good cause" for the protective order and allowed Defendants to complete the remaining 53 minutes of Blank's deposition.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Nike USA, Inc.'s motion for a protective order, which sought to prevent a second session of deposition for Gil Blank, Nike's Director of Brand Imaging. The Judge found that Nike had not shown good cause for the protective order, as the first session of deposition was shorter than the 7-hour limit by 53 minutes. The Judge also noted that while some time may have been wasted during the deposition, it was not entirely the fault of the Defendants, and that the Defendants may still seek to take the remaining 53 minutes of Blank's deposition. The Judge cited Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.420 and 2025.290 in support of the decision. The ruling allows the Defendants to proceed with taking the remaining portion of Blank's deposition, which may provide further insight into the alleged breaches and their impact on Nike's branding operations.
