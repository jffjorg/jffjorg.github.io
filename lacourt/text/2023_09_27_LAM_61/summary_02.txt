Summary in English text:

The Judge has denied Nike USA, Inc.'s motion for a protective order to prevent a second session of deposition for Gil Blank, Director of Brand Imaging. Blank's deposition took place on August 11, 2023, and Nike USA, Inc. contends that the deposition time was wasted by asking Blank questions about irrelevant matters. However, the Judge finds that Nike USA, Inc. has not shown good cause for the protective order. The Judge notes that the first session of deposition was shorter than the seven-hour limit, and although some time was wasted, it was partly caused by Blank's decision to review the entire document. The Judge also takes into account that Defendants' counsel had a legitimate reason for suspending the deposition due to a health issue. As a result, the Judge denies Nike USA, Inc.'s motion for a protective order, allowing Defendants to take the remaining 53 minutes of Blank's deposition.
