And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying defendant Rena Aminpour's demurrer to the complaint. The demurrer was based on the argument that the complaint does not state a cause of action against Aminpour, as all the alleged breaches and promises were committed by defendant Felix Pena. However, the judge found that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of action against Aminpour for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Aminpour advised Pena not to pay plaintiff what he promised, and that Pena followed this advice. This constitutes aiding and abetting the commission of an intentional tort, which is sufficient to impose civil liability on Aminpour. As a result, the judge overrules the demurrer and orders Aminpour to answer the complaint within 30 days.
