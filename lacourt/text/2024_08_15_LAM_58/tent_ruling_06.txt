Background
 
This action arises from alleged
wrongful actions in the management of two apartment complexes. On May 6, 2024,
Plaintiffs 4100 Del Rey, LLC; PJ Fig, LLC; WP Fig, LLC; and Neumann Fig, LLC
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Reliant Real
Estate Management, Inc. (“Reliant”); Sara Dixon D’Elia (“D’Elia”); Frank
Dietrich Thorp (“Thorp”); Jeanette Christine Ruscitti (“Ruscitti”); Leanna
Wendy Tevis (“Tevis”); and Yong Held (“Held”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
alleging causes of action for: (1) fraud; (2) breach of contract; (3) breach of
fiduciary duty; and (4) declaratory relief. 
 
On July 15, 2024, Defendants filed a
demurrer to the first and third causes of action in the complaint. On July 17,
2024, Defendants filed a motion to strike punitive damages allegations from the
complaint. 
 
On August 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
opposition briefs to the demurrer and motion to strike, to which Defendants replied
on August 8, 2024.
 
The Court finds that the meet and
confer requirement has been met as to both the demurrer and motion to strike.
(CCP §§ 430.41, 435.5.) 
 
Legal Standard for Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the
complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.¿Code Civ.
Proc. § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.)¿The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a
pleading “by raising questions of law.”¿(Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 280, 286.)¿“In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of
determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 452.)¿The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . . .”
’ ”¿ (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)¿In applying
these standards, the court liberally construes the complaint to determine
whether a cause of action has been stated.¿(Picton v. Anderson Union High
School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.) 
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The
burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended
successfully.  (Ibid.) “If there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.) 
 
Pertinent Allegations of the Complaint 
 
            Plaintiffs
allege that they are owners of rental properties in Los Angeles County.
(Complaint, ¶ 14.) Tribeca Urban Apartments (“Tribeca”) is located at 4108 Del
Rey Avenue in Marina Del Rey, California, and is owned by Plaintiff 4100 Del
Rey, LLC. (Complaint, ¶ 15.) City Lights on Fig (“City Lights”) is located in
Los Angles, California and is owned by Plaintiffs PJ Fig, LLC, WP Fig, LLC, and
Neumann Fig, LLC. (Complaint, ¶ 16.) In June of 2021, Plaintiffs entered into
separate contracts with Defendant Reliant for Defendant Reliant to serve as
manager of Tribeca and City Lights (collectively, the “Contracts”). (Complaint,
¶ 17; Exs. 1-2.) 
 
            Under the
Contracts, Defendant Reliant agreed to perform all of the necessary property
management functions related to Tribeca and City Lights. (Complaint, ¶ 18.)
This included, without limitation, functions such as hiring, supervising,
training all business managers, leasing agents, maintenance, and other
administrative employees, and finding and vetting new applicants for tenancies
at the properties. (Complaint, ¶ 18.) While serving as manager of the
properties, Defendants acted as an agent and fiduciary for Plaintiffs.
(Complaint, ¶ 19.) In or about November of 2023, the Contracts between
Plaintiffs and Defendant Reliant were terminated. (Complaint, ¶ 20.) 
 
During the time that Defendant
Reliant acted as Plaintiffs’ agent, all Defendants and Plaintiffs had a clear
understanding of the minimum qualifications required for any new applicant to
be accepted as a tenant at Tribeca and/or City Lights including, but not
limited to, those stated in Defendant Reliant’s written Policies and Procedures
dated December 1, 2020 (the “Policies”). (Complaint, ¶ 21.) Plaintiff aver that
Defendants knowingly and intentionally accepted unqualified applicants as
tenants for the properties and failed to follow various state and federal law
requirements related to applicant screening. (Complaint, ¶ 22.) Plaintiffs
allege that such tenants defaulted on their rental obligations in multiple
cases. (Complaint, ¶ 22.) Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants would
knowingly and intentionally allow employees of Defendant Reliant who failed to
meet applicant criteria to occupy rental units in the properties. (Complaint, ¶
23.) 
 
First Cause of Action—Fraud  
 
“The elements of fraud are (a) a
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c) intent to induce reliance; (d)
justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town
Ctr. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) The facts constituting the alleged
fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to every element of fraud,
as the policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will not ordinarily be
invoked. (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.) To
properly allege fraud against a corporation, the plaintiffs must plead the
names of the persons allegedly making the false representations, their
authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it
was said or written. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2
Cal.App.4th 153, 157.) 
 
The Court finds that the first cause
of action for fraud is insufficiently alleged. (Complaint, ¶¶ 25-30.)
Plaintiffs merely allege that Defendants made misrepresentations of fact including,
but not limited to, that: (1) the Policies would be followed specifically with
regard to applicant screening, communication, maintenance, rekeying locks,
verification of renter’s insurance, and safety; and (2) Defendants were capable
and prepared to use Plaintiffs preferred property management software known as
“RealPage.” (Complaint, ¶ 26.) Plaintiffs allege that they relied on the
purported misrepresentations and that Defendants intended to induce reliance.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 27, 29.)
 
The Court, however, finds that the
first cause of action is much too conclusory. Plaintiffs only set forth the
purported misrepresentations in a conclusory manner as Plaintiffs have failed
to plead the names of the persons allegedly making the false representations on
behalf of Defendant Reliant and the facts surrounding such misrepresentations.
(Complaint, ¶ 6.) Additionally, Plaintiffs have failed to allege justifiable
reliance or that Defendants knew that the alleged misrepresentations were
false. (Complaint, ¶¶ 25-30.) Plaintiffs must assert their fraud cause of
action with the required specificity. 
 
Thus, the first cause of action for
fraud in the complaint does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of
action. 
 
Third Cause of Action—Breach of Fiduciary Duty  
 
“The elements of a cause of action
for breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of a fiduciary relationship,
breach of fiduciary duty, and damages.” (Oasis
West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 820.) “Whether a
fiduciary duty exists is generally a question of law.” (Green Valley
Landowners Assn. v. City of Vallejo (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 425, 441
[citation omitted].) “Any agent is also a fiduciary, whose obligation of
diligent and faithful service is the same as that of a trustee.” (Duffy v. Cavalier
(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1517, 1534.) “California law is that parties to a
contract, by that fact alone, have no fiduciary duties toward one another.” (Rickel
v. Schwinn Bicycle Co. (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 648, 654.) 
 
Initially, the Court finds that
Plaintiffs’ reliance on Duffy, supra, 215 Cal.App.3d 1517 is
inapposite as such case concerned the fiduciary duties of stockbrokers. Here,
however, Plaintiffs are alleging that a residential property management company
and its employees have a fiduciary duty. Thus, Duffy, supra, 215
Cal.App.3d 1517 is factually distinguishable from the instant action. 
 
Here, the Court finds that the third
cause of action is insufficiently alleged. (Complaint, ¶¶ 39-46.) Plaintiffs
make a conclusory allegation that Defendants were the agents of Plaintiffs;
however, the Court does not accept conclusions of fact or law on demurrer. The
third cause of action is premised on Defendants repeatedly approving applicants
who did not meet Plaintiffs’ qualifications or the standards in the Policies.
(Complaint, ¶ 41.) Plaintiffs have asserted a cause of action for breach of
contract, which Defendants do not challenge on demurrer. (Complaint, ¶¶ 31-38.)
The second cause of action for breach of contract is premised on Defendants
failing to follow the Policies and breaching the Contracts. (Complaint, ¶¶
31-38.) 
 
Although not raised as an argument by
Defendants, the Court finds that the third cause of action for breach of
fiduciary duty—which incorporates the preceding allegations of the complaint therein—appears
to be a slightly recast cause of action for breach of contract. (Palm
Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th
268, 290.) The third cause of action does not add anything to the complaint “by
way of fact or theory of recovery.” (Rodrigues v. Campbell Industries (1978)
87 Cal.App.3d 494, 501.) 
 
Therefore, the Court finds that the
third cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is insufficiently alleged. 
 
Legal Standard for Motions to
Strike 
 
            “The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section
435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a)
Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
(b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”¿(Code
Civ. Proc. § 436.) “Immaterial” or “irrelevant” matters include allegations not
essential to the claim, allegations neither pertinent to nor supported by an
otherwise sufficient claim or a demand for judgment requesting relief not
supported by the allegations of the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc. § 431.10,
subds. (b)(1)-(3).) 
 
            “In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation of
punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief must
be pled by a plaintiff.” (Clauson v. Superior Court (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.) Civ. Code § 3294 authorizes punitive damages upon a
showing of malice, fraud, or oppression. Malice is defined as either “conduct
which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff,” or
“despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code, § 3294,
subd. (c)(1).) “Despicable conduct is conduct which is so vile, base,
contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down
upon and despised by ordinary decent people.” (Mock v. Michigan Millers
Mutual Ins. Co. (1992) 4 Cal. App. 4th 306, 331.)  Fraud under Civ.
Code § 3294(c)(3) “means an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or
concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the
part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights
or otherwise causing injury.” Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2) defines oppression as
“despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”  Specific facts must be
alleged in support of punitive damages. (Hillard v. A.H. Robins Co.
(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 374, 391-392.) Facts must be pled to show that a
defendant “act[ed] with the intent to vex, injure or annoy, or with a conscious
disregard of the plaintiff’s rights.” (Silberg v. California Life Ins. Co.
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 452, 462.) Conduct that is merely negligent will not
support a claim for punitive damages. (Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins.
Co. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1288.)
 
Plaintiffs’ Punitive Damages
Allegations are Insufficient 
 
            Defendants move to strike Plaintiffs’ request for
exemplary damages. The Court references its recital of the allegations of the
complaint from above and incorporates such recitation herein. The Court finds
that the complaint does not set forth sufficient facts to show entitlement to
punitive damages. Plaintiffs have not alleged specific facts showing fraud,
oppression, or malice. 
 
            The Court therefore grants Defendants’ motion to strike. 
 
Conclusion
 
The demurrer to the first and third causes of action in the complaint
is sustained with leave to amend. The motion to strike is granted with leave to
amend. The amended complaint shall be filed and served on or before September
5, 2024.
