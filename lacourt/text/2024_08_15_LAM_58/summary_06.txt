And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants in a lawsuit brought by the plaintiffs, 4100 Del Rey, LLC, PJ Fig, LLC, WP Fig, LLC, and Neumann Fig, LLC, against Reliant Real Estate Management, Inc., Sandra Dixon D'Elia, Frank Dietrich Thorp, Jeanette Christine Ruscitti, Leanna Wendy Tevis, and Yong Held.

The Court finds that the first cause of action for fraud is insufficiently alleged and sustains the demurrer with leave to amend. The Court also finds that the third cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is insufficiently alleged and sustains the demurrer with leave to amend.

The Court grants the motion to strike the plaintiffs' request for punitive damages, finding that the complaint does not set forth sufficient facts to show entitlement to such relief. The Court orders the amended complaint to be filed and served on or before September 5, 2024.

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants, who managed the plaintiffs' rental properties, knowingly and intentionally accepted unqualified applicants as tenants and failed to follow state and federal law requirements. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants allowed employees to occupy rental units in the properties.

The Court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, the California Civil Code, and various court cases, including Blank v. Kirwan, Postley v. Harvey, and Berkley v. Dowds.
