Background
            On December
14, 2021, Woodrow Wong and GWC Real Estate Services, LLC (Plaintiffs) filed a
Complaint containing thirteen causes of action against several defendants. The
motion now before the Court is the motion of Plaintiffs’ counsel to be relieved
(the Motion).  
 
Discussion
 
Legal Standard
An application to
be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of
Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration)
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates
scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).)
 
            Further,
the requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have
appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may
delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service
of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994),
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)
 
Analysis
            Plaintiffs’
counsel has filed the requisite MC-051 and MC-052 forms. Additionally, counsel
filed the Motion on July 16, 2024, and included the next hearing date at that
time which was an OSC on July 25, 2024. Trial is currently not yet set. Notice
requirements have been satisfied and counsel indicates Plaintiffs have failed
to respond to or communicate with counsel as the cause for the Motion.  
 
Conclusion
            As all
requirements for the Motion have been met, Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.
