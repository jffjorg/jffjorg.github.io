BACKGROUND: 
 
Quality Loan Service Corp. is the Trustee under a Deed of
Trust executed by Mary C. Sakowski recorded on September 19, 2014. Said Deed of
Trust was secured by real property commonly known as 16450 Tribune St., Granada
Hills, CA 91344, which was sold at a non-judicial foreclosure sale on January
12, 2023 as result of a default under the terms of the Deed of Trust. The sale
yielded funds that exceeded the amount due and owing under the Deed of Trust
foreclosed upon. Petitioner (Trustee) filed a petition to deposit surplus funds
with the Court and a motion to deposit the funds, pursuant to California Civil
Code Section 2924j(c) and be discharged. 
 
On September 7, 2023, the Court entered Petitioner’s Order
to Deposit Surplus Funds and ordered Petitioner to deposit surplus funds by
September 18, 2023. On September 12, 2023, the Court issued a Notice of Entry
of Order to Deposit Surplus Funds in which it discharged Petitioner and stated
that Petitioner is not required to make any further appearances. On September
26, 2023, the Clerk filed the Notice of Hearing on Claims to Determine
Disbursement of Surplus Funds. However, no claims have been filed with the
Court. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
If the trustee fails to determine priority or there is a
dispute, the trustee must deposit the funds with the court pursuant to Civil
Code § 2924j(c). The Court “shall consider all claims filed at least 15 days
before the date on which the hearing is scheduled with the court.” (Civ. Code,
§ 2924j(d).) The Court determines priority according to Civil Code § 2924k(a):
(1) the costs and expenses incurred in the selling of the property, (2) payment
of any obligations secured by the deed or mortgage, (3) to satisfy any
outstanding obligations encumbering the property, and (4) to the vested owner
at the record time of the trustee’s sale. (Civ. Code, § 2924k(a)(1–4).)
 
Here, no claims were filed with the Court in advance of this
hearing. Pursuant to the September 12, 2023 Notice of Entry of Order, the funds
would be escheated to the State of California as unclaimed property.
 
However, on October 2, 2023, the Court received three
separate notices of returned mail regarding the Notice of Hearing, from: 
 
1. County of Los Angeles
2. The Heirs or Devisees of Mary C.
Sakowski, Deceased
3. The Estate of Mary C. Sakowski,
Deceased
All notices stated that the notices were not deliverable as
addressed. 
 
Therefore, this hearing is continued for the Clerk to mail
the notice of hearing to the proper address.
