And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to place the hearing off-calendar due to the lack of any claims filed regarding the undistributed funds. The court had previously approved the petition to deposit surplus funds and ordered the trustee (Quality Loan Service Corp.) to deposit the funds. However, no claims were filed with the court, and therefore, the court will not proceed with the hearing. The court will determine priority according to California Civil Code Section 2924k(a) when claims are actually filed.
