And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by Judge C Pena grants the plaintiff's motion to quash the defendants' subpoenas. The plaintiff, Miguel Pena, brought a complaint against the defendants, La Noria Entertainment, Inc and Total Production Group, Inc, and the City of Pico Rivera alleging battery, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent hiring. The defendants issued three subpoenas to the plaintiff's primary care physician, Dr. Stephanie Lopez, seeking private medical records from 2009 to the present. The plaintiff objected to the subpoenas, arguing that they are overbroad and seek private medical records beyond the limited waiver of his constitutional privacy rights.

The judge agrees with the plaintiff that the subpoenas are overbroad and quashes them, ordering the defendants to reissue the subpoenas with a limitation to the injuries identified in the plaintiff's response to Form Interrogatory 6.3 within the past five years. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendants, finding that the request is procedurally defective.
