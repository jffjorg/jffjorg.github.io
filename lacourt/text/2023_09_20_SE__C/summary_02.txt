The tentative ruling by Judge C Pena grants the plaintiff's motion to quash the defendants' subpoenas. The plaintiff, Miguel Pena, brought a complaint against the defendants, La Noria Entertainment, Inc and Total Production Group, Inc, and the City of Pico Rivera alleging battery, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent hiring. The defendants issued three subpoenas to the plaintiff's primary care physician, Dr. Stephanie Lopez, seeking private medical records from 2009 to the present. The plaintiff objected to the subpoenas, arguing that they are overbroad and seek private medical records beyond the limited waiver of his constitutional privacy rights.

The judge agrees with the plaintiff that the subpoenas are overbroad and quashes them, ordering the defendants to reissue the subpoenas with a limitation to the injuries identified in the plaintiff's response to Form Interrogatory 6.3 within the past five years. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendants, finding that the request is procedurally defective.

## English Summary:

The judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoenas issued by the Defendants to his doctor. The judge found the subpoenas too broad because they sought medical records for a period of ten years and for a wide range of complaints, not all of which are directly relevant to the Plaintiff's claims. 

The judge has limited the scope of the subpoenas, allowing the Defendants to request records only for complaints and conditions related to the incident in question, and only for the past five years. The judge denied the Plaintiff's request for sanctions against the Defendants.
