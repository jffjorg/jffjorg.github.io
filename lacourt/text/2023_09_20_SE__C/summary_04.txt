## English Summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a breach of contract lawsuit filed by Creditors Adjustment Bureau ("Plaintiff") against OM Roofing, Inc. ("Defendant").  

The Plaintiff is seeking to enforce a default judgment against Defendant, who failed to respond to the initial Complaint. Defendant has now filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, claiming excusable neglect due to its sole officer and shareholder, Becky Brown, being out of state caring for her ailing mother.

While the judge recognizes the strong public policy in favor of granting Defendant's motion based on the demonstrated excusable neglect, the motion is incomplete. Defendant failed to file a proposed answer or other pleading with the motion, which is required under CCP § 473(b). 

Therefore, the hearing on Defendant's motion is continued to September 27, 2023, to give Defendant an opportunity to file the required pleading.

English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling for the case 22NWCV01607, with a hearing date of September 20, 2023, in Dept. C. The case is a breach of contract lawsuit between the Plaintiff, Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc., and the Defendant, OM Roofing, Inc., regarding unpaid premiums on Defendant's workers' compensation insurance contract with the State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF). SCIF assigned its right to collect the unpaid premiums to Plaintiff.

The Judge has considered Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment, filed within six months after the Entry of Default Judgment on March 14, 2023. The Judge recognizes a strong public policy in favor of granting Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default, as Defendant's sole officer and shareholder, Becky Brown, has demonstrated excusable neglect under CCP § 473(b) by being away due to her mother's stroke. However, the Motion does not meet the requirements of CCP § 473(b) as a proposed answer or other pleading is not filed with the Motion. Therefore, the Judge continues the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment to September 27, 2023, at 10:30 a.m. in Dept.

## English Summary

The judge is inclined to give OM Roofing, Inc. another chance to defend itself in a breach of contract lawsuit. 

The company missed a deadline and a default judgment was entered against them.  

However, the owner, Becky Brown, explained that she was away caring for her sick mother during the time of the lawsuit and therefore overlooked the legal documents. 

The judge believes this excuse is valid and wants to allow OM Roofing to present a defense. 

The judge has delayed the decision until September 27th, giving OM Roofing time to file a formal response to the lawsuit.
