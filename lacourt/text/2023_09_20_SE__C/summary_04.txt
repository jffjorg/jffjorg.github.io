And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to continue the Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment to September 27, 2023, to allow the Defendant to file an answer or other responsive pleading. The Motion was filed by OM Roofing, Inc. (Defendant) to seek relief from the Default Judgment entered on March 14, 2023, in a breach of contract lawsuit against the State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF). The Defendant's sole officer and shareholder, Becky Brown, demonstrated excusable neglect due to her mother's severe stroke and her own efforts to care for her mother while away from the office. The Judge found that the Defendant's mistake was excusable within the meaning of CCP § 473(b), but the Motion does not meet the requirements of CCP § 473(b) because a proposed answer or other pleading was not filed with the Motion.
