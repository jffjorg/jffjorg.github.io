## English Summary:

This tentative ruling concerns a breach of contract lawsuit filed by Creditors Adjustment Bureau ("Plaintiff") against OM Roofing, Inc. ("Defendant").  

The Plaintiff is seeking to enforce a default judgment against Defendant, who failed to respond to the initial Complaint. Defendant has now filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, claiming excusable neglect due to its sole officer and shareholder, Becky Brown, being out of state caring for her ailing mother.

While the judge recognizes the strong public policy in favor of granting Defendant's motion based on the demonstrated excusable neglect, the motion is incomplete. Defendant failed to file a proposed answer or other pleading with the motion, which is required under CCP § 473(b). 

Therefore, the hearing on Defendant's motion is continued to September 27, 2023, to give Defendant an opportunity to file the required pleading.
