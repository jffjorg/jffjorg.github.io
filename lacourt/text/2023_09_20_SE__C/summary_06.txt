However, the Judge found that simply selling the product is enough to establish a potential product liability claim against Macy's.

And here is the summary in English text:

This is the tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Macy's Inc. to Plaintiff Blanca Suarez's Second through Fifth Causes of Action. The Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that she sustained injuries when the packaging containing a Vortex Air Fryer broke, causing the box to fall on her while she was carrying it. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant failed to properly manufacture and design the product, and that the Defendant failed to warn her of the potential danger.

The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff's complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because it does not include allegations that the Defendant manufactured or designed the product. However, the court held that the Plaintiff's allegations that the Defendant sold her the product are sufficient to support a product liability cause of action.

Accordingly, the court overruled the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's Second through Fifth Causes of Action. The court held that the Plaintiff's complaint does state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that the Defendant is liable for the Plaintiff's injuries.

## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Suarez v. Macy's. The judge is overruling Defendant Macy's demurrer to Plaintiff Blanca Suarez's second through fifth causes of action.  

Macy's argued that Plaintiff's complaint did not allege that Macy's manufactured or designed the defective air fryer. The judge disagreed, citing case law that holds retailers strictly liable for injuries caused by defective products they sell.  Because Plaintiff alleges she purchased the air fryer from Macy's, the judge finds that the complaint adequately states a product liability claim against Macy's.
