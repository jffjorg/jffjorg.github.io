And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's second through fifth causes of action is overruled. The plaintiff, Blanca Suarez, brought a complaint alleging that she was injured when the packaging containing a Vortex Air Fryer broke and the box fell on her while she was carrying it. The defendant, Macy's Inc., demurred to these causes of action, arguing that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's allegations that the defendant sold her the product were sufficient to support a products liability cause of action. Therefore, the defendant's demurrer was overruled, and the plaintiff's claims for general negligence, products liability, and failure to warn will proceed.
