Defendant to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant OM Roofing, Inc. (Defendant) moves
for relief from default judgment pursuant to CCP § 473(b).
Background
This
is a breach of contract lawsuit between Defendant and the State Compensation
Insurance Fund (“SCIF”) regarding unpaid premiums on Defendant’s workers’
compensation insurance contract with SCIF. SCIF assigned its right to collect
the unpaid premiums to Plaintiff Creditors Adjustment Bureau, Inc. (“Plaintiff”).

Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on December 14, 2022. Entry of Default Judgment was entered
on March 14, 2023.
Legal
Standard
Discretionary
and mandatory relief is available to parties from “judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding taken against him or her.” (CCP § 473(b).) Discretionary
relief is available under the statute as “the court may, upon any terms as may
be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (CCP § 473(b).)
Alternatively, mandatory relief is available when “accompanied by an attorney’s
sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) Under this statute, an application for discretionary
or mandatory relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is
sought.  (CCP § 473(b); English v.
IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) 
“‘[W]hen
relief under section 473¿is¿available, there is a strong public policy in favor
of granting relief and allowing the requesting party his or her day in court …
[Citation.]” (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 981-82.)
Discussion

Here, Plaintiff’s Request for Entry of Default was
entered on March 14, 2023. Defendant filed its Motion to Set Aside Default on
May 26, 2023, within the six months allowed by CCP § 473. Thus, there is a
strong public policy in favor of granting Defendant’s Motion to Set Aside
Default.
Defendant’s sole officer and shareholder, Becky
Brown, has demonstrated excusable neglect under CCP § 473(b). Ms. Brown states
that she left for an extended stay in Vallejo, California after her mother
suffered from a severe stroke on January 22, 2023. (Brown Decl., ¶ 5.) An
office manager was served and made Ms. Brown aware of a legal document during
the week of January 23, 2023. (Brown Decl., ¶ 8.) On February 9, 2023, Ms.
Brown was advised by counsel on another matter that the legal document was the
Complaint and she needed to retain an attorney to represent Defendant. (Brown
Decl., ¶ 16.) Ms. Brown states that she neglected to investigate the document
or retain an attorney to represent Defendant earlier because she was attempting
to run the business while away and care for her mother’s extensive needs after
her stroke. (Brown Decl., ¶¶ 9-14.) Thus, Defendant’s mistake was excusable
within the meaning of CCP § 473(b) and the strong public policy in favor of
determination on the merits weighs in favor of setting aside the default. 
However, a proposed answer or other pleading is
not filed with the Motion or at any time prior to the hearing. “Application for
this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted
….” (CCP § 473(b).) "The objectives of the “accompanied by” requirement,
i.e., a screening determination that the relief is not sought simply to delay
the proceedings, is satisfied by the filing of a proposed answer at any time
before the hearing.” (County of Stanislaus v. Johnson (1996) 43
Cal.App.4th 832, 838.) Thus, the Motion does not meet the requirements of CCP §
473(b).  
 
Defendant’s
Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment is CONTINUED to September 27, 2023 at
10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C to give Defendant an opportunity to file an Answer or
other responsive pleading to accompany the Motion to Set Aside Default
Judgment.
