Third-party Vivera Bio’s Motion for
Protective Order is DENIED
Plaintiff to give NOTICE.
 
Third-party Vivera Bio, Inc. (Vivera Bio) moves
for a protective order. 
Background
The
Court entered judgment in favor of Blaine Holding and against Vivera Pharmaceuticals
on September 15, 2021 in the amount of $406,657.19 plus $623.58 per day between
June 3, 2021 and the return of possession of the commercial property. Thereafter,
Plaintiff issued a deposition subpoena for bank records from Third-party Vivera
Bio.  Plaintiff contends that Vivera
Pharmaceuticals and Vivera Bio are “a single entity with overlapping management
and commingled finances.”  (Opposition,
p. 2.)  Vivera Bio argues that the
deposition subpoena should be quashed because Plaintiff failed to seek a court
ordered debtor examination of Vivera Bio under CCP § 708.120.  
Legal
Standard
A
witness may be required to appear and testify before the court [in proceedings
enforcing money judgments] in the same manner as upon the trial of an
issue.  (CCP § 708.130.)  
“[A]
subpoena duces tecum issued to a third party and “tethered” to a judgment
debtors examination under section 708.110 permits a wide scope of inquiry
regarding the property and business affairs of the judgment debtor.” (Shrewsbury
Management, Inc. v. Superior Court (2019) 32 Cal.App.5th 1213, 1228.)
Discussion
Here, Plaintiff issued a deposition subpoena
upon third-party Vivera Bio in connection with, or “tethered” to, its debtor
examination of Vivera Pharmaceuticals under section 708.110.  As long as a subpoena is “tethered” to an
examination of the judgment debtor, there is no requirement that a judgment
creditor first seek a court ordered debtor examination of a third-party before
issuing a subpoena duces tecum upon the third-party. (Shrewsbury at
1225.)  The bank records sought by
Plaintiff are within the scope of discovery authorized by section 708.130 because
they are relevant to Plaintiff’s claim that Vivera Pharmaceuticals and Vivera
Bio are “a single entity with overlapping management and commingled finances.” 
Sanctions
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction .
. . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes
a motion for a protective order, unless it finds that the one subject to
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of sanction unjust.” CCP § 2031.060(h).)
Plaintiff seeks sanctions for Vivera Bio’s lack
of substantial justification for filing this Motion based on its failure to
cite any legal authority for the majority of its arguments. However, Plaintiff
has not included any evidence in Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration to support a
finding for an award of attorney’s fees. Thus, Plaintiff’s request for
attorney’s fees is DENIED.
 
Accordingly, Third-party
Vivera Bio’s Motion for Protective Order is DENIED.
