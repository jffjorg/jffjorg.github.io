**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Vivera Bio's motion for a protective order.  

Vivera Bio argued that a subpoena from Blaine Holding seeking bank records was invalid because Blaine Holding hadn't first sought a court-ordered debtor examination of Vivera Bio. The judge disagreed, stating that as long as the subpoena is "tethered" to a debtor examination, a separate examination of a third party isn't required.

The judge found that Blaine Holding's request for bank records was relevant to their claim that Vivera Pharmaceuticals and Vivera Bio are a single entity. 

The judge also denied Blaine Holding's request for sanctions against Vivera Bio, as they didn't provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that Vivera Bio acted without substantial justification.

The Judge also denied Plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, as Plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence to support the request.
