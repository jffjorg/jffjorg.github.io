And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Vivera Bio's Motion for Protective Order, which sought to block Blaine Holding's deposition subpoena for bank records. The judge ruled that the subpoena is valid because it is "tethered" to a debtor examination of Vivera Pharmaceuticals under CCP § 708.110, and that the bank records are within the scope of discovery authorized by CCP § 708.130. The judge also denied Blaine Holding's request for attorney's fees, as the plaintiff failed to provide evidence to support such an award.
