And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel the deposition of expert witnesses in a personal injury lawsuit. The plaintiff, Leigh Grode, filed the lawsuit against the defendants, Eliza Lu and Timothy Lu, for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident. The defendants are seeking to compel the deposition of the plaintiff's expert witnesses, who include Andrew S. Morris, D.C., Jan Roughan, B.S.N., Jonathan Eskenazi, M.D., John J. Smith, P.E., and Fardad Mobin, M.D.

The defendants argue that the plaintiff is refusing to produce her expert witnesses for deposition, but the evidence provided does not support this contention. Instead, it appears that the defendants unilaterally noticed the experts' depositions, and neither the plaintiff's counsel nor the experts were available on the noticed dates. The defendants proceeded with the depositions and obtained certificates of non-appearance, but failed to tender the expert witness fees as required by law.

The court finds that the motion is denied without prejudice, and orders the moving party to give notice. The court encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement on the deposition schedule. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
