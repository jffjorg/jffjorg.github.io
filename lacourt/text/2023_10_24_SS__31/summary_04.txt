Here is the English-text summary:

Judge Michelle C. Kim has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Quiana Jones v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The case involves a personal injury claim by Jones against the transportation authority, alleging that an employee closed the bus doors on her without warning as she was boarding the bus. The transportation authority has moved to compel Jones' physical examination and has requested monetary sanctions. The judge has granted the motion to compel the physical examination, ordering Jones to appear for the examination on November 7, 2023. The judge has also awarded the transportation authority $1,035 in sanctions, which Jones must pay within twenty days. The judge notes that the parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading the tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement, and that failure to submit or appear at the hearing may result in the matter being taken off calendar or the tentative ruling being adopted as the final order of the court.
