Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the petition to approve the compromise of a pending action of a minor, Sofia Menezes, between the plaintiffs and the defendant, Sonny Mesbah. The reason for the denial is that the petition did not include a copy of the written attorney fee agreement as required. The judge is ordering the petitioner to submit a new petition with the missing attachment at their earliest convenience. The settlement agreement would have paid a total of $38,000, with $3,000 going to Sofia Menezes, and the remaining amount to be deposited into a blocked account.
