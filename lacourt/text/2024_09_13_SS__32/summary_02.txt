And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the admissibility of layperson's opinion testimony and the foundation for opinions in a declaration submitted by the Defendant. The Judge holds that layperson's opinion testimony is only admissible if it is rationally based on the witness's perception and helpful to understanding their testimony. In this case, the Judge declines to consider new evidence submitted in reply to establish the foundation for the opinions in the declaration, as it was not previously disclosed and the Plaintiff had requested a continuance to obtain maintenance records. As a result, the Judge does not reach the Plaintiff's alternative arguments regarding the Defendant's duty of care and the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.
