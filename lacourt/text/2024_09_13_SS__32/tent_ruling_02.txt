[1] A
layperson's opinion testimony is admissible only if it is “(a) Rationally based
on the perception of the witness; and (b) Helpful to a clear understanding of
his testimony.” (Evid. Code, § 800; Osborne v. Todd Farm Service (2016)
247 Cal.App.4th 43, 52.)


[2] This is
not supported by the evidence cited, which consists of Beepot’s declaration
that he “did not know of anything that [he] could have done differently
that would have prevented the accident of Plaintiff Francesca Montenotte’s
claimed injuries.” (Beepot Decl. ¶ 21 [emphasis added].)


[3]
Regarding the seat belts, Defendant relies on his own declaration and two
excerpts of Plaintiff’s deposition, which do not establish that the seat belts
were working properly at the time of the accident. (UMF 7.)


[4] Defendant
presents the deposition testimony of Defendant in reply. The Court declines to
consider new evidence submitted for the first time in reply to establish the
foundation for the opinions in Beepot’s declaration, when the declaration filed
with the motion could have attempted to lay the foundation for Beepot’s
opinions and where Plaintiff has requested a continuance to obtain maintenance
records not produced at the time of his deposition.


[5] In light
of the Court’s ruling, the Court does not reach Plaintiff’s alternative
arguments that Defendant owes a heightened duty of care as a common carrier or
that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies.
