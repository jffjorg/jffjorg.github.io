And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Roger Beepot's motion for summary judgment in a negligence case filed by Plaintiff Francesca Montenotte. The Plaintiff alleges that she was injured in a motor vehicle collision as a passenger in a Lyft ride operated by Defendant Beepot on June 26, 2018. The Defendant argues that there are no facts showing that he breached his duty or caused the Plaintiff's injury.

The Court has reviewed the evidence presented by both parties and has found that the Defendant has set forth sufficient evidence that he was at a complete stop at a red light and was rear-ended by another vehicle. However, the Court has also found that the Defendant's declaration regarding the seat belts and the lack of mechanical problems with the car lacks foundation and constitutes improper lay opinion testimony.

Based on this review, the Court has denied the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Court has also ordered the Defendant to provide notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.

The Court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure, California Rules of Court, and various court cases, including Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.
