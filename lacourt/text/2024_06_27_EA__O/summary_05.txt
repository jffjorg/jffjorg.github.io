And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the understanding that the complaint must be liberally construed, with the court drawing inferences favorable to the plaintiff. The failure of the defendant to address a lunch time incident renders many of their arguments inapplicable. The judge does not need to consider whether the statute complies with a three-prong test to determine if it imposes a mandatory duty, as the statute tacitly suggests it does. The ruling cites several cases, including Stevens v. Superior Court, Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist., and Pemberton v. Nationstar Mortgage LLC, to support its conclusions.
