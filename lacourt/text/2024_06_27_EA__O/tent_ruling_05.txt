[1] The complaint must
be liberally construed. (Stevens v. Superior Court (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th
594, 601.) Even if there is a difference in reasonable interpretation (i.e.,
calls happened on or off campus), court must draw “inferences favorable to the
plaintiff, not the defendant.” (See Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012)
209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.) 
 


[2] And the failure to
address this lunch time incident largely renders many of Defendant’s arguments
inapposite. 


[3] For this reason, as
the cited cases tacitly suggest the statute does provide a mandatory duty, the
court need not address whether the statute complies with the three-prong test
enumerated by the courts to determine whether a statute imposes a mandatory duty.
