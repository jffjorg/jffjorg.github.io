And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling states that the failure to attach the AAA rules to the agreement does not increase the procedural unconscionability of the application or its arbitration provision. The judge cites two cases, Nguyen v. Applied Medical Resources Corp. (2016) Cal.App.5th 232, 249 and Baltazar v. Forever 21, Inc. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1237, 1246, to support this conclusion. The judge notes that the plaintiff does not claim that anything was hidden in the AAA rules, but rather contests only matters related to the agreement itself. Therefore, the judge's ruling does not affect the substantive unconscionability of the agreement.
