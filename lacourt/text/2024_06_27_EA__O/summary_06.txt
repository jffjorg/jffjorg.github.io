And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a wrongful foreclosure case. The case is about alleged violations of the Homeowner Bill of Rights statutes by the defendants, Selene Finance, L.P. and U.S. Bank National Association. The plaintiff, Cesar Javier, alleges that the defendants failed to contact him to discuss his financial situation and/or explore other options aside from foreclosure before recording a notice of default. The defendants filed a demurrer, which argues that the complaint is contradictory and that any alleged violations are immaterial. The judge has sustained the demurrer in its entirety with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff can refile the complaint with additional information to support his claims. The motion to strike is also moot.
