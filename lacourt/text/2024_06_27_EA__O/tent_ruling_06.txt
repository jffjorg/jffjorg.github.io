Request
for Judicial Notice (RJN)[3]
 
Pursuant to Evidence Code §§ 451 and
452, the court takes judicial notice of Exhibits 1-8, all of which are
documents that are publicly recorded documents which are put at issue by
Plaintiff. (See RJN p. 3, citing Evans v. California Trailer Court, Inc.
(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 540, 549 [court may take judicial notice of recorded
deeds]; see also Poseidon Development, Inc. v. Woodland Lane Estates, LLC
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1106, 1116 [same]; Pomona College v. Superior Court (1996)
45 Cal. App. 4th 1716, 1727- 1728 [court may take judicial notice of documents
referred to in the Complaint even when not attached [“These documents, together
with [plaintiff’s] complaint, describe the nature of [defendant’s] mandatory tenure review and
grievance procedures.”].) 
 
Discussion
 
Defendants demur to the entirety of the complaint. The court will
address each COA ad seriatim. 
 
1.    
Civ. Code § 2923.5 (Failing to notify the homeowner about possible
foreclosure and to wait 30 days after notice to record a notice of default)
Pursuant to
Civil Code section 2923.5(a)(2), a mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee,
beneficiary, or authorized agent shall not record a notice of default pursuant
to Section 2924 until all of the following: Contact the borrower in person or
by telephone in order to assess the borrower's financial situation and explore
options for the borrower to avoid foreclosure, including advising the borrower
that he or she has the right to request a subsequent meeting and, if requested,
the mortgage servicer shall schedule the meeting to occur within 14 days. The
assessment of the borrower's financial situation and discussion of options may
occur during the first contact, or at the subsequent meeting scheduled for that
purpose.
 
The complaint
alleges the relevant fact:
 
On April 24, 2023, SF DEFENDANT and RCF DEFENDANT recorded a Notice of
Default on the Subject Property. PLAINTIFF was staying in his home when the
Notice of Default was issued and received no mail or messages. (¶25, citing to
Ex. E.)
 
Defendant argues that this allegation is directly
contradicted by the notice of default (NOD) and that whether Plaintiff received
notification from Defendants is not the inquiry. (Demurrer p. 3, citing to Lupertino
v. Carbahal (1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 742, 746-747; Knapp v. Doherty (2004)
123 Cal.App.4th 76, 89.)
 
Here, indeed a review of Exhibit E as attached to
Plaintiff’s complaint, which is dated March 21, 2023, indicates that the
“mortgage servicer has contacted the Borrower” but that more than 30 days has
passed since the initial contact was made. (Complaint, Ex. E, p. 48 of 82 of
PDF.) Notwithstanding,
though not argued by Plaintiff, the fact that the judicially noticed document
contradicts the allegation is not dispositive. According to the court in
Herrera v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366,
1375, the truthfulness of the documents remains subject to dispute [Judicial notice of the recorded documents did not
establish that the bank was the beneficiary or that reconveyance company was
the trustee under the 2003 deed of trust]; see also Lockley v. Law Office of
Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz, & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 882
[“Judicial notice is the recognition and acceptance by the court, for use by
the trier of fact or by the court, of the existence of a matter of law or fact that
is relevant to an issue in the action without requiring formal proof of the
matter.”].) 
 
To the extent
that Defendant relies upon Lupertino (Knapp cites to Lupertino),
it is not entirely instructive.[4]
The cases addressed Civil Code sections 2924-2924h, which applies to a
trustor’s notice of default or notice of sale. (Lupertino, supra, 35
Cal. App.3d at p. 742, 746-747 [“They simply
mandate certain procedural requirements reasonably calculated to inform
those who may be affected by a foreclosure sale and who have requested notice
in the statutory manner that a default has occurred and a foreclosure sale is
imminent.”].) Here, however, Civil Code 2923.5 contemplates a different
concern because Civil Code section 2923.5 is the initial contact that is
not by request but that is mandated to discuss options to avoid
foreclosure. Thus, the plain language of the statute provides for communication
such that receipt is arguably necessary. 
 
That said,
Defendants argument that any violation is immaterial, when read in context with
the other COAs/allegations, is persuasive. A material violation is one that
affected the borrower’s loan obligations, disrupted the borrower’s loan
modification process, or otherwise harmed the borrower. (Demurrer p. 4, citing Morris
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 279, 304.) Here,
however, Plaintiff merely restates the statutory language to establish
materiality. 
 
Therefore,
the court SUSTAINS the demurrer with leave to amend. 
 
2.    
Violation Of Civ. Code § 2923.7 – Failure To Assign A Single Point Of
Contact
California
Civil Code §2923.7(a) states: When a borrower requests a foreclosure prevention
alternative, the mortgage servicer shall promptly establish a single point of
contact and provide to the borrower one or more direct means of communication
with the single point of contact. 
 
Plaintiff
alleges that he submitted a “complete” request for loan modification assistance
and requested that Defendants assign him a Single Point of Contact (“SPOC”)
(Complaint ¶ 29) but no SPOC was assigned. (¶30.)
 
Defendants
argue that (i) Plaintiff has not pled that this is a material violation and
(ii) the allegation is contradictory. 
 
Here, the
court agrees on both fronts. Plaintiff’s
allegations are contradicted by paragraph 18 wherein he alleges that on August
20, 2023, Plaintiff’s representative called Selene and spoke to a
representative who advised of the notice of missing document. Thus,
Plaintiff’s representative was informed of the need to provide missing
documents in support of Plaintiff’s application for a loan modification. Even
Plaintiff’s opposition continues to contradict the complaint wherein he states
that he was not notified of any missing documents. (Opp. p. 6:5-7.) 
 
Therefore,
the court SUSTAINS the demurrer as to this 2nd COA with leave to
amend.
 
3.    
Violation Of Civ.Code § 2924.9, Failure to Provide Homeowner With
Foreclosure Alternatives
California
Civil Code § 2924.9 provides: 
 
(a) Unless a borrower has previously exhausted the first lien loan
modification process offered by, or through, his or her mortgage servicer
described in Section 2923.6, within five business days after recording a notice
of default pursuant to Section 2924, a mortgage servicer that offers one or
more foreclosure prevention alternatives shall send a written communication to
the borrower that includes all of the following information: (1) That the
borrower may be evaluated for a foreclosure prevention alternative or, if
applicable, foreclosure prevention alternatives. (2) Whether an application
is required to be submitted by the borrower in order to be considered for a
foreclosure prevention alternative. (3) The means and process by which a
borrower may obtain an application for a foreclosure prevention alternative.
(b) This section shall not apply to entities described in subdivision (b) of
Section 2924.18. (c) This section shall apply only to mortgages or deeds of
trust described in Section 2924.15. (emphasis added.) 
 
Plaintiff
states that Defendants failed to notify him of all foreclosure prevention
alternatives within 5 business days after the NOD was recorded as required by
California Civil Code § 2924.9. (Complaint ¶ 37.)
 
Here, the
court directs the parties to the 1st COA wherein the holding of Lupertino
applies. What is more, a violation of this statute would be immaterial
because Plaintiff alleges he did submit a loan modification
application after the NOD was recorded, so clearly Plaintiff tacitly concedes
he was aware of possible alternatives to foreclosure. (Complaint ¶ 16.) 
 
Therefore,
the court SUSTAINS the demurrer as to the 3rd COA.
 
4.    
Violation of California Civil Code § 2924.10 
California
Civil Code § 2924.10 provides in part: (a) When a borrower submits a complete
first lien modification application or any document in connection with a first
lien modification application, the mortgage servicer shall provide written
acknowledgment of the receipt of the documentation within five business days of
receipt. 
 
Plaintiff
alleges he sent a loan modification application on August 10, 2023. (Complaint,
¶ 41.)
 
The court
again directs the parties to Lupertino’s holding. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, the demurrer to the 4th COA is sustained with leave to
amend. 
 
5.    
Wrongful Foreclosure
Plaintiff’s
cause of action for Wrongful Foreclosure is premised on the alleged violations
of Civil Code §§ 2923.5, 2923.6(c), 2923.7, 2924.9 and 2924.10. 


As the
foregoing COAs require amendment such that ruling on this COA is somewhat
premature, the court SUSTAINS this COA with leave to amend.
 
6.    
Unfair Business Practices
In order to
allege a violation of the Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §17200, a plaintiff must
state with reasonable particularity the facts supporting the statutory elements
of the violation. Khoury v. Maly's of California (1993) 14 Cal. App. 4th
612, 619. A plaintiff must show either an (1) unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent
business act or practice, or (2) unfair, deceptive, untrue, or misleading
advertising. Stewart v. Life Ins. Co. of North America (2005) 388
F.Supp.2d 1138. Furthermore, in order to have standing to allege such a claim,
the plaintiff must have been injured as a result of the allegedly
fraudulent/unfair/unlawful activity in question. (Troyk v. Farmers Group,
Inc., (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1346. 
 
As the
foregoing COAs require amendment such that ruling on this COA is somewhat
premature, the court SUSTAINS this COA with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
In sum, even
if there were statutory violations, they appear immaterial as Plaintiff’s
(contradictory) complaint state that he submitted a loan modification
application after the NOD was recorded (thus he was aware of possible
alternatives to foreclosure), that he was informed of missing documents because
his representative was in contact/had communications with a Selene
representative, and that the Notice of Trustee’s Sale that was recorded
setting the sale of the Property for August 31, 2023 (RJN Ex. 7) was continued
to January 9, 2023 (sic) (Complaint ¶ 15). Based thereon, as the complaint does not plead facts to
support material violations, the demurrer is sustained in its entirety with
leave to amend and the MTS is moot.
