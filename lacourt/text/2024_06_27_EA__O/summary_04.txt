And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a plaintiff who was bullied and assaulted in middle and high school. The plaintiff, Malachi Saucedo, alleges that the West Covina Unified School District had a mandatory duty to protect him from harm under Education Code section 44807. The district demurred to the complaint, arguing that the statute does not impose a mandatory duty.

The judge finds that Education Code section 44807 does provide a mandatory duty for the district to supervise students during recess and lunch periods. The judge cites several cases that support this finding, including Lucas v. Fresno Unified School Dist. (1993) and Dailey v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (1970).

However, the judge sustains the district's demurrer to the complaint to the extent that it seeks relief based on negligence per se. The judge finds that negligence per se is not a cause of action under California law.

The judge denies the district's motion to strike portions of the complaint and allows the plaintiff to amend his complaint to allege a breach of mandatory duty.
