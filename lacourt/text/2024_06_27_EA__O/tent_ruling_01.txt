On December 22, 2022, Plaintiff M.L. filed suit against Doe

Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s attorney, Paulina H. Jaafar and Slater, Slater,
Schulman, LLP seeks to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in attorney
client relationship. 
 
As Counsel has complied with all California Rules of Court
Rule 3.1362 (filed MC-051, 052, and 053 forms), has appropriately served
Plaintiff and Defendant, and there are no substantive motions on calendar
requiring Plaintiff’s immediate representation, the court grants the motion. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, effective upon serving this court’s order relieving Counsel sent to
Plaintiff, Defendant, and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
