DEFENDANT
WEST COVINA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT'S NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION TO STRIKE
PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT is DENIED. 
 
Background
 
This case arises from bullying plaintiff experienced in
middle and high school. Plaintiff MALACHI SAUCEDO, a minor, by and through his
Guardian Ad Litem, Jimmy Luera alleges the following against Defendant WEST
COVINA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (“Defendant” or “District”): While in middle
school, beginning in 2017 and on over 30 occasions, Plaintiff was the target of
bullying, threats, and assaults by male students at his middle school.
(Complaint p. 4.) Plaintiff reported the assaults, but his complaints were
ignored. In 2020, due to the repeated bullying, Plaintiff was removed from
school, and home-schooled. In 2023, he returned to high school, but the
harassment continued. On one occasion, on July 6, 2023, Plaintiff was severely
beaten during lunch recess, resulting in traumatic brain injury, neck injuries,
and other trauma. (Complaint p. 5.) 
 
On March 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed suit for:
 
1.    
Negligence (Gov. Code §§ 815.2 & 820)
2.    
NEGLIGENCE PER SE / BREACH OF MANDATORY DUTY (Education
Code §44807) (v. District and Does 1-20 wherein Does 1-10 are identified as
those “who owed a duty of care to Plaintiff and breached that duty of care, as
described in more detail herein, and/or had the duty to control the conduct of
Plaintiff’s fellow students who bullied and assaulted Plaintiff”)
3.    
ASSAULT (v. student(s))
4.    
Battery (v. student(s))
5.    
Negligence (Does 21-30 defined as “persons, entities or
businesses who owed a duty of care to Plaintiff and/or his parents,or had a
duty to control the conduct of the alleged perpetrators, DOES 31-40.”)
 
On May 31, 2024, Defendant filed the instant demurrer and
motion to strike. 
 
On June 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to both.
 
On June 20, 2024, Defendant filed a reply. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant demurs to the 2nd COA for Negligence
Per Se/Breach of Mandatory Duty on the grounds that it fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a COA against the District. 
 
The 2nd COA, in pertinent part, provides the
following:
 
Defendant[] had a special relationship
with Plaintiff and an affirmative duty to take all reasonable steps to protect
Plaintiff.  Additionally, under Education
Code §44807, Defendants had a duty to account for the health and safety of
their students during recess and on playgrounds. Consequently, Defendants
breached such duty by
failing to protect Plaintiff during the lunch recess on July 6, 2023.
(Complaint ¶33, emphasis
added.)
 
Specifically, the District argues the following:
 
i.                
Plaintiff’s reliance upon Education Code section 44807
is misplaced as it imposes a discretionary, not mandatory, duty on the
District, and it was not designed to protect against the kinds of injuries
suffered by Plaintiff (Motion p. 1, citing Clausing v. San Franciso Unified
School Dist. (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1224, 1239). 
ii.              
Negligence per se is not an appropriate cause of action
under the law. 
 
1.    
Whether Education Code section 44807 Provides
a Mandatory Duty
 
To impose liability against a public entity under Government
Code section 815.6, liability must be based on a statute that imposes a
mandatory duty, rather than a discretionary function of said public entity.
(Demurrer p. 3, citing Nunn v. State of California (1984) 35 Ca1.3d 616,
625.) The term "mandatory duty" refers to an "obligatory duty
which a government entity is required to perform, as opposed to a permissive
power, which a government entity may exercise or not at it chooses." (Demurrer
p. 4, citing Fox v. County of Fresno (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 1238, 1242.
See also, Posey v. State of California (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 836, 848.) 
 
Education Code § 44807 states in pertinent part, that “[e]very
teacher in the public schools shall hold pupils to a strict account for their
conduct on the way to and from school, on the playgrounds, or during
recess." 
 
Defendant
argues that this statute does not impose a mandatory duty. But Defendant’s
authority and analysis does not support this proposition. 
 
First, Defendant’s papers focus on the allegation that one
of the tormentors antagonized Plaintiff over Facetime/speakerphone (Complaint ¶21) to seemingly argue that Plaintiff’s
injuries did not arise on campus. (Demurrer p. 4:19-21 [“[Education Code
section 44807] certainly does not establish a duty to supervise or otherwise
monitor the cellular usage of its students let alone the behavior of its
students outside of school., Reply p. 3:14-17.) But Defendant narrowly reads this allegation;[1] the
complaint does not suggest that the Facetime calls happened off campus
(i.e., one can make a call on campus). Even if the Facetime calls
happened off campus, the 2nd COA specifically focuses on the
July 6, 2023 fight that happened during lunch recess, which Defendant
does not squarely address.[2] Thus, as there was an incident that
happened on campus during recess, Education Code section 44807
may apply. 
 
Second, Defendant cites to Jimenez v. Roseville City
School Dist. (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 594, 606 for its contention that the
statute does not provide for a mandatory duty. (Demurrer p. 4.) However, Jimenez does not
provide for such a rule. In fact, the cases cited by the Jimenez court
support the finding of a mandatory duty afforded by Education Code section
44807. For example, the Jimenez court referenced Lucas v.
Fresno Unified School Dist. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 866 wherein a student was
injured during morning recess after numerous students threw dirt clods at one another.
(Id. at p. 868.) In reversing the trial court’s decision granting the
district’s motion for summary judgment, the appellate court observed that “[s]upervision during recess and lunch
periods is required, in part, so that discipline may be maintained and student
conduct regulated. Such regulation is necessary precisely because of the
commonly known tendency of students to engage in aggressive and impulsive
behavior which exposes them and their peers to the risk of serious physical
harm.” (Id. at p 872, quoting Dailey v. Los Angeles Unified School
Dist. (1970) 2 Cal.3d 741, 747-748.) And as a student, the plaintiff
Lucas was
within the class of persons Education Code section 44807 who was
designed to be protected. (Lucas, supra, 14 Cal.App.4th at p. 872.)
Based thereon, the court held that Education Code section 44807 (and Code of
regulations Title 5, Section 5552) “clearly defined legal duty on the part
of the District to supervise plaintiff … to prevent precisely what
occurred in the case at bar.” (Id, emphasis and underline added.) Similarly,
here, consistent with the pronouncements of Dailey and Lucas, supervision
during lunch was required to ensure “serious physical harm” does not happen and
because of the alleged lack thereof, Plaintiff was seriously injured. 
 
To the extent that Defendant cites to Hoff v. Vacaville
Unified School Dist. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 925, 939 to support its argument that the
statute applies to teachers, not the district, that is not what Hoff proposes.
In Hoff, the state Supreme Court concluded that neither the school
district nor any of its employees owed a duty to Hoff, a nonstudent who
was not on school property at the time of the accident. For that reason—that
Hoff was a member of the general public and not on school property, the court
concluded that Hoff may not state a negligence claim based on the duty of
teachers under Education Code section 44807. (Id. at
pp. 938-939.) Here, in contrast, Plaintiff’s injuries are the very kind
that the Legislature intended to prevent. 
 
Accordingly, absent authority that Education Code section
44807 does not provide a mandatory duty (as illustrated otherwise by various
cases), the court OVERRULES the demurrer on said grounds.[3]
 
2.    
Negligence Per Se
 
In opposition, Plaintiff contends that negligence per se
action is a cause of action by citing to Toste v. CalPortland Construction
(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 362, 371. Though, not addressed in the Reply, Toste still
supports the well-established understanding that negligence per is an evidentiary
doctrine, not a separate cause of action. (See e.g., Beaver v. Tarsadia Hotels, 29 F. Supp. 3d 1294
(S.D. Cal. 2014), aff'd on other grounds, 816 F.3d 1170 (9th Cir. 2016) (applying
California law). 
 
Therefore, as negligence per se doctrine does not provide a duty of
care but may establish a relevant standard when a duty already exists,[4]
the court SUSTAINS the demurrer on this ground with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
In sum, as Education Code section 44807 provides a mandatory
duty that the District was to monitor the students during lunch recess and the
allegation is that the District failed to do so resulting in injuries to
Plaintiff, then the complaint does state a valid COA for breach of mandatory
duty against the District. Consequently, the MTS references to the education
code section 44807 is DENIED. That said, as negligence per se is not a COA
(and Plaintiff has already pled negligence via the 1st COA which
requires a mandatory duty), the court SUSTAINS the demurrer with leave to
amend.
