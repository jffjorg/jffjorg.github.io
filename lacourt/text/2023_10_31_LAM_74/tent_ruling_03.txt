Defendant argues that the
court in Williams overruled this case. However, the court in Williams
only disapproved of San Diego Trolley to the extent it required the
party seeking information in this context to demonstrate a compelling interest
or compelling need. (Williams, supra, 3 Cal.5th at p. 560, fn. 8.) 


 
[2] In its opposition, Defendant
contends Plaintiff has waived his right to privacy in the employment records
with Third-Party Prospect. As Plaintiff notes, though, waivers must be narrowly
rather than expansively construed. (Britt v. Superior Court (1978) 20
Cal.3d 844, 859.) Plaintiff did not waive his right to privacy in his
employment records with Third-Party Prospect because only Plaintiff’s
employment with Defendant is directly relevant to this action.
