```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to quash or modify the deposition subpoena for business records issued to Third-Party Adventist. The plaintiff seeks to quash the subpoena on the grounds that it does not describe the categories of documents sought with particularity and that the requested documents are personnel records subject to the plaintiff's constitutional right to privacy. The defendant argues that the documents are relevant to assess the plaintiff's mitigation of damages, evaluate the plaintiff's credibility, and show whether Third-Party Adventist disciplined the plaintiff for the same reasons that led to his termination.

The court finds that the plaintiff has a legally protected privacy interest in the requested documents and a reasonable expectation of privacy in these documents. The court also finds that the defendant has not specified which of the disputed categories of documents are necessary for its purposes. Therefore, the court will grant the plaintiff's motion to modify the subpoena and order the defendant to remove the following categories of documents from the subpoena: personnel files, manager and/or supervisor files, performance evaluations and reviews, complaints by employees about the plaintiff, complaints by the plaintiff about employees, disciplinary actions pertaining to the plaintiff, and termination documents pertaining to the plaintiff. The court also orders the defendant to limit the scope of the subpoena to specific documents rather than requesting all documents that refer, relate, or pertain to the plaintiff's employment.
