And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to quash or modify a deposition subpoena issued to Third-Party Prospect Medical Group, Inc. on behalf of Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The subpoena seeks various documents related to Plaintiff Harmik Abrahamian's employment, including personnel files, performance evaluations, and disciplinary actions. Plaintiff argues that these documents are protected by his right to privacy and that the subpoena does not sufficiently particularize the items sought. The court agrees with Plaintiff and grants the motion to modify the subpoena, limiting the scope of the requested documents to only those necessary for assessing Plaintiff's mitigation of damages and credibility.
