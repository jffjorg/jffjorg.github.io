```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the arguments presented by both parties and has tentatively ruled that the court in Williams did not overrule the case at hand, but rather only disapproved of the requirement that a party seeking information must demonstrate a compelling interest or need. The judge has also considered the defendant's contention that the plaintiff waived his right to privacy in his employment records with Third-Party Prospect, but has determined that the plaintiff did not waive his right to privacy because the employment records are not directly relevant to this action. The judge will make a final ruling after considering further arguments and evidence presented at the future court hearing.
