Motion filed on 11/30/23.

Firm
CLIENT #1: Plaintiff Jose Pablo Flores-Membreno
CLIENT #2: Plaintiff Eva Carolina Menendez De Contreras
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: 
 
1.

Law Firm as counsel for Plaintiff Jose Pablo Flores-Membreno in this action.
 
2.     
An order relieving attorney Christopher
Goodroe/Wilshire Law Firm as counsel for Plaintiff Eva

RULING: The motions are denied without prejudice.
 
On 4/11/23, attorneys Christopher Goodroe and Daniel Uzi
Frydman of the Wilshire Law Firm filed this action on behalf of Plaintiffs Jose
Pablo Flores-Membreno and Eva Carolina Menendez De
Contreras.  Attorney Frydman is
listed as Plaintiffs attorney of record in eCourt.  The complaint has not been served on any of
the named defendants.  
 
On 11/30/23, two motions to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiffs were filed listing attorneys Christoper Goodroe and Moshe Shemtov of
the Wilshire Law Firm in the caption of each motion.  Each motion seeks an order relieving attorney
Christopher Goodroe/Wilshire Law Firm as counsel for one of the Plaintiffs in
this action.  The motions are supported
by declarations from attorney Shemtov.  Neither
motion lists a reservation ID number and neither motion attaches a reservation
receipt.  Only one motion filing fee has
been paid.  
 
Attorney Shemtov has filed two additional declarations
titled “Declaration In Support of Compliance With Service, Rules of Court
3.1362(d), Service” which list the same reservation ID number, 103677745355.  A proper proof of service for each motion has
not been filed.  Each declaration claims
that the non-specified “Plaintiff” was served with the motion documents on
11/30/23 by mail and electronic mail at the unspecified “Plaintiff’s” current
residence address as confirmed by a property and asset search conducted on
11/7/23.  The declarations do not comply
with the requirements for a valid proof of service by mail or electronic mail.  See CCP 1013a; CCP 1010.6; CRC 2.251;
CRC 3.1362(d).  Nor is there any evidence
that the clients agreed to electronic service or that they were actually served
via electronic mail.  
 
Additionally, the proposed orders do not include
telephone numbers for the clients/Plaintiffs. 
(See proposed Orders, nos.6).
