And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by Plaintiff Omar Maldonado Gonzalez against Defendant Ford Motor Company. The Plaintiff alleges that defects and nonconformities in a 2019 Ford Explorer, which was purchased under a warranty contract, substantially impaired the use, value, and/or safety of the vehicle. The Plaintiff had previously filed a lawsuit against Ford and Sunrise Ford of North Hollywood, alleging breach of warranty and negligence. The Plaintiff sought further responses to discovery requests, including specific documents related to Ford's policies and procedures regarding compliance with the Song-Beverly Act.

The Court granted the motion, finding that Ford's responses did not comply with statutory requirements. The Court ordered Ford to produce responsive documents claimed to be confidential under a protective order, which will be entered after a hearing on March 5, 2024. The Court also found that Ford's objections to production were without merit and failed to identify specific documents withheld. The Court awarded the Plaintiff sanctions against Ford and its counsel, Mortenson Taggart Adams LLP, in the amount of $2,460.00.
