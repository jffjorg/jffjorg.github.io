SUMMARY
OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This
action arises out of a warranty contract Plaintiff Omar Maldonado Gonzalez
(Plaintiff ) entered with Defendant Ford Motor Company (Ford) on 4/19/22
regarding a 2019 Ford Explorer (the Vehicle). 
(Complaint ¶15).  Plaintiff
alleges that “[d]efects and nonconformities to warranty manifested themselves
within the applicable express warranty period” which “substantially impair the
use, value and/or safety of the Subject Vehicle.”  (Complaint ¶¶16-17).
 
Plaintiff
alleges that he delivered the Vehicle to Defendant Sunrise Ford of North
Hollywood (Sunrise Ford) for repair on numerous occasions and that Sunrise Ford
breached its duty to use ordinary care and skill by failing to properly store,
prepare and repair the Vehicle in accordance with industry standards which was
a proximate cause of Plaintiff’s damages. 
(Complaint ¶¶28-31).    
 
On 2/10/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Ford
for Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty and against
Sunrise Ford for Negligent Repair.  On
5/19/23, Plaintiff served Ford with Requests for Production of Documents, Set
1. (Lopez Decl. ¶3, Exhibit A). On 6/21/23, Ford served  unverified responses to the requests.  (Lopez Decl. ¶4, Exhibit B). On 7/11/23, Ford
served a verification. (Lopez Decl. ¶4). 
 
Meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the issues
Plaintiff had with regard to Ford’s responses to certain of the requests. (Lopez
Decl. ¶¶5-11, Ex.C-G).  During the meet
and confer process, the parties agreed to extend the deadline to file a motion
to compel further responses to 9/29/23. 
(Lopez Decl., Ex.D).
 
Therefore, on 9/29/23, Plaintiff filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order compelling further responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production, Set 1, numbers 16, 19-29 and 31.  Additionally, Plaintiff requests sanctions in
the amount of $2,460.00 against Ford and its attorneys of records, Mortenson
Taggart Adams LLP.  Ford has opposed the
motion and Plaintiff has filed a reply to the opposition.   
 
ANALYSIS 
 
A party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action or to
the determination of any motion made in the action, if the matter itself is
admissible or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.  See CCP
2017.010.  Doubts as to relevance are
generally resolved in favor of allowing discovery.  Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co.
(1982) 31 C3d 785, 790.
 
CCP 2031.310(a) provides:
 
“On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply: 
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete. 
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.” 
 
The subject requests are reasonably particularized as
they seek specific documents tailored to the issues in this case.  See CCP 2031.030(c)(1).  Additionally, they seek documents regarding
Ford’s policies and procedures related to its compliance with the Song-Beverly
Act.  As such, the requests seek
documents relevant to Plaintiff’s claims and Plaintiff has provided sufficient
facts to establish the requisite good cause for production of the subject
documents.  See CCP 2031.310(b)(1).

 
Ford’s responses to the subject document requests do not
comply with the statutory requirements.  
In response to the subject requests, Ford has indicated
that it will produce certain documents subject to a protective order.  Additionally, Ford’s responses include
objections.  The Court finds that Ford
had the burden of obtaining Plaintiff’s agreement to enter a protective order
or filing a motion for a protective order before serving its responses.  See CCP 2031.060.  In other words, Ford could not merely assume
the parties would come to an agreement or the Court would issue its requested
protective order.  Based on the motion
and the meet and confer letters between the parties, it appears that Plaintiff
is agreeable to entering a protective order; however, the parties cannot agree
on the specific terms of same.  (See
Lopez Decl. ¶5, Ex.C).  As such, the
production of responsive documents claimed to be confidential will be pursuant
to any protective order entered after the Court’s ruling on
Ford’s motion for protective order which is scheduled for hearing on 3/5/24. 
 
 
With regard to the objections interposed by Ford, Ford
has failed to identify with particularity any documents that it is withholding
based on a specific objection as required. 
See CCP 2031.240(a), (b). 
To the extent Ford objects to production on the basis of privilege, Ford
has failed to establish how responsive documents fall under any privilege and
Ford has failed to provide a privilege log. 
See CCP 2031.240(c).  Where
Ford has indicated an inability to comply with part of a request (i.e., in
response to Request 24 with regard to “scripts”), Ford has failed to “specify
whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has
never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has
never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the
responding party.”  CCP 2031.230.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions
against Ford and its counsel, Mortenson Taggart Adams
LLP, for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations in the
amount of $2,460.00 (6.4 hours of attorney time at $375.00/hour plus $60.00
filing fee). CCP 2031.310(h); (Lopez Declaration ¶¶12-14). 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is granted.  Further responses are due within 30
days.  
 
The Court awards Plaintiff sanctions against Ford and its attorneys of
record, Mortenson Taggart Adams LLP,  in
the amount of $2,460.00.  Sanctions are
payable within 30
