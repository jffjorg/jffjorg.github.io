And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the petition for approval of compromise without prejudice. The petition was filed on behalf of minor Diego Won, who was bitten by the defendant's dog in 2021. The petition seeks approval of a settlement agreement in which the defendant will pay a total of $71,500.00 to settle all of the plaintiffs' claims. The settlement includes payment of medical expenses, attorney fees, and expenses. However, the judge notes several procedural defects in the petition, including the lack of proof of service for the complaint and petition, and the failure to submit proposed orders for approval and deposit in a blocked account. The judge also notes that a petition for approval of compromise has not been filed on behalf of minor Nicolas Won, who was also involved in the incident. The judge is denying the petition without prejudice, meaning that the parties may re-file the petition after addressing the procedural defects.
