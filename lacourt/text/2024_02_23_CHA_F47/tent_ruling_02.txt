Case #23CHCV00709
 
MINOR’S
COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 1/31/24.  
 
MINOR: Diego Won
GAL: Yolanda Won (parent)
Defendant: Elida Ortiz
 
RULING: The petition is denied without prejudice.
 
This action arises out of dog bite incident that occurred
on 3/28/21 at Golden Valley Dog Park in Santa Clarita.  On that date, Defendant Elida Ortiz’s
(Defendant) dog bit minor Diego Won in the presence of his family members and
co-plaintiffs, Hanson Won (father, Hanson), Yolanda Won (mother, Yolanda) and
Nicolas Won (Nicolas, brother).  On
3/10/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant for: (1) strict
liability in tort, (2) negligence and (3) negligent infliction of emotional
distress.  No proof of service for the
complaint has been filed and Defendant has not appeared in the action.  
 
On 1/31/24, Yolanda, on behalf of Diego, filed the
instant petition for approval of compromise of the claim of Diego.  There is no proof of service for the
petition.  
 
The petition indicates that Defendant will pay a total of
$71,500.00 to settle all of the Plaintiffs’ claims in this action with
$56,500.00 being allocated to Diego and each of 
the other Plaintiffs receiving $5,000.00.
 
The petition indicates medical expenses in the total
amount of $2,817.00 have been incurred with $342.00 having been paid.  Medical expenses in the amount of $2,475.00
are to be paid from the settlement. 
Additionally, attorney fees in the amount of $14,125.00 and expenses in
the amount of $1,965.95 are to be deducted from Diego’s settlement funds
leaving $37,934.05 to be paid to Diego who still has faint scars from the
incident.  
 
As noted above, Defendant has not appeared in this action
and there is no proof of service for the complaint or the petition.  The declaration of attorney Barry L. Edzant
indicates that Defendant is insured by State Farm and an unnamed State Farm
adjuster offered the $71,500.00 global settlement.  (Attachment 13a - Edzant Decl. ¶3).  There is no other evidence of the foregoing
or that the petition was served on State Farm/the adjuster.  Attorney Edzant indicates that this action
was only filed to preserve the statute of limitations for the adult
plaintiffs.  Id. 
 
There are several procedural defects in the petition:
 
(1)   The
Guardian Ad Litem box is not marked in item 1. 
(2)   Item
17.e. indicates that the attorney is not representing any other party involved
in the matter; however, the attorney also represents the other plaintiffs and
expects to receive fees from their portion of the settlement.  (See Item 17.f.).
(3)   Item
18.b.(7) indicates that Diego’s settlement funds are to be transferred to the
trustee of a trust that is either created by or approved in the order approving
the settlement.  However, Item 10.c. and
Attachment 18b(7) indicate that Diego’s settlement funds are to be placed in a
blocked account which would fall under Item 18.b.(2).  If a trust is to be created/approved, it
would have to be submitted to the Probate Division for approval.  See Los Angeles Superior Court, Local
Rule 4.115(c).  
(4)   Proposed
orders for approval and deposit in blocked account have not been submitted.
 
 
The Court also notes that a petition for approval of the
compromise of the claim of minor plaintiff Nicolas Won has not been filed.
