And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motions filed by attorneys Christopher Goodroe and Moshe Shemtov to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiffs, Jose Pablo Flores-Membreno and Eva Carolina Menendez De Contreras. The motions were filed on November 30, 2023, and seek an order relieving Goodroe and/or Wilshire Law Firm as counsel for the Plaintiffs. The Judge found that the motions were not properly served, and the declarations submitted in support of compliance with service did not comply with the required procedures. Specifically, the declarations lacked a reservation ID number, a reservation receipt, and a proper proof of service, and did not provide evidence that the clients agreed to electronic service or were actually served via electronic mail. The Judge denied the motions without prejudice, meaning that the Plaintiffs can re-file the motions with proper proof of service.
