  Case Number:  22PSCV00438    Hearing Date:   October 26, 2023    Dept:  G Plaintiff KeyBank National Association’s Motion for  Summary Adjudication of Affirmative Defenses Respondent: Defendants JYuan  Corp, James Yuan, and Golden Lion Transportation TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff KeyBank National Association’s Motion for  Summary Adjudication of Affirmative Defenses is GRANTED IN PART as to the First  Affirmative Defense and DENIED IN PART as to the Second Affirmative Defense BACKGROUND This  is a breach of contract action arising from a loan and security agreement. In  October 2014, Plaintiff KeyBank National Association (KeyBank) entered into a  written agreement with Defendant JYuan Corp. (Lion Express), doing business as Lion Express,  in which KeyBank agreed to provide $381,972.81 for Lion Express to purchase  equipment. Lion Express agreed to make an initial payment of $395, sixty-three  monthly payments of $4,639.39, and one final payment of $81,034.39. James Yuan  and Golden Lion Transportation (Golden Lion) also executed personal guaranties  under the agreement. KeyBank alleges Lion Express breached the agreement by  failing to make monthly payments and now owes $63,060.40. On December 27, 2021,  KeyBank sent demand letters to Lion Express, Yuan, and Golden Lion demanding  payment. On  May 6, 2022, KeyBank filed a complaint against Lion Express, Yuan, and Golden  Lion (collectively, Defendants), alleging breach of written contract against  each defendant. On  October 14, 2022, KeyBank filed a motion for summary judgment that the court  denied on February 28, 2023. The court also denied a subsequent motion by  KeyBank for leave to resubmit a motion for summary judgment on April 10. On June  21, 2023, KeyBank filed the present motion for summary adjudication. A hearing  on the motion is set for October 26 with a post-mediation status conference. A  final status conference is also set for February 20, 2024, with a jury trial on  March 5. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE Defendants’  request for judicial notice of prior filings and orders in this action is GRANTED. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS To  the extent Defendants have made evidentiary objections to KeyBank’s evidence,  the court declines to consider the objections as they were not made in  compliance with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1354(b). ANALYSIS KeyBank  moves for summary adjudication of Defendants’ first affirmative defense  (failure to state a cause of action) and second affirmative defense (failure to  mitigate damages). For the following reasons, the court GRANTS KeyBank’s motion as to the  first affirmative defense and DENIES its motion as to the second affirmative defense. Legal Standard A  motion for summary judgment or adjudication provides “courts with a mechanism  to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite  their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar  v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) It must be granted  “if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from  the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that  there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is  entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.  (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119, quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)  To establish a triable issue of material fact, the opposing party must produce  substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68  Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of  the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence  in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39  Cal.4th 384, 389.) Failure to State Sufficient Facts (First Affirmative  Defense) KeyBank  argues Defendants’ first affirmative defense of failure to state sufficient  facts is defeated by their Complaint. The court agrees. Legal Standard In  a demurrer or answer, a defendant may object to a complaint on the ground that  “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of  action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This defense is based on legal  rather than factual issues as it requires the court to determine the legal  sufficiency of the pleading. (Cf. Stanton Road Associates v. Pacific  Employers Ins. Co. (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 333, 340-341.) To  succeed on a claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must be able to  establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or  excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting  damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51  Cal.4th 811, 821.) If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach of  a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the  complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated  by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74  Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances, a plaintiff may also “plead the  legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction  Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,  198-199.) Discussion In  this case, KeyBank argues it has adequately alleged causes of action for breach  of contract against all three Defendants. KeyBank alleges it entered into a  loan agreement with Lion Express on October 22, 2014. (Complaint, ¶ 5.) On the  same day,[1]  KeyBank alleges Yuan and Golden Lion executed guaranty agreements. (Complaint,  ¶ 10.) According to the Complaint and attached exhibits, KeyBank agreed to  finance the purchase of “certain equipment” for Lion Express in the amount of  $381,972.81. (Complaint, ¶ 5, Ex. A.) In exchange, Lion Express agreed to repay  the amount in 83 payments.[2]  (Complaint, ¶ 6, Ex. A.) KeyBank also alleges Yuan and Golden Lion induced  KeyBank to enter into the loan agreement with Lion Express by promising to  personally guarantee Golden Lion’s obligations. (Complaint, ¶ 10, Ex. B, C.) Based  on these allegations, the court finds KeyBank adequately alleged the existence  of enforceable contracts between KeyBank and Defendants. Next,  KeyBank alleges it performed pursuant to the agreement by providing the  required funds to Lion Express. (Complaint, ¶ 22.) KeyBank alleges Lion Express  breached the agreement by failing to make the minimum monthly payments to  KeyBank when they were due. (Complaint, ¶ 11, 21.) KeyBank also alleges Yuan  and Golden Lion breached their guaranty agreements by failing to make the  payments owed by Lion Express. (Complaint, ¶ 17, 26, 30.) Last, KeyBank alleges  their breach has damaged KeyBank in the amount of at least $63,060.40.  (Complaint, ¶ 23, 27, 31.) Based on these allegations, the court finds KeyBank adequately  alleged performance by KeyBank, breach by Defendants, and damages. Because  KeyBank established it adequately alleged the elements of breach of contract  against Defendants, the burden now shifts to Defendants who must demonstrate  how KeyBank’s Complaint is inadequately pled.   Defendants fail to do so. Accordingly,  KeyBank’s motion for summary adjudication of Defendants’ first affirmative defense  is GRANTED. Failure to Mitigate Damages (Second Affirmative  Defense) KeyBank  contends Defendants’ second affirmative defense of failure to mitigate damages is  inapplicable. The court disagrees. Legal Standard “A  plaintiff who suffers damage as a result of either a breach of contract or a  tort has a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate those damages and will not  be able to recover for any losses which could have been thus avoided.” (Shaffer  v. Debbas (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 33, 41.) In other words, “A plaintiff may  not recover for damages avoidable through ordinary care and reasonable  exertion.” (Valle de Oro Bank v. Gamboa (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1686,  1691.) But “[t]he duty to mitigate damages does not require an injured party to  do what is unreasonable or impracticable.” (Ibid.) “Whether the  plaintiff has acted reasonably in mitigating damages is ordinarily a question  of fact [Citation], but issues of fact become those of law where . . .  the facts are undisputed and permit of only  one conclusion [Citations].” (West v. Bechtel Corp. (2002) 96  Cal.App.4th 966, 985.) Discussion In  this case, KeyBank contends Defendants are not entitled to this defense because  KeyBank adequately mitigated damages by repossessing and selling the collateral  at issue. (Barnes Decl., ¶ 8-9.) According to the declaration of Nancy Barnes,  Lion Express defaulted on March 15, 2021. (Barnes Decl., ¶ 6.) On December 27,  KeyBank sent letters notifying Defendants that they were in default and that  KeyBank was accelerating their debt. (Barnes Decl., ¶ 8.) But while Barnes’  declaration refers to the letters as attached exhibits, Barnes’ declaration  does not include any such exhibits. Furthermore, while Barnes states the  collateral at issue was repossessed and sold at a public auction in a  reasonable manner, Barnes fails to state when these events occurred, the price for  which the collateral sold, and how the price affected the amount of damages  sought by KeyBank. (Barnes Decl., ¶ 8-9.) Thus, the court finds KeyBank failed  to carry its burden of establishing an absence of triable facts regarding the  amount by which any damages were mitigated. Accordingly,  KeyBank’s motion for summary adjudication of this defense is DENIED. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, KeyBank’s  motion for summary adjudication is GRANTED IN PART as  to Defendants’ first affirmative defense and DENIED IN PART as to  Defendants’ second affirmative defense.
