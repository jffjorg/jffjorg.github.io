And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

**Demurrer and Motion to Strike**

The court has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Baldwin Park Unified School District (BPUSD) in response to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Jane Doe M.N.

**Ruling**

The court has overruled BPUSD's demurrer and granted its motion to strike M.N.'s request for treble damages and attorney fees from the FAC. The court has also ordered BPUSD to file its answer to the FAC, with the request for treble damages and attorney fees stricken, within 20 days.

**Background**

The case arises from the alleged sexual abuse of an elementary student by a fellow student at Vineland Elementary School in the 1993-1994 school year. M.N. alleges that the school failed to remove the student from the school after the abuse was reported, and that the student continued to approach M.N. during recess.

**Analysis**

The court has analyzed the gift clause of the California Constitution, which prohibits the Legislature from creating liability for past acts. The court has held that AB 218, a 2019 law that waived the statute of limitations for childhood sexual assault claims, does not violate the gift clause. The court has also held that the law did not create new liability for childhood sexual assault, but rather waived the applicable statute of limitations to revive time-barred claims.

**Conclusion**

The court has overruled BPUSD's demurrer and granted its motion to strike M.N.'s request for treble damages and attorney fees from the FAC. The court has also ordered BPUSD to file its answer to the FAC, with the request for treble damages and attorney fees stricken, within 20 days.
