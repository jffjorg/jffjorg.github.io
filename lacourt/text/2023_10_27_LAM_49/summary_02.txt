Significant Statements:
  - "A local government may not be sued under § 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents. Instead, it is when execution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under § 1983."
  - "The custom must be so ‘persistent and widespread’ that it constitutes a ‘permanent and well settled city policy.’"
  - "Liability for improper custom may not be predicated on isolated or sporadic incidents; it must be founded upon practices of sufficient duration, frequency and consistency that the conduct has become a traditional method of carrying out policy."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge overruled the County's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, which alleged that the County's practice of retaliating against employees for exercising their first amendment rights is a "persistent and widespread" custom that constitutes a "permanent and well-settled city policy." The judge found that the plaintiff has stated a claim for pleading purposes and that the County is liable for the actions of Sheriff Villanueva and other employees at LASD. The judge also found that the plaintiff's allegations of retaliation and harassment by Sheriff Villanueva are sufficient to state a claim for deprivation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The judge ordered the County to file an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 21 days of the ruling.
