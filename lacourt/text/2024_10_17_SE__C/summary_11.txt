And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to strike the reference to "negligence" in the heading of the plaintiff's first cause of action. The plaintiff has 30 days to amend the complaint to remove any reference to "negligence". The motion was granted because the plaintiff's allegations do not support a separate claim for negligence, and the reference to "negligence" in the heading of the complaint may be causing confusion. The court's ruling is based on California law, which requires that all governmental tort liability be based on statute.
