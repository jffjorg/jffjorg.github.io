UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT 
CASE NO.:  24NWCV01330
HEARING:  10/17/24
 
#7
 
Defendant WHITTIER UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT’s Motion to
Strike Portions of Plaintiff’s Complaint is GRANTED with 30 days leave to
amend. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This action sounding in premises liability was filed by
Plaintiff JUDITH ANN GWINN (“Plaintiff”) on April 26, 2024. The operative
Complaint asserts one sole cause of action for “Negligence and Dangerous
Condition of Public Property Pursuant to Gov. Code §830 et seq.” 
 
Defendant WHITTIER UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT (“Defendant”) moves to
strike the reference to “negligence” in the heading of Plaintiff’s first cause
of action. 
 
A motion to strike lies either when (1) there is “irrelevant, false or
improper matter inserted in any pleading”; or (2) to strike any pleading or
part thereof “not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a
court rule or order of court.” (CCP §436.)
 
Under the statutory scheme in
California, all governmental tort liability must be based on statute. (Duarte
v. City of San Jose (1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 648, 653.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s allegations
support a claim for Premises Liabilty – Dangerous Condition on Public Property,
which, although based on negligence, does not constitute a separate claim for
negliegence. 
 
It is undisputed that Plaintiff
is not asserting a separate claim for general negligence in addition to the
claim for dangerous condition on public property. In order to clear up any
misunderstandings surrounding what/how many causes of action are being alleged,
the Motion to Strike is GRANTED with 30 days leave to amend. Plaintiff is
ORDERED to remove any reference to “negligence” in the heading of Plaintiff’s
first cause of action.
