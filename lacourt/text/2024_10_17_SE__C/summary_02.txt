And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by Guadalupe Meave, one of the defendants, to the second cause of action in the plaintiff's Fourth Amended Complaint. The second cause of action alleges negligence by Guadalupe Meave in failing to prevent the sexual assault of the plaintiff, A.P., by her husband, Juan Vicente Meave. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged negligence against Guadalupe Meave. The judge notes that the wife's duty to her minor invitee (in this case, A.P.) to prevent sexual assault depends on whether the husband's behavior was reasonably foreseeable. While Guadalupe Meave witnessed inappropriate contact between her husband and A.P., the judge finds that this alone is not sufficient to infer actual knowledge of her husband's deviant sexual desires. However, considering the allegations as a whole, the court determines that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged negligence against Guadalupe Meave, and the demurrer is overruled.
