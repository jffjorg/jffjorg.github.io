And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's (PLC's) ex parte application to advance the hearing date for its motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The motion is currently scheduled for March 5, 2025, and the judge has decided to hear it on that date rather than accommodating the defendant's request for an earlier hearing. The judge notes that the court's calendar is congested and that CCP ยง437c(a)(3) sets a limit on when motions for summary judgment can be heard. The defendant will need to give notice of the hearing date to all parties involved.
