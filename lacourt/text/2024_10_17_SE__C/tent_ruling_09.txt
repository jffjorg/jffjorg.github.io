I.       
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
LONE OAK FUND, LLC’s Demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint is CONTINUED to Thursday, November 7,
2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
    II.       
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant LONE OAK FUND, LLC’s Motion to
Strike Portions of the First Amended Cross-Complaint is CONTINUED to Thursday, November 7, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept.
SE-C. 
 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This action concerning real property was filed on July 14, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant LONE OAK FUND, LLC (“Cross-Defendant”) demurs
and moves to strike portions of the First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FAXC”). 
 
This matter is CONTINUED due to Cross-Defendant’s failure to comply with
its meet and confer obligations under CCP §430.41.
CCP
§430.41(a) states that, before filing a demurrer, the Moving Party must engage
in a specified meet and confer process with the party who filed the pleading at
issue for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached as to
the filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer/motion to strike. “[T]he demurring party shall meet and
confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (emphasis added.) (CCP §430.41(a);
see also CCP §435.5(a) regarding motions to strike.) A declaration setting
forth such meet and confer efforts must accompany the demurrer. (CCP §
430.41(a)(3).) 
The
Declaration of Elsa M. Horowitz, attached to the subject Demurrer, does not
satisfy the requirements of CCP §430.41. Ms. Horowitz states that she “prepared
and delivered [a] meet and confer letter… via email and U.S. Mail.” (Horowitz
Decl., ¶2.) Having received no response to her correspondence, Ms. Horowitz
sent a follow up email. (Id. ¶3.) Ms. Horowitz does not state that she made any
effort to meet and confer by telephone, in person, or by video conference in
compliance with the Code.  
Accordingly,
Moving Party is ORDERED to
comply with CCP §§430.41 and 435.5. If, after complying with the Code, court
intervention is needed, the parties may appear and argue the merits on the
continued hearing date. If the parties are unable to informally resolve the
issues raised in the instant Demurrer, then the Demurring Defendant must submit
a signed declaration indicating such efforts pursuant to the Code. The
declaration must be e-filed by no later than Friday, November 1, 2024.
