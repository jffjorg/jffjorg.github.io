And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in the case. First, the Court has placed the Defendant's Motion to Enter Order for Return of Judgment Debtors' Overpayment off-calendar, as the parties have not reached an agreement on the amount overpaid or unpaid. Second, the Court has continued the Plaintiff's Motion for Attorneys Fees to December 5, 2024, and has advanced the Defendant's Motion to Tax or Strike Plaintiffs' Post-Judgment Attorneys Fees to the same date. Third, the Court has tentatively decided to appoint an accounting referee to resolve the underpayment/overpayment dispute, but will confer with the parties before making a final determination. The Court's decision is based on the parties' conflicting statements regarding the amount overpaid or unpaid, and the need to promote judicial economy and speed up the resolution of the matter.
