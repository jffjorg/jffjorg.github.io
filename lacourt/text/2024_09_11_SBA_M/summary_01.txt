And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Gary Y. Tanaka on a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Starbucks Corporation, et al. on behalf of themselves and other defendants. The motion was filed in response to a complaint filed by Saima Aziz alleging causes of action for General Negligence and Premises Liability. The Court has denied the motion, finding that the defendant has failed to present competent evidence to show that the plaintiff's claims have no merit. The Court notes that the defendant has relied solely on the plaintiff's deposition and exhibits, without presenting any expert testimony or other evidence to support its claims. In contrast, the plaintiff has presented evidence from individuals with expertise in the relevant fields, including a pedestrian engineer and a safety expert. The Court concludes that the defendant has failed to meet its burden of showing that there are no triable issues of material fact and that the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication should be granted.
