[Tentative] Order Sustaining Demurrer to First
Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate
 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Petitioner
Compton Property Group, LLC (“Petitioner”) has filed two cases against the City
of Compton.  Petitioner filed the first
case (Case Number 23STCP02247) against the City of Compton and Trinidad Bravo
(who is incorrectly identified as “a Planning Technician for the City of Colton”).  (First Amended Petition, ¶¶ 10-11.)  On June 22, 2023, Petitioner submitted a
Builder’s Remedy application for the property located at 1601 West El Segundo
Boulevard in Compton, California (the “Property”).  (Id., ¶ 38.) 
Petitioner alleges that Trinidad Bravo refused to accept the
application.  (Id., ¶¶ 44-49.)  Petitioner filed the first action on June 27,
2023, and the City of Compton agreed to accept and process the application on
July 19, 2023.  (Id., ¶ 50.)
 
            Petitioner’s
preliminary application affords “vesting rights pursuant to SB 330, the Housing
Crisis Act of 2019.”  (Respondents’ Request
for Judicial Notice, Exh. 1, P. 22.)  In
other words, submitting the preliminary application “freezes fees and
development standards as of this date unless exceptions per Government Code §
65889.5(o) are triggered.”  (Ibid.)  A preliminary application must be followed by
a full application, which was disclosed to Petitioner: “After submitting this
Preliminary Application to the local agency, an application has 180 days to
submit a full application or the Preliminary Application will expire.”  (Ibid.) 

 
            On
July 18, 2023, Robert Delgadillo, Senior Planner for the City of Compton, sent
a letter stating: “[T]he City of Compton is accepting the materials that you
have submitted as your Preliminary Application (PA) for a proposed residential
project located at 1601 W. El Segundo Blvd.” 
(Petitioner’s Request for Judicial Notice, Exh. 2.)  The letter also states: 
 
“We look forward to receiving your formal application for
the proposed project, including all necessary submittals associated with the
formal application.  For your use,
attached is the ‘General Application’ for the General Plan Amendment, Zone
Change, and Conditional Use Permit that will be required when you submit the
formal applications.  It contains all of
the supplemental requirements and explains how the plans should be prepared.  Please also complete the CEQA questionnaire
with the General Application.  This will
assist us in determining the proper environmental document for this project.”
 
(Ibid.)  As a result, Petitioner filed the second case
(Case Number 23STCP02754)
against the City of Compton and Robert Delgadillo (incorrectly identified as a
“Senior Planner for the City of Colton”) seeking a writ of mandate to require
the City of Compton to process the application without requiring the General
Plan Amendment, Zone Change, and Conditional Use Permit.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD  
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the
grounds for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from
judicially noticeable matters. (Code Civil Proc. § 430.30, subd. (a); Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “We assume the truth of the
allegations in the complaint, but do not assume the truth of contentions,
deductions, or conclusions of law.”  (California Logistics, Inc. v.
State (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.)  “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters.”  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  The
allegations in the petition must be liberally construed in favor of Petitioner
on demurrer.  (See Mobil Oil Corp. v
Exxon Corp. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 942, 947.)  “A demurrer must dispose of an entire
cause of action to be sustained.”  (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        Code of Civil Procedure section 1085
 
            Although
Petitioner does not specify whether it seeks relied under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1094.5 or 1085, it appears that Petitioner seeks relief under
the latter section,
which authorizes writ relief for “an[y] act which the law specially
enjoins.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
1085(a).)  There
are two essential requirements for an ordinary writ of mandate under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1085: (1) a clear, present, and ministerial duty on the
part of the respondent, and (2) a clear, present, and beneficial right on the
part of the petitioner to the performance of that duty. (California Ass’n for Health Services at Home
v. Department of Health Services (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 696, 704.)  “Generally, mandamus is available to compel a public agency’s
performance or to correct an agency’s abuse of discretion when the action being
compelled or corrected is ministerial.”  (AIDS
Healthcare Foundation v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Public Health (2011)
197 Cal.App.4th 693, 700.)  “A
ministerial act is an act that a public officer is required to perform in a
prescribed manner in obedience to the mandate of legal authority and without
regard to his or her own judgment or opinion concerning such act’s propriety or
impropriety, when a given state of facts exists.”  (Ibid.)
 
            B.        Ripeness
and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies   
 
            Respondents argue that this case is
not yet ripe because Petitioner has not submitted a full application.  “[A] basic prerequisite to judicial review of
administrative acts is the existence of a ripe controversy.”  (Pacific Legal Foundation v.
California Coastal Com. (1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 169, 188 Cal.Rptr. 104.)  “The ripeness doctrine is based upon the
recognition that judicial decisions are best made in the context of an actual
set of facts so that the issues will be framed with sufficient definiteness to
enable the court to make a decree finally disposing of the controversy.”  (Id. at p. 170.)  “The controversy must be definite and
concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal
interests. [Citation.] It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting
of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished
from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of
facts.”  (Id. at pp. 170–171.)  “A controversy is ‘ripe’ when it has reached,
but has not passed, the point that the facts have sufficiently congealed to
permit an intelligent and useful decision to be made.”  (Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group v. City
of San Jose (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 689, 708.)
 
            Similarly, a petitioner must exhaust
administrative remedies before seeking review by this court.  Exhaustion of administrative remedies is “a
jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial review.”  (Cal. Water Impact Network v. Newhall County Water Dist. (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 1464, 1489.) 
“The exhaustion requirement applies whether relief is sought
by traditional (Code Civ. Proc., § 1085) or
administrative (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5) mandamus.”  (Eight Unnamed Physicians v. Medical
Executive Com. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 503, 511.)  
 
            C.        Government
Code section 65941.1
 
            Government
Code section 65941.1 requires a developer to submit a formal development
application within 180 days after submitting a preliminary application for
development.  Specifically, subdivision
(d) of section 65941.1 provides, in relevant part:
 
(d)(1) Within 180
calendar days after submitting a preliminary application with all of the
information required by subdivision (a) to a city, county, or city and county,
the development proponent shall submit an application for a development project
that includes all of the information required to process the development
application consistent with Sections 65940, 65941, and 65941.5.
 
(2) If the public
agency determines that the application for the development project is not
complete pursuant to Section 65943, the development proponent shall submit
the specific information needed to complete the application within 90 days of
receiving the agency's written identification of the necessary information. If
the development proponent does not submit this information within the 90-day
period, then the preliminary application shall expire and have no further force
or effect.
 
(Gov. Code § 65941(d)(1) &
(2).)  
 
            D.        Analysis  
 
            This
dispute is not ripe.  In the first
amended petition, Petitioner alleges that it submitted a preliminary
application on June 22, 2023, and Respondent accepted the application on July
19, 2023.  (First Amended Petition ¶¶ 38,
50.)  Petitioner does not allege that it
submitted the full application within 180 days (and it is undisputed that
Petitioner did not do so).  Instead,
Petitioner relies on Delgadillo’s letter to argue that the City is refusing to
process the application without the General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, and Conditional
Use Permit.  That is not so.  The letter does not state that the
application will not be processed in the absence of these documents.  The court agrees with Respondent’s argument: 
 
“If Petitioner believes so strongly that Petitioner’s formal
application should be granted without the need for any other supporting
application or documents, then Petitioner could submit its formal application,
have the City render a final administrative decision, and if Petitioner is
dissatisfied with that decision, Petitioner would then be open to seeking a
writ of mandate from this Court.  At
bottom, there is no ripe controversy in the absence of a final administrative
decision from the City of the violation of a ministerial duty.”   
 
(Respondent’s Reply Brief, p. 4:19-24.)  This dispute is not ripe, and Petitioner has
not exhausted its administrative remedies, until Petitioner submits a full
application and the City of Compton refuses to process the application or
denies the application in violation of the law. 
Indeed, the court is concerned that it will not be able to resolve this
dispute effectively without an administrative record, i.e., understanding the
reasons why the City refuses to process or denies Petitioner’s full
application.  Therefore, the demurrer to
the first cause of action is sustained. 
The court also sustains the demurrer to the second and third causes of
action, which are derivative of the first cause of action.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Respondent’s demurrer is sustained.
 
            2.         The court denies leave to amend, as no
amendment would cure the defect in this case. 
 
            3.         This order shall not preclude
Petitioner from filing a new petition for writ of mandate if it submits a full
application and the City of Compton refuses to process the application or
denies the application in violation of law.
 
            4.         Either party may lodge a proposed
judgment if necessary.
 
            5.         Respondent’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of service with the court.
