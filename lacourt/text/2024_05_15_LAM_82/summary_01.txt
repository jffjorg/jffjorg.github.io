Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23STCP02754
* Hearing Date: May 15, 2024
* Department: 82
* Judge: Stephen I. Goorvitch

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Compton Property Group, LLC
* Defendant: City of Compton
* Related to Case: 23STCP02247

**Background**

* Petitioner filed a preliminary application for a residential project at 1601 W. El Segundo Blvd, Compton, CA
* Petitioner alleges that the City of Compton refused to accept the application
* Petitioner filed a second case seeking a writ of mandate to require the City to process the application without requiring additional documents

**Legal Standard**

* Demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading
* Allegations must be liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff

**Ripeness and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies**

* The dispute is not ripe until Petitioner submits a full application and the City of Compton refuses to process the application or denies it in violation of law
* Petitioner must exhaust administrative remedies before seeking review by the court

**Government Code Section 65941.1**

* Requires a developer to submit a formal development application within 180 days after submitting a preliminary application for development

**Analysis**

* The dispute is not ripe, as Petitioner has not submitted a full application
* Petitioner relies on a letter from the City's Senior Planner, which does not state that the application will not be processed in the absence of additional documents

**Order**

* Respondent's demurrer is sustained
* The court does not grant leave to amend, as no amendment would cure the defect in this case
* The court denies the petition for writ of mandate, but reserves the right for Petitioner to file a new petition if it submits a full application and the City refuses to process it or denies it in violation of law.
