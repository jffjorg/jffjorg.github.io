Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion filed by Homes by Millenium Inc. (HBM) requesting leave to file a cross-complaint against Rancho San Jose Manufactured Home Community, LLC, Rancho San Jose Covina LLC, Mark Wheeler, and Does 1-25. The cross-complaint alleges causes of action for breach of oral contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of implied covenant of merchantability, indemnity and contribution, and fraud and concealment.

The court finds that the motion is denied without prejudice because HBM failed to obtain the necessary leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint. The court notes that the proposed cross-complaint also includes Romuzga, who is not a party to the motion and has not requested leave to file the cross-complaint.

The court also finds that the facts of the case do not support a finding of bad faith, which would be necessary to deny the motion. Therefore, the court denies the motion without prejudice, allowing HBM to re-file the motion at a later date if necessary.
