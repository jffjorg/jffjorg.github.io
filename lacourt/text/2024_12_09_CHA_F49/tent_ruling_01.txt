Motion filed: 7/31/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Los Angeles Unified School
District
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Troy Betz
NOTICE: OK.¿¿¿ 
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order from this Court compelling
Defendant Troy Betz’s responses to all 86 unanswered deposition questions,
which he refused to answer by invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The motion is DENIED. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On November 30, 2022, Plaintiff
Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”), a former student at Arleta High School, initiated this
action seeking damages arising from an alleged sexual relationship with Troy Betz
(“Betz”), which commenced when she was a minor. Subsequently, on January 19,
2023, Plaintiff filed her operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against
Defendants Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”) and Betz, alleging the
following seven causes of action: (1) Sexual Battery/Abuse of a Minor (against
Betz and Does 1-10), (2) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (against
Betz and Does 21-30), (3) Negligent Hiring, Supervision & Retention of an
Unfit Employee (against LAUSD and Does 1-20), (4) Breach of Mandatory Duty:
Failure to Report Suspected Child Abuse (against LAUSD and Does 1-20), (5)
Negligent Failure to Warn, Train or Educate (against LAUSD and Does 1-20), (6)
Negligent Supervision of a Minor (against LAUSD and Does 1-20) and (7)
Negligence (against Does 31-50). 
 
On February 16, 2023, LAUSD filed
its Answer to the FAC. 
 
On April 3, 2023, a default was
entered by the Clerk against Betz. 
 
On June 25, 2024, the Court granted
Betz’s motion to quash LAUSD’s deposition subpoena seeking production of
documents. 
 
On July 31, 2024, LAUSD filed the
instant Motion to Compel Responses (the “Motion”) Subsequently, Betz filed his
Opposition on November 22, 2024, and LAUSD replied on December 2, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (a), “If a deponent fails to
answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing under the deponent' s control that is specified
in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery
may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.”  
 
Additionally, “This motion shall be made no later than 60 days after the
completion of the record of the deposition, and shall be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480,
subd. (b).)
 
A.   
Meet and Confer
 
The Court finds
that LAUSD has satisfied the meet and confer requirement. (See
Mot. at p. 2, Ex. “1.”)
            
B.    
Procedural Defects
 
Betz first contends that the Motion
should be denied due to multiple procedural defects. Specifically, Betz argues
that the Motion fails to comply with the requirements for a Separate Statement
under California Rules of Court rule 3.1345. He points out that the Separate
Statement uses the incorrect format; that it does not accurately state the text
of each response, answer or objection as required by California Rules of Court
3.1345(c)(2); that it does not provide any factual or legal reasons (Cal. Rules
of Court rule 3.1345(c)(3)); and that it fails to summarize relevant documents
(Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1345(c)(6.). 
 
Notably, Betz asserts that the Motion
contains other fatal defects, including that its Notice of Motion fails to
state the “grounds upon which it will be made” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010), and
that the declaration does not include the three exhibits it claims to attach.
Additionally, Betz states that the Motion’s Memorandum of Points and
Authorities fail to contain the correct law concerning the Fifth Amendment
issue.
 
Due to these above procedural defects,
Betz claims he was forced to do LAUSD’s work, including correcting the formatting
errors and providing the Court with factual context of the relevant proceedings
for evaluation. (Opp’n. at p. 11.)
 
In its Reply, LAUSD concedes to most of
the procedural defects but argues that these issues are not fatal. LAUSD admits
that the missing exhibits from the accompanying declaration were instead attached
to the Points and Authorities. (Reply at p. 4) Additionally, it contends that while
the wrong statute was cited in the Notice of Motion, the correct code section
is discussed in its Points and Authorities. (Reply at p. 4.) LAUSD also posits
that the Court may overlook the failure of a notice of motion to state a ground
for relief as the Court may treat the supporting papers as curing the defective
notice, citing Luri v. Greenwald (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1127 (Luri).
 
The Court observes that in Luri,
the plaintiff’s motion seeking discretionary relief under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473 failed to include a notice of motion. The Luri
court held that the trial court did not err by not treating the motion as
though plaintiff sought relief under the mandatory provision of § 473,
reasoning that “the trial court could reasonably have rejected the entire
motion as defective and noncompliant with California rules and statutes. The
trial court overlooked these defects and reviewed the documents submitted to
determine the specific basis upon which Luri sought relief, as permitted by Carrasco
v. Craft (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 796, 807-808.[]” (Luri, supra,
107 Cal.App.4th at p. 1127.)
 
Although the defect in the present
Notice of Motion is distinguishable from the complete absence of notice in Luri
case, the same principle applies: the Court may overlook the failure of a
notice to state a ground for relief if the supporting materials clearly
articulate the grounds upon which relief is sought. 
 
Applying this principle, the Court
concludes that while Betz has been prejudiced by the Motion’s formatting
errors, the correct specific ground for relief is clearly discussed and argued
in the accompanying papers. 
 
Accordingly, the Court, in its
discretion, proceeds to examine the Motion on its merits.
   
  
C.   
Fifth Amendment Privilege
 
The right not to bear witness
against oneself is enshrined in both the United States Constitution (Fifth
Amendment) and the California Constitution (Article 1, § 15). (People v.
Merfeld, 57 Cal.App.4th 1440, 1443 (1997).) The privilege
applies in any proceeding, civil or criminal. (United States v. Balsys (1998)
524 U.S. 666, 672; Kastigar v. United States (1972) 406 U.S. 441,
444-445; see also, Evid. Code, § 940.)
 
“Under cases of
the Supreme Court, there are four requirements that together trigger [the Fifth
Amendment self-incrimination] privilege: the information sought must be (i)
incriminating; (ii) personal to the defendant; (iii) obtained by compulsion;
and (iv) testimonial or communicative in nature.” (Izazaga v. Superior Court
(1991) 54 Cal.3d 356, 366 (Izazaga) [internal quotations omitted].)
“Statutorily mandated discovery of evidence that meets these four requirements
is prohibited. Conversely, discovery of evidence that does not meet each of
these requirements is not barred by the self-incrimination clause.” (Ibid.)

 
Once a person
claims the Fifth Amendment privilege, “the trial court must
undertake a particularized inquiry with respect to each specific claim of
privilege to determine whether the claimant has sustained his burden of
establishing that the testimony or other evidence sought might tend to
incriminate him.” (Warford v. Medeiros (1984) 160 Cal.App.3d
1035, 1045.) 
 
“Ultimately, a
trial court may reject an assertion of the privilege only when it appears to
the court perfectly clear, from a careful consideration of all the
circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer[s]
cannot possibly have such tendency to incriminate.” (People v. Trujeque (2015)
61 Cal.4th 227, 267 [internal quotations omitted].)

(LAUSD’s Separate Statement)
 
2)                 
Incriminating
Information
 
The information
sought need not be directly incriminatory. Rather, the information sought
is considered incriminating if the information might provide a link in the
chain of evidence of guilt (Hoffman v. United States (1951) 341 U.S.
479, 486 (Hoffman); People v. Lucas (1995) 12 Cal.4th 415, 454)
or might lead to incriminating evidence even though the information itself is
not inculpatory. (United States v. Hubbell (2000) 530 U.S. 27,
35-36.) The witness must have reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a
direct answer. (Hoffman, supra, at p. 486.)  A danger
of incrimination “of ‘imaginary and unsubstantial character’ will not
suffice. [Citation.]”  (Ohio v. Reiner (2001) 532 U.S. 17,
21.) 
 
In Zonver v.
Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 613 (Zonver),
the court addressed a claim of Fifth Amendment privilege in refusing to answer
inquiries into the claimants’ social and sexual relationship. It held that
information about the locations and times a married man, Mr. Zonver, had
visited his female bookkeeper could be a strong link in a chain of evidence
proving guilty of a variety of state misdemeanors and felonies, making
self-incrimination realistic. (Zonver, supra, 270 Cal.App.2d at
pp. 619-621.)  
 
Notably, the Zonver
court emphasized that it is “emphatically wrong” for the trial court to think
Mr. Zonver’s privilege in connection with possible prosecution under the
federal Mann Act was adequately protected by restricting its order to questions
related only to “activities within the State of California.” It reasoned that although
“activities within the State of California” are not directly related to
“interstate transportation”, a conduct proscribed in the Mann Act, they may
nevertheless be relevant to illuminate the purpose or opportunity in later
transportation, resulting in self-incrimination future charges based on the
possible Mann Act prosecution. (Id. at p. 619.)
 
Here, LAUSD
merely asserts that none of the above-listed questions bear on whether Betz
committed sexual misconduct against Plaintiff. However, LAUSD provides no further
explanation or legal analysis to support its argument. 
 
In his response, Betz
argues that these questions are barred by the Fifth Amendment as they could
require answers that forge links in a chain of facts imperiling Betz. (Opp’n.
at p. 18.) Specifically, Betz notes that he is the named defendant in the
present case and Plaintiff alleges that Betz was a teacher in a “position of
authority” at Plaintiff’s high school and Betz “used this position to gain
Plaintiff’s trust and friendship” so he could take advantage of Plaintiff
sexually. (Betz’s Separate Statement at p. 13.) Allegedly the misconduct took
place on and off school grounds, and through multiple forms of communication. Moreover,
Betz’s classroom door allegedly had a “Doctor Who” alien covering one of the
windows, obstructing the view inside. (Id. at p. 33.) Betz contends that
answering the deposition questions could forge a link in a chain of facts,
thereby implicating an opportunity to commit the alleged misconduct. 
 
Additionally,
Bets highlights that Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor are
not limited to Plaintiff herself. The FAC also alleges that Bets continued to
abuse “young children” and “engaging in repeated misconduct at LAUSD[.]”
(Betz’s Separate Statement at p. 13.) Bets argues that the deposition questions
open the door to inquiries about his Betz’s educational background, including
when and how Betz obtained his teaching credentials, and thereby gained the
opportunity and ability to alleged “groom” and “condition” Plaintiff and
allegedly other minors to have sexual relationship with him. (Id. at p.
14.)
 
The Court finds
the reasoning in Zonver regarding the Fifth Amendment privilege, as
applied to the discovery of social and sexual relationship involving the
claimant, directly in point. 
 
The deposition
questions concern the following topics: (1) Betz’s work experience and
education related to his employment with LAUSD (Question Nos. 1-6, 10-13, 16,
19-20, 23, 27-33, 43, 54-58, 60-67, 84-86), (2) Betz’ use of social media or communication
methods (Questions Nos. 7-9, 34, 38, 50, 59, 81-83), (3) Betz’s knowledge of
and relationship with Plaintiff during both minor and adult (Question Nos.
14-15, 24-26, 35-36, 39-40, 44, 51-53, 68-80), (4) Betz’s residence (Question
Nos. 17-18, 21), (5) Betz’s knowledge and relationship with other female
students (Question Nos. 22, 41-42, 45-49).
 
After carefully considering all of the
circumstances in the case and each claim of privilege invoked by Betz, the
Court finds that the information sought by each individual questions may serve
a link to a potential criminal prosecution under state sex statutes, including
“evidence tending to establish motive, desire or opportunity to engage in the
conduct proscribed.” Consequently, the Court finds Betz’s argument persuasive.
(See People v. Trujeque, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 267.) 
 
Accordingly, the
Court concludes that the first requirement in Izazaga is satisfied,
finding the information sought by LAUSD’s subpoena questions is incriminating.
 
3)                 
Personal to Betz
 
“The Fifth Amendment privilege ...
being personal to the defendant, does not extend to the testimony or statements
of third parties called as witness at trial.” (United States v. Nobles
(1975) 422 U.S. 225, 234.)
 
            Here,
it is uncontested that Betz is the named defendant in the case alleging sexual
misconduct. Therefore, Betz may personally be subject to possible criminal
prosecution. 
 
            Accordingly,
the second Izazaga requirement is met.
 
4)                 
Obtained by
Compulsion
 
The Court
reiterates that “[t]he constitutional guarantee against compelled
self-incrimination protects an individual from being forced to testify
against himself or herself in a pending [] proceeding ... ‘civil or
criminal, formal or informal,’ where he or she reasonably believes the answers
might incriminate him or her in a criminal case. [Citations.]” (Oiye v. Fox
(2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1036, 1052.) (Underlines added.) “[a]
party may claim the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination where to
disclose [] information might lead to prosecution under [certain]
statutes.” (In re Marriage of Sachs (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1144, 1156.)
(Underlines added.)
 
However, the
privilege “cannot be maintained in relation to ‘records required by law to be
kept in order that there may be suitable information of transactions which are
the appropriate subjects of governmental regulation and the enforcement of
restrictions validly established.’” (Shapiro v. United States (1948) 335
U.S. 1, 633 (Shapiro).)
 
Here, it is evident
that the testimony compelled by a deposition subpoena falls within the scope of
“disclose information” and “testify” that the Fifth Amendment privilege
protects against self-incrimination. (See Oiye v. Fox, supra, 211
Cal.App.4th at p. 1052; In re Marriage of Sachs, supra, 95
Cal.App.4th at p.1156.)
 
Based on the
above, the Court concludes that this part of the Izazaga test is also
satisfied. 
 
5)                 
Testimonial or
Communicative in Nature
 
It is clear that the Fifth
Amendment does not independently proscribe the compelled production of every
sort of incriminating evidence but “applies only when the accused is compelled
to make a Testimonial Communication that is incriminating.” (Fisher
v. U.S. (1976) 425 U.S. 391, 408 (Fisher).) “[W]e leave
intact the firmly established precedents that hold the self-incrimination
privilege inapplicable to, and allow mandatory production of, nontestimonial
evidence such as fingerprints, blood samples, breath samples, appearances in
lineups, and handwriting and voice exemplars.” (People v. Collie (1981)
30 Cal.3d 43, 55, fn. 7)
 
It is undisputed that testimony and
answers compelled by deposition subpoena are testimonial or communicative in
nature. 
 
Therefore, the Court’s analysis of
the four-part requirements under Izazaga leads to the conclusion that Betz’s
claim of Fifth Amendment privilege is justified.
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES the Motion. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District’s Motion to
Compel Defendant Troy Betz’s Responses to Deposition Questions is DENIED. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
