SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Rosa L. Munguia
Rodriguez; Breanna Munguia-Sena (Suing By Her Guardian Ad Litem, Rosa L.
Munguia Rodriguez); Alaina Sena (Suing By Her Guardian Ad Litem, Rosa L.
Munguia Rodriguez); Suryah Martinez (Suing By Her Guardian Ad Litem, Rosa L.
Munguia Rodriguez); and Sonic Martinez’s (Suing By Her Guardian Ad Litem, Rosa
L. Munguia Rodriguez) (collectively, Plaintiffs) tenancy in an apartment in a
multi-unit complex owned and/or managed by Defendant Peter Coeler dba P.A.C. Properties
(Defendant).
 
On 2/21/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendant for: (1) Violation of Civil Code 1942.4; (2) Tortious Breach of the
Warranty of Habitability; (3) Private Nuisance; (4) Business & Professions
Code 17200, et seq. and (5) Negligence. 
After the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the original complaint
with leave to amend, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint alleging
the same five causes of action as in their original complaint.  A demurrer and motion to strike as to the
First Amended Complaint are currently scheduled for hearing on 4/3/24.  
 
On 7/14/23, Defendant served each Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories, Set 1.  (Dunkel Decl.,
Ex.A-1 – A-5).  After receiving
extensions of time to respond, responses were ultimately due on 8/29/23.  (Id., Ex.B, C).  Plaintiffs did not serve responses by the
agreed upon deadline and, unilaterally, decided that they would respond by
9/5/23.  (Id. Ex.C, D).  Plaintiffs failed to serve any responses,
despite Defendant’s reminder.  (Id.,
Ex.D, E).
 
On 9/29/23, Defendant filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order compelling Plaintiffs Rosa L. Munguia Rodriguez; Breanna
Munguia-Sena (Suing By Her Guardian Ad Litem, Rosa L. Munguia Rodriguez);
Alaina Sena (Suing By Her Guardian Ad Litem, Rosa L. Munguia Rodriguez); Suryah
Martinez (Suing By Her Guardian Ad Litem, Rosa L. Munguia Rodriguez); and Sonic
Martinez (Suing By Her Guardian Ad Litem, Rosa L. Munguia Rodriguez) to respond
to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set 1. 
Additionally, Defendant requests an order imposing sanctions on
Plaintiff Rosa Rodriguez, individually and as Guardian
Ad Litem and Plaintiffs’ counsel in the amount of $1,600.00.  Plaintiffs have not opposed or otherwise
responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Due to Plaintiffs’ failure to serve responses to the
subject Form Interrogatories, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling
responses without objections.  CCP
2030.290(a), (b). 
 
Additionally, Defendant is entitled to sanctions in the
amount of $1,050.00 (2.6 hours to prepare the motion + 1 hour to appear at the
hearing multiplied by $275/hour + $60.00 filing fee) against Plaintiff Rosa
Rodriguez, individually and as Guardian Ad Litem and against Plaintiffs’
counsel for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations.  CCP 2023.010(d); CCP 2023.030(a); CCP
2030.290(c); (Dunkel Decl. ¶8).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Responses, without objections, are due and sanctions are payable within
30 days.
