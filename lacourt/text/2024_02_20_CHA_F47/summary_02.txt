**Tentative Ruling**

In this case, the Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, K-W Properties, against the plaintiffs, David Tchakerian, Alice Tchakerian (an adult), Mariam Hovannisyan, April Tchakerian, and Alice Tchakerian (a minor).

**Facts**

The plaintiffs are seeking damages for alleged breaches of contract, covenant of quiet enjoyment, warranty of habitability, negligence, negligent maintenance of premises, nuisance, and common law fraud. However, the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to state these claims.

**Analysis**

The Judge has found that the plaintiffs have failed to allege a contractual relationship with K-W Properties, which is necessary for the first, second, and third causes of action. Additionally, the plaintiffs have failed to allege any facts showing K-W Properties owed them any duty or committed any wrongful conduct.

**Conclusion**

The demurrer is sustained, and the plaintiffs are given 30 days to amend their complaint. The motion to strike is placed off calendar as moot due to the ruling on the demurrer.
