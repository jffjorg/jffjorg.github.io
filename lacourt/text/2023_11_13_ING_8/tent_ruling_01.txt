Esphorst vs Hicks and Ming, BC700634  Motions in Limine for Trial


















MIL No.
Subject of Motion
Tentative
Brief Discussion



 
 
 
 



¶-1
To Bar Def from
  disputing Liability
Grant
Unopposed,
  but Order should be to prevent dispute of fault and causation, not to bar
  evid of other causes.  Hicks admits in
  MIL 3 at p. 2:4-6 that liability is deemed admitted



¶-2
To Exclude Evid of
  Go Fund Me Donations
Grant.  Why should Def benefit from charity pd by
  non-parties?
Collateral
  source rule argued. Opp notes Go Fund Me is POST-accident, not like insur
  before an accident.  CACI 3926
  Settlement Deduction advises jury not to consider amt PL received from
  settlement with other PARTIES, but does not speak to charitable
  contributions  Caselaw and CCP 877 says
  the COURT, not jury, makes the deduction. 
  But neither shall PLs present evid that they are living hand-to-mouth,
  are destitute, etc.  Jury should
  calculate damages from econ damages and factors in CACI 3921 / 3922 on WD
  non-econ award, rather than on largess of others



¶-3
To
  exclude evidence of settlement with other Defs, and to remove names of other
  Defs from caption
Ditto,
  unless settling Def is trial wit
N0
  law cited by Def that permits jury to hear amt of settlement with other
  parties.  Is any settling Def
  testifying, and if so is settlement potential evid of bias by that party
  under Shepherd v Walley (1972) 28 CA3d 1079, 1082 fn. 2?



¶-4
T
  exclude evid of PLs' victim impact statements made in criminal case (PL
  expressed forgiveness towards Ming but not Hicks)
Grant  
Unopposed



¶-5
Exclude
  or limit Def police practices expert Curtis Cope
Discuss
Unopposed,
  but won't parties ask for allocation of non-econ damages per Prop 51, and
  seek a higher % or liab as to the County for 911 call operator asking Ming to
  get license number from fleeing Hicks? 
  Doesn't PL have a police practices expert too?



¶-6
Exclude
  evid that Decedent did not use a seat belt
Grant
Unopposed.  No biomechanics expert designated.  Note, in MIL pg. 4:18, PL argues Truman vs
  Vargas is the "Seminole" case in this area . . . .  Motion attaches depo of Julie re coroner
  noting marks on chest, and autopsy diagram showing clavicle fracture,
  arguably from seat belt.  Does PL have
  biomechanic who opined on this?

















¿ Ming-1
To Bifurcate
  Liab and Compensatory damages
Deny
Judge Hill
  previously denied this motion, and no material change in facts since then for
  Ct to make required finding under CCP 598 to bifurcate



¿ Ming-2
To
  permit Ming's remote attendance at trial 
Grant,
  but must attend by video, not audio
Unopposed.  Discussed in part at FSC, PL not willing to
  stip to depo passages and Ct will accommodate Def's unavailability per good
  cause showing under CRC 3.672(j)



¿ Ming-3
To
  exclude evid of other lawsuits, including fraudulent transfer suit
Grant,
  but must attend by video, not audio
Unopposed 



¿ Ming-4
To
  exclude evid of health and later death of Cody, Jessie Jr.'s younger brother
Deny
Evidence
  of Cody's cancer and death raises 352 balancing, but the Court will admonish
  jury per CACI 100 and 5000 not to base any decision on sympathy.  Court will allow evidence that Plaintiffs
  still have 2 other children to mitigate potential "only child"
  prejudice 



¿ Ming-5
To
  exclude comments by Hicks' mother at criminal sentencing
Grant  
Unopposed



¿ Ming-6
Reptile
  Theory / Golden Rule, during 1st phase of bifurcated trial
Grant
  in part, rest Deny w/o prejudice
The
  Ct will order both sides NOT to ARGUE during Voir Dire or Mini Openings nor
  full Opening statements.   As for
  specific Voir Dire Qs, Ct will rule on objections if, as, and when raised.  Closing argument cannot be ruled on
  prospectively or in vacuum

















¿ Hicks-1
To exclude
  mention of Dollar amount in Voir Dire or Opeing Statement
Grant in part
Discussed with
  counsel at FSC; dollar amounts for NON-ECONOMIC damages not allowed in Voir
  Dire or Openings  or Mini Openings, but
  ok to discuss amt of economic damages



¿ Hicks-2
To
  exclude cumulative testimony, photos 
  etc.
Deny
  w/p Prejudice
Motion
  fails to ID which witness, which exhibit, which photo is
  "cumulative"  Court will rule
  on objections if, as, and when raised during trial or after certain number of
  photos or witnesses have been admitted and offer of proof is made as to
  additional exhibits or witnesses.  PL
  runs risks of over-selling case or parading excessive witnesses or exhibits
  on the same point, and DEF might opt to refrain from objecting as matter of
  trial strategy



¿ Hicks-3
To
  exclude evidence of brown liquid in Hicks' car, had suspended license, and
  claim of hit and run after contracting Esphorst vehicle
Grant
  at 1st phase of bifurcated trial
Unopposed.  Unclear from motion if brown liquid was
  determined to be alcohol, and unclear if "hit and run" was charged
  or was subject of conviction



¿ Hicks-4
To
  exclude evid of Hicks' phone searches and private messages
Grant
  at 1st phase of bifurcated trial
Unopposed  



¿ Hicks-5
To
  exclude media coverage
Discuss
Unopposed,
  but voir dire usually inquires if any members of venire have heard of or read
  about the facts of the case.  If so,
  the Court intends to sequester those jurors from others to enable questioning
  without tainting others



¿ Hicks-6
To
  exclude reference to Hicks' criminal file
Discuss
Unopposed,
  but does this MIL seek to exclude mention of Hicks' manslaughter
  conviction?
