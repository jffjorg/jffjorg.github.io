And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in limine filed by the parties. The ruling grants several motions, including one to exclude evidence of Go Fund Me donations, settlement with other defendants, and victim impact statements made in a previous criminal case. The ruling also denies several motions, including one to bifurcate liability and compensatory damages, and one to exclude evidence of other lawsuits.

The judge also addresses several issues, including the admissibility of evidence of a seat belt, the use of a police practices expert, and the introduction of evidence of a defendant's criminal record. The ruling notes that the court will allow evidence of a plaintiff's two other children to mitigate potential "only child" prejudice.

The judge also orders both sides not to argue during voir dire or opening statements, and will rule on objections if, as, and when raised. The ruling notes that the court will admonish the jury not to base any decision on sympathy, and will allow evidence that the plaintiffs still have two other children to mitigate potential "only child" prejudice.
