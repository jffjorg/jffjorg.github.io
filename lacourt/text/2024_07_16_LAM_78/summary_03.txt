And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge, Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike certain paragraphs from the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Narek Vardanyan against Defendant Christopher Mandalian. The motion to strike was filed by Defendant, who argues that the judge's commentary at a prior restraining order hearing is irrelevant and that Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages.

The Judge agrees with Defendant that the judge's commentary is not relevant and grants the motion to strike paragraphs 15 and 16 of the FAC. The Judge also finds that the FAC allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages and that Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to demonstrate that Defendant's conduct rose to the level of despicable conduct.

The Judge grants the motion to strike paragraphs 15, 16, 21, 30, 34, 35, and paragraph 3 on page 7 of the FAC without leave to amend. The Court also encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement before the hearing date.
