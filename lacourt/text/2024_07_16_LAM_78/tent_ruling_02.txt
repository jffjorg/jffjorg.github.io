 Case Number:  23STCV05937    Hearing Date:   July 16, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ JOSE HERNANDEZ, Plaintiff(s), vs. STRUCTURAL CONCRETE GROUP, INC., et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 23STCV05937 Hearing Date:¿ July 16, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED FROM DEEMED ADMISSIONS  I.  BACKGROUND Plaintiff Jose Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Structural Concrete Group, Inc. (“SCG”), Ismael Gutierrez, and Does 1 through 20 for (1) disability discrimination, (2) hostile work environment based on sex, (3) sexual discrimination, and (4) battery. On May 15, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for an order deeming his Requests for Admissions (“RFAs”), set one, against SCG and imposing monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,660. (Min. Order, May 15, 2024.) On May 29, 2024, SCG filed the instant amended motion to be relieved from the deemed admissions pursuant to CCP §§02033.300(a) and 473(b). SCG argues its counsel failed to serve code-compliant responses prior to the May 15, 2024 hearing date because of a lack of client communication, and the belief that a withdrawal as counsel would be heard in advance to provide an explanation as to why discovery had not been served. Defense counsel argues that they mistakenly and inadvertently calendared all of Plaintiff’s motions for July 3, 2024, and overlooked that the motion was set for May 15, 2024. Defense counsel declares that he served responses in the later afternoon of May 15, 2024, and that verifications were subsequently served on May 17, 2024. SCG further asserts that Plaintiff will not be prejudiced because responses were served, and SCG sent payment in the amount of $1,660. In opposition, Plaintiff argues that SCG concedes the RFAs, set one, were served on August 31, 2023, and that they were due on November 3, 2023. Plaintiff argues the breakdown in communication between defense counsel and SCG is not mistake, inadvertence, nor excusable neglect, and further argues that CCP § 2033.300 does not apply. Plaintiff asserts that SCG knew back in November 2023 of the due responses, and that Plaintiff lost eight months of not receiving SCG’s responses.  In reply, SCG reiterates that they lost contact with their client, there was mistake and inadvertence in calendaring the hearing, that discretionary relief is appropriate, and that Plaintiff will not be prejudiced.  II.  LEGAL STANDARD A party may withdraw or amend an admission made in response to a request for admission only on leave of court granted after notice to all parties. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.300, subd. (a).) The court may permit the withdrawal only if it determines the admission was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and the party who obtained the admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party’s action or defense on the merits.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.300, subd. (b).) The “mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect” under CCP § 2033.300 have similar meanings as those words used in CCP § 473(b). (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1419.) “Because the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 2033.300 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief. Accordingly, the court's discretion to deny a motion under the statute is limited to circumstances where it is clear that the mistake, inadvertence, or¿neglect was inexcusable, or where it is clear that the withdrawal or amendment would not substantially prejudice the party who obtained the admission in maintaining that party's action or defense on the merits.” (New Albertsons, Inc., supra, 168 Cal.App.4th at 1420–21.)  III.  DISCUSSION¿ Statutory Relief Available SCG moves under both CCP § 2033.300 and CCP § 473(b). Plaintiff argues that CCP § 2033.300 is inapplicable, and that the mandatory relief provision of CCP § 473(b) is not available. Contrary to Plaintiff’s assertion, CCP § 2033.300 does apply to deemed admissions. (See Wilcox v. Birthwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 983.) However, the Court agrees that the mandatory relief provision under CCP § 473(b) is not available here. In providing for mandatory relief, “the Legislature created a narrow exception to the discretionary relief provision for default judgments and dismissals.” (Huh v. Wang (2007) 158 Cal. App. 4th 1406, 1414.) “By its express terms, the mandatory relief provision applies only to defaults, default judgments, and dismissals.” (Id. at 1415.) The issue here does not involve a default, default judgment, nor dismissal, and SCG appears to acknowledge the narrowness of the mandatory relief provision. The Court is not persuaded by SCG’s contention that deemed admissions is equivalent to a procedural certainty of a default judgment, nor does SCG provide any authority in support of this contention. Here, CCP § 2033.300’s language explicitly provides relief from deemed admissions for mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, which is analogous to the discretionary relief provision in CCP § 473(b).  In contrast to the mandatory provision of section 473(b), “discretionary relief under the statute is not limited to defaults, default judgments, and dismissals....” because it applies to any “judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding.” (Id. at 1419.) The failure of counsel to meet a procedural deadline and counsel's failure to timely respond to a request for admissions are proper subjects for discretionary relief under the statute allowing relief from judgment for mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (Huh, supra, 158 Cal. App. 4th at 1419.) The Court need not reach Plaintiff’s contention that SCG should have brought the motion under CCP § 2033.280 instead. Thus, SCG must demonstrate mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  Mistake, Inadvertence, or Excusable Neglect The discretionary relief provision of the statute authorizing relief from a proceeding taken against a party through neglect only permits relief from attorney error fairly imputable to the client. (Comunidad en Accion v. Los Angeles City Council (2013) 219 Cal. App. 4th 1116, 1132.) "In determining whether the attorney's mistake or inadvertence was excusable, ‘the court inquires whether “a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances” might have made the same error.[’]" (Ibid.) Here, defense counsel declares that his office calendared all four of Plaintiff’s discovery motions for July 3, 2024, and that his office mistakenly did not correctly calendar the motion regarding Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission to be Deemed Admitted for May 15, 2024. (Soleimanpour ¶¶ 3-4.) Generally, excusable neglect and a basis for relief has been found where an attorney relies on an employee or calendaring system to calendar deadlines, and the employee or system fails. (Renteria v. Juvenile Justice, Dept. of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2006) 135 Cal. App. 4th 903, 911.) “Courts have found excusable neglect warranting relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 when an associate attorney misinterpreted the instructions of the lead attorney and gave incorrect information at a hearing [Citation] and an attorney's secretary lost the answer to be filed [Citation]; see also 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, § 167, pp. 671–673 [“A number of cases deal with the realities of office practice, including the inevitable misfiling of papers or erroneous clerical entries, and usually this neglect is considered excusable”] ).” (Ibid.) Plaintiff argues that SCG should have served discovery earlier, and that the breakdown in communication between SCG and its counsel is not mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Indeed, it is undisputed that responses were due in November 2023. However, the Civil Discovery Act places the burden on propounding party to take affirmative steps in deeming RFAs admitted, and also allows responding party to serve before the hearing on the motion a proposed response that is substantial compliance with section 2033.220. (CCP §2033.280; see also St. Mary v. Superior Ct. (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 762, 776.) The Court agrees that SCG should have served timely responses. However, Plaintiff also waited until March 7, 2024, approximately four months after responses were due to seek relief by having the RFAs, set one, be deemed admitted against SCG. The Court is not persuaded that Plaintiff has been greatly prejudiced by the lost time in receiving responses for him to “narrowly tailor what remaining discovery is needed before the upcoming trial on October 21, 2024” when part of the delay is also on Plaintiff in not seeking relief earlier. Further, SCG served belated responses in the afternoon of the same day of the May 16, 2024 hearing date, with verifications following two days later. Plaintiff does not argue that the responses were not in substantial compliance with section 2033.220. Further, the monetary sanctions have been paid in full to compensate Plaintiff for the time and effort expended in bringing the motion. Plaintiff was placed in the same position he should have been had SCG served prior to the hearing, but with a two-day delay. A two-day delay is not prejudicial. Further, it is “[t]he policy of the law is to have every litigated cause tried on its merits; and it looks with disfavor on a party who, regardless of the merits of his cause, attempts to take advantage of the mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or neglect of his adversary.” (Reed v. Williamson (1960) 185 Cal. App. 2d 244, 24.) Due to the liberal construction of section 473 relief for mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect and its remedial nature, the Court resolves any doubts in favor of its application.  IV. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, SCG’s motion to be relieved from deemed admissions is GRANTED.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: July 15, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
