And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Structural Concrete Group, Inc. (SCG) to be relieved from deemed admissions. SCG failed to serve code-compliant responses prior to the May 15, 2024 hearing date, and defense counsel mistakenly calendared all of Plaintiff's motions for July 3, 2024. SCG served belated responses in the afternoon of the same day of the May 16, 2024 hearing date, with verifications following two days later. The judge finds that SCG's neglect was excusable, and that Plaintiff has not been prejudiced by SCG's delay. The judge resolves any doubts in favor of applying the relief and grants the motion.
