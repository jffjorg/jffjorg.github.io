Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Imran Khan, dismissing the defendant, Michael R. "Harry-O" Harris's demurrer to the complaint. The plaintiff alleges breach of contract, unjust enrichment, conversion, and fraudulent inducement against the defendants. The judge finds that the plaintiff's claims are sufficient to state a cause of action and that the defendants' demurrer is without merit. The judge also finds that the doctrine of unjust enrichment is cognizable in California under certain circumstances, and that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for unjust enrichment. The judge notes that the parties have not met and conferred as required by law, but does not sustain the demurrer on this ground. The judge orders the defendants to provide notice of the ruling.
