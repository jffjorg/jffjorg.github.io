And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Lakos Corporation's motion to continue the trial date and pretrial discovery cut-off dates by 12 months. The motion was unopposed and the judge found that Lakos and Watertronics, LLC, the other party, have not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial. The judge also considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, and found that the continuance was warranted to enable the parties to conduct discovery and file dispositive motions prior to trial. The trial date is now set for May 5, 2025, and the Final Status Conference is continued to April 18, 2025. The parties are required to meet and confer and file a joint report regarding discovery, ADR, and motion practice.
