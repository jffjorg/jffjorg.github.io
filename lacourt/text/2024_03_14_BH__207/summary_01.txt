  - "A sealing order must be sought by means of a motion (or application) and accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities, as well as evidence and testimony containing facts sufficient to justify the mandatory findings required to support a sealing order."
  - "To grant a motion to seal, a trial court must expressly find that: (1) an overriding interest exists that overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) the overriding interest supports sealing the records; (3) a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest."

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Michael E. Whitaker, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to seal portions of Exhibits 3, 4, and 35 containing confidential and proprietary fee schedule information submitted by Blue Shield of California and Blue Shield of California Life and Health Insurance Company. The motion is unopposed. The Judge finds that Blue Shield's overriding interest in protecting its confidential and proprietary information overrides the public's right of access to the information and supports sealing the record. The Judge orders the continued hearing on March 28, 2024, to permit Blue Shield to conditionally lodge the unredacted documents with the Court as required by California Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(4).
