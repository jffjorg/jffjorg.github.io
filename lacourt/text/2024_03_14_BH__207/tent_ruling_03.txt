MOTION
 
            Plaintiff Angela Shalome Streat
Wilson (“Plaintiff”) filed the original complaint, alleging causes of action
for elder abuse and negligence against Defendant The Regents of the University
of California (“Defendant.”)  The Court
sustained Defendant’s demurrer to the elder abuse cause of action on the basis
that Plaintiff failed to allege (1) that Defendant knowingly, chronically
understaffed its hospital below the minimum nurse-to-patient ratios or (2) that
Plaintiff suffered any harm or damage as a result of Defendant’s alleged
neglect.  (December 15, 2023 Minute
Order.)
 
Plaintiff now moves for leave to amend the complaint to add a cause of
action for dependent adult abuse (pursuant to the Elder Abuse and Dependent
Adult Civil Prosecution Act) of Welfare and Institutions Code sections 15600,
et seq., and requests for punitive and exemplary damages, treble damages, and
attorneys’ fees and costs.  
 
Defendant opposes the motion and Plaintiff replies.    
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Amendments
to Pleadings: General Provisions
 
            Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and
on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or
proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may,
upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may
likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.”
 
            To wit, without notice to the other
party the Court has wide discretion to allow either party (i) to add or strike
the name of a party or (ii) to correct a mistake in the name of a party or a
mistake in any other respect “in furtherance of justice” and “on any terms as
may be proper.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); see also Marriage
of Liss (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1429.) Alternatively, after notice to
the other party, the Court has wide discretion to allow either party to amend
pleadings “upon any terms as may be just.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1). Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure section 576 states “Any judge,
at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of
justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any
pleading or pretrial conference order.”
 
            Judicial policy favors resolution of
all disputed matters between the parties and, therefore, leave to amend is
liberally granted. (Berman vs. Bromberg (1986) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945; Hirsa
v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 488-489 [this has been an
established policy in California since 1901] (citing Frost v. Whitter
(1901) 132 Cal. 421, 424; Thomas v. Bruza (1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 150,
155).) The Court of Appeal in Morgan v. Superior Court held “If the
motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not
prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and
where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert
a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error
but an abuse of discretion.” (Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527, 530, citations omitted.) Moreover, “it is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where the opposing party was
not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [opposing party did not
establish harm by the delay in moving to amend the complaint].)
 
            “The court may grant leave to amend the
pleadings at any stage of the action.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 6:636 (hereafter Weil
& Brown).) Denial of a motion to amend is rarely justified if the motion is
timely made and granting the motion will not prejudice the opposing party. (Id.
at ¶ 6:639, citations omitted.) However, if the party seeking the amendment has
been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the opposing party, the judge has
discretion to deny leave to amend. (Id. at ¶ 6:655, citations omitted.
Absent prejudice, any claimed delay alone is not grounds for denial. “If the
delay in seeking the amendment has not misled or prejudiced the other side, the
liberal policy of allowing amendments prevails. Indeed, it is an abuse of
discretion to deny leave in such a case even if sought as late as the time of
trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:653 (citing Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565).) “Prejudice exists where the amendment would result
in a delay of trial, along with loss of critical evidence, added costs of
preparation, increased burden of discovery, etc. . . . But the fact that the
amendment involves a change in legal theory which would make admissible
evidence damaging to the opposing party is not the kind of prejudice the court
will consider.” (Weil & Brown, supra, at ¶ 6:656, citations
omitted.)
 
            “Even if some prejudice is shown,
the judge may still permit the amendment but impose conditions, as the Court is
authorized to grant leave ‘on such terms as may be proper.’” (Weil &
Brown, supra, at ¶ 6:663, citation omitted.) For example, the court
may cause the party seeking the amendment to pay the costs and fees incurred in
preparing for trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:664 (citing Fuller v. Vista Del
Arroyo Hotel, 42 Cal.App.2d 400, 404).)
 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324: Procedural Requirements
 
            Pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(a), a motion to amend a pleading before trial must:
 
“(1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment or
amended pleadings, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from
previous pleadings or amendments;
(2) state what allegations in the previous
pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and
line number, the deleted allegations are located; and
(3) State what allegations are proposed to be
added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line
number, the additional allegations are located.”
 
            In addition, under Rule 3.1324(b), a
motion to amend a pleading before trial must be accompanied by a separate
declaration that specifies the following:
 
“(1) the effect of the amendment;
(2) why the amendment is necessary and proper;
(3) when the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and
(4) the reasons why the request for amendment was
not made earlier.”
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff has provided a copy of the
proposed amended complaint, with the new allegations bolded to differentiate
them from existing allegations. 
Moreover, Plaintiff has provided an attorney declaration indicating “the
purpose of the proposed amendment is to add a cause of action for Dependent
Adult Abuse (pursuant to the Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Prosecution
Act – Welfare and Institutions Code §§ 15600, et seq.) to the Negligence
Complaint.”  (Garcia Decl. ¶ 5.)
 
            The declaration further explains
that Plaintiff did not receive any of Plaintiff’s hospital records until
November 20, 2023, one hundred and one days after propounding the request, and
that Defendant’s deposition, which was originally noticed on October 18, 2023,
finally took place on December 15, 2023.            (Garcia
Decl. ¶¶ 7, 10.)  Plaintiff has been
otherwise unsuccessful in obtaining documents that were requested in connection
with the deposition or supplemental responses to written discovery, despite an
Informal Discovery Conference being held on February 7, 2024.  (Garcia Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9, 11.)  Thus, although Plaintiff’s declaration does
not state why the amendment was not made sooner, it paints a picture that
Plaintiff has been and continues actively attempting to obtain discovery.
 
            However, the declaration does not
specify what new facts were discovered, when those new facts were discovered,
or why the amendment is necessary and proper. 
Instead, Plaintiff focuses much of the motion and declaration on
discovery Plaintiff has not obtained, rather than what new facts were
discovered that support the proposed amendments.  (See Garcia Decl. ¶¶ 8-10.)  
 
For example, although Plaintiff has included segments of Defendant’s
deposition testimony concerning staffing protocols, it appears the provided testimony
undermines, rather than supports Plaintiff’s allegations of understaffing.  (See Ex. 6 at pp. 13:14-15:6; 16:18-25;
17:7-10 [demonstrating the hospital has written nursing policies to ensure adequate
patient care]; pp. 22:10-25; 23:23-25; 24:25-26:2; 28:16-29:3; 33:17-25:17;
27:3-15; 44:9-45:5; 46:1-23; [the hospital has numerous timekeeping, staffing,
and patient assignment systems]; pp. 33:2-34:25 [the hospital has more nurse
hours staffed than its target goal]; pp. 52:2-55:19 [the hospital considers prospective
nurses’ education, experience and training and conducts license and background
checks when hiring and documents work through written performance reviews and a
formal disciplinary system].)  
 
Furthermore, although Plaintiff explains Plaintiff’s medical records were
not received until November 20, 2023, it is unclear what facts were learned from
these medical records that either support Plaintiff’s assertion that Defendant
chronically understaffed its hospital or otherwise demonstrate Defendant’s
intent to harm Plaintiff to support Plaintiff’s proposed elder abuse claim and
requests for punitive and exemplary damages and attorneys’ fees.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Therefore, the Court denies without
prejudice Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend for failure to comply with the
procedural requirements of Rule 3.1324(b).
 
            The Court orders Plaintiff to
provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service of such.
