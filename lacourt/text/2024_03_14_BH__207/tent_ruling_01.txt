MOTION
 
            Defendants,
Cross-Complainants and Plaintiffs California Physicians’ Service dba Blue
Shield of California and Blue Shield of California Life and Health Insurance
Company (“Blue Shield”) move to seal portions of Exhibits 3, 4, and 35 containing
or referencing Blue Shield’s confidential and proprietary fee schedule
information with regard to the CPT codes at issue.  Blue Shield’s motion is unopposed.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
Unless confidentiality is required
by law, court records are presumed to be open to the public, pursuant to a
potent “open court” policy undergirded by the First Amendment and favoring the
public nature of court proceedings.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(c); see NBC
Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court¿(1999)¿20 Cal.4th 1178, 1199-1110.)¿
Consequently, pleadings, motions, discovery documents, and other papers may not
be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties; filing under seal requires
a court order.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(a); see¿H.B. Fuller Co. v.
Doe¿(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 888.)¿
 
A sealing order must be sought by
means of a motion (or application) and accompanied by a memorandum of points
and authorities, as well as evidence and testimony containing facts sufficient
to justify the mandatory findings required to support a sealing order.¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rules 2.550(d) & 2.551(b).)¿ The proponent of the sealing
order must also conditionally lodge the¿unredacted¿matter to be sealed with the
court.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(4).)¿
 
To grant a motion to seal, a trial
court must expressly find that: (1) an overriding interest exists that
overcomes the right of public access to the record; (2) the overriding interest
supports sealing the records; (3) a substantial probability exists that the
overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) the
proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) no¿less restrictive means exist
to achieve the overriding interest.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550 (d).) “If
the trial court fails to make the required findings, the order is deficient and
cannot support sealing.” (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 471, 487; see also In re Marriage of Tamir (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 1068, 1087 [“express findings must be made to seal records”].)
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Blue Shield
seeks to redact and seal its confidential and proprietary fee schedule
information included in Exhibits 3, 4, and 35 that Blue Shield submitted in
opposition to Plaintiff, Cross-Defendant, and Defendant Advanced Orthopedic
Center, Inc.’s (“AOC”) motion to tax costs. 

 
            The Court
finds that Blue Shield’s overriding interest in protecting its confidential and
proprietary fee schedule information overrides the public’s right of access to
that information and supports sealing the record.  If this fee schedule information is unsealed,
Blue Shield’s interest in protecting its confidential and proprietary
information will be prejudiced. 
Moreover, Blue Shield’s request appears narrowly tailored, as the balance
of the documents are unsealed – Blue Shield merely requests to redact and seal
the fee information itself from the documents. 
Thus, there are no less restrictive means to protect Blue Shield’s overriding
interest.
 
            However,
Blue Shield has not conditionally lodged the unredacted exhibits with the Court
as required by California Rule of Court, rule 2.511(b)(4), although the Court
notes that Blue Shield filed a notice of lodgment on February 29, 2024.  As such, the Court cannot ensure that the
proposed redactions include only Blue Shield’s confidential and proprietary fee
schedule information.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Therefore,
the Court continues the hearing on Blue Shield’s motion to seal to March 28,
2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207 to permit Blue Shield to conditionally
lodge the unredacted documents with the Court in compliance with California
Rules of Court, rule 2.511(b)(4).  
 
            Blue Shield
shall provide notice of the continued hearing and file a proof of service of
the same.
