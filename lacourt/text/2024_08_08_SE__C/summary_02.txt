And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is continued to November 21, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. The Plaintiff, Karina Lopez, alleges that a chair at the Defendant's premises collapsed on May 31, 2021, causing her injury. The Defendant has moved for summary judgment, but the Plaintiff argues that there is essential discovery relevant to the opposition that must be completed before the motion is heard. The Plaintiff's counsel has not received responses to special interrogatories and has not been produced for deposition despite promises. The Judge finds that the outstanding discovery is important to the Plaintiff's opposition and has continued the motion to allow for its completion.
