And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Blaine Holding & Development, LLC, has filed a motion for attorney's fees pursuant to CCP §128.5, claiming that the defendant, Vivera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., made a frivolous motion to set aside default and default judgment. The judge has denied the motion, finding that Blaine failed to comply with the safe harbor provision of CCP §128.5, which requires that a motion for sanctions be served at least 21 days before filing. The judge also notes that the motion would be properly denied on the merits, as there is no evidence of subjective bad faith or improper motive by the defendant. Additionally, the judge finds that Blaine has failed to establish that the defendant's motion to set aside default was wholly without merit and made in bad faith or with improper motive.
