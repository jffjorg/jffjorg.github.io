And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA's Motion to Compel Plaintiff C LE's further responses to a request for production of documents. The motion was denied because the Defendant failed to comply with California Rule of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1345, which requires that a Separate Statement be filed whenever a discovery motion involves the contents of a discovery request. The Judge noted that the filing and service of a Separate Statement is mandatory, not optional. Since no Reply has been filed by the Defendant, the motion was denied.
