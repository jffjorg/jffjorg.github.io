 Case Number:  22NWCV01287    Hearing Date:   August 8, 2024    Dept:  C MARTINEZ v.
AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO., INC. 
CASE NO.:  22NWCV01287
HEARING:  08/08/24
 
#2
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant AMERICAN
HONDA MOTOR CO., INC.’s PMQ is GRANTED.

 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
Pursuant to CCP §2025.450, if after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action, without having served a valid objection, fails
to appear for examination, or proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, the party giving notice may move for an order compelling the
deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any
document. (CCP §2025.450(a).) 
 
Upon review of Defendant’s Opposition, the Court notes that
Defendant does not oppose producing its PMQ. Rather, Defendant argues that the
failure to timely respond to Plaintiff’s Notice of Deposition was due to
mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect; and that Defendant’s objections
are necessary. 
 
The Motion is GRANTED. Defendant’s PMQ is ORDERED to appear for a deposition and
produce the documents contained within the Notice of Deposition, without
objection. Defendant has waived their objections to the document requests
because they failed to object to them pursuant to CCP §2025.410.The parties
shall meet and confer to determine the date, time, and location of the
depositions, which shall take place no later than 60 days from the date of the
Court’s issuance of this Order. The date may be extended by agreement of the
parties.
 
As to sanctions, it is widely understood that Defendant’s
PMQ has limited availability to sit for deposition.  The Court finds that Defendant’s PMQ acted
with substantial justification when it failed to attend Plaintiff’s unilaterally
noticed deposition.  Under the
circumstances, sanctions are not warranted.
