I.       
Defendant’s
unopposed Motion to Compel Plaintiff ERNESTO
ESCOBAR CHAVEZ’s Responses to Form Interrogatories
(set one) is GRANTED.
 

   
II.       
Defendant’s
unopposed Motion to Compel Plaintiff ERNESTO ESCOBAR
CHAVEZ’s Responses to Special Interrogatories (set one) is GRANTED.

Demand for Production of Documents (set one) is GRANTED.
 
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Oppositions filed as of August 6, 2024. 
 
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories and document demands are directed fails to respond at
all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers
thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the
discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond
has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party
is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the
matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial
discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely
filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all
objections. 
 
Here, Defendant
has shown that Special Interrogatories (set one), Form Interrogatories (set
one) and Request for Production of Documents (set one) were properly served
onto Plaintiff on September 25, 2023. The deadlines to respond have expired,
and no responses of any kind have been provided.  These Motions were filed July 10, 2024— almost
ten months after service of the discovery. As of August 6, 2024, no Oppositions
have been filed to the subject Motions. 
 
The unopposed
Motions to Compel are GRANTED, and Plaintiff
ERNESTO ESCOBAR CHAVEZ’s is ORDERED
to provide verified responses and documents, without objection by no later
than 30 days from date of the Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may
be extended by stipulation of the parties. If any objections are asserted, it
will be tantamount to no response at all and will be deemed a violation of this
Court’s order. 
 
Reasonable
sanctions are GRANTED in the total amount of $705.00 Plaintiff ERNESTO ESCOBAR
CHAVEZ’s and their counsel of record are jointly and severally ORDERED to pay Defendant
and their counsel of record sanctions in the total amount of $705.00, payable
within 30 days from the date of the Court’s issuance of this Order.
