And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s (Defendant) Production Manager's Qualified (PMQ) representative. The court notes that the Defendant does not oppose producing its PMQ, but rather argues that the failure to timely respond to the plaintiff's notice of deposition was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The court finds that the Defendant's PMQ has limited availability to sit for deposition and that it acted with substantial justification in failing to attend the plaintiff's unilaterally noticed deposition. As a result, the court does not believe that sanctions are warranted. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to determine the date, time, and location of the deposition, which must take place within 60 days of the court's issuance of this order.
