And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and demand for production of documents. The defendant served the discovery requests on the plaintiff on September 13, 2023, and the deadlines to respond have expired. Despite this, the plaintiff has failed to provide any responses. The court finds that the defendant has shown that the discovery requests were properly served and that the plaintiff has waived all objections by failing to respond. As a result, the court orders the plaintiff to provide verified responses and documents without objection within 30 days of the court's issuance of this order. The court also grants reasonable sanctions in the amount of $580.00 to be paid by the plaintiff and their counsel of record to the defendant and their counsel of record.
