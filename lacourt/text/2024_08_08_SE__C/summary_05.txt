English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers and motions to strike filed by the defendants in this personal injury action. The Court has OVERRULED the demurrers filed by several defendants, including VICTORY OUTREACH INTERNATIONAL, INNER CITY RECOVERY HOMES INTERNATIONAL, INC. dba VICTORY HOMES INTERNATIONAL, and INNER CITY RECOVERY HOMES INTERNATIONAL, INC. The Court has also DENIED the motions to strike portions of the plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint filed by these same defendants.

However, the Court has SUSTAINED the demurrer filed by defendants ROGER SOTO, JASMINE GALVEZ, AUGIE BARAJAS, and MARY BARAJAS, with 20 days leave to amend, as the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to support a finding of their liability for claims of fraud in their individual capacities. The Court has also GRANTED the motion to strike punitive damages filed by these same defendants, with 20 days leave to amend.

The Court has also ruled that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged that defendant ROGELIO SOTO, on behalf of all entity defendants, made a number of oral misrepresentations in order to induce the decedent to sign the client intake form, and that these facts are sufficient to withstand the demurrer stage.
