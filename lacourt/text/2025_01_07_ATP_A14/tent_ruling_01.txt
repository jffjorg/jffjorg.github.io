  Case Number:  23AVCV01352    Hearing Date:   January 7, 2025    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a real property action.
Plaintiff Andrea Cervantes as Administrator of the Estate of Robert Stewart
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that on or about August 31, 2017, Robert Stweart Jr.
(“Decedent”) obtained a mortgage loan on the real property commonly known as
43481 30th Street W #3, Lancaster, CA 93536 (the “Property”) from Defendant
Carrington Mortgage Services (“Carrington”) in the amount of $73,897,
memorialized by a Deed of Trust with the maturity date on September 01, 2032
and with First American Title as the Trustee (Instrument No. 20170992131).
Plaintiff further alleges that (1) on June 30, 2022, a death certificate for
Decedent was recorded in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office (Instrument
no. 2000000048362); (2) on June 23, 2023, an Assignment of Deed of Trust was
recorded in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office purportedly assigning the
Deed of Trust from Carrington to Carrington (Instrument No. 20230410981); (3)
on June 23, 2023, a Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under a Deed of Trust
was recorded in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office (Instrument No.
20230410983); (4) on September 27, 2023, a Notice of Trustee’s Sale was
recorded in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office with a sale date of
November 02, 2023 (Instrument No. 20230651903); and (5) the Property was sold
on that date. Plaintiff presents that: (1) Carrington has a consent decree over
its foreclosure activities; (2) Plaintiff was in the final stages of the
Mortgage Relief Program, the loan is one of the loans the consent decree found
misleading, Plaintiff submitted documents to Carrington in September of an
unspecified year, and Carrington postponed working on a successor as the
Trustee of the Living Trust; (3) the Property is in pre-foreclosure; and (4)
when Decedent died, Plaintiff did not get any letters from Carrington stating
that her modification was denied or closed out and Carrington did not offer an
assumption loan. 
 
On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff
filed her Complaint alleging four causes of action for: (1) Violation of Cal
Civ. Code § 2923.5 against Carrington and Defendant Federal Housing Authority
(“FHA”); (2) Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2924.9 against Carrington and FHA;
(3) Wrongful Foreclosure against Carrington and FHA; and (4) Unfair Business
Practices (Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §17200, et seq.)
against Carrington and FHA. 
 
On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff
dismissed FHA. 
 
On March 18, 2024, a Case
Management Conference was held.
 
On April 17, 2024, Carrington
filed a Demurrer to the Complaint, subsequently sustained.
 
On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed
her First Amended Complaint (“FAC”).
 
On August 08, 2024, Carrington
filed a Demurrer to the FAC, subsequently sustained. The Court notes that it
sustained this Demurrer due to Plaintiff’s failure to amend the allegations
related to standing which was not only an issue with the previous pleading, but
also argued in the moving papers. 
 
On October 24, 2024, Plaintiff
filed her Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”). The causes of action remain the
same. 
 
On November 14, 2024, Carrington
filed this Demurrer to the SAC.
 
On December 24, 2024, Plaintiff
filed her Opposition.
 
On December 30, 2024, Carrington
filed its Reply.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Demurrer – A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn v.¿Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.
App. 4th 740, 747.) ¿When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context.¿ (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power¿(2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.)¿ In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.¿ (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.30(a).)¿A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.¿ (SKF Farms v.
Superior Court¿(1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)¿ Therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.¿¿(Id.)¿¿The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn,¿supra,¿147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A general demurrer admits the truth of all
factual, material allegations properly pled in the challenged pleading,
regardless of possible difficulties of proof.¿¿(Blank,¿supra, 39
Cal.3d at p. 318.)¿ Thus, no matter how unlikely or improbable, plaintiff’s
allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling on the
demurrer.¿¿(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.¿(1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)¿ Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations
expressing mere conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits
to the complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.¿¿(Vance
v. Villa Park¿Mobilehome¿Estates¿(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.)¿ A
general demurrer does not admit contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact
or law alleged in the complaint; facts impossible in law; or allegations
contrary to facts of which a court may take judicial notice.¿¿(Blank,¿supra,
39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Pursuant to¿Code Civ. Proc.¿§430.10(e), the
party against whom a complaint has been filed may object by demurrer to the
pleading on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.¿ It is an abuse of discretion to sustain a
demurrer if there is a reasonable probability that the defect can be cured by
amendment.¿¿(Schifando¿v. City of Los Angeles¿(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074,
1082,¿as modified (Dec. 23, 2003).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿

Meet and Confer
Requirement¿– Before filing a demurrer or a motion to strike, the demurring or
moving party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the
pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike
for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached through a
filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in
the demurrer.¿ (Cal. Code Civ.¿Proc. §430.41 and §435.5.)¿The Court that
Katalina Baumann (“Baumann”) has declared that Plaintiff has not responded to
her meet and confer attempts. (See 11/14/2025 Decl. of Demurring or Moving
Party RE: Meet and Confer [signed by Baumann].) “A determination by the court
that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule
or sustain a demurrer.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(4).) The Court
addresses the Demurrer on its merits.

Discussion
 
Application – Carrington
demurs to all causes of action. The gravamen of Carrington’s moving papers is
standing as the Homeowner’s Bill of Rights (“HBOR”) does not apply as Plaintiff
is not the borrower under the loan. Carrington further argues as to the First
Cause of Action, Plaintiff does not overcome the presumption of compliance that
attaches to the declaration filed with the June 2023 Notice of Default; and, as
to the Fourth Cause of Action, Plaintiff’s claims fail as there is no valid
basis for a claim under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, et seq.,
also known as California’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”).
 
Plaintiff argues that her
allegations under HBOR are well pled as: (1) HBOR requires that a servicer may
not record a notice of default until 30 days after contacting the borrower to
discuss alternatives to foreclosure and Plaintiff was not contacted; (2) Section
2924.9 provides, in part, that within five business days after recording a
notice of default pursuant to Section 2924, a mortgage servicer shall send a
written communication to the borrower that includes information regarding
foreclosure alternatives and Carrington did not contact Plaintiff; (3)
Plaintiff was not contacted to explore foreclosure alternatives prior to the
sale of the Property, so there is a valid claim for wrongful foreclosure; and
(4) as Plaintiff has pled sufficiently actionable conduct under any of the
three basis for a UCL claim, Plaintiff 
has a basis for the Fourth Cause of Action. Regarding the Fourth Cause
of Action, Plaintiff further argues that she has pled the claims with
reasonable particularity and she has standing under the UCL as her present or
future property interest was diminished and she was denied a proper review of a
loan modification.
 
In Reply, Carrington reiterates
that Plaintiff is not the borrower. Carrington argues that, borrower issue
aside, Plaintiff fails to allege that she submitted a complete loan
modification, HBOR does not excuse tender or provide Plaintiff with the remedy
of setting aside the sale, and the admission of default bars Plaintiff from a
UCL claim.
 
In the SAC, Plaintiff has added
the following relevant allegations:
 
Plaintiff notified
the servicer of the loan encumbering the subject property that she is a
successor in interest of the property and is the rightful and lawful owner of
subject property. Within the meaning of Cal. Civ. Code § 2929.5 (e)(1)
Plaintiff is borrower under the subject Deed of Trust: "Borrower"
means the trustor under a deed of trust, or a mortgagor under a mortgage, where
the deed of trust or mortgage encumbers real property security and secures the
performance of the trustor or mortgagor under a loan, extension of credit,
guaranty, or other obligation. The term includes any
successor-in-interest of the trustor or mortgagor to the real property security
before the deed of trust or mortgage has been discharged, reconveyed, or
foreclosed upon. As such, Plaintiff rightfully holds title over the
subject property.
 
Furthermore,
Pursuant to Civ. Code §2920.7(e)(l), the survivors and heirs have a right of action
for violations of the Homeowner' s Bill of Rights upon the beneficiary or
servicer of the subject loan being notified of the death of the trustor to a
Deed of Trust. Plaintiff notified the servicer of the loan encumbering the
subject property and is the rightful and lawful owner of subject property.
 
(SAC ¶19-20 [emphases included in
SAC].) 
 
Despite Plaintiff’s case caption,
Plaintiff appears to be bringing her claims as a successor-in-interest and not
as an administrator of the Estate of Robert Stewart. The law respects form less
than substance. (See Cal. Civ. Code § 3528.)
 
Plaintiff’s citation to Cal. Civ.
Code § 2929.5 is not applicable to Plaintiff’s claims, as Carrington points out
in its Reply. The wording of the statute states plainly: 
(e) For purposes of
this section:
(1)
"Borrower" means the trustor under a deed of trust, or a mortgagor
under a mortgage, where the deed of trust or mortgage encumbers real property
security and secures the performance of the trustor or mortgagor under a loan,
extension of credit, guaranty, or other obligation. The term includes any
successor-in-interest of the trustor or mortgagor to the real property security
before the deed of trust or mortgage has been discharged, reconveyed, or
foreclosed upon.
 
(Cal. Civ. Code § 2929.5(e)(1).)
 
The definition applies to this
section only.
 
The definition of “borrower” for
Plaintiff’s actions under Cal Civ. Code §§ 2923.5 and 2924.9 is: 
 
(b) “Foreclosure
prevention alternative” means a first lien loan modification or another
available loss mitigation option.
(c)
(1) Unless
otherwise provided and for purposes of Sections 2923.4, 2923.5, 2923.55,
2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, 2924.18, and 2924.19, “borrower”
means any natural person who is a mortgagor or trustor and who is potentially
eligible for any federal, state, or proprietary foreclosure prevention
alternative program offered by, or through, his or her mortgage servicer.
(2) For purposes of
the sections listed in paragraph (1), “borrower” shall not include any of the
following:
(A) An individual
who has surrendered the secured property as evidenced by either a letter
confirming the surrender or delivery of the keys to the property to the
mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent.
(B) An individual
who has contracted with an organization, person, or entity whose primary
business is advising people who have decided to leave their homes on how to
extend the foreclosure process and avoid their contractual obligations to
mortgagees or beneficiaries.
(C) An individual
who has filed a case under Chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13 of Title 11 of the United
States Code and the bankruptcy court has not entered an order closing or
dismissing the bankruptcy case, or granting relief from a stay of foreclosure.
 
(Cal. Civ. Code § 2920.5(c)
[emphasis added].)
 
Plaintiff does not fit this
definition as Carrington is not Plaintiff’s mortgage servicer. 
 
Further, Plaintiff’s citation to Cal.
Civ. Code § 2920.7(e)(1) is inapposite as Cal. Civ. Code § 2920.7 has been
repealed as of January 01, 2020. This fact was highlighted in Carrington’s
Reply. 
Accordingly, the standing issue
which has been present since the original pleading remains as Plaintiff’s
allegations lack factual allegations that would provide her with standing. 
 
As the standing issue remains and
impacts all causes of actions, the Demurrer is SUSTAINED.

Leave to Amend
 
Regarding leave to amend, leave to amend
must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy¿(1976), 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) While under
California law leave to amend is liberally granted, “leave to amend should not
be granted where, in all probability, amendment would be futile.” (Vaillette
v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. (1993), 18 Cal. App. 4th 680, 685).¿ “A trial
court does not abuse its discretion when it sustains a demurrer without¿leave
to amend¿if either (a) the facts and the nature of the claims are clear and no
liability exists, or (b) it is probable from the nature of the defects and
previous unsuccessful attempts to plead that the plaintiff cannot state a
claim.” (Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp.¿(1992)¿4 Cal.App.4th 857, 889.)
 
The Court notes that it informed Plaintiff
that the previously granted leave to amend would be Plaintiff’s final attempt
to address the standing issue. (See 09/17/2024 Minute Order [“Because
Plaintiff has not made any changes regarding her standing between the Complaint
and the FAC, the Court informs Plaintiff that this will be the final time leave
to amend is given.”].) Plaintiff has had three attempts to plead her causes of
action, two of which the Court has opined on and made the standing issue known.
As such, it is probable from the nature of the defects and previous unsuccessful
attempts to plead that the plaintiff cannot state a claim. 
 
The Court does not allow leave to amend.

Conclusion
 
Defendant Carrington Mortgage Services, LLC’s Demurrer
is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
