Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. The motion is brought by Zinnanti Law Firm P.C., Law Office of Anthony D. Zinnanti, a Professional Law Corporation, and Anthony D. Zinnanti, seeking to file a cross-complaint against Eric B. Halem, EB Halem, LLC, Matthew Vannatter, Keith M. Davidson, and Does 51-100, alleging causes of action for fraud, alter ego, and apportionment of damages on grounds of legal malpractice. The court finds that it is in the interest of justice to permit the cross-complaint, despite the delay in filing. The court also finds that the proposed cross-complaint is not meritless and does not target Plaintiffs' protected activities under the anti-SLAPP statute.
