The judge has granted the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession in the case of Alliant Credit Union v. Salazar. The plaintiff seeks to recover a recreational vehicle, valued at $53,400.00, which was purchased by the defendant, Edgar Magos Salazar, in May 2019. The defendant defaulted on payments in April 2023 and refused to return the vehicle. The plaintiff has established that it has a first priority security interest in the vehicle and that the defendant wrongfully possesses the vehicle. The judge finds that the plaintiff has met its burden and is entitled to a writ of possession of the vehicle, as well as orders prohibiting the defendant from transferring or concealing the vehicle. The defendant has not filed an opposition to the application.
