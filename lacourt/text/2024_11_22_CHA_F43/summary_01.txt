And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted defendant Sergey Pogosyan's motion to compel plaintiff Leonard Allen Cole's responses to form interrogatories, Set One. The plaintiff has failed to serve any responses despite being granted three extensions. The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel had substantial justification for requesting the extensions, but the time spent on the motion is unreasonable. The court has granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the reduced amount of $360.00. The court orders the plaintiff to serve code-compliant responses to each individual form interrogatory within 20 days and to pay the sanctions to the defendant's counsel within 20 days.
