On December 12, 2022, plaintiffs Hsin
Jou Hou, Senqiang Liang, Zhihua Dai, Liping Su, Shu-O Lien, Chang-Wu Chi, and
Ran Zhen filed this action against defendants Daniel Chiu, Rebecca Chiu, Arc-I,
and Oasis Growth Partners LLC (“Oasis”) (collectively, “Defendants”).
Plaintiffs seek a default judgment of $4,379,096.81 against Defendants,
consisting of $3.71 million as demanded in the complaint and $667,800 in
interest. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants mismanaged the project and embezzled
the money for their personal use. 
There are several issues with
Plaintiffs’ application. First, Plaintiffs’ proposed judgment does not indicate
how much of the money judgment each plaintiff will receive. Second, Plaintiffs
do not specify whether the judgment is joint and several as to all Defendants.
Third, Plaintiffs state that a motion for attorneys’ fees will follow. However,
"a plaintiff seeking an award of attorney fees from a defaulting defendant
must request those fees at the time the plaintiff requests entry of default.” (Garcia
v. Politis (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1480.) Therefore, Plaintiffs must calculate
and state the amount of recoverable attorney’s fees in their default package. If
the fees sought exceed the schedule provided in Local Rule 3.214(a), Plaintiffs
must include a declaration explaining why the Court should award the greater
amount. 
Accordingly, the hearing is continued
to June 5, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse.
