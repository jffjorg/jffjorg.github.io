And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action. The plaintiff, Darryl Abbinante, alleges that the defendants, Huntington Health and Huntington Memorial Hospital, failed to provide a safe environment, implement proper procedures, and provide qualified personnel. The defendants argue that they complied with the standard of care and that they are not vicariously liable for the actions of the treating physicians under an ostensible agency theory. The court finds that the defendants have met their burden to show that there are no triable issues of fact regarding their compliance with the standard of care and ostensible agency liability. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion and failed to raise a triable issue of fact. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
