Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has considered the parties' submissions and has denied the Motion to Disqualify Counsel. The motion was filed by the defendants, Regency Outdoor Advertising, Inc. and Brian Kennedy, alleging that Seyde's counsel, Miller Barondess LLP, reviewed inadvertently produced documents containing privileged information. The court finds that the intentional disclosure of allegedly privileged documents by Seyde does not constitute a valid ground for disqualification. The court notes that the parties' interests and relationships are complex, and the intentional disclosure of documents is not a new or unusual occurrence in this case. The court finds that the public interest in the fair administration of justice requires that Seyde's counsel be allowed to continue to represent him.
