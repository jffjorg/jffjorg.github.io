And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the defendants, Christopher Maggiore and Artists Worldwide, to file a first amended answer and a cross-complaint. The Judge will deny the motion for leave to file a first amended answer without prejudice, meaning that the defendants can refile the motion at a later time. The Judge will grant the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, but will require the defendants to file a separate copy of the proposed cross-complaint within 10 days. The Judge has denied the motion for leave to file a first amended answer because the defendants' counsel failed to provide sufficient information about the proposed affirmative defenses and the reasons for seeking the amendment. The Judge has granted the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint because the proposed cross-complaint arises out of the same transaction as the plaintiff's claim and the defendants have acted in good faith.
