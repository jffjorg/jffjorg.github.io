And here is the summary in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of non-party Alex Arroyo. The Plaintiffs, Mercy 1031, LLC and Loyal 1031, LLC, had sought to compel Arroyo's deposition after he failed to appear for his noticed deposition on May 1, 2024. The Judge finds that there is good cause to order Arroyo's deposition, as he may have knowledge relevant to the subject matter involved in this action. The Judge grants the motion to compel Arroyo's deposition, and orders Arroyo to meet and confer with the Plaintiffs within 10 days of entry of this order for a deposition date to occur within 90 days of entry of this order.

The Judge also denies the Plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions, as Arroyo did not oppose the motion to compel his deposition. Additionally, the Judge denies the Plaintiffs' motion for an order to show cause re: contempt, finding that it is not clear that Arroyo is familiar with the justice system or is represented.
