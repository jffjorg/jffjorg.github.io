And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Wilshire Quinn Income Fund Reit, LLC's motion to compel Defendant Victor Lossi to comply with the Court's order dated February 29, 2024. The Plaintiff had sought to compel the Defendant to provide discovery responses without objections within 30 days of the order. The Court has already awarded monetary sanctions of $1,320 to the Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel, and has denied the Plaintiff's request for terminating sanctions. The Judge cited California Code of Civil Procedure and case law, including Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) and Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL Adm'rs, Inc. (2008), in support of the ruling. The Court has determined that terminating sanctions are not warranted at this time, as the Plaintiff has failed to comply with the Court's prior order, but the failure is not willful. The Court has also declined to impose additional monetary sanctions, citing the incremental approach to discovery sanctions under California law.
