And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and costs on appeal, in part, and denied it, in part. The plaintiff is the prevailing party on the second appeal, and is entitled to attorneys' fees and costs on appeal. The judge has awarded the plaintiff $3,100.00 in attorneys' fees and $0 in costs on appeal. The judgment will be amended to include an award of attorneys' fees and costs on appeal in the total amount of $3,160.00. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for $60.00 in costs on appeal because the documentation was not properly served and filed within the required time frame.
