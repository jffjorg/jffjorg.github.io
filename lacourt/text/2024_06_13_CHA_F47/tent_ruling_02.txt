FACTUAL SUMMARY & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arose out of a dispute between Plaintiff/Respondent
Cross Creek Village Homeowners Association (Plaintiff) and one of its members,
Defendant/Appellant Alexander Cvetkovich (Defendant).  On 12/15/17, Plaintiff filed this action
against Defendant.   
 
On 5/13/22, Plaintiff obtained a judgment against
Defendant in the amount of $1,100.00.  (RJN, ¶1, Ex.A).  On 9/7/22, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs as the prevailing party against Defendant
awarding Plaintiff $48,740.45 in attorneys’ fees and $28,922.86 in court costs.
 (RJN, ¶2, Ex.B).  The Court awarded Plaintiff its attorneys’
fees and costs pursuant to Civil Code Section 5975(c) and Civil Code Section
1717(a). (RJN, ¶2, Ex.B.) On 9/8/22, the Court signed an Amended Judgment that
included an award of attorneys’ fees and costs in the total amount of
$78,763.31.  (RJN, ¶3, Ex.C). The Court
signed another Amended Judgment on 7/25/23, in the amount of $99,221.12 after awarding
Plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs on Defendant’s first appeal.  (RJN, ¶3, Ex.C).
 
Defendant filed two appeals in this action.  On 7/13/22, Defendant filed his first Notice
of Appeal.  (RJN, ¶4, Ex.D).  On 12/8/22, the Second Appellate District
dismissed Defendant’s first appeal.  (RJN,
¶5, Ex.E).  On 2/8/23, the Second
Appellate District issued a Remittitur on Defendant’s first appeal.  (RJN, ¶6, Ex.F).  The Remittitur stated that Plaintiff was “to
recover cost on appeal.”  (RJN, ¶6, Ex.F).  On 6/1/23, this Court granted Plaintiff’s first
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs on Appeal in the amount of $10,945.50.  (RJN, ¶7, Ex.G).
 
On 6/9/23, Defendant filed his second Notice of Appeal.  (RJN, ¶8, Ex.H).  On 9/25/23, the Second Appellate District
dismissed Defendant’s second appeal.  (RJN,
¶9, Ex.I).  On 12/12/23, the Second
Appellate District issued a Remittitur on Defendant’s second appeal.  (RJN, ¶10, Ex. J). 
 
As a result of the second Notice of Appeal, on 1/11/24,
Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion seeking orders (1) determining
that Plaintiff/Respondent Cross Creek Village Homeowners Association is the
prevailing party on appeal against Defendant/Appellant Alexander Cvetkovich,
(2) awarding attorneys’ fees to Plaintiff as the prevailing party on appeal against
Defendant in the amount of $3,100.00, (3) awarding costs to Plaintiff as the
prevailing party in this civil lawsuit in the amount of $60.00 against
Defendant, and (4) amending the Judgment entered on 7/25/23 to include the
award of attorneys’ fees and costs on appeal in the total amount of $3,160.00. 
 
On 6/3/24, Defendant filed (served on 5/31/24) an
opposition to the motion.  On 6/6/24,
Plaintiff filed and served a reply.  On
6/7/24, an Order Nunc Pro Tunc was filed by the Court of Appeal indicating that
the remittitur issued 12/12/23 erroneously did not award costs on appeal and
pursuant to CRC 8.278(a)(2) costs on appeal are awarded to
Plaintiff/Respondent.  On 6/7/24,
Plaintiff filed and served a supplemental reply and supplemental request for
judicial notice.  On 6/10/24,  Defendant filed (served 6/7/24) a
supplemental opposition. 
 
ANALYSIS  
 
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) and
Supplemental Request for Judicial Notice (SRJN) are granted.
 
In California, “[w]here a contract or a statute creates a
right for the prevailing party to recover attorney fees, the prevailing party
is also entitled to attorney fees on appeal.” 
Villinger/Nicholls Development Co. (1995) 31 CA4th 321,
329; See also Sixells, LLC (2008) 170 CA4th 648, 656; MBNA America
Bank, N.A. (2006) 147 CA4th Supp. 1, 14. 
Therefore, if there is a contractual or statutory basis to recover
attorney’s fees at the trial court level, that right also allows for recovery
of attorney’s fees incurred on appeal.  Douglas
E. Barnhart, Inc. (2012) 211 CA4th 230, 250; See also Garcia
(2013) 220 CA4th 1058, 1067.   
 
Plaintiff’s Governing Documents include its Declaration
of Restrictions Covenants (CC&Rs) which constitute a contract between
Plaintiff and its members such as Defendant. 
Plaintiff’s CC&Rs provide that the prevailing party in a lawsuit to
enforce the CC&Rs is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and
costs.  (RJN, ¶11, Ex.K, Article XV,
Section 9). 
 
Civil Code 5975(c) provides that “[i]n an action to
enforce the governing documents, the prevailing party shall be awarded
reasonable attorney's fees and costs.” 
The instant action constituted one to enforce the governing documents
against Defendant.  See Civil Code
5925    
 
Civil Code 1717(a) provides, in relevant part:
 
In any action on a contract, where
the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are
incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be
the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's
fees in addition to other costs.
 
                                                          
. . .
 
Reasonable attorney's fees shall be
fixed by the court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit.
 
Here, the Court already
determined that Plaintiff was entitled to recover attorney’s fees after trial and
on the first appeal pursuant to contract and statute.  (RJN ¶¶2, 7, Ex.B, G).  
 
Based on the dismissal of
Defendant’s second appeal, Plaintiff is also the prevailing party on that appeal.  See CRC 8.278(a)(2).  While the initial remittitur on the second
appeal issued on 12/12/23 did not provide that Plaintiff is to recover costs on
appeal, the Court of Appeal, on its own motion, issued an Order Nunc Pro Tunc
on 6/7/24 indicating that the 12/12/23 remittitur erroneously did not award
costs on appeal and that pursuant to CRC 8.278(a)(2), costs on appeal are
awarded to Plaintiff/Respondent.  (RJN, ¶6,
Ex.F; SRJN, ¶1, Ex.N); See CRC 8.278(b)(2).    
 
A party moving for attorneys’
fees on appeal in an unlimited action must file a motion for attorneys’ fees
within forty (40) days of the issuance of remittitur.  See CRC 3.1702(c); CRC
8.278(c)(1).  Here, the instant motion
was filed within 40 days of the issuance of the 12/12/23 remittitur.   
 
A court’s determination of a reasonable attorney fee
award ordinarily begins with the lodestar method of calculation (the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate).  State Farm General Insurance Company
(2021) 71 CA5th 197, 209 citing PLCM Group, Inc. (2000) 22 C4th 1084,
1095.  The trial court has broad discretion
to determine a reasonable attorney fee award. 
Douglas E. Barnhart, Inc. (2012) 211 CA4th 230, 249  
 
While the appeal was dismissed after Defendant’s default,
Plaintiff’s counsel was still required to monitor the status of the appeal in
order to protect its client’s interests. 
As such, the Court finds that the 15.5 hours of attorney time and the
hourly rate of $200 charged are reasonable. 
(See Speights Decl. ¶¶5-7, Ex.L). 
Therefore, the Court awards Plaintiff $3,100.00 in attorneys’ fees as
the prevailing party on appeal.
 
The Court declines to award the $60.00 in costs.  While Plaintiff has attached a copy of a
memorandum of costs on appeal to the declaration of attorney Speights filed in
support of the motion, there is no evidence that document was separately served
and filed within 40 days after the issuance of the remittitur as required.  See CRC 8.278(c)(1); CRC 3.1700;
(Speights Decl. ¶8, Ex.M).
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing: (1) Plaintiff is determined to be
the prevailing party on the second appeal; (2) Plaintiff is awarded $3,100.00 in
attorneys’ fees as the prevailing party on the second appeal; (3) Plaintiff is
awarded $0 costs on the second appeal; and (4) the Judgment will be amended to
include an award of attorneys’ fees on the second appeal in the amount of $3,100.00
and $0 costs on the second appeal.
