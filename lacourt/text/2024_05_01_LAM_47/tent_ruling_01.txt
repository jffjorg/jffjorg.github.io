MOTION
TO COMPEL RESPONSES (x4)

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Daniel A. Hernandez
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 4/25/24
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed on May 25, 2023. Plaintiff purchased a
2016 Dodge Challenger on December 4, 2016 which developed numerous defects to
critical systems including the body, electrical, braking, and powertrain
systems. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses
to four sets of discovery served on Defendant. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections
within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Admission is DENIED.
 
            This
ruling is conditioned on Plaintiff paying $180 in filing fees within 10 days of
this order. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves to compel responses
to four sets of discovery served on Defendant. 
 
Multiple Motions
 
            Multiple
motions should not be combined into a single filing.¿(See¿Govt. Code,¿§
70617(a)(4) [setting forth the required filing fee for each motion,
application, or any other paper or request requiring a hearing];¿see¿also¿Weil
& Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial, [8:1140.1] at 8F-60 (The Rutter
Group 2011)¿[“Motions to compel compliance with separate discovery requests
ordinarily should be filed separately.”].) 
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks in one motion
to compel responses to form and special interrogatories, requests for
admission, and requests for production. Combining multiple motions under the
guise of one motion with one hearing reservation manipulates the Court Reservation
System and unfairly jumps ahead of other litigants. Moreover, combining motions
to avoid payment of separate filing fees deprives the Court of filing fees it
is otherwise entitled to collect.
 
            The Court
therefore conditions its ruling on this motion on the payment of an additional
$180 in filing fees within 10 days of this order.
 
Interrogatories and Requests for Production
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel responses to form and special interrogatories and requests for
production propounded to Defendant. 
 
When a party to whom an inspection
demand or an interrogatory is directed fails to respond, a party making the
request may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.290(b) [interrogatories]; 2031.300(b) [requests for production].) A party
who fails to provide timely responses waives any objection, including one based
on privilege or work product. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(a); 2031.300(a).)
For a motion to compel initial responses, no meet and confer is required. All
that must be shown is that a set of requests for production was properly served
on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no
response has been served. (Leach v. Sup.
Ct. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-06.) 
 
            Plaintiff
served the interrogatories and requests for production on Defendant via email
on September 7, 2021. (Declaration of Noreelie Panhwar ISO Mot. ¶ 3, Exh. 1.)
As of the date this motion was filed, no responses had been received. (Id.
¶ 6.) Plaintiff is therefore entitled to an order compelling responses to the
interrogatories and requests for production without objections. 
 
//
 
Requests for Admission
 
            Plaintiff
also moves for an order compelling responses to requests for admission. No such
motion is contemplated by the Code of Civil Procedure, which only authorizes a
motion to deem the truth of matters stated in the requests in the event no
response is received. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280.) Plaintiff’s request is
therefore improper. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories is GRANTED.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant responses without objections
within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Admission is DENIED.
 
            This
ruling is conditioned on Plaintiff paying $180 in filing fees within 10 days of
this order. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
