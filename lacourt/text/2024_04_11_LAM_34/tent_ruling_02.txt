 Case Number:  23STCV26327    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  34 SUBJECT:        Special  Motion to Strike Complaint [and] Request for Attorneys Fees and Costs   Moving Party: Defendants Soraya Moazaam and Faro Optometry Inc. Resp. Party:    Plaintiff Vrezh Hovhannisyan     The anti-SLAPP  Motion is DENIED.  Defendants’ Request  for Fees is DENIED.    Plaintiff is  GRANTED fifteen (15) days leave to file a motion for attorney’s fees and costs.     BACKGROUND:   On  October 27, 2023, Plaintiffs Vrezh Hovhanissyan and Leo Gonzalez filed their  Complaint against Defendants Soraya Moazaam, Faro Optometry Inc., and Faro  Management, LLC. The causes of action arise from an alleged business  relationship gone awry.    On  December 14, 2023, the First Amended Complaint (FAC) was filed, which omitted  Leo Gonzalez as a plaintiff and added a cause of action.    On  December 21, 2023, Plaintiff Vrezh Hovhanissyan (“Plaintiff”) filed Notice of  Errata Re First Amended Complaint.    On  February 29, 2024, Defendants Soraya Moazaam and Faro Optometry Inc.  (“Defendants”) filed their Special Motion to Strike [and] Request for Attorneys  Fees and Costs (“anti-SLAPP Motion”). In support of their anti-SLAPP Motion,  Defendants concurrently filed: (1) Appendix of Exhibits; and (2) Request for Judicial  Notice.    On March  14, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Opposition to the anti-SLAPP Motion. The  Opposition includes a request for attorney’s fees. In support of his  Opposition, Plaintiff concurrently filed: (1) Declaration of Vrezh  Hovhanissyan; (2) Declaration of Luke Manzo; (3) Request for Judicial Notice;  (4) Objections to Defendants’ Exhibits; (5) Proposed Order on Objections; and  (6) Omnibus Proof of Service.    On March  19, 2024, Defendants filed their Reply in support of the anti-SLAPP Motion.  Defendants concurrently filed: (1) Evidentiary Objections; and (2) Response to  Plaintiff’s Objections.    On March  27, 2024, by request of Plaintiff, the Clerk’s Office entered default on  Defendant Faro Management, LLC.    ANALYSIS:   I.           Evidentiary Objections   A.       Plaintiff’s Evidentiary Objections   Plaintiff filed evidentiary objections to  Defendants’ evidence. The following are the Court’s rulings on these  objections.          Objection             1       OVERRULED     2       OVERRULED     3       OVERRULED     4       OVERRULED     5       OVERRULED     6   SUSTAINED         7   SUSTAINED         8   SUSTAINED         9   SUSTAINED         10   SUSTAINED         11       OVERRULED     11A   SUSTAINED         12   SUSTAINED         13   SUSTAINED         14   SUSTAINED         15   SUSTAINED         16       OVERRULED     17   SUSTAINED         18   SUSTAINED         19   SUSTAINED         20   SUSTAINED         21   SUSTAINED         22   SUSTAINED         23       OVERRULED     24   SUSTAINED         25   SUSTAINED         26   SUSTAINED         27   SUSTAINED         28   SUSTAINED         29   SUSTAINED         30   SUSTAINED                     Although some of the hearsay objections  are valid, the Court finds frivolous Plaintiff’s repeated citation to Gruber  v. Gruber (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 529, 537 for the proposition that a statement  that “fails to defeat Plaintiff’s cause of action as a matter of law” is objectionable.             The Court notes that Plaintiff's attorney who filed these objections has  only been an attorney for three years.  “We  sometimes ‘hear’ that a common practice in cases staffed by multiple levels of  lawyers is to assign the most junior lawyer to ‘do the objections,’ which was  apparently done here. Perhaps a wiser practice would be to have the most  experienced lawyer, presumably with a better understanding of the law of  evidence, deal with the objections.”  (Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc. (2009)  178 Cal.App.4th 243, 257, fn. 6.)         B.       Defendants’ Evidentiary Objections   Defendants filed evidentiary objections to  Plaintiff’s evidence. The following are the Court’s rulings on these  objections.        Objection             1   SUSTAINED         2   SUSTAINED         3   SUSTAINED         4   SUSTAINED         5   SUSTAINED         6   SUSTAINED         7   SUSTAINED         8   SUSTAINED         9   SUSTAINED         10   SUSTAINED         11   SUSTAINED         12   SUSTAINED         13   SUSTAINED         14   SUSTAINED         15   SUSTAINED         16   SUSTAINED                     “We recognize that it is very common for [counsel] to include  argument in their declarations . . . but it is a sloppy practice which should  stop. Even at its most benign, it is a practice that forces the trial and  appellate courts, and opposing counsel, to sort out the facts that are actually  supported by oath from material that is nothing more than the statement of an  opinion ostensibly under oath. More fundamentally, however, it makes a mockery  of the requirement that declarations be supported by statements made under  penalty of perjury. The proper place for argument is in points and authorities,  not declarations.”  (In re Marriage of  Heggie (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 28, 30.)     II.        Request for Judicial Notice   A.       Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice   Defendants request that the Court take  judicial notice of:   (1)        The docket of case LACBA514505, The People of the  State of California v. Hovhannisyan, Vrezh, filed in the Superior  Court of California, County of Los Angeles;   (2)        The FAC filed in this case;   (3)        The Notice of Related Case filed in this case;   (4)        The Complaint filed by Leo Manuel Gonzalez against  Rosita Khadivi and Faro Optometry Inc. in case WC-CM-870496, filed with the  State of California Department of Industrial Relations Labor Commissioner’s  Office; and   (5)        Death Certificate of Dr. Ali Mohebbi.    The Court GRANTS judicial notice of items 1,  4, and 5.  Of course, “while  courts may notice official acts and public records, we do not take judicial  notice of the truth of all matters stated therein.”  (Mangini v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994) 7  Cal.4th 1057, 1063–1064 [cleaned up], overruled on other grounds by Lorillard  Tobacco Co. v. Reilly (2001) 533 U.S. 525 and In re Tobacco Cases II (2007)  41 Cal.4th 1257, 1276.)   The Court DENIES as superfluous judicial notice of  items 2 and 3. Any party that wishes to draw the Court’s attention to an item  filed in this action may simply cite directly to the document by execution and  filing date. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(d).)   B.       Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial Notice   Plaintiff requests that the Court take  judicial notice of:   (1)        The FAC filed in this case;   (2)        The Petition filed in case 22STPB12611, filed in the  Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles;   (3)        The First Amended Petition filed in case  22STPB12611, filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles;   (4)        The Second Amended Petition filed in case  22STPB12611, filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles;  and   (5)        The Third Amended Petition filed in case  22STPB12611, filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles.   The Court GRANTS judicial notice of items 2  through 5. “        While courts  may notice official acts and public records, we do not take judicial notice of  the truth of all matters stated therein.”   (Mangini v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994)  7 Cal.4th 1057, 1063–1064 [cleaned up], overruled on other grounds by Lorillard  Tobacco Co. v. Reilly (2001) 533 U.S. 525 and In re Tobacco Cases II (2007)  41 Cal.4th 1257, 1276.)     The Court DENIES as superfluous judicial notice of  item 1. Any party that wishes to draw the Court’s attention to an item filed in  this action may simply cite directly to the document by execution and filing  date. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(d).)   III.      Legal Standard   “A cause of action against a person arising from any act of that  person in furtherance of the person’s right of petition or free speech under  the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection  with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the  court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability  that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16,  subd. (b)(1).)   “In making its determination, the court shall consider the  pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which  the liability or defense is based.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(2).)   “A SLAPP suit—a strategic lawsuit against public  participation—seeks to chill or punish a party's exercise of constitutional  rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances.  The Legislature enacted Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16—known as the  anti-SLAPP statute—to provide a procedural remedy to dispose of lawsuits that  are brought to chill the valid exercise of constitutional rights.” (Rusheen  v. Cohen (2006) 37 Cal.4th 1048, 1055–56, citations omitted.)   “In light of the  foregoing, we may summarize a court's task  in ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion to strike as follows. Section 425.16,  subdivision (b)(1) requires the court to engage in a two-step process. First,  the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the  challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity. The moving  defendant's burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the  plaintiff complains were taken ‘in furtherance of the [defendant]'s right of  petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in  connection with a public issue,’ as defined in the statute. (§ 425.16, subd.  (b)(1).) If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then determines  whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the  claim. Under section 425.16, subdivision (b)(2), the trial court in making  these determinations considers ‘the pleadings, and supporting and opposing  affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.’” (Equilon  Enters. v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67.)   “Only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the  anti-SLAPP statute—i.e., that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit—is a SLAPP, subject to  being stricken under the statute.” (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29  Cal.4th 82, 88­–89, emphases in original.)   IV.       Discussion   A.       The Parties’ Arguments   Defendants move the Court to strike the  entire FAC and award Defendants attorney’s fees in bringing the anti-SLAPP  Motion. (Anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 18:14–16.)   Defendants argue: (1) that police reports are  protected activity; and (2) that Code of Civil Procedure section 366.2 bars  every cause of action in the FAC. (Anti-SLAPP Motion, pp. 16:3, 17:11.)   Plaintiff disagrees, arguing: (1) that  Plaintiff did not allege any protected activity, including any police report;  (2) that none of Defendants’ conduct is privileged or protected; (3) that  Plaintiff demonstrates minimal merit; (4) that Plaintiff’s causes of action are  within the statute of limitations; (5) that Plaintiff will succeed on each of  his causes of action; (6) that Defendants’ other arguments are factually  incorrect and irrelevant; and (7) that the Court should sanction Defendants for  bringing a frivolous anti-SLAPP motion. (Opposition, pp. 2:22–24, 3:24, 5:3, 4:16–17,  6:19–20, 7:18–19, 8:7–8, 7:15, 9:23, 10:21–22, 11:11, 12:15–16, 13:1, 13:14–15,  14:5–6, 14:16–18, 14:20–22.)   In their Reply, Defendants argue: (1) that  Plaintiff admits this action was only filed after a police report led to his  arrest; (2) that Plaintiff cannot meet his burden to show his claims have any  merit; and (3) that Defendants have been sued only on the liability of a  decedent, which bars all claims due to the statute of limitations in Code of  Civil Procedure section 366.2. (Reply, p. 4:5–6, 6:13, 7:1, 9:3–4.)   B.       The First Prong   1.       Legal Standard   “The defendant's first-step burden is to identify the  activity each challenged claim rests on and demonstrate that that activity is  protected by the anti-SLAPP statute. A claim may be struck only if the speech  or petitioning activity itself is the wrong complained of, and not just evidence of  liability or a step leading to some different act for which liability is  asserted. To determine whether a claim arises from protected activity, courts  must consider the elements of the challenged claim and what actions by the  defendant supply those elements and consequently form the basis for liability. Courts then must evaluate  whether the defendant has shown any of these actions fall within one or more of  the four categories of acts protected by the anti-SLAPP statute.” (Wilson v.  Cable News Network, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 871, 884 [cleaned up], emphasis  in original.)   “As used in this  section, ‘act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under  the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue’  includes: (1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a  legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official  proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made  in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,  executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by  law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the  public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4)  any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of  petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public  issue or an issue of public interest.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (e).)   “An act is in  furtherance of the right of free speech if the act helps to advance that right  or assists in the exercise of that right.” (Tamkin v. CBS Broad., Inc. (2011)  193 Cal.App.4th 133, 143, citation omitted.)   There is “a  two-step inquiry for deciding whether the activity from which a lawsuit arises  falls within section 425.16(e)(4)'s protection: first, we ask what  public issue or issues the challenged activity implicates, and second, we ask  whether the challenged activity contributes to public discussion of any such  issue. If the answer to the second question is yes, then the protections of the  anti-SLAPP statute are triggered, and the plaintiff in the underlying lawsuit  must establish ‘a probability’ of prevailing before the action may proceed.” (Geiser  v. Kuhns (2022) 13 Cal.5th 1238, 1243, citing FilmOn.com Inc. v.  DoubleVerify Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 133, 149–150; Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16,  subd. (b).)   “At this stage,  the question is only whether a defendant has made out a prima facie case that  activity underlying a plaintiff's claims is statutorily protected, not whether  it has shown its acts are ultimately lawful. . . . Consistent with this  understanding, at the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, we routinely have  examined the conduct of defendants without relying on whatever improper motive  the plaintiff alleged.” (Wilson, supra, 7 Cal.5th at p. 888,  citations omitted.)   2.      The Alleged Conduct at Issue   The following is  the conduct that Plaintiff alleges Defendants engaged in:   (1)        that Defendants did not  provide Plaintiff with his final paycheck of $4,480.00 (FAC, ¶ 36);   (2)        that Defendants did not  provide Plaintiff with his final wages at the time of the termination of his  employment (FAC, ¶ 39);   (3)        that Defendants did not  indemnify or reimburse Plaintiff for substantial necessary business expenses  for which Plaintiff was not reimbursed, such as expenses for travel, cellular  telephone services, and home internet usage (FAC, ¶¶ 45–47);   (4)        that Defendants engaged  in unlawful business practices by violating various sections of the Labor Code  (FAC, ¶¶ 53–55);   (5)        that Defendants did not  deliver an edging machine to Plaintiff or permit him to take possession of it (FAC,  ¶¶ 64, 68);   (6)        that Defendants  prevented Plaintiff from receiving funds that he is entitled to receive as a  result of his 50% ownership of Faro Management, LLC (FAC, ¶ 71);   (7)        that Defendants retained  $33,000.00 Plaintiff sent to them while wrongfully retaining the edging machine  at issue (FAC, ¶¶ 76–78);   (8)        that Defendants orally  misrepresented to Plaintiff that they would return the edging machine at issue  when they received $33,000.00 (FAC, ¶ 81–82);   (9)        that Defendants sold  property partly owned by Plaintiff but retained all the income and/or profits  (FAC, ¶¶ 87–89);   (10)     that Defendants’ acts of  misappropriation have caused an existing balance between Defendants and  Plaintiff to become unknown (FAC, ¶¶ 93–94); and   (11)     that Defendant Soraya  Moazaam fraudulently misrepresented to the California Secretary of State that  Defendant Faro Management, LLC is wound up by vote of all members (FAC, ¶ 101).     3.      Discussion   Nowhere in the  FAC does Plaintiff mention the police, an alleged report to the police, and  alleged police report, or an alleged arrest.  The closest the pleading comes to referencing  such items is when Plaintiff alleges: (1) that Defendant Soraya Moazaam “began  behaving erratically [and] accused [Plaintiff] of fraud and theft . . .”; and (2)  that Defendant Soraya Moazaam subsequently “contacted [Plaintiff] through  counsel and accused him of stealing funds, frames and lenses, examination  equipment, and of stealing the $33,000 for the edging machine.” (FAC, ¶¶ 20,  25; see also anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 5:12–18.) But Plaintiff does not allege that  the police, police reports, or arrests are the conduct at issue for the causes  of action that are pleaded in the FAC.   The Court agrees that  issues involving the police, reports to and by the police, and arrests can  implicate issues that would fall under the ambit of protected activity for the  purposes of the anti-SLAPP statutes. Yet there is no basis to strike the pleading merely because these issues  involving the police might have happened prior to Plaintiff filing the original  Complaint or the FAC. Rather, the pleading itself must include “[a] cause of  action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of  the person’s right of petition or free speech . . . in connection with a public  issue . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)   Here, Plaintiff did not sue Defendants for malicious prosecution,  defamation, wrongful arrest, or any other cause of action based on conduct that  might be protected activity.   Indeed, the vast majority of the conduct that is alleged does not even  come close to protected conduct. The conduct involving wages, withholding  funds, and selling property without dispersing amounts owed are not directly  protected activity nor are they acts in furtherance of protected activity.    Two pieces of conduct do give the Court pause: (1) the alleged oral  misrepresentation to Plaintiff that Defendants would return the edging machine at issue  when they received $33,000.00; and (2) the alleged misrepresentation to the  California Secretary of State that Defendant Faro Management, LLC was wound up  by vote of all members. (FAC, ¶¶ 81–82, 101.)   As to the first  issue above, an oral misrepresentation in creating a private contract is not  free speech “in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.”   As to the second issue,  Defendants have not made any arguments regarding alleged misrepresentations to  the California Secretary of State. Indeed, no arguments are made at all about  this alleged conduct in either the anti-SLAPP Motion or the Reply. Nor have  Defendants provided the Court with any evidence regarding these allegations. Therefore,  the Court does not consider further the allegations of misrepresentations to  the California Secretary of State.            In  summary, Defendants have not met their initial burden on the first prong to  show that Plaintiff has pleaded any cause of action against Defendants that  involves Defendants’ protected activity. The Court need not and does not reach  the second prong.    The Court DENIES  the anti-SLAPP Motion.    C.      Attorney’s Fees   1.      Legal Standard   “Except as  provided in paragraph (2), in any action subject to subdivision (b), a  prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover  that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs. If the court finds that a special  motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay,  the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to a plaintiff  prevailing on the motion, pursuant to Section 128.5.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  425.16, subd. (c)(1).)   “A trial court may  order a party, the party’s attorney, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses,  including attorney’s fees, incurred by another party as a result of actions or  tactics, made in bad faith, that are frivolous or solely intended to cause  unnecessary delay. This section also applies to judicial arbitration  proceedings under Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 1141.10) of Title 3 of  Part 3.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (a).)   “For purposes of this  section:   “(1) ‘Actions or tactics’ include, but are  not limited to, the making or opposing of motions or the filing and service of  a complaint, cross-complaint, answer, or other responsive pleading. The mere  filing of a complaint without service thereof on an opposing party does not  constitute ‘actions or tactics’ for purposes of this section.   “(2) ‘Frivolous’ means totally and completely  without merit or for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing party.”   (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.5, subd. (b).)   2.      Discussion   Defendants  request fees in connection with their anti-SLAPP Motion. Because the anti-SLAPP  Motion has been denied, there is no basis to award Defendants attorney’s fees.  The Court DENIES Defendants’ Request for Fees.     Plaintiff  requests fees and costs for having to defend against the frivolous anti-SLAPP  Motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 425.16, subd. (c)(1); 128.5, subd. (a).)  The Court grants Plaintiff fifteen (15) days  leave to file a motion for attorney’s fees and costs.      V.          Conclusion   The anti-SLAPP  Motion is DENIED.            Defendants’ Request for Fees  is DENIED.    Plaintiff is  GRANTED fifteen (15) days leave to file a motion for attorney’s fees and costs.
