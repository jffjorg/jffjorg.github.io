And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for leave to amend the cross-complaint to add Diversified Utility Services, Inc. (DUSI) as a cross-defendant. The motion was brought by the defendant, Southern California Edison Company, seeking to enforce a contractual indemnity agreement against DUSI. The court found that the claims against DUSI are based on the contractual relationship between the two companies and do not involve the same legal and factual issues as the claims against the original defendants. The court also noted that trial is approaching and any claims against DUSI for indemnity will not become ripe unless it is determined that the defendant is liable to the plaintiffs for damages. The court concluded that the potential for another trial continuance and the complexity of adding another party to the action at this late stage outweighed the benefits of allowing the amendment.
