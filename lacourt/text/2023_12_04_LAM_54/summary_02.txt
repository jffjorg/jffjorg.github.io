And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel verified responses to discovery. The plaintiff had failed to serve verifications to the discovery requests, and the defendant had requested that the plaintiff do so. The judge notes that the plaintiff had served unverified responses to the discovery requests on February 13, April 19, and May 15, 2023, but had not provided verifications. The defendant's motion was granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to serve verifications to the discovery requests within 15 days of the ruling. The defendant's request for sanctions was denied, as it did not specify the amount of sanctions requested.
