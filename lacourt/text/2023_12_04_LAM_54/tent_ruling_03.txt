BACKGROUND
                
On August 8, 2023, Plaintiff Curtis Randolph sued Defendant Bank of
America, N.A., and others, asserting causes of action for (1) conversion; (2)
unjust enrichment; (3) UCL violations; and (4) negligent misrepresentation.
Plaintiff alleges the Note and/or Deed
of Trust for Plaintiff’s mortgage loan hid the “actual lender;” the loan was
improperly assigned; and the loan was improperly placed into a securitized
trust pool.
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Defendants’ request for judicial notice is GRANTED.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or to any
of the causes of action in it.  (CCP §
430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only
the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual
allegations or the plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996)
50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court
must treat as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.  (Id. at 732-33.)  The complaint is to be construed liberally to
determine whether a cause of action has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
Defendant demurs to the complaint on the grounds that it is barred by
res judicata and the statute of limitations and that it fails to state
sufficient facts.
 
A demurrer lies where the dates alleged
in the complaint show “clearly and affirmatively” that the action is barred by
a statute of limitations.  It is not
enough that the complaint shows that the action may be barred.  (Geneva Towers Ltd. Partnership v. City of
San Francisco (2003) 29 Cal.4th 769, 781.) 
The statute of limitations begins to run when the cause of action
“accrues.”  (CCP § 312.) A cause of
action “accrues” when, under the substantive law, the wrongful act is done or
the wrongful result occurs, and the consequent liability arises.  (Norgart v. Upjohn Co. (1999) 21
Cal.4th 383, 397.)  That is, a cause of
action accrues “upon the occurrence of the last element essential to the cause
of action.”  (Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Ass’n v. City of La Habra (2001) 25 Cal.4th 809, 815.)  
 
The statute of limitations
for Plaintiff’s conversion cause of action is three years. (Code of Civ. Proc.
§ 338(c).) The statute of limitations for unjust enrichment is three years.
(Code of Civ. Proc. § 338(d).) The statute of limitations for a violation of
Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 is four years. (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17208.)
Lastly, the statute of limitations for negligent misrepresentation is three
years. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 338(d).)
 
Plaintiff alleges the
fraudulent Deed of Trust was recorded in 2011. Plaintiff’s home was foreclosed
on and sold on March 28, 2019. Plaintiff filed this lawsuit more than four
years later, on August 8, 2023. Plaintiff’s complaint is barred on its face by
statute of limitations. The Court need not address the remaining arguments.
 
Defendants’ demurrer is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend. As the complaint is barred, it cannot be
remedied by amendment. Additionally, Plaintiff has failed to oppose this motion
to request leave for amend.
