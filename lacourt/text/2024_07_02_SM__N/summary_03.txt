And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the motion of Jeffrey Tamkin and Tamkin Development Corporation to stay the civil action pending the resolution of the criminal proceedings against Tamkin. The Judge finds that the interests of justice do not require a stay, and the factors identified in Avant! Corp. v. Superior Court weigh in favor of denying the motion. Specifically, the Judge notes that Tamkin Development Corporation does not have a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and Plaintiff's interest in proceeding expeditiously with the litigation outweighs the potential burden on Defendants. The Judge also finds that the criminal case does not concern conduct against Plaintiff, and therefore, all discovery in this case will not require Tamkin to choose between testifying and asserting his Fifth Amendment rights.
