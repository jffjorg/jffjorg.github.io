Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Vervent, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary Adjudication. The ruling finds that Plaintiffs' claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, accounting, and declaratory judgment are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs' claims are not timely under either the four-year or two-year statute of limitations, and that the continuous accrual doctrine does not apply. The ruling also denies Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as MOOT.
