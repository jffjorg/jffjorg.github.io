And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The motion is denied. The defendant, Gilbert Azafrani, was served with a summons on January 23, 2022, and the proof of service indicates that he was personally served. The defendant claims that he was not served and was in bed at the time, but the court finds that the defendant has not sufficiently rebutted the presumption of proper service. The court also notes that the defendant has previously moved to set aside a default and quash service of summons, and that motion was denied. The defendant is required to file an answer to the complaint within 15 days of entry of this order. The court also notes that the defense counsel's use of font and spacing in the motion is unnecessarily difficult to read and asks counsel to limit such changes to necessary ones.
