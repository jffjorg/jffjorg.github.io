TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendants Saman Manavi and Manavi Law Group Demurrer without
Motion to Strike as to the 1st through 6th causes of
action in Plaintiff Jay Scott Cohen’s Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend. Plaintiff’s 2nd through 6th causes of action are
barred by the actual innocence requirement. Plaintiff’s 1st cause of
action for civil conspiracy is not a cause of action and thus cannot be claimed
against Defendants. 
 
Defendants
Saman Manavi and Manavi Law Group’s RJN is GRANTED.
 
            “In a legal malpractice case arising out of a criminal
proceeding, California, like most jurisdictions, also requires proof of actual
innocence.” (Coscia v. McKenna & Cuneo (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1194, 1200;
see Wiley v. County of San Diego (1998) 19 Cal.4th 532.) “Public
policy considerations require that only an innocent person wrongly convicted be
deemed to have suffered a legally compensable harm. Unless a person convicted
of a criminal offense is successful in obtaining postconviction relief, the
policies reviewed in Wiley preclude recovery in a legal malpractice
action.” (Coscia, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 1201.) "[A]ctual
innocence is a necessary element of the plaintiff's cause of action" in
actions alleging malpractice in a prior criminal case. (Wiley, supra,
19 Cal. 4th at p. 545.)
 
            “[T]he doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes
relitigation of guilt in a malpractice action when the plaintiff remains
convicted.” (Ibid.) “[A]n individual convicted of a criminal offense
must obtain reversal of his or her conviction, or other exoneration by
postconviction relief, in order to establish actual innocence in a criminal malpractice
action.” (Ibid.) “Such a conviction, regardless whether it follows a
plea of guilty (or nolo contendere) or a trial, bars proof of actual
innocence in a legal malpractice action.” (Id., at p. 1205; see Cote
v. Henderson (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 796, 803 [“a plea of nolo contendere is
considered the same as a plea of guilty. Upon a plea of nolo contendere the
court shall find the defendant guilty, and its legal effect is the same as a
plea of guilty for all purposes. (§ 1016, subd. (3).) It negates the element of
a favorable termination, which is a prerequisite to stating a cause of action
for malicious prosecution.”].)
 
            Defendants Saman Manavi and Manavi Law Group (“Manavi
Defendants”) demurrer to the 1st through 6th causes of
action within Plaintiff Jay Scott Cohen’s (“Cohen”) Complaint arguing all six
causes of action are barred by the actual innocence requirement. The Manavi
Defendants show all six causes of action, including claims for civil
conspiracy, fraud, professional negligence, declaratory relief, abandonment,
and legal malpractice, arise out Cohen’s primary right asserted of professional
negligence. (Demurrer, pp. 7–8; see Khodayari v. Mashburn (2011) 200
Cal.App.4th 1184, 1190 [“the nature of a cause of action does not depend on the
label the plaintiff gives it or the relief the plaintiff seeks but on the
primary right involved.” [citation] Here, it is clear that the primary right
involved in all of appellant's claims is “the right to competent legal
representation” [citation], and thus, for application of the actual innocence
requirement, all are properly characterized as claims for legal malpractice.”];
see also Bird, Marella, Boxer & Wolpert v. Superior Court (2003) 106
Cal.App.4th 419, 427.)
 
The
Manavi Defendants show the 2nd through 6th causes of
action allege that if the Manavi Defendants had done a better job “the outcome
of the proceeding would have been different,” thus each cause of action is
alleging defective representation and falls under the actual innocence requirement.
(See Compl., Cohen RJN, Ex. C, pp. 39:14-18; 40:2-5 and 21-23; 41:7-9, 22-26.)
The Manavi Defendants argue the first cause of action for conspiracy is not an
actual cause of action as acknowledged by Cohen in the complaint, and by black
letter law. (See Compl., RJN Ex. C, p. 38:27–28; see also Moran v. Endres
(2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 952, 954–955[“Standing alone, a conspiracy does no harm
and engenders no tort liability. It must be activated by the commission of an
actual tort.”].)
 
The
Court finds the 2nd through 6th causes of action arise of
the alleged defective representation and thus require the pleading of actual
innocence as an essential element. Here, Cohen plead nolo contendere to felony count
of violating Penal Code § 532(A) in Case No. BA484182, the case which Cohen
claims the Manavi Defendants committed malpractice.   Cohen does not, and cannot, allege
he has been exonerated of the felony he plead nolo contendere to, and in fact
Cohen’s opposition concedes that he plead guilty. (See Oppo., p. 2:11–12.).
Cohen cannot plead that he has been found innocent of the felony he plead
guilty to, and thus Cohen cannot plead an essential element of the 2nd
through 6th causes of action. Therefore, Defendants Demurrer to the
2nd through 6th causes of action is SUSTAINED without
leave amend. 


Finally,
the Court finds that the 1st cause of action for civil conspiracy is
not an actual cause of action pursuant to Moran and thus the demurer to
the 1st cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend as to
the Manavi Defendants.
