And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer without motion to strike filed by the defendants, Saman Manavi and Manavi Law Group, against the plaintiff, Jay Scott Cohen. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff's claims for legal malpractice, professional negligence, declaratory relief, abandonment, and civil conspiracy are barred by the actual innocence requirement. The judge agrees with the defendants and sustains their demurrer to the 2nd through 6th causes of action without leave to amend, as the plaintiff has not pleaded actual innocence and has pleaded guilty to a felony. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the 1st cause of action for civil conspiracy, as it is not an actual cause of action. The judge grants the defendants' request to strike the pleaded causes of action.
