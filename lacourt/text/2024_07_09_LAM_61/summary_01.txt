And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Admire 3377 Family Limited Partnership, has moved for summary judgment on its sole cause of action for breach of lease against the defendant, Ki Jong Oh. The plaintiff has presented evidence that the defendant failed to pay contract rent and that the defendant remained in possession of the premises for the full duration of the lease term.

The defendant has argued that the government-ordered closure of the premises during the COVID-19 pandemic constituted an irresistible superhuman cause excusing performance of the lease. However, the defendant has failed to present any evidence to support this argument.

The court has found that the doctrine of frustration of purpose does not apply, as the defendant remained in possession of the premises for the full duration of the lease term and did not attempt to rescind the lease. The court has also found that the defense of impossibility under Civil Code ยง 1511 does not apply, as the government closure orders did not make it illegal for the defendant to pay rent.

Therefore, the court has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are no triable issues as to the elements of the plaintiff's claims or the defendant's affirmative defenses.
