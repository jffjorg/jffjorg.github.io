Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Obsidian Development, LLC's renewed motion to set aside the default entered against them. The court finds that Obsidian's neglect was excusable due to their reasonable attempts to contact Plaintiff's counsel and resolve the matter informally prior to litigation. The court also notes that Obsidian has cured their previous procedural deficiency by providing a proposed responsive pleading. The motion is granted, and Obsidian is to file its answer within 10 days.
