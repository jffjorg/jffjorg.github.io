And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer brought by Arman Yurman to the defendants' cross-complaint. The defendants have alleged various causes of action against Yurman, including assault, battery, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, promissory fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conversion, violation of Penal Code ยง 496, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the first, second, fourth, seventh, ninth, and tenth causes of action without leave to amend, finding that they are barred by the statute of limitations. The court has overruled the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, finding that the defendants have adequately pleaded their claim.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action with 20 days' leave to amend, finding that the defendants' allegations are unclear and do not provide sufficient notice to Yurman of the claims.

The court has also addressed the doctrine of equitable tolling, finding that the defendants have not sufficiently demonstrated timely notice of their claims such that the doctrine applies.

Overall, the court's tentative ruling is a mixed bag, with some causes of action being sustained and others being overruled or sustained with leave to amend.
