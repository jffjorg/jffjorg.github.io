And here is the English-text summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion brought by Spare CS Inc. (Spare) to set aside an order confirming an arbitration award in favor of Two Nine Sports Inc. (Petitioner). The arbitration award was made on October 12, 2023 for $148,474.12. Spare argues that it did not receive notice of the petition to confirm the arbitration award, while Petitioner claims that Spare's motion is defective and that it did not receive notice.

The Judge grants Petitioner's request for judicial notice of Spare's corporate status with the California Secretary of State and the California Franchise Tax Board, which shows that Spare's corporate status is suspended due to its lack of good standing with the Franchise Tax Board.

The Judge finds that Spare lacks the capacity to bring the motion and that it must necessarily fail unless Spare can demonstrate compliance with the process of revival. Since Spare has submitted no evidence of revival, the motion is denied.
