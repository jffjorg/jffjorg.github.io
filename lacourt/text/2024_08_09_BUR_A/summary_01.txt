And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants American Express National Bank's motion to vacate the conditional dismissal and enter judgment against Michael J. Duda. The parties had previously stipulated to the entry of a conditional judgment against Duda, which was conditioned on him making settlement payments. However, Duda made only $13,950.00 in settlement payments and then stopped paying. Despite notice to Duda of his default, he remains in arrears on the settlement. The court finds that Amex has demonstrated that the parties stipulated to the entry of judgment against Duda, and therefore grants the motion to vacate the conditional dismissal and enter judgment in the amount of $20,902.52, including $20,902.52 in principal and $77.19 in costs.
