ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Two Nine
Sports Inc. (Petitioner) previously brought a petition to confirm an
arbitration award obtained against Spare CS, Inc. (Spare). The arbitration
award was made on October 12, 2023 for $148,474.12. On April 19, 2024, the
Court confirmed the arbitration award in Petitioner’s favor. Spare provided no
opposition to the petition. 
 
Before
the Court is a motion brought by Spare seeking relief from the Court’s April 19
order. Spare argues that it did not receive notice of the petition until after
the Court confirmed the arbitration award. Petitioner opposes the instant
motion, arguing that 1) Spare’s motion is defective on a variety of grounds and
2) Spare’s contention that they did not receive notice is without merit. 
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
Request
for Judicial Notice 
 
Petitioner
requests judicial notice of the following documents: 
 
1.     
A
printout of Spare’s Corporate Status from the California Secretary of State
Website, attached as Exhibit A. 
 
2.     
A
printout of Spare’s status with the California Franchise Tax Board, attached as
Exhibit B. 
 
Petitioner
argues that both of these documents are the proper subject of judicial notice,
as they are records of a California state agency. (See Rodas v. Spiegel
(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 518 [ holding that judicial notice of records,
reports, and orders of administrative agencies are the subject of proper
judicial notice pursuant to Evidence Code § 452(c).].) The Court agrees that
the records are the proper subject of judicial notice and Petitioner’s request
is GRANTED. 
 
Spare’s
Corporate Status 
 
Petitioner
first argues that Spare cannot properly bring the instant motion because it
lacks the right to do so as a suspended corporation under Revenue & Taxation
Code (RTC) § 23301. 
 
A
corporation whose powers have been suspended for nonpayment of the corporate
franchise tax lacks capacity to sue in California courts; and, if sued, it
lacks capacity to defend. (RTC § 23301; Reed v. Norman (1957) 48 Cal.2d
338, 342; see Bourhis v. Lord (2013) 56 Cal.4th 320, 324; Color-Vue,
Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603-1604 [“suspension of
corporate powers results in a lack of capacity to sue, not a lack of standing
to sue”].) During the period that a corporation is suspended for failure to pay
taxes, it may not prosecute or defend an action, appeal from an adverse
judgment, or seek a writ of mandate. (Grell v. Laci Le Beau Corp. (1999)
73 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1306.) A suspended corporation has no right to defend or
participate in a lawsuit. (Cadle Co. v. World Wide Hospitality Furniture, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 504, 513.)
 
Once the
delinquent taxes (plus interest and penalties) are paid, the corporation's
powers are restored, thus “reviving” its capacity to sue or defend. But such
revivor is “without prejudice to any action, defense or right which has accrued
by reason of the original suspension ...” (RTC §§ 23305, 23305a; Electronic
Equip. Express, Inc. v. Donald H. Seiler & Co. (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d
834, 843; see Friends of Shingle Springs Interchange, Inc. v. County of El
Dorado (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1484 [dismissal proper where suspended
corporation did not have standing to sue when it filed mandate petition and did
not satisfy revivor requirements until after statute of limitations expired].)
Revivor of a corporation's powers validates any procedural step taken on its
behalf while it was under suspension: “Procedural acts . . . are validated
retroactively by corporate revival.” (Benton v. County of Napa (1991)
226 Cal.App.3d 1485, 1489-1490; Moofly Productions, LLC v. Favila (2018)
24 Cal.App.5th 993, 1000.) Most litigation activity is characterized as “procedural”
for purposes of corporate revival. (Benton v. County of Napa, supra, 226
Cal.App.3d at p. 1490.) The purpose of the suspension is to put pressure on the
corporation to pay its taxes. “There is little purpose in imposing additional
penalties after the taxes have been paid.” (Peacock Hill Assn. v. Peacock
Lagoon Const. Co. (1972) 8 Cal.3d 369, 371.)
 
Here, Petitioner
draws the Court’s attention to the fact that Spare’s corporate status with the
California Secretary of State is listed as “Forfeited-FTB”. (See Matthews Jr.
Decl. Exh. A.) It appears that Spare has been listed inactive since April 2,
2024 at the least. (Id.) Petitioner also attaches a July 8, 2024 letter
from the California Franchise Tax Board, informing Spare that they are not in
good standing. (Matthews Jr. Decl. Exh. B.) 
 
The Court
is satisfied from the above showings that Spare’s status is suspended due to
its lack of good standing with the California Franchise Tax Board. As such, Spare
lacks the capacity to bring this motion and it must necessarily fail unless
Spare can demonstrate compliance with the process of revival. Spare has
submitted no evidence of revival in this case and acknowledges in its “Non-Reply”
that it lacks the capacity to bring this motion or participate further in this
litigation. (See August 2, 2024 Notice of Non-Reply.) 
 
Accordingly,
the motion to set aside the order confirming the arbitration award is DENIED. Given
denial on the grounds of Spare’s inability to bring the motion, the Court need
not address the merits of Spare’s request.
