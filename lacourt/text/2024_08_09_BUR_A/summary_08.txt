And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's applications for a writ of possession and orders a re-delivery bond of $80,000 for the defendants. The plaintiff, BMW Bank of North America, seeks to recover a 2022 BMW X5 vehicle that was purchased under a motor vehicle retail installment contract but was defaulted on by the defendants, Classic Hardwood Flooring, Inc. and Azat Stepanyan. The plaintiff has demonstrated its entitlement to possession of the property claimed and has met its burden in demonstrating its entitlement to a writ of possession. The judge finds that the defendants have no interest in the property and therefore waives the requirement to file an undertaking for their interest. The re-delivery bond of $80,000 is set to ensure that the defendants will return the vehicle and pay any damages or costs incurred by the plaintiff.
