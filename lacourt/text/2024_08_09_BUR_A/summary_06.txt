And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants and has made the following tentative rulings:

* The demurrer to the fourth cause of action for Damages Pursuant to Cal. Penal Code § 496(c) is overruled. The statute explicitly authorizes an independent cause of action, and the plaintiff's allegations of fraud and conversion are sufficient to state a cause of action.
* The motion to strike the claim for treble damages and the request for attorney's fees is denied. The statute provides the basis for the recovery of attorney's fees, and the plaintiff maintains a valid cause of action under Penal Code § 496(c).

The judge notes that the defendants' argument that the statutory cause of action is not independent is unpersuasive, and that the plaintiff's allegations of fraud and conversion are sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge also rejects the defendants' argument that the cause of action is duplicative of the causes of action for fraud and conversion, noting that the intent to commit theft is a separate element that distinguishes the statutory cause of action from the other causes of action.
