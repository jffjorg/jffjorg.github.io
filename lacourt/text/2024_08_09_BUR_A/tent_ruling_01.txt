ALLEGATIONS: 
 
American
Express National Bank (Amex) brings this action against Michael J. Duda
(Defendant). On April 5, 2021, the parties stipulated to the entry of a
conditional judgment against Defendant in the amount of $34,852.52. The Court
granted the stipulation, and the conditional judgment was entered. As condition
of this entry, Amex agreed to conditionally dismiss the action against
Defendant pursuant to C.C.P. § 664.6. 
 
Amex now
moves to vacate its conditional dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant
pursuant to the terms of the stipulation. Amex seeks entry of judgment in the
amount of $20,902.52. Amex also seeks to recover costs in the amount of $77.19
occurred in connection with the filing of this motion. Amex’s motion is unopposed,
and the memorandum of costs has not been disputed. 
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
C.C.P. §
664.6(a) provides: 
 
If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Amex has
sufficiently demonstrated that the parties stipulated to the entry of judgment
against Defendant in this matter in the event Defendant ceased making
settlement payments. (See Exh A ¶ 2.) Amex represents that Defendant made
$ 13,950.00 in settlement payments but thereafter stopped paying the
settlement. (Keith Decl. ¶¶ 9,10.) Despite notice to Defendant of his
default, Defendant remains in arrears on the settlement. (Keith Decl. ¶ 11,
Exh. C.) Amex states that the remaining balance for the stipulated settlement
is $20,902.52. (Keith Decl. ¶ 12.) 
 
Pursuant
to the stipulation, judgment is to be entered in favor of Amex in the amount of
$20,979.71, including $20,902.52 in principal and $77.19 in costs.
 
The court
will sign Amex’s proposed Order and enter the proposed Judgment.
