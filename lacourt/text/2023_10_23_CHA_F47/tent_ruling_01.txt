filed 10/10/23. 
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Ruben Ramirez
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Juan Carlos Saucedo
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order
compelling Defendant Juan Carlos Saucedo to provide further responses and
documents to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set 3.  Additionally, Plaintiff requests an award of
sanctions against Defendant Juan Carlos Saucedo and Defendant’s counsel in
favor of Plaintiff in the amount of $5,160.00.  

 
RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Ruben Ramirez’s
(Plaintiff) employment as a truck driver with/for Defendants: (1) Juan Carlos
Saucedo (Saucedo), (2) K12 School Services (K12), 
(3) Fresh Start Healthy School Meals (Fresh Start
Healthy) and (4) Fresh Start Meals, Inc. (Fresh Start Meals).  On 8/2/21, Plaintiff filed this action
against Defendants for: (1) Unpaid Overtime; (2) Unpaid Minimum Wages; (3)
Non-compliant Wage Statements; (4) Wages Not Timely Paid During and Upon
Separation of Employment; (5) Unpaid Business Expenses; (6) Unpaid Meal Period
Premiums; (7) Unpaid Rest Period Premiums; (8) Violation of California Business
& Professions Code§§ 17200, et seq.; and (9) Failure to Provide Employment
Records in Violation of Labor Code§§ 1198.5 & 432.7.
 
On 12/23/22, Saucedo, whom Plaintiff contends co-owns,
controls and is the Chief Executive Officer of the entity defendants, testified
that he is not the owner of Fresh Start Meals. 
Rather, Saucedo claimed he purchased the assets, but not the
liabilities, of Fresh Start Meals.  
 
In order to investigate Saucedo’s relationship with Fresh
Start Meals, including any purchase of the entity and the relationship between
the three entity defendants, Plaintiff served discovery on Defendants.
 
On 1/30/23, Plaintiff served Saucedo with Requests for
Production of Documents, Set 3. 
(Roshanian Decl., Ex.A).  On
4/3/23, after being granted extensions of time to respond, Saucedo served
responses to the discovery.  (Id.,
Ex.B).  On 4/13/23, Plaintiff sent a meet
and confer letter regarding what it perceived to be deficient responses.  (Id., Ex.C).  During the meet and confer process, it was
ultimately agreed that Saucedo would have until 5/19/23 to provide
supplemental/further responses and Plaintiff’s deadline to file a motion for
further responses would be extended until 6/13/23.  (Id., Ex.D-F).  On 5/18/23, Saucedo’s counsel filed and
served a motion to be relieved as counsel which was denied without prejudice on
9/21/23.  (Roshanian Decl.; 9/21/23
Minute Order).  Saucedo did not serve
supplemental responses as promised. 
(Roshanian Decl.).  On 5/22/23,
Plaintiff inquired as to whether further responses would be served or whether
motions should be filed.  (Id.,
Ex.G).  Saucedo did not respond.  Id. 
 
Therefore, on 6/9/23, Plaintiff filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order compelling 
Saucedo to provide further responses and produce documents to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set 3.  Additionally, Plaintiff requests an award of
sanctions against Saucedo and his counsel in favor of Plaintiff in the amount
of $5,160.00.  Saucedo has not filed an
opposition or any other response to the motion. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
By way of this motion, Plaintiff seeks to compel further
responses and/or the production of documents in relation to Requests 31, 32,
33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42 and 43.  (See
Plaintiff’s Separate Statement).
 
CCP 2031.310(a) provides: 
 
“On receipt of a response to a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding
party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) A statement of compliance with
the demand is incomplete.
(2) A representation of inability
to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.”
 
In response to Requests 31, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 41,
42 and 43 Saucedo asserts various objections and then states without waiving
such objections, no responsive documents exist. 
If a timely motion to compel further responses is filed, the responding
party has the burden to justify any objection. 
See Fairmont Insurance Co. (2000) 22 C4th 245, 255; Coy
(1962) 58 C2d 210, 220-221.  Saucedo has
failed to meet his burden of justifying the objections made in response to
these requests.  Additionally, Saucedo’s response/conclusion
that “no such documents exist” is insufficient. 
CCP 2031.230 provides: 
 
“A representation of inability to
comply with the particular demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent
search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
demand. This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is
because the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed,
has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The statement shall
set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.”
 
In response to Request 36 which seeks all documents
showing Saucedo did not acquire any of Fresh Start Meals, Inc.’s assets,
Saucedo asserts objections and then states without waiving the objections: “In
order to prove up the negative, this Responding Party would be required to turn
over all his personal financial information over an unspecified period of time.”  Saucedo has failed to meet his burden of
justifying the foregoing objections.  Fairmont
Insurance Co., supra.  It is
not clear what Saucedo means with the last sentence as it appears to be a
veiled/ambiguous objection based possibly on privacy or burden which he has,
again, failed to justify.  
 
Plaintiff is entitled to an award of sanctions against Saucedo
and his counsel of record for their failure to comply with their discovery
obligations.  CCP 2023.010(d), (e); CCP
2023.030(a); CCP 2030.310(h).  However,
the Court finds that the $5,160.00 requested to be excessive.  The Court awards $1,560 in sanctions (2 hours
to prepare the motion + 1 hour to appear x $500/hour + $60 filing fee).  The Court finds this motion is substantially
similar to motions heard on 10/9/23 and 10/16/23 as to other defendants.  Therefore, the time was adjusted
accordingly.     
 
CONCLUSION
 
The request to compel further responses is granted.  The request for sanctions is granted in the
reduced amount of $1,560.00.  Further
responses are due and sanctions are payable within 30 days.
