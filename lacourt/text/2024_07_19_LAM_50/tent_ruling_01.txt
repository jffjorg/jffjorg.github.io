  D. COHAN AND BEHZAD COHAN’S DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT



 
Background
On February 9, 2024,
Plaintiffs Sukhinderpal Gill and Angela Hercilia Ganem, individually and as
Trustees of the PSG Family Hycet Trust u/d/t December 6, 2011, the AHG Family
Hycet Trust, u/d/t December 6, 2011, and the Gill and Ganem Trust amended
and restated u/d/t September 5, 2012 (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a
Complaint for Specific Performance in this action against Defendants Behzad
Cohan and Nori D. Cohan, individually and as Trustees of the BC Family Hycet
Trust u/d/t December 6, 2011, the NC Family Hycet Trust u/d/t December 6, 2011,
and the Behzad and Nori D. Cohan Trust amended and restated u/d/t August 1,
2012 (collectively, “Defendants”). 
Defendants now demur to
the Complaint. Plaintiffs oppose. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter,
the Court notes that Defendants’ counsel’s declaration in support of the
demurrer provides, inter alia, that “[o]n April 3, 2024, I wrote
a detailed letter to Plaintiff’s counsel, Rich Pech pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, detailing
the core basis for Defendants’ intended demurrer…On April 5, 2024, Mr. Pech
sent a letter interspersing his responses for points raised in my letter…April
11, 2024, Mr. Pech and I engaged in further email exchanges regarding the
merits of the intended demurrer…Unfortunately, these exchanges did not succeed
in resolving the parties’ dispute.” (Robinson Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.) 
The Court notes that Defendants’
counsel’s declaration does not demonstrate that the parties met and
conferred in person, by telephone, or by video
conference, or that Defendants’
counsel attempted to do so. Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis
added.) Such meeting and conferring must be done in good faith with an
effort to try to resolve the issues subject to the demurrer. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Defendants’
demurrer is continued to _______________,
2024 at 2 p.m. in Dept. 50. 
Defendants
are¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiffs within 10 days of the date of
this order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the
parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, Defendants are to¿thereafter¿file
and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in
compliance with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days
of this order.¿
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.
