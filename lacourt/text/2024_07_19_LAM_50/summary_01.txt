And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' complaint. The defendants had filed a demurrer, which the plaintiffs opposed. The judge notes that the defendants' counsel did not demonstrate that the parties met and conferred in person, by telephone, or by video conference, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. The judge orders the defendants to meet and confer with the plaintiffs within 10 days and to file a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer if the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues. The hearing on the demurrer is continued to a later date.
