And here is the summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rosario Marcela Rivera Santos v. General Motors LLC. The case involves a dispute over the timely response to discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents. The defendant, General Motors LLC, filed motions to compel the plaintiff's initial responses, which were served belatedly. The Judge finds that the motions are mooted by the serving of belated written responses and denies the request for monetary sanctions. The Judge encourages the parties to stipulate to extend the time to bring a motion to compel further responses and to meet and confer on resolving the objections and any assertion of claimed insufficient substantive responses.
