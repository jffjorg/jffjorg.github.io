And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled on a motion to consolidate multiple cases involving the same incident. The cases were filed by different plaintiffs against Republic Services, Inc. and its employee, Terry Marshall, alleging negligence and negligent entrustment. The defendants argue that the cases are identical and that the evidence at trial will likely be the same, and therefore they should be consolidated. However, the judge has tentatively denied the motion because the defendants failed to comply with the procedural requirements for filing a motion to consolidate.

The judge notes that the defendants' motion does not list all of the parties in each case, does not contain the captions of all of the cases sought to be consolidated, and is not filed in each of the listed cases. The judge suggests that the defendants can circulate a stipulation to consolidate the cases, collect signatures from counsel in all of the cases, and then submit the stipulation with a proposed order.

The judge also recognizes that there are discrete issues as to each plaintiff's damages and that there may be disputes as to pre-existing or subsequent incidents that might affect apportionment of damages. Therefore, the judge is unlikely to try all of the cases together absent a stipulation to do so, but is receptive to consolidation of discovery to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
