Background
On May 13, 2022, Plaintiff
filed its complaint against Defendant in the instant action.  On August 30, 2022, Plaintiff filed its first
amended complaint (“FAC”).  On
March 15, 2023, this Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st
through 8th causes of action in its FAC with 20 days leave to amend.  (3/15/23 Minute Order.)  On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed its
SAC.  On October 5, 2023, this Court
sustained Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st through 8th causes of action
in its SAC with 20 days leave to amend.  (10/5/23 Minute Order.)
On October 25, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative TAC alleging eight causes of action: (1) intentional
interference with contractual relationship, (2) intentional interference with
prospective economic advantage, (3) negligent interference with prospective
economic advantage, (4) breach of contract, (5) breach of good faith and fair
dealing, (6) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, (7) constructive eviction,
and (8) declaratory relief, arising from alleged Defendant-landlord and
Plaintiff-tenant’s car wash lease agreement for the car wash portion of real
property at 3071 S. Robertson Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90034 (“Subject Property”).   (See TAC.)   
Defendant filed the instant
demurrer to Plaintiff’s TAC on November 22, 2023.  On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed its
opposition.  As of the date of this
hearing Defendant has not filed a reply.
 
          Summary of Allegations
Plaintiff alleges on or about
July 2018, Defendant entered into an oral lease agreement (“Agreement”) with
Plaintiff for the car wash portion of the Subject Property.  (TAC ¶7.)  Plaintiff alleges
pursuant to the Agreement Plaintiff was to pay $6,009.99 per month payable on
the first day of each month to Defendant.  (TAC ¶8.) 
Plaintiff alleges the rent was to increase by 3% per year.  (TAC ¶8.)  Plaintiff alleges as the tenant, Plaintiff
was entitled to use the entire car wash portion of the Subject Property, which
include the vacuum area, the car wash tunnel, including entrance and exit
areas, office, two storage rooms, electric room, employee restroom, drying,
parking and detail area adjacent to the tunnel exit, the parking space directly
east of the air and water area, and one parking space adjacent to the trash
area before the car wash tunnel.  (TAC ¶9.)  Plaintiff alleges pursuant to the Agreement,
Plaintiff was to maintain and bear the expenses and obligations of maintaining
the car wash portion of the Subject Property, landscaping of the Subject
Property, the waiting area of the Subject Property and the running fountain of
the Subject Property.  (TAC ¶10.)  
Plaintiff alleges starting in
July 2018, Plaintiff paid Defendant the rent due from July 2018 until July 2020
until the COVID-19 pandemic.  (TAC
¶11.)  Plaintiff alleges each
month Defendant accepted payment from Plaintiff and allowed continuous usage of
the car wash portion of the Subject Property.  (TAC ¶11.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant did not refuse
payment from Plaintiff to use the car wash portion of the Subject Property.  (TAC ¶11.)
Plaintiff alleges Defendant,
without notice, substantially reduced Plaintiff’s use of the Subject Property
by eliminating a lane for ingress to the car wash tunnel and the drying,
parking, and detailing areas, and notwithstanding this reduction in services, Defendant
continued to charge Plaintiff rent which exceeded the terms of the Lease
Agreement.  (TAC ¶12.)  Plaintiff alleges when it invoked its rights
under the Los Angeles Commercial Eviction Moratorium, Defendant retaliated by
filing an unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent, and Plaintiff was left with
no choice but to vacate the Subject Property.  (TAC
¶12.)  
Plaintiff
alleges in or about October 2020, Defendant found a buyer for Plaintiff to sell
the car wash business to, Armen Takayan (“Takayan”) and/or assignee.  (TAC
¶13.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant
represented that Takayan was a bona fide purchaser, and that Defendant would meet
any and all obligations necessary to proceed forward with the sale.  (TAC ¶14.) 
Plaintiff alleges that based on Defendant’s representation, in or about
October 2020, Plaintiff and Takayan executed a written purchase agreement, wherein
Plaintiff would sell the car wash business subject to the Agreement to Takayan
for $500,000.00.  (TAC ¶15.)  Plaintiff alleges that shortly thereafter,
Defendant unreasonably refused to perform his obligations necessary to close
the sale.  (TAC ¶16.)  Plaintiff alleges it and Takayan were left
with no choice but to cancel the sale.  (TAC
¶17.)    
 
Summary of Demurrer
Defendant argues Plaintiff’s TAC
fails because (1) the TAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action against Defendant; (2) the allegations in the TAC are uncertain; and
(3) in an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the
pleading whether the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct.  (Demurrer, pg. 3; C.C.P. §§430.10(e), (f),
(g).)
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer is a pleading used
to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings, i.e., it raises issues
of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s
pleading (complaint, petition, answer, or cross-complaint).  (C.C.P. §§422.10, 589; see Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [citing text]; Lewis
v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388 [citing text].)
A demurrer can be used only
to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or
from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318; Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at pg. 994 [citing text].)
 
Failure to State a Claim
          Entire TAC
Under
the sham pleading doctrine, plaintiffs are precluded from amending complaints
to omit harmful allegations, without explanation, from previous complaints to
avoid attacks raised in demurrers or motions for summary judgment.  (Deveny v.
Entropin, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 408, 425.)  Moreover, “[I]f a party files an amended
complaint […] by adding facts inconsistent with those of previous pleadings,
the court may take judicial notice of prior pleadings and may disregard any inconsistent
allegations.”  (Colapinto v. County of
Riverside (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 147, 151.)  “The policy against sham pleadings requires
the pleader to explain satisfactorily any such omission.”  (Deveny, 139 Cal.App.4th at pg. 425.)
Plaintiff on no less than three
separate occasions previously alleged that Car Care Consultant, Inc. (“CCI”), a former Nevada Corporation, had
assigned the lease to Plaintiff and that Defendant affirmatively ratified the
assignment by performance. Upon an affirmative showing that due to CCI’s
corporate status it lacked the ability to assign the lease to Plaintiff as a
matter of law and the inability to do so was fatal to Plaintiff’s causes of
action, the TAC now revises the allegations to omit any reference to the
assignment and Defendant’s ratifying acts and now reads that Defendant entered
into a wholly distinct oral lease for the Subject Property that, incongruent with
an assignment which would merely be a substitution of parties, amounted to an
agreement that included additional understandings concerning the parties’
respective obligations as well as future increases of the minimum monthly rent
due to Defendant by its terms.  Plaintiff’s
amendments do not clarify any ambiguity in the pleadings or offer additional
facts to support the causes of action pled.  The newly pled allegations in the TAC have been
reverse engineered in response to Defendant’s Demurrers in order to transform
that previously pled as an “assignment” into an “oral lease” in an effort to
circumvent Defendant’s otherwise appropriate challenge.  Therefore, the Court ignores Plaintiff’s
allegations in its TAC pertaining to the Agreement as an oral lease and takes
judicial notice of Plaintiff’s allegations in its SAC pertaining to the
November 21, 2014 car wash lease agreement between CCI and Defendant, which it
alleges it assigned to Plaintiff.  (See
SAC ¶¶7, 9, Exh. 1.)
CCI lacked
the ability to assign the Lease Agreement to Plaintiff.  CCI, possessing Nevada business identification
number NV20141199795 and entity number E0150412014-0 is identified as being
“permanently revoked” no later than December 1, 2014, well prior to the date
Plaintiff contends that CCI assigned the Lease Agreement to it and CCI has not
been reinstated to a good standing status. (See D-RJN, Exh. B.)
CCI
had no ability whatsoever to carry out any operations in California, include
the transfer and/or assignment of any Lease Agreement to Plaintiff. It is
well-settled that if a corporation has been suspended, forfeited or revoked, it
is not in good standing and loses its rights, powers, and privileges to do
business in California.  (See
Cal-Western Business Services, Inc. v. Corning Capital Group (2013) 221
Cal.App.4th 304; see also Nevada Revised Statutes (“N.R.S.”) §78-175.)
In
addition to the inability to prosecute or defend itself in a lawsuit, a
corporation that is either suspended or, as here, permanently revoked, forfeits
its corporate powers, cannot function as a corporation and is incapable under
the state statute of exercising corporate powers for any business purpose.  (McLaughlin Land & Livestock Co v.
Bank of America, National Trust & Savings Ass’n (9th Cir. 1938) 94 F.2d
491, 493 [applying state law].)  A
revoked corporation cannot carry out any operations available to a corporation
in good standing, including that it “cannot prevent another from adopting its
corporate name,” (Center for Self-Improvement & Community Development v.
Lennar Corp. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1543, 1552) and “cannot borrow money,
execute notes, or sell stock.”
Based
on the foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s TAC is sustained without
leave to amend.
 
          Conclusion
          Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s TAC
is sustained without leave to amend.
