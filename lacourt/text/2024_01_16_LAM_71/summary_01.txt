Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Defendants Mike Brown Grandstands, Inc. and Scott Northern's motion to augment their expert witness designation to substitute Brian D. Avery, Ph.D. as their events management and event safety expert in place of Bart Whitaker, who is unavailable for trial. The ruling also denies Plaintiffs Craig Nelson and Stacy Nelson's request for sanctions against Defendants and Defendants' request for sanctions against Plaintiffs. The Judge finds that Defendants have satisfied all the conditions required to grant leave to augment their expert witness designation and that the circumstances of Whitaker's unavailability make the imposition of sanctions unjust.
