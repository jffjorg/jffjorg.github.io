And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's third amended complaint without leave to amend. The demurrer was filed in response to the plaintiff's allegations regarding the validity and assignment of the oral lease agreement for the car wash portion of the Subject Property. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's allegations are invalid due to the revocation of CCI, the corporation that allegedly assigned the lease agreement to the plaintiff. The judge has also determined that the defendant's ratification of the assignment was ineffective due to CCI's lack of ability to assign the lease agreement. As a result, the plaintiff's causes of action are dismissed, and the defendant's demurrer is sustained.
