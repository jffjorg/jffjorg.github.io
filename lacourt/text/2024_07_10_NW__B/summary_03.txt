And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants Defendant CDC Madison Lomita LLC's Motion for Terminating Sanctions and orders the dismissal of Plaintiff Eva Mayes's First Amended Complaint with prejudice. The Court also grants the request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,678.23, which is to be paid by Plaintiff Eva Mayes within 30 days of the Court's Order.

The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to attend several noticed depositions and failed to comply with the Court's order, despite being sanctioned previously. The Court also finds that Plaintiff has a pattern of discovery abuse and that less severe sanctions have not been effective in promoting compliance with discovery rules.
