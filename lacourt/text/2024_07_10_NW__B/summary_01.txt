And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Chung's Motion to Bifurcate the liability and remedies portion of the trial. The motion was filed after the pretrial conference schedule, which is untimely under California Code of Civil Procedure § 598. The judge notes that the trial court has the discretion to bifurcate claims and try them separately, but this discretion is limited by the timing of the motion. The judge finds that the motion was filed too late and that the parties had ample opportunity to bring the motion in a timely manner. The judge also considers the potential prejudice to Plaintiff Rosales, including increased costs and the need for the parties to testify twice. Therefore, the judge denies the motion and orders that the parties proceed with the trial as scheduled.
