 
Tentative: The
Court has reviewed the request for default judgment against Cross-Defendant and
is CONTINUING the matter in order for Cross-Complainants to correct the
following defects:
 
1.     
Only
one Cross-Complainant (Blanca Schlup) has filed a statement of damages. There
is no statement of damages filed for Cross- Complainant Martha Bautista. If she
did not serve one prior to entering default against Cross-Defendant, Bautista’s
entry of default against Cross-Defendant will need to be stricken.
2.     
Further,
Cross-Complainant Bautista has not filed a declaration in support of the
judgment sought.
3.     
Request
for Court judgment on CIV-100 states that filing fees are in the amount of
$1,080, yet the declaration filed by counsel states $210 of that amount is for
service of process. Item 7 of CIV-100 should be amended accordingly.
