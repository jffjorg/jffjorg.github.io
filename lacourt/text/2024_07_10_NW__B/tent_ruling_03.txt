ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On August 20, 2021, Plaintiff Eva Mayes (“Mayes”) filed
an action against Defendants The Regents of the University of California
(“Regents”) and UCLA Sky Park Medical Facility (“Sky Park”) (collectively
“Defendants”) for general
negligence and premises liability.  On
November 4, 2022, Plaintiff amended the Complaint to add CDC Madison Lomita LLC
(“CDC”) as Defendant Doe 1.  On June 16,
2023, following stipulation of the parties, Plaintiff filed the First Amended
Complaint against Defendants Regents and CDC. 
Plaintiff alleges that on December 16, 2019, she sustained serious
injuries on the premises owned, possessed, worked upon, managed, supervised,
operated, maintained, or controlled by Defendants as a result of the negligent
placement of a stanchion outside of the elevator.
 
On July 31, 2023, Defendants Regents and CDC filed a
Cross-Complaint against Roes 1 through 25 for equitable indemnity,
contribution/apportionment of fault, declaratory relief, breach of contract,
and express indemnity.
 
On November 21, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s Request for
Dismissal, the Court dismissed Defendant Regents without prejudice.
 
On March 25, 2024, Defendant CDC filed the instant Motion
for Terminating Sanctions and Request for Monetary Sanctions (“Motion”).  No opposition has been filed.  On July 2, 2024, Defendant filed a Notice of
Non-Opposition to the Motion.
 
            On June 7,
2024, the matter was assigned to Judge Karen Moskowitz in Department B of the
Van Nuys Courthouse East.  
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence, or monetary
sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010(d), (g), 2023.030; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.040 requires that “[a]
request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person,
party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type
of sanction sought.”  Furthermore, the
notice of motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and authorities,
and accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of
any monetary sanction sought.  (Code of
Civ. Proc. § 2030.040.)
 
Monetary sanctions may be imposed “ordering that one engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct…unless [the Court] finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(a).)
 
Issue sanctions may be imposed “ordering that designated
facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim
of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process. The
court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing
designated claims or defenses.”  (Code of
Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(b).)
 
Evidence sanctions may be imposed “by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated
matters in evidence.”  (Code of
Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(c).)
 
In more extreme cases, the Court may also impose
terminating sanctions by “striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings,” “staying further proceedings,” “dismissing the action, or any part
of the action,” or “rending a judgment by default” against the party misusing
the discovery process.  (Code of Civ.
Proc. § 2030.030(d).)  The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate.  (Lang v.
Hochman (2000) 77¿Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) 
Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011)
196¿Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)  “[A]
penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance
with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or
bad faith.”  (Brown v. Sup. Ct.
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) 
“Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a
terminating sanction as a first measure [citations], a terminating sanction
should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe
alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows
lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” 
(Lopez v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604-605.)
 
In City of
Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC, the Court ruled that Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2023.010
and 2023.030 list the available discovery sanctions but do not independently
authorize a court to impose specific sanctions. 
(PriceewaterhouseCoopers (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
503-504.)  Thus, a court’s authority to
impose the sanctions specified in §§ 2023.010 and 2023.030 must arise from
a statute governing a particular method of discovery.  (Ibid.)
 
III.             
Discussion
 
Defendant CDC moves for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff
Mayes and for dismissal of the Complaint with prejudice.  (Mot. pp. 1-2.)  Defendant also moves for an order imposing
monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,428.23 against Plaintiff.  (Ibid.)
 
Defendant states that Plaintiff has failed to appear at
seven (7) properly noticed depositions. 
(Braun Decl. ¶¶ 2, 8-13, 15-16, Exs. A-I.)  On November 17, 2023, after Plaintiff failed
to appear at a deposition for the sixth time, Defendant Filed a Motion to
Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition.  The Court
granted Defendant’s Motion on December 15, 2023, and ordered Plaintiff to
appear at a mutually agreed upon date and to pay monetary sanctions in the amount
of $1,132.36.  Sanctions were paid and
the following deposition was set for February 6, 2024.  (Braun Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. H.)  On the day of the deposition, Plaintiff’s
counsel informed Defendant that she would not be attending the deposition.  (Ibid. at ¶ 6.)  Defendant recorded a Certificate of
Non-Appearance.  (Ibid., Ex. I.)
The Court notes that on March 28, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel and to date, the Court has been informed that
Plaintiff has not retained a new representative.
 
Defendant
also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,428.23 as follows: 10
hours of attorney time, billed at a rate of $500 per hour (6.5 hours for
preparing the instant Motion, 0.5 hour spent at the February 6, 2024,
deposition, additional 2 hours anticipated for reviewing Plaintiff’s opposition
and preparing a reply, and 1.5 hours to attend the hearing), $341.23 in Court
reporter fees for the final deposition, $15 for CourtCall, $60 in motion filing
fees, $12 for e-filing fees.  (Braun
Decl. ¶¶ 17-20.)
 
Defendant
argues that “Plaintiff has a pattern and practice of constant delays by failing
to participate in the discovery process even to the point of defying a Court
Order to appear for her deposition.” 
(Mot. p. 4.)  Although Plaintiff
has been sanctioned by the Court, she has continued to fail to comply with the
discovery process and the Court’s order. 
(Ibid.)  These delays have
“substantially interfered with Defendant’s ability to litigate and defend
against Plaintiff’s claims.”  (Ibid.
p. 5.)  Defendant also argues that
terminating sanctions are appropriate because Plaintiff’s violation has been
willful, demonstrated a history of abuse, and less severe sanctions have not
been effective.  (Ibid. at p. 6.)
 
First,
the Court notes that the Notices of Taking Deposition for the following dates
were issued solely by Defendant Regents, which has since been dismissed from
the case: September 27 and December 19, 2022, and April 17 and June 27,
2023.  (Braun Decl. ¶¶ 8-11, Exs.
A-D.)  On December 15, 2023, the Court
noted that there was no evidence that Plaintiff has served any valid objections
to the deposition notices and granted Defendant’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s
Deposition.  (12-15-23 Minute Order.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.450 governs the imposition
of sanctions when a party fails to obey a Court order compelling attendance,
testimony, and production at a noticed deposition.  According to § 2025.450(h), 
 
The court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
that party deponent or against the party with whom the deponent is affiliated.
In lieu of, or in addition to, this sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against that
deponent or against the party with whom that party deponent is affiliated, and
in favor of any party who, in person or by attorney, attended in the
expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken pursuant to that
order.
 
Pursuant to this section, the Court has authority to impose
any of the sanctions specified in § 2030.030.
 
In determining whether terminating sanctions are
appropriate in the instant case, the Court considers the totality of the circumstances,
including whether there has been a willful discovery order violation, a history
of abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with discovery rules.
 
Here, the Court finds that Defendant has presented
sufficient evidence to support its request for terminating sanctions.  Plaintiff has failed to attend several
noticed depositions and failed to comply with the Court’s December 15, 2024
Order.  Furthermore, monetary sanctions
have not been effective in promoting compliance with the Court’s order and
there is a pattern of discovery abuse. 
The Motion is unopposed, and Plaintiff has not demonstrated any
justification for her failure to comply with discovery.
 
The Court also finds that $2,678.23 in monetary sanctions
are appropriate, as follows: 4.5 hours of attorney time for preparing the
Motion, attending the final deposition, and appearing at the hearing on the
instant Motion, at $500 per hour, as well as $341.23 in Court reporter
fees, $15 for CourtCall, $60 in motion filing fees, and $12 for e-filing fees.
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions is GRANTED.  Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions is
also GRANTED in the amount of $2,678.23.
