DEMURRER
(CCP § 430.10)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants HB
Land Enterprises, LLC, et al.’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to amend.
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On September 7, 2021, Plaintiff Richard
Harris (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed a personal injury action
against Defendants HB Land Enterprises LLC (“HB”) and Yasmin Saad Nowyhed
(“Nowyhed”) (collectively “Defendants”). 
On November 2, 2021, and April 8, 2022, Plaintiff filed Amendments
correcting Defendant Nowyhed’s name to “Saade Nowyhed” and Defendant HB’s name
to “HB Land Enterprises LLC dba Arco.”
 
On May 9, 2024, Defendants HB and
Nowyhed filed the instant Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint.  No opposition has been filed.
 
            On June 7,
2024, the matter was assigned to Judge Karen Moskowitz in Department B of the
Van Nuys Courthouse East.
 
II.                
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer is a pleading that may
be used to test the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in the
complaint.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §
430.10.)  There are two types of
demurrers – general demurrers and special demurrers.  (See McKenney v. Purepac
Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 77.)
 
General demurrers can be used to
attack pleadings for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e); McKenney,
167 Cal.App.4th at 77.)  Such
demurrers can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable;
evidence or extrinsic matters are not considered.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 430.30, 430.70;
Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  For the
purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the Court admits “all material
facts properly pleaded” and “matters which may be judicially noticed,” but does
not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.
[Citation].”  (Blank, 39 Cal.3d at
318.)  It gives these facts “a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.”  (Ibid.). At the pleading
stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the
defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him.  (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.
App. 3d 714, 721.)  The face of the
complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94.)  "If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence."  (Holland v.
Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.). Special
demurrers can be used to attack the pleadings on grounds that the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible, or in a contract case, for failure to
allege whether a contract is oral or written. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41
requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed
the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether
an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in
the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least
five days before the date the responsive pleading is due.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the demurring party shall file
and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(3).)
 
When a demurrer
is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility
that the defect can be cured by amendment. 
(Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set
of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the
plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be
deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings
were defective for lack of particulars.” 
(Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 892, 900.)  Generally, the court will allow leave to
amend on at least the first try, unless there is absolutely no possibility of
overcoming the issue.  (See Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227 ("Denial of
leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the complaint shows on
its face it is incapable of amendment. 
[Citation.]  Liberality in
permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect
has not been given.").)
 
III.             
Discussion
 
A.   
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Defendants request that the Court
take judicial notice of the (1) Complaint filed on September 7, 2021, and (2)
the Summons issued on September 23, 2021. 
(Mot. p. 2.)  Although it is not
necessary to take judicial notice of documents filed in the instant case,
Defendants’ request is granted.
 
B.    
Meet and Confer Requirement
 
Defense counsel Stanley E. Germany,
Esq. indicates that he has made several attempts to reach Plaintiff by telephone;
however, Plaintiff has not responded to his requests to meet and confer.  (Mot. p. 4; CIV-140, Decl. of Demurring or
Moving Party.)
 
The Court finds counsel’s
declaration sufficient to satisfy the meet and confer requirement.
 
C.   
Demurrer
 
Defendants demur to the Complaint
on the basis that the Complaint fails to state a cause of action.  Plaintiff has filed a Form Complaint that does not allege any cause of action
or set forth any allegations against Defendants.
 
Plaintiff has not opposed the
Demurrer.
 
The Court sustains the Demurer with
leave to amend. 
 
IV.             
Conclusion & Order
 
For the
foregoing reasons,
 
Defendants HB
Land Enterprises, LLC, et al.’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to amend.
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
