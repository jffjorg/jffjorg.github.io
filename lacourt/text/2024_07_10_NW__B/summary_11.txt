And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the case until the Cross-Complainants can correct certain defects in their request for default judgment against the Cross-Defendant. Specifically, only one Cross-Complainant (Blanca Schlup) has filed a statement of damages, while the other Cross-Complainant (Martha Bautista) has not. Additionally, Cross-Complainant Bautista has not filed a declaration in support of the judgment sought. The judge also notes that there was a discrepancy between the filing fees listed on the request for default judgment ($1,080) and the declaration filed by counsel ($210), which should be corrected.
