And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the Demurrer filed by defendants HB Land Enterprises LLC, et al. with 20 days' leave to amend. The Demurrer is based on the fact that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action or allegations against the defendants. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not opposed the Demurrer and has not alleged any facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge grants the defendants' request for judicial notice of the complaint and summons issued in the case. The judge also finds that the defendants have satisfied the meet and confer requirement by filing a declaration detailing their attempts to reach the plaintiff. The judge orders the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
