Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Byron Walker's Motion to Compel Deposition of Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.'s Person Most Qualified and Requests for Production of Documents and Request for Monetary Sanctions. The motion was filed in connection with a motor vehicle collision that occurred on March 10, 2021. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc. is vicariously liable for the collision and seeks to depose a person most qualified to testify about the relationship between the defendant and the driver who was involved in the collision.

The judge found that the defendant had served valid objections to the deposition notice and that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that the court may compel the deposition. The judge also found that the defendant's counsel had acted with substantial justification in requesting postponement of the deposition. As a result, the judge denied the motion and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
