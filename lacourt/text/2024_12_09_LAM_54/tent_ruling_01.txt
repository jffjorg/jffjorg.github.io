Motion to Consolidate
Moving Party: Plaintiff Daniel Gonzalez
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:      PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE IS GRANTED.
Daniel Gonzalez v. On Deck Delivery, LLC, et al. Case Number 24STCV17120 will be the lead case.
 
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE. 
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received. 
 
“When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending
before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the
matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and
it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid
unnecessary costs or delay.”  (CCP §
1048(a).) 
 
Plaintiff moves to consolidate (1) Daniel Gonzalez v. On Deck Delivery, LLC, et al. Case Number 24STCV17120 (Gonzalez); and (2) Angelo Terrones v.
On Deck Delivery, LLC, et al. Case Number 24STCV21413 (Terrones).
 
Plaintiff argues that the
cases should be consolidated because they contain common issues of law and
fact. Both cases are employment actions against On Deck Delivery, where the
Plaintiffs worked as delivery drivers. Plaintiff asserts that they involve the
same causes of action for wage and hour violations under the same employment
policies. Defendants do not oppose this motion.
 
The Court finds that there are common issues of fact and law, making
consolidation appropriate. Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate is GRANTED.
