And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of The Nitka Firm (Firm) to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Kimberly Sanchez, contingent upon the firm providing a proof of service at or before the time of the hearing, reflecting Code of Civil Procedure § 1005(b) notice to Plaintiff. The motion was not accompanied by a proof of service initially, but the firm has since attempted to serve Plaintiff by mail at her last known address. The court finds that the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 have been met, and the motion is granted effective upon the filing of a proof of service showing service of the signed order, return receipt requested, upon Plaintiff at her last known address.
