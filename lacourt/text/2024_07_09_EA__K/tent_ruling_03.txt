[1]            A copy of a motion or application to
seal a record “must be served on all parties that have appeared in the case.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b).) The motion was filed on May 20, 2024;
however, defendants only recently appeared in this case, via an answer filed
June 21, 2024.


[2]            As a preliminary matter, there is no
indication on ecourt that the complaint has been “filed under seal” or “lodged”
in a secured manner, with appropriate access controls in compliance with
California Rules of Court rule 2.551. “A record must not be filed under seal
without a court order. . .” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.551(a).) Further, a party
“requesting that a record be filed under seal must lodge it with the court
under (d) when the motion or application is made, unless good cause exists for
not lodging it or the record has previously been lodged under (3)(A)(i).
Pending the determination of the motion or application, the lodged record will
be conditionally under seal.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(4).)
“The party submitting [a] lodged record must affix to the electronic
transmission, the envelope, or the container a cover sheet that: (A) Contains
all the information required on a caption page under rule 2.111; and (B) States
that the enclosed record is subject to a motion or an application to file the
record under seal.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(d)(3).)
