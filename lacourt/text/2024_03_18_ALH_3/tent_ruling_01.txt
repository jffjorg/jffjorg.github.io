Rosevianney C. Ogumsi (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Heydar
Shahrokh, D.D.S. and Heydar Sharokh, D.D.S., Inc. dba Comfort Dental

to quash 2 subpoenas issued by Defendants to Optum fka Healthcare Partners and
Optum’s billing department. The subpoenas are attached to the motion. The
subpoenas both request the following:

RENAUD, M.D. 
 
A deposition subpoena may request (1)
only the attendance and testimony of a deponent, (2) only the production of
business records for copying, or (3) the attendance and testimony, as well as
the production of business records. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.020.) The court,
upon motion or the court’s own motion, “may make an order quashing the subpoena
entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or
conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders. In
addition, the court may make any other orders as may be appropriate to protect
the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable
violations of the right of privacy of the person.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1,
subd. (a).) 
When a plaintiff puts her health and
physical condition at issue, the privacy and privileges that normally attach to
such sensitive information are “substantially lowered by the very nature of the
action.” (Heller v. Norcal Mutual Ins.
Co. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 30, 43.) “[I]n seeking recovery for
physical and mental injuries plaintiffs have unquestionably waived their
physician-patient . . . privileges as to all information concerning the medical
conditions which they have put in issue.” (Britt
v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 849.) Nevertheless, “past cases
make clear that such waiver extends only to information relating to the medical
conditions in question, and does not automatically open all of a plaintiff’s
past medical history to scrutiny.” (Ibid.) The burden is on the party seeking
the constitutionally protected information to establish direct relevance. (Davis v. Superior Court (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1008, 1017.)
          Plaintiff
argues that the unbridled scope of these subpoenas violates her right to
privacy as well as the physician-patient and psychotherapist-patient
privileges. As this is a dental malpractice action, Plaintiff argues that her medical
records relating to her claimed injuries may be discoverable, but Defendants’
subpoenas seek considerably more information about unrelated medical conditions.

Defendants oppose Plaintiff’s motion on
purely procedural grounds. First, Defendants argue that the motion should be
denied because there was no notice of the subpoenas at issue and no separate
statement. This is an unpersuasive ground upon which to deny the motion because
Plaintiff identified the subpoenas at issue and the subpoenas are attached to
the motion; the subpoenas also demand the same records. 
Nevertheless, the Court agrees that
Plaintiff needed to file a declaration showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of the issues in this motion. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1983.5.) Although it does not appear that Defendants would have been
open to modifying the scope of their subpoenas or that any attempt to meet and
confer would have been successful, section 1983.5 states that a motion to quash
“shall be accompanied by a declaration showing a reasonable and good faith at
informal resolution of the dispute between the party requesting the personal
records and the consumer.” The Court is not inclined to bypass the
meet-and-confer requirement in light of this express language. Additionally, it
appears that Plaintiff concedes the procedural deficiencies of her motion
because she did not file a reply brief.
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion to quash
is DENIED. 
Defendants’ request for monetary
sanctions is DENIED. The Court does not find that the motion was made in bad
faith or without substantial justification because the subpoenas were
overbroad.
