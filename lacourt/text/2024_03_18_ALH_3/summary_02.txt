And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the December 20 Order, which sustained the defendant's demurrer without leave to amend. The plaintiff had requested the court to reconsider the order and remove a discussion about elder abuse from the record. The judge found that the plaintiff's motion was based on the same facts and circumstances that were available at the time of the demurrer, and did not present any new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support the motion. As a result, the judge determined that reconsideration was improper and denied the motion. The hearing is set for March 18, 2024.
