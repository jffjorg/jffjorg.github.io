And here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively denied the plaintiff's motion to quash two subpoenas issued by the defendants to obtain medical records related to the plaintiff's claimed injuries. The defendants' subpoenas were deemed overbroad and the judge agreed that the plaintiff needed to file a declaration showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issues. The judge also denied the defendants' request for monetary sanctions, stating that the motion was not made in bad faith or without substantial justification. The case will proceed with the denial of the motion to quash.
