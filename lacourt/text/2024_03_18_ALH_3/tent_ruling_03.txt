Paz Law
 Firm, APC seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiffs
 Leila Martinez and Gerardo Martinez, Jr. (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) on
grounds that a conflict has arisen and a substitution of attorney form has
 not been returned. Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an
attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted. (People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Counsel’s Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The Court notes that trial in this
matter is set for October 28, 2024, and no prejudice will result from granting
this motion. Accordingly, the two unopposed motions to be relieved are GRANTED
and effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the signed orders
on Plaintiffs
and all parties who have appeared.
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 18th
day of March 2024
