And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the complaint is sustained on the basis of uncertainty. The Judge finds that there is uncertainty in paragraphs 2 and 7 of the complaint. Paragraph 2 alleges that the lease agreement was entered into between RRRM Holding Company, LLC and Vigan Sardariani, but the attached lease agreement shows that the lease was actually entered into between Roland Markarian and Vigan Sardariani. The Judge finds that the complaint fails to allege how RRRM Holding Company, LLC is involved in the lease and therefore lacks standing.

Paragraph 7 alleges that $121,000 in rent was due and owing as of October 1, 2023, but the notice to pay rent or quit attached to the complaint is dated September 28, 2023. The Judge finds that the complaint's allegations regarding rent are unclear and that the notice does not matter because rent was due the 1st of the month.

The Judge allows the Plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to cure these issues.
