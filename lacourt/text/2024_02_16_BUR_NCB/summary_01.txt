The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Cross-Defendants (Andrew Bergman, et al.) against the cross-complaint filed by Cross-Complainants (Aneaka English, et al.). The judge has sustained the demurrer to the 1st, 2nd, and 4th causes of action (accounting, declaratory relief, and interpleader, respectively) without leave to amend. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the 3rd cause of action (violation of Business & Professions Code, ยง 17200) and granted the motion to strike the cross-complaint in its entirety or paragraph 56. The judge's ruling does not foreclose the ability for Cross-Complainants to file a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint if they retain counsel.
