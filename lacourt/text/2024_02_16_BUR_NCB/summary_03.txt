And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses from Ford Motor Company in a lawsuit brought by Justin Whiter. Whiter alleges that Ford failed to comply with the warranty on his 2019 Ford Fusion vehicle, which was manufactured and/or distributed by Ford. He seeks reimbursement or replacement under the Song Beverly Act. The judge has continued the matter to allow Ford to provide further responses to Whiter's requests for production of documents. The judge notes that it has had a prior relationship with Ford Motor Company, but does not believe that this will bias its decision. However, the judge invites any party to request that it recuse itself from the case if they believe that the prior relationship creates an appearance of bias. The case will be heard on February 23, 2024, and no further briefing will be permitted on the motion.
