Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion to file a sixth amended complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add a claim for civil theft under Penal Code, section 496(c). The judge finds that the plaintiff's delay in asserting this claim is unjustified and has caused prejudice. The judge also finds that granting leave to amend would be unduly prejudicial to the defendants and would not be in the interest of justice. The judge notes that there has been a pattern of piecemeal amendment by the plaintiff, with five prior amendments to the complaint in less than three years. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's claim is based on the same underlying facts as their conversion and fraud claims, and that the delay in asserting the claim has caused unnecessary expense and inefficiency.
