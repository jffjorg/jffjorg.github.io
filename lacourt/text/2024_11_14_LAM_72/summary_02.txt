And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by defendants Robert Spieth and S&H Real Estate, LLC to quash a subpoena issued by plaintiff Joshua David-Helderman Lawler to Bank of America for Spieth's bank records. The defendants also seek a protective order limiting the discovery of certain records.

The judge denies the motion as to S&H's bank records, finding that they are relevant to the plaintiff's claims and that the plaintiff has a right to access them as a member of the limited liability company.

The judge grants the motion in part as to Spieth's bank records, finding that Spieth has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his bank account information. The judge orders that Bank of America shall respond to the subpoena with the following limitations: Bank of America shall only produce bank statements from September 3, 2020 to September 3, 2024, and shall redact Spieth's personal information from the production. The judge also allows the plaintiff to seek leave of court to obtain further discovery into Spieth's bank information if necessary.
