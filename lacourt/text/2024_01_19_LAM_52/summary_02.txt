Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the demurrers filed by Pinnacle Estate Properties, Inc. and Kenneth Winter to the complaint filed by Jacob Ongwiseth and Nipith Ongwiseth are overruled. The demurrers challenged the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint, specifically the claims for negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent inducement. The judge finds that the allegations are sufficient to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent inducement.

The judge also denies the motions to strike portions of the complaint regarding punitive damages. The defendants argued that the allegations did not rise to the level of malice, oppression, or fraud necessary to recover punitive damages. The judge finds that the allegations do support a claim for fraud under California Civil Code section 3294.

Finally, the judge orders the defendants to answer the complaint within 15 days.
