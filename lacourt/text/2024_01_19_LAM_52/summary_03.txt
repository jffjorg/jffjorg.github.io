And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The defendants, Gigi C's Bikinis, LLC and Tina Caruso, moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's lawsuit, alleging that the parties' arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable. The plaintiff, Monique Ocegueda, argued that the agreement is unconscionable due to procedural and substantive unconscionability.

The court found that the agreement is procedurally unconscionable in that it was an adhesion contract imposed as a condition of employment, but not to the extent of being oppressive or surprising. The court also found that the agreement is substantively unconscionable due to several provisions, including:

* A provision permitting the employer to seek an injunction in court, which is unconscionable because it waives the employer's need to show irreparable harm and requires the employee to consent to an immediate injunction.
* A provision permitting the employer to recover attorney fees incurred in compelling arbitration, which violates the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) and is unconscionable.
* A provision prohibiting employees from discussing their wages, which is unconscionable because it restricts employees' ability to discuss their compensation.

The court exercised its discretion to sever the unconscionable provisions from the agreement and ordered the parties to arbitrate the dispute. The court stayed the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding.
