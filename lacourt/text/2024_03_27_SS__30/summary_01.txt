And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to bifurcate without prejudice, meaning the defendant can still raise the issue at the trial court's discretion. The judge recognizes that while the defendant properly sought a bifurcation order in advance of the trial date, the decision on whether to bifurcate should be made by the trial judge. The judge notes that in the Personal Injury Court system, the trial court typically rules on motions in limine and finds that the same logic applies to this request for bifurcation. The judge orders that the bifurcation briefing be included in the trial binders and directs the trial court to the order, which should not be construe d as binding the trial court's decision.
