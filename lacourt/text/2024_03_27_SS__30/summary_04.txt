And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint for indemnity and property damage against the Plaintiff, Javier Marchen, et al. The Defendant argues that the cross-complaint was not filed due to oversight, and the Plaintiff opposes, arguing that defense counsel delayed in seeking to file the cross-complaint. The Court finds that the cross-complaint is compulsory because it arises out of the same occurrence, namely, the vehicle collision at issue. The Court also finds that there is no showing of bad faith on the part of the Defendant. Therefore, the motion is GRANTED, and the Defendant is ordered to file the cross-complaint within 10 days of this order.
