And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the motion to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Debra J. Chavez, without prejudice. The motion was made by counsel for the plaintiff, but some mandatory judicial council forms were not fully completed, and the proposed order incorrectly stated the date of the Final Status Conference. Additionally, trial is set to begin in April, leaving insufficient time for the plaintiff to obtain new representation. As a result, the motion is denied, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
