And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this default judgment proceeding, suggesting that the plaintiff's claims may not be sufficient to support a default judgment. The judge notes that while a default generally admits the allegations of the complaint, the plaintiff still has a duty to prove causation and damages. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's proposed judgment is confusing and unclear, and that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient information to support their claims. The judge is also concerned about the plaintiff's attempt to seek punitive damages without providing clear and convincing evidence of the defendant's oppression, fraud, or malice. Finally, the judge notes that the claims against the defendants have not been properly alleged and lack sufficient facts to support the claims.
