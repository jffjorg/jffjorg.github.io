And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by defendants Danyel Benhaghnazar and Stella Yaghoubzadeh to set aside and vacate the court's ruling of April 29, 2024. The defendants claimed that Benhaghnazar was unable to attend the scheduled hearing due to a medical appointment and that the trial proceeded in his absence. However, the court found that there was no explanation for Yaghoubzadeh's nonappearance and that Benhaghnazar's medical records did not provide a sufficient basis for relief. The court also noted that it had previously issued minute orders to clarify the record and that the defendants had failed to litigate the case on the merits. The judge concluded that there was no basis to conclude that relief was warranted and denied the motion.
