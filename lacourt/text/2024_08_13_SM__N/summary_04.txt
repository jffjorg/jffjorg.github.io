And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to vacate a default judgment entered against them. The defendants, Vishal Vanjani and Kavita Vanjani, claimed that they believed their communications with a third party were in furtherance of a settlement and did not realize that they needed to respond to the lawsuit. However, the judge found that the defendants were properly served with the summons and complaint and received notice of the request for entry of default. The judge also found that the defendants did not attempt to communicate with the plaintiff regarding a settlement and instead waited until May to file their motion to set aside the default. The judge stated that there is no basis to set aside the default on equitable grounds, as the defendants had notice of the action and chose not to participate. The judge cited several California court cases to support their decision, including Olivera v. Grace, Kramer v. Traditional Escrow, Inc., and Cruz v. Fagor America, Inc.
