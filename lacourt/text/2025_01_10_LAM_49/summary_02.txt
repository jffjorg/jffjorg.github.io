And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to engage in limited and expedited discovery against non-party social media service providers. The plaintiff is seeking to identify the person(s) owning or operating social media accounts that were used to impersonate her and share her personal information. The judge has given the plaintiff permission to reissue the subpoenas to the non-party deponents for the limited purpose of identifying the subject social media accounts. The judge has noted that the pending subpoenas are invalid because they were served before service of summons and complaint on any defendant, but has allowed the plaintiff to issue new subpoenas because it has demonstrated good cause for doing so. The judge's order requires the moving party to give notice, unless waived.
