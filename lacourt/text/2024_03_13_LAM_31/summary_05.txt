And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is issued in the case of Aaron Birt v. Cali Movers, et al., case number 23STCV23219. The court has reviewed the pleadings and motions filed by the parties and has decided to grant the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint.

The plaintiff originally filed a complaint against individual defendants, but later filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) naming Cali Movers, Inc. as the sole defendant. The individual defendants filed demurrers to the FAC, but the court finds that these demurrers are moot since the plaintiff has amended the complaint to name Cali Movers, Inc. only.

The court notes that the parties have stipulated to the amendment of the pleading, and that the time for responding to the amended pleading shall be computed from the date of service of the amended pleading.

The court orders that the demurrers filed by the individual defendants are dismissed, and that the case shall proceed with the amended complaint naming Cali Movers, Inc. as the sole defendant.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change after hearing from the parties and considering any additional evidence or arguments.
