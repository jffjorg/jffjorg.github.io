Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to quash deposition subpoenas and protective orders. The defendants sought to quash certain categories of documents related to Protective Film Solutions, GEICO, and Silver Bird Auto Leasing LLC, as well as requests for information about the 2015 McLaren 650S Spider and the motor vehicle accident. The judge granted the motion to quash certain categories of documents, finding that they were overbroad and irrelevant to the issue of fraud. The judge also modified certain categories of documents to narrow the scope of discovery. The judge denied the motion to quash certain other categories of documents, finding that they were relevant to the issue of fraud. The judge's ruling is tentative and may be subject to change after further briefing and argument.
