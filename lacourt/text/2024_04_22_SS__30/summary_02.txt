And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a denial without prejudice of the defendant's motion to compel compliance with a subpoena for business records from T-Mobile. The defendant served the subpoena on November 1, 2023, and T-Mobile objected on or around December 29, 2023. The defendant filed proof of service indicating service of the motion on T-Mobile, but not personal service as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346. The court finds that the defendant's motion cannot be granted due to the lack of proper service.
