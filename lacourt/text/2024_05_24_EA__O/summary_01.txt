Here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the sale of her home. The plaintiff, Elizabeth Fernandez, alleges that she purchased the property in May 2022 and secured two loans: one with E. Mortgage Capital Inc. and one with the defendant, Alma Rosa Muñoz. Despite making all loan payments, the defendant served the plaintiff with a Declaration of Mortgage Servicer and a Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust, leading to the scheduled foreclosure. The court finds that the plaintiff has met the first prong of the test for a preliminary injunction, as she has demonstrated a likelihood of prevailing on the merits. However, the court determines that the plaintiff has not met her evidentiary burden, as she has not provided sufficient evidence to support her claims. The court requests that the plaintiff submit a supplemental declaration prior to the hearing with evidence of the payments.
