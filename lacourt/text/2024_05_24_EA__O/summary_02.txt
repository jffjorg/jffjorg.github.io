And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court finds that the Plaintiff, Elizabeth Fernandez, has made all payments on the loan and is not in default. Therefore, the Defendant's attempt to foreclose on the property is invalid. The court grants the Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the foreclosure. The court also finds that the Plaintiff is entitled to declaratory relief and rescission of the loan agreement.
