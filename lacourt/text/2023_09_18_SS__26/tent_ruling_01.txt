ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff CMRE
Financial Services, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant Complaint for money
against Defendant Gabriel Garcia (“Defendant”) on April 1, 2021. On September
13, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement. 
 
Nothing was
filed in the action until more than a year-and-a-half later on March 15, 2023,
when Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Enter Judgment. The Motion was
initially set for hearing on May 31, 2023 in Department Y of the Norwalk
Courthouse at which time Defendant made his first appearance. (Minute Order,
05/31/23.) Prior to hearing the Motion, the Court determined that the action
should be transferred to the limited jurisdiction court. (Minute Orders, 05/31/23
and 06/02/23.) 
 
A trial setting
conference was set for July 18, 2023, with notice only given to Plaintiff.
(Minute Order, 06/02/23; Certificate of Mailing, 06/02/23.) At the trial
setting conference, the Motion was set for hearing on September 18, 2023.
(Minute Order, 07/18/23.) Defendant did not appear at the trial setting
conference and Plaintiff was ordered to give notice of the ruling. (Ibid.)

 
No opposition has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The motion is defective
in the following respects. First, no proof of service has been filed showing
that Plaintiff gave Defendant notice of the current hearing date, as ordered. Failure
to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory
requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero
(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) 
 
Second, the Motion
does not cite any legal authority for its request to enter judgment pursuant to
the parties’ settlement agreement. “The memorandum must contain a
statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments
relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in
support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).) Indeed,
Plaintiff’s failure to provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an
“admission that the [request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke
(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Plaintiff CMRE Financial
Services, Inc.’s Motion for Entry of Judgment is CONTINUED TO NOVEMBER 20, 2023
AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY OCTOBER 30,
2023, PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE SUPPLEMENTAL PAPERS CORRECTING THE DEFECTS
NOTED HEREIN. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
