And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling continues the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award filed by Jerome St. Martin against Cassius Marsh and Cash Cards Unlimited, Inc. to November 20, 2023. By October 30, 2023, the petitioner is required to file proof of service of the petition and arbitration award on respondent Cash Cards Unlimited, Inc. in compliance with the statutory requirements.

The court finds that the service requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 have not been met with respect to respondent Cash Cards Unlimited, Inc. because the proof of personal service does not set forth the name of the person served on behalf of the respondent.

The court also finds that the arbitration award was not served on respondent Cash Cards Unlimited, Inc. in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1283.6, 1288, and 1288.4.

The merits of the petition to confirm the arbitration award are discussed, and the court finds that the petition is sufficient in substance to confirm the award. The court also grants the petitioner's request for attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $2,500.00 and $370.00, respectively.
