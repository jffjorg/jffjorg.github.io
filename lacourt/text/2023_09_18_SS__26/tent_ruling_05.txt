(CCP § 1285, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:

RESPONDENT CASH CARDS UNLIMITED, INC. IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTORY
REQUIREMENTS.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Petitioner Jerome St. Martin
(“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the
“Petition”) against Respondents Cassius Marsh and Cash Cards Unlimited, Inc. (“Respondents”),
on May 15, 2023. No response to the Petition has been filed to date.
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.) 
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (CCP §§
1290.4)
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1290.4 states in pertinent part: 
 
“(a) A copy of the
petition and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and
any other papers upon which the petition is
based shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration
agreement for the service of such petition and notice.
 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not provide the
manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom service is
to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not previously
been served in accordance with this subdivision: ¶ (1) Service within this
State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in
an action.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4.) The arbitration agreement does not indicate
the manner of service required for the Petition and Notice of Hearing,
therefore, service must be in a manner provided for service of a summons. (See
Pet., Attachment 4(a) at ¶VIII.) Petitioner sub-served Respondent Marsh with
the Petition and Notice of Hearing. (Proof of Substitute Service, filed
08/14/23.) However, the proof of personal service with respect to Respondent
Cash Cards Unlimited is incomplete. It does not set forth the name of the
person served on behalf of Respondent Cash Cards Unlimited. (Proof of
Substitute Service, ¶3b.) Therefore, the Court cannot find that the service
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 have been met
with respect to Respondent Cash Cards Unlimited, Inc. 
 
Service of the Arbitration
Award and Timing of Service of Petition
(CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
         
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 provides that: “The
neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on
each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or
as provided in the agreement.”  (Emphasis added.) This requirement may
be satisfied by service by the arbitration, or upon proper service of the award
with the Petition. (See Murry v.
Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) Also, a party may seek a court judgment confirming
an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than four years,
but not less than 10 days, after the award is
served. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) 
 
A copy of the
arbitration award is attached to the Petition but does not include any proof of
service from the arbitrator. (Pet., Attachment 8(c).) Nor has Petitioner
demonstrated service of the award with the instant Petition on Respondent Cash
Cards Unlimited, Inc. in order to satisfy the
service requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6. It
follows that the Court cannot find that service of the award complies with Code
of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4. 
 

Merits of the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states: “A petition under this chapter shall:
 
(a)  
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
(b)  
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
(c) Set forth
or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrators, if any.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4 (emphasis added).) The court must confirm the award as made,
unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; Valsan Partners
Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th
809, 818.) 
 
Petitioner has set forth the substance of the arbitration
award and submitted a copy of the arbitration agreement with the name of the arbitrator. (Pet., ¶¶4-6 and
Attachment 8(c).) This satisfies Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4,
subdivisions (a)-(c). Substantively,
Petitioner has demonstrated that on August 11, 2022, the arbitrator issued an
award in his favor and jointly and severally against Respondents in the amount of $11,910.40
principal, $1,548.50 interest plus $3.26 per diem from August 1, 2022,
$5,000.00 attorney’s fees, and $1,400.84 administrative fees and arbitrator
compensation. (Pet., Attachment 8(c), pp. 1-2.) 
 
Attorney’s Fees,
Costs and Interest
 
To the extent Petitioner requests attorney’s fees and costs
according to proof, such an award is permitted on a petition to confirm
arbitration award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1293.2; MBNA America Bank, N.A. v.
Gorman (2006) 147 Cal.App.4th.Supp. 1, 7.) Petitioner may be awarded
attorney’s fees of $2,500.00 and costs of $370.00.
