The plaintiff, Interinsurance Exchange of the Automobile Club, has filed a motion to reclassify its lawsuit against Destiny Mason as an unlimited civil case. The court has granted this motion. The case was initially classified as a limited civil case, but the plaintiff has shown that the damages may exceed $25,000, which is the threshold for unlimited jurisdiction. The court has ordered the case to be transferred to an independent calendar court and for the plaintiff to pay a reclassification fee within 10 days.
