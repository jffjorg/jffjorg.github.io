And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for a determination of good faith settlement filed by California Box Company and Samuel Reyes. The motion was opposed by iStaff Solutions LLC, who claimed that the settlement was not made in good faith. The judge found that the moving defendants had met their burden to demonstrate the settlement, shifting the burden to the non-settling defendant, iStaff Solutions LLC. The judge considered the factors outlined in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Assoc. (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, including the amount paid in settlement, the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of the settling defendants, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of the non-settling defendants. The judge found that the settlement was a good faith estimate of the settling defendants' liability to the plaintiff, Esthela Ibarra, and granted the motion.
