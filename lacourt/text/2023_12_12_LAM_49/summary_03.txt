And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the County's special motion to strike Plaintiff's Tenth Cause of Action for Defamation. The County argued that the alleged defamatory statements were made in a place open to the public or a public forum, and therefore were protected under the anti-SLAPP statute. The judge found that the County met its burden under the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute by showing that the alleged defamatory statements were made in a place open to the public or a public forum. The judge then shifted the burden to the Plaintiff to demonstrate a probability of success on her claim. The Plaintiff failed to provide evidence to impose vicarious liability against the County under Government Code section 815.2, and therefore the judge found that the County was immune from defamation under these particular facts. The judge also granted the County's motion to strike the Plaintiff's Tenth Cause of Action for Defamation, and ordered that the County may file a motion for attorney's fees if it elects to do so.
