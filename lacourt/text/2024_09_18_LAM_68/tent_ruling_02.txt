RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant, Jeff Kern
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
Motion
for Terminating Sanctions 
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
March 11, 2022,, Defendant Jeff Kern, et al. entered into an agreement with
Plaintiff APB Properties, Inc. for the purchase of certain commercial property
located at 6342 Pacific Bl., Huntington Park. The purchase price was
$2,050,000, with a 90-day escrow period. Kern deposited $60,000. Subsequent
negotiations based on requests for repair led to a reduction in price, with
escrow closing date remaining May 31, 2022. Plaintiff buyer failed to follow through
on the purchase. APB Properties, Inc. seeks the $60,000 deposit as liquidated
damages.
 
On
February 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of Written Contract
and Declaratory Relief. Kern filed a cross-complaint for Breach of Contract of
Contract and Declaratory Relief on April 13, 2024, with the answer filed on
April 14, 2023. Kern alleges APB Properties, Inc. withheld material information
on the condition of the property, thereby breaching the purchase contract. 
 
On
May 19, 2023, the court granted the motion to compel arbitration. On December
27, 2023, the court terminated the arbitration order and lifted the stay. APB
Properties, Inc. answered the cross-complaint on December 28, 2023. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff
APB Properties, Inc. (APB) moves for terminating sanctions against Defendant
Jeff Kern, due to the failure to comply with the June 3, 2024, order compelling
responses to the Request for Production of Documents (set one). The court
electronic filing system shows no opposition or reply at the time of the
tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
“Discovery
sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that
which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.’” (Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 118-119
citing Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978)
84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793; Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 613.) A prerequisite to the imposition of the dismissal
sanction is that the party has willfully failed to comply with a court order. (Mileikowsky v.
Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 481, 487 overruled on other grounds in Garcia
v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, fn. 4.); Young
v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 114.) Preventing parties
from presenting their cases on the merits is a drastic measure; terminating
sanctions should only be ordered when there has been previous noncompliance
with a rule or order and it appears a less severe sanction would not be
effective.  (Link v. Cater (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1315,
1326; Department of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell¿(2017)
18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191 [“Terminating sanctions are to be used sparingly
because of the drastic effect of their application.”].) “The trial court
may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the
totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the
actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of
formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los Defensores,
Inc. v. Gomez¿(2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)  
 
A
prerequisite to the imposition of the dismissal sanction is that the party has
willfully failed to comply with a court order. (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem, supra, 128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 279-280; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d
481, 487 overruled on other grounds in Garcia
v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 478, fn. 4.); Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 114.) “Discovery
sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that
which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied
discovery.’” (Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 118-119
citing Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793; Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 613.) Preventing parties from presenting their cases on the
merits is a drastic measure; terminating sanctions should only be ordered when
there has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order and it appears a
less severe sanction would not be effective. 
(Link v. Cater (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1326.)
 
“The discovery statutes
thus ‘evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate
sanction of termination.’ (Citation.) Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure (Citations), a
terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has
attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the
record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society
of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.)
To avoid sanctions, the burden of proving that a discovery violation was not
willful is on the party on whom the discovery was served. (Cornwall v. Santa
Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252- 253.)
 
The
motion makes an alternative conclusive request for sanctions barring Kern from
“introducing any documents that were requested in the document request.”
Normally, the court initially considers issue and evidentiary sanctions, but
where a party presents no opposition and appears to have abandoned the case,
the court can impose terminating sanctions. 
 
The
court also notes that the underlying motion only addressed discovery served by
Defendant to Plaintiff. The court therefore can only strike the answer to the
complaint, and declines to strike the cross-complaint. The motion for
terminating sanctions is therefore granted as to the complaint in the form of
an order striking the answer. Plaintiff may proceed with a default, and return
to the court for a default judgment. 
 
Sanctions in the amount of $1,000. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.040, 2023.050, subd. (a), 2031.310, subd. (i).) Sanctions payable in 30
days and imposed jointly against responding party and counsel.
 
Motions for summary judgment/summary adjudication and motion
for terminating sanctions, and motion to set aside admissions for October 21,
2024, are vacated. 
 
Trial on the cross-complaint remains set for April 28, 2025.
 
Plaintiff APB to give notice.
