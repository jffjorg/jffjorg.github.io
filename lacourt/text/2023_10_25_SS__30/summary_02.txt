And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion by the counsel for the plaintiff, Levonna Lacy, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The judge's decision is based on the counsel's failure to include a declaration establishing that the service requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, have been satisfied. The judge is uncertain whether the amended form MC-053, which includes the correct upcoming scheduled hearing dates, has been properly served on all parties, including the client. The judge is also concerned that granting another continuance would result in a hearing date that is too close in time to the scheduled upcoming flurry of motions. As a result, the judge has denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the counsel to refile the motion and provide the necessary documentation to support their request.
