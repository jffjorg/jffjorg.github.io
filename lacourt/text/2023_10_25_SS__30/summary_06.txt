And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motions to compel defendant Alejandro Cadena's responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The motions are considered moot because verified and code-compliant responses were already served prior to the hearing. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the defendant's responses were served in a timely manner, and therefore, the imposition of sanctions is not necessary to prevent future discovery violations.
