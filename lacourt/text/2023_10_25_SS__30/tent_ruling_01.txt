  Case Number:  20STCV28572    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  30 LANORA WELLS, et al. vs DANIEL AUNERMotion for Leave to Depose Defendant in PrisonTENTATIVEMotion for Leave to Depose Defendant Auner in Prison is GRANTED.  Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONPlaintiff argues that the deposition of Defendant Auner is necessary. Defendant Auner has been incarcerated in North Kern State Prison since July 6, 2023, stemming from the vehicle accident which resulted in the death of Ashely Wells. Plaintiff seeks to depose Defendant to inquire about the “speeds, names, streets, and any and all activities that led up to the violent crash that occurred on the date of the incident.” (Motion 5: 8-11.) Plaintiff argues that Defendant is the only person with knowledge of the incident. Defendant’s prison sentence is not scheduled to end until 2036, and therefore, the only way to obtain his testimony is for the court to grant leave to do so.The Court finds that the deposition of Defendant Auner is appropriate. Under Penal Code § 2623, the testimony of a prisoner can be taken in a civil action by either the court itself or a judge of the superior court where the matter is pending. Additionally, Penal Code § 2623 states that this order can “only be made on the motion of a party, upon affidavit showing the nature of the action or proceeding, the testimony expected from the witness and its materiality.”Here, the motion and the Declaration of Kenneth Shy indicate that Defendant’s testimony will provide information about the circumstances of the incident, such as what the parties were doing prior to the incident, while driving, and what occurred after the accident. The Court finds this sufficient to have the Defendant provide testimony. Thus, the Court finds that Defendant Auner’s testimony is to be taken pursuant to Penal Code § 2622.No opposition was filed to this regularly noticed motion.
