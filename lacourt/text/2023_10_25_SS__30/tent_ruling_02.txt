 Case Number:  20STCV44029    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  30 LEVONNA LACY vs LONG BEACH PUBLIC TRANSPORTATIONMotion to Be Relieved as Counsel for PlaintiffTENTATIVECounsel's motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is denied without prejudice. Moving party to give notice.DISCUSSIONThe amended form MC-053 includes the correct upcoming scheduled hearing dates. However, the Minute Order from September 27, 2023, stated that Counsel must amend form MC-053 and serve on all parties, including the client. Under Section 3 of the new MC-053 form, counsel has selected 3(b), which indicates that the attorney “has served client by mail and submitted a declaration establishing that the service requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, have been satisfied.” However, with the newly submitted form Mc-053, counsel has not included any such declaration. Thus, the Court is not certain that the newly amended form as been properly served on all parties, including the client, and no  proof of service has been filed.  Further, if the Court grants another continuance then the hearing date will be too close in time for the scheduled upcoming flurry of motions. As such, the Court denies the motion without prejudice.
