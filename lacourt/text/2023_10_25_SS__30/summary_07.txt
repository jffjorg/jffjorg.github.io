And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to special interrogatories. The defendant served the special interrogatories on May 29, 2023, but the plaintiff has not responded to date. The court has ordered the plaintiff to serve verified responses, without objections, within 20 days. The request for sanctions is denied because the motion is unopposed. The court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(a), which states that a party waives its objections to a discovery request when it does not serve a timely response to the request.
