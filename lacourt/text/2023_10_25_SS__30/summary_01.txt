```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to depose defendant Auner in prison. The motion is necessary because defendant Auner is the only person with knowledge of the incident, and his prison sentence is not scheduled to end until 2036. The court finds that the deposition is appropriate under Penal Code § 2623, which allows for the testimony of a prisoner to be taken in a civil action. The court notes that the motion and supporting declaration indicate that defendant Auner's testimony will provide important information about the circumstances of the incident, including what the parties were doing before, during, and after the accident. Since no opposition was filed to the motion, the court grants the motion and allows the deposition to proceed.
