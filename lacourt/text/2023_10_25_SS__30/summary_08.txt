And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the action or stay all further proceedings based on forum non conveniens. The defendants had sought to move the trial from Los Angeles County to Kern County, citing that California is an inconvenient forum for the trial. However, the judge found that the motion was not properly noticed, as it did not specify the nature of the order being sought or the grounds for issuance of the order. Additionally, the judge noted that the declaration of Ortiz lacked factual evidence showing why venue in Los Angeles County is improper. The judge also pointed out that the defendants should have brought a motion to change venue instead of a motion for forum non conveniens. The judge therefore denied the motion, citing the need for proper notice and due process.
