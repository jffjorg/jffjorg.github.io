And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Simon Ginez Monico to deem Requests for Admission, Set One, for Plaintiff Darryl Benedict Cassell admitted, and to impose monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,320.00.

The motion is denied as moot because Plaintiff Cassell has served untimely responses to the Requests for Admission, Set One, despite multiple extensions granted by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Monico.

However, the court grants in part Defendant/Cross-Complainant Monico's request for monetary sanctions because Plaintiff Cassell failed to serve a timely response to the Requests for Admission, Set One. The court orders Plaintiff Cassell and his attorney to jointly and severally pay $480.00 to Defendant/Cross-Complainant Monico's counsel within 20 days.
