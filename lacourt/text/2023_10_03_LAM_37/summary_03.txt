And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to review the defense's motion to strike on its merits, rather than dismissing it due to a lack of compliance with the meet and confer requirement. The defense failed to file a declaration stating that they had met and conferred with the plaintiff to resolve their objections, as required by CCP § 435.5. However, the judge notes that CCP § 435.5(a)(4) specifically states that a determination of insufficient meet and confer process is not grounds for granting or denying the motion to strike.

## English Summary

The judge has reviewed a motion to strike filed by the defendant.  The judge notes that the defendant failed to comply with the procedural requirement of CCP § 435.5, which mandates a "meet and confer" session with the plaintiff before filing a motion to strike. However, the statute also states that failure to properly meet and confer doesn't automatically mean the motion will be denied. Therefore, the judge will proceed to consider the motion to strike on its merits despite the procedural issue.

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to strike filed by the defendant, which failed to meet the meet and confer requirement of CCP § 435.5. Specifically, defense counsel failed to file a declaration attesting that the meet and confer process was conducted. Despite this, the Judge will consider the motion on the merits, as CCP § 435.5(a)(4) states that a determination that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to grant or deny the motion to strike. The Judge will therefore focus on the substantive issues raised in the motion.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling considers the defendant's motion to strike on its merits, despite the defense counsel's failure to file a declaration attesting that the meet and confer requirement had been met. According to CCP § 435.5, the moving party must meet and confer with the opposing party to determine if an agreement can be reached to resolve objections. Although the defense counsel failed to comply with this requirement, the court will still evaluate the motion on its merits, as the insufficient meet and confer process is not a grounds for granting or denying the motion to strike.

**Summary:**
A judge is considering a motion to strike that was filed but defense counsel did not file a declaration attesting that they met and conferred for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be reached to resolve any objections. The judge will consider the motion on the merits as the insufficiency of the meet and confer process is not grounds for granting or denying the motion.
