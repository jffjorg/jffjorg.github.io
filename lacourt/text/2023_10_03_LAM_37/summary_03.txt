And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to review the defense's motion to strike on its merits, rather than dismissing it due to a lack of compliance with the meet and confer requirement. The defense failed to file a declaration stating that they had met and conferred with the plaintiff to resolve their objections, as required by CCP ยง 435.5. However, the judge notes that CCP ยง 435.5(a)(4) specifically states that a determination of insufficient meet and confer process is not grounds for granting or denying the motion to strike.
