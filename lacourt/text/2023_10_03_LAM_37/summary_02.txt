**English Summary:**

In this case, Danny Silberstein alleges that MM Products, Inc. knowingly sold coffee mugs made with unsafe glass that could break and cause injury.  He is seeking punitive damages, arguing that the company acted with malice and disregard for consumer safety. MM Products moved to strike Silberstein's request for punitive damages, arguing that he hadn't provided enough evidence.  

The judge disagreed, finding that Silberstein's complaint adequately described the company's knowledge of the danger and its decision to continue selling the unsafe mugs despite that knowledge.  The judge also found that MM Products was improperly relying on evidence outside the complaint itself to support its argument. Therefore, the judge denied the motion to strike the punitive damages claim.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant manufactured a coffee mug with sodalime glass, which is not suitable for hot liquids, and that the defendant knew about the danger but did not notify consumers. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts, including allegations that the defendant failed to provide a warning to consumers, failed to recall the product, and acted with conscious disregard for public safety. The judge also rejects the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's evidence is insufficient and notes that the sufficiency of the evidence is a matter to be decided at a later stage in the proceedings.
