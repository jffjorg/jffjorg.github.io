And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The FAC alleges that the defendant manufactured a coffee mug with sodalime glass that is not safe for hot beverages, and that the company received 400 notifications from consumers about the product's failure. The FAC also alleges that the company continued to sell the product despite knowing it was unsafe and dangerous, and that the company's CEO made a conscious decision to not notify consumers of the defective product. The judge found that the FAC adequately pleads a claim for punitive damages, and that the defendant has failed to show that a defect in the pleading exists on the face of the FAC. The judge also noted that the defendant's motion relies on matters outside of the pleadings, which is not allowed at the pleading stage. Therefore, the defendant's motion is denied.
