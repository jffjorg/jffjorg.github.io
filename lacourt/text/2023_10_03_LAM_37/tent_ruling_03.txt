CCP § 435.5 requires that “[b]efore
filing a motion to strike pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet
and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that
is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining whether an
agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike.” Defense counsel failed to file a declaration attesting that
the meet and confer requirement has been met. “A determination by the court
that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to grant
or deny the motion to strike.” (CCP § 435.5(a)(4).) Therefore, the court
considers the Motion on the merits.
