 Case Number:  23SMCV05936    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  M CASE NAME:           Doe v. Davis
CASE NO.:                23SMCV05936
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   1/14/2025

 
Legal
Standard
 
Where there has been no timely
response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand, the demanding party must
seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. Thus,
unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he
or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline
for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving
party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the
motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no
showing of "good cause" is required. 
  
ANALYSIS 
 
Plaintiff Jane Doe moves to compel Defendant Michael Davis to provide
written, verified responses to requests for amended production of documents,
with
document production, without objections. On October 24, 2024, Plaintiff
served Defendant with the subject discovery, Request for Amended Production of
Documents, Set One. (Doe Decl., Ex. A.) Defendant failed to respond to the
requests. (Doe Decl., ¶ 4.) Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff cannot recover the requested sanctions of $200.00 against
Defendant for her time spent working on this motion. “A¿pro se litigant
cannot recover attorney's fees as a discovery sanction, but he can recover the ‘reasonable
expenses’ he has ‘incurred,’ including photocopying, computer-assisted legal
research, and other identifiable and allocable costs.”¿¿(Kravitz v. Superior
Court¿(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1015, 1017.) Plaintiff has not shown any identifiable
costs incurred as a result of this motion. Therefore, the Court will not grant
sanctions.
