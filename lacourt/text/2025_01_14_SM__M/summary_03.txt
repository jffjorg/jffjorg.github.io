And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel initial discovery responses in a case filed by Sean Kehoe and others against Pauly Shore and the Comedy Store. The defendant moved to compel the plaintiff's responses to special interrogatories and requests for production of documents, as the plaintiff failed to serve timely responses. The plaintiff claimed that he served the responses on December 23, 2024, but the judge found that the motion is moot since the plaintiff has already provided substantially code-compliant discovery responses. However, the judge sanctioned the plaintiff's counsel for failing to calendar the deadline properly, imposing a reasonable amount of $1,520.00, inclusive of costs, against the counsel only.
