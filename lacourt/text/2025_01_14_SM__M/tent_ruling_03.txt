MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   1/14/2025

 
Legal
Standard
 
 If a
party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for
a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown
in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on
the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response
of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 Where there has been no timely
response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand, the demanding party must
seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. Thus,
unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he
or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline
for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving
party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the
motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no
showing of "good cause" is required.
ANALYSIS 
Defendant Pauly Shore moves for an order compelling Plaintiff Sean
Kehoe to serve verified responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents (Set One). 
On September 23, 2024, Defendant propounded his first set of
discovery, including the subject special interrogatories and requests for
production. Plaintiff’s responses were due October 25, 2024. (Giennetto Decl. ¶
4; Ex. A) Defendant informally met and conferred prior to filing this motion but
did not receive any responses to the subject discovery.
(Giennetto Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff explains that he served verified responses to the subject
discovery on December 23, 2024. (Brief Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. A.) Plaintiff has
provided substantially code compliant discovery responses. As such, the motion
is MOOT. 
The Court must
sanction any party that unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response, “unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (See, e.g., CCP, § 2030.290(c).) Plaintiff notes that his
failure to respond was due to counsel’s failure to calendar the deadline
properly. (Brief Decl. ¶6.) Plaintiff does not provide substantial
justification for his failure to provide timely responses. Sanctions are
imposed in the reasonable amount of $1,520.00, inclusive of
costs, against Plaintiff’s counsel of record only.
