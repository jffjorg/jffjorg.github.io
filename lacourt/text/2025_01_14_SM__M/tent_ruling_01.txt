  Case Number:  23SMCV00933    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  M CASE NAME:             Amaya v. General Motors LLC,  et al.  CASE NO.:                   23SMCV00933 MOTION:                     Demurrer to the Second Amended  Complaint   HEARING DATE:   1/14/2025   LEGAL STANDARD    A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether  the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147  Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations  liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be  apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian  v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the  pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it  lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are  judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff  need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the  factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28  Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,  deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the  construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore  Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations  omitted.)    A special demurrer for uncertainty is  disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that  defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what  issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed  against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.  (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat  vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)     Any party, within the time allowed to  respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole  or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322(b).)  The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it  deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted  in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or  filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of  the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,  782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;  probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)    “Liberality in permitting amendment is  the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie  M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of  discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable  possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.  Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in  what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that  amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.)    ANALYSIS    Statute of Limitations     Defendant argues that the three-year  statute of limitations has run with respect to the fraud cause of action. Unless  a complaint affirmatively discloses on its face that the statute of limitations  has run, a demurrer must be overruled. (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell,  Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 881.) “Generally,  a cause of action accrues and the statute of limitation begins to run when a  suit may be maintained. Ordinarily this is when the wrongful act is done and  the obligation or the liability arises . . .. In other words, a cause of action  accrues upon the occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of  action. [Citation.]” (Cobb v. City of Stockton (2011) 192  Cal.App.4th 65, 72-73, alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.)    The statute of limitations for fraud is  three years. (CCP § 338(d).) “In California, fraud  must be pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice.  ‘Thus “ ‘the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings ... will not  ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect.’  ” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645, citations omitted.)  Under the so-called “discovery rule,” the accrual of the statute is tolled  until a plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of action.  The discovery rule protects those who are ignorant of their cause of action  through no fault of their own. (April Enterprises, Inc. v. KTTV (1983)  147 Cal.App.3d 805, 832.) “The  provision tolling operation of the statute until discovery of the fraud has  long been treated as an exception and, accordingly, this court has held that if  an action is brought more than three years after commission of the fraud,  plaintiff has the burden of pleading and proving that he did not make the  discovery until within three years prior to the filing of his complaint.” (Hobart  v. Hobart Estate Co. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 412, 437.) Thus, to avoid the  statute of limitations bar, a plaintiff must specifically plead facts to show  (1) the time and manner of discovery and (2) the inability to have made earlier  discovery despite reasonable diligence. (CAMSI IV v. Hunter Technology Corp.  (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 1525, 1536-37.) “Mere conclusory assertions that delay in  discovery was reasonable are insufficient and will not enable the complaint to  withstand general demurrer.” (Id.)    On  June 28, 2019, Plaintiff travelled to an authorized Chevrolet dealership and  leased the subject vehicle, a 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV. (SAC ¶8.) GM delivered  the vehicle to Plaintiff “with serious defects and nonconformities to warranty”  including the battery defect. (SAC ¶ 10.) Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, the battery  in the vehicle has a defect which may cause a fire. (¶ 11.) This resulted in the  manufacturer issuing numerous recalls, reducing the charge capacity, reducing  the distance the vehicle can be driven on a single charge, and manufacturer  advising owners of the vehicle not to charge the vehicle in their garages due  to the risk of fire. (Id.) The SAC alleges that Plaintiff would not have leased  the vehicle if she knew of the battery defect. (¶12.) Defendant was aware of  the defective batteries plaguing Chevrolet Bolt vehicles as early as 2017. (¶  13.) These allegations show that all elements of fraud were complete on June  28, 2019. Thus, the three-year statute of limitations expired three years later  on June 28, 2022. Plaintiff did not file the instant fraud action until eight  months later, on February 28, 2023.      However, Plaintiff  alleges sufficient facts for delayed discovery. On November 13, 2020, GM  announced to its authorized dealerships its intent to recall over 50,000  Chevrolet Bolt vehicles because the battery pack posed a risk of fire when  charged to full, or very close to full, capacity. (SAC ¶19.) The purpose of the  recall was to install an interim software fix that called for reprogramming the  hybrid propulsion system control module to limit the battery’s range to  approximately 214 miles on a single battery charge, a decrease of range of  approximately 10%. (¶ 20.) This recall was the first time GM made the public,  including Plaintiffs, aware of the defective battery in Chevrolet Bolt vehicles.  (¶ 21.) The Vehicle’s battery did not exhibit any signs of being susceptible to  catching fire prior to GM’s announcement of the recall. (Id.) Plaintiff had no  way of discovering that the battery in their Vehicle was defective and could  cause fire prior to GM’s announcement of the November 13, 2020 recall. (Id.)  Plaintiff thus alleges that she discovered the truth of the concealed battery  defect on November 13, 2020, within three years of filing of this suit on  February 28, 2023. As such, the fraud cause of action is not barred by the  statute of limitations on the face of the complaint. Particularity Defendant argues that the fraud claim  fails because Plaintiff does not identify the alleged misrepresentations with  specificity, including who at GM made the alleged misrepresentations, their  authority to speak on behalf of GM, and when/where such misrepresentations were  made. GM also argues that there are insufficient facts showing knowledge about  alleged defects in Plaintiff’s Bolt, and GM’s intent to induce reliance by  Plaintiff to lease the specific Bolt at issue. The elements of fraud  are: “(a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or  nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to  defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting  damage.” (Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) “[T]o  establish fraud through nondisclosure or concealment of facts, it is necessary  to show the defendant ‘was under a legal duty to disclose them.’” (OCM  Principal Opportunities Fund v. CIBC World Markets Corp. (2007) 157  Cal.App.4th 835, 845.) Nondisclosure may constitute actionable fraud when:  (1) there is a fiduciary relationship between the parties; (2) the defendant  had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) the  defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) the  defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some material  facts. (Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission v. Insomniac, Inc.  (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 803, 831.)  Generally, the “particularity  demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and  by what means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of  America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.) However, less  specificity is required to plead fraud by concealment. (Jones v.  ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1199.)  “As one court  has aptly observed, ‘it is harder to apply [the requirement of specificity] to  a case of simple nondisclosure. “How does one show ‘how’ and ‘by what means’  something didn't happen, or ‘when’ it never happened, or ‘where’ it never  happened?” ’ ” (Ibid; see also Alfaro v. Community Housing  Improvement System & Planning Assn., Inc.¿(2009) 171¿Cal.App.4th1356,  1384; see Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp.  (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 217 [“ ‘[e]ven under the strict rules of common law  pleading, one of the canons was that less particularity is required when the  facts lie more in the knowledge of the opposite party ...’”].)  The  SAC alleges a theory of fraud by concealment. As noted, GM knew of the  defective batteries in the 2017 to 2019 Chevrolet Bolt vehicles, including  Plaintiff’s vehicle. (¶¶ 18, 28, 34.) Despite this knowledge, GM concealed the  defect from Plaintiff, never intending to replace the battery defect during the  relevant warranty periods. (Id.) GM owed a duty to disclose the battery defect  and its corresponding safety hazard to Plaintiff because GM possessed superior  and exclusive knowledge regarding the defect. (¶ 35.) GM knew its concealment  and suppression of the battery defect would sell more vehicles and encourage  Plaintiff to purchase the defective vehicle. (¶ 36.) Plaintiff was unaware of  GM’s concealment of the battery defect and would not have leased the Vehicle  but for GM’s omissions and concealment of material facts regarding the nature and  quality of the Vehicle and existence of the battery defect. (¶ 37.) Plaintiff  has therefore pled a duty for GM to disclose the truth of the known battery  defect, and GM’s breach of said duty by failing to disclose this safety defect  at the time of purchase.  Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED.              UCL   Defendant demurs to the UCL claim.  Defendant argues that the UCL claim fails to plead fraud by alleging facts  showing how, where, to whom, and by what means the representations that  allegedly violated the UCL were tendered by GM to Plaintiff, how these alleged  false and misleading statements were likely to deceive a reasonable consumer, the  names of the persons who made the misrepresentations, and their authority to  speak on behalf of GM.   First, Defendant cites no authority that  a UCL claim would be subject to the heightened pleading standard of common law  fraud. Business and Professions Code  section 17200 prohibits “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or  practice.” To bring a claim under the fraud prong, a  plaintiff must allege an affirmative misrepresentation, conduct, or business  practice on the part of a defendant; or an omission in violation of a  defendant’s duty to disclose; and that is likely to deceive members of the  public. (Buller v. Sutter Health (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 981, 986; Hypertouch,  Inc. v. ValueClick, Inc. (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 805, 839-840 [whether  statements or advertisements are likely to deceive a reasonable consumer, is a  fact question].) The fraud prong of the UCL is less rigorous than common law  fraud, as common law fraud requires allegations of actual falsity and  reasonable reliance while fraud under UCL does not. (Morgan v. AT&T  Wireless Services, Inc. (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1235, 1256.) Even if the  pleading standard applied, the Court has already explained why the pleading  meets the pleading standard for common law prong. Moreover, the SAC establishes all that is required  for the UCL fraud cause of action: an omission in violation of GM’s duty to  disclose. The SAC alleges facts which, if believed, show that GM’s deception is  likely to deceive a member of the public. (SAC ¶¶  8-21.)    Defendant also ignores the unlawfulness  prong. “An unlawful business  practice or act is an act or practice, committed pursuant to business activity,  that is at the same time forbidden by law.” (Klein v. Earth Elements, Inc.  (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 965, 969.) A  violation of other laws is deemed independently actionable under the UCL. (Law  Offices of Mathew Higbee v. Expungement Assistance Services (2013)  214 Cal.App.4th 544, 554.) “‘Virtually any law—federal, state or local—can  serve as a predicate for a section 17200 action.’” (Id.) The SAC  alleges just that: violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. (SAC  ¶¶ 41, 48-88.) This provides independent grounds for the UCL cause of action.   Plaintiff has standing to assert the  instant UCL claim. Private parties can sue under the UCL  only if,¿as a result of¿unfair competition, they have 1) suffered¿injury in  fact,¿and 2) suffered some form of economic injury. (Bus. & Prof. Code §  17204; see¿Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 322.)  There must be a causal link between the alleged unfair competition and  plaintiff's injury; plaintiff must have lost money or property¿because of¿the  challenged act. (Hall v. Time Inc. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 847, 855.)  “The phrase ‘as a result of’ in its plain and ordinary sense means ‘caused by’  and requires a showing of a causal connection or reliance on the alleged  misrepresentation.” (Kwikset Corp., supra, 51 Cal.4th at 326.) Plaintiff  alleges an injury in fact. As a result of GM’s fraudulent  business practices, Plaintiff purchased the defective Vehicle that she  otherwise would not have purchased. (¶¶ 8-12.)    Accordingly, the demurrer is OVERRULED  as to this cause of action.   Motion to Strike - Punitive Damages   Defendant argues that Plaintiff has  not alleged facts showing that GM “intended . . . to cause injury to  [Plaintiff],” or engaged in “despicable conduct . . . with a willful and  conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others,” or “subject[ed] [Plaintiff]  to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of [his] rights,” or  “intentional[ly] misrepresent[ed], decei[ved], or conceal[ed] . . . a material  fact known to [GM] with the intention . . . of . . . depriving [Plaintiff] of  property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”   Civil Code section 3294 defines fraud  “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact  known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of  thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing  injury.”   As discussed, the SAC alleges an  intentional omission on the part of GM with the intent of depriving Plaintiff  of property, legal rights, or otherwise causing injury. Defendant had a duty to  disclose known material safety defects due to its superior and exclusive knowledge  regarding the battery defect. (SAC ¶ 35.) Defendant “intentionally and  knowingly concealed, suppressed and/or omitted material facts” including the  presence of the defective high voltage battery pack. (SAC ¶¶ 11, 31-33.)  Defendant “intended to defraud Plaintiff” because it knew its concealment and  suppression of material facts were false and misleading, that nondisclosure of  the battery defect would sell more vehicles, and would specifically “encourage  Plaintiff to purchase the defective vehicle.” (¶ 36.) Plaintiff was unaware of  the truth, and would not have purchased the vehicle if she knew the truth of  the battery defect. (¶ 37.) Thus, Plaintiff was harmed by GM’s fraudulent and  intentional omission. The “fraud” element of punitive damages is therefore sufficiently  pled.    Accordingly, the motion is DENIED. Defendant to file an answer within 20 days.
