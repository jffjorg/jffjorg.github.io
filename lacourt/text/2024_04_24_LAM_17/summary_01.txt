The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production (RFP) and has determined that the motion is moot. The defendant has supplemented their responses and provided all non-privileged responsive documents as of April 9, 2024. The court does not find it necessary to award sanctions at this time, given the parties' efforts to meet and confer. The plaintiff's motion to compel further responses is denied.
