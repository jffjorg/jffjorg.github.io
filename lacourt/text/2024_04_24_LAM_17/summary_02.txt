And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend to file a second amended complaint (SAC). The plaintiff seeks to remove himself from certain claims and withdraw the sixth cause of action for cessation. The court finds that there would be no meaningful prejudice to the defendant if the motion is granted, and cites a precedent case to support this decision.
