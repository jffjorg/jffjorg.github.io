And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Vig Private Lending, Inc. v. Ilan Kenig. The defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained, with 5 days leave to amend. The plaintiff's complaint is not properly verified, as it was verified by a property manager rather than an officer of the corporation. Additionally, the plaintiff's allegation of standing is insufficient, as it does not demonstrate a right to possession of the property. The court grants the plaintiff 5 days to amend its complaint to cure these defects.
