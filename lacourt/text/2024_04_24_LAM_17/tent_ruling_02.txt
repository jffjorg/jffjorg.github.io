BRETT GAGNON, an
  individual, and in

  vs.
 
ARSALAN HAMIDI 
 


 Case
  No.:  22STCV30718 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: April 24, 2024 



 
Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend to file a SAC is GRANTED.  
 
On 9/20/2022,
Plaintiff Gagnon filed suit as an individual and
in 
a directive
capacity on behalf of Geminon Properties, LLC (Plaintiff) against Arsalan
Hamidi (Defendant). On 6/5/2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint
(FAC) alleging: (1) breach of operating agreement; (2) breach of fiduciary
duties; (3) constructive fraud; (4) constructive trust; (5) conversion; (6)
cessation; and (7) declaratory relief. 
 
            On
1/30/2024, Plaintiff sought leave to file a second amended complaint (SAC). 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks leave to amend to remove himself from the FAC in his individual capacity
for the first, second, fourth, fifth and seventh causes of action, and to
remove the sixth cause of action for cessation/withdrawal of membership. 
            
            On
1/24/2023, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to strike, and instructed Plaintiff
to seek leave of court to file the SAC. 
 
            Given
that Plaintiff only seeks to remove Plaintiff from certain claims and withdraw
the sixth cause of action, and does not seek to add new or different
allegations, the Court finds no meaningful prejudice would result if the motion
was granted. The policy favoring leave to amend is so
strong that it is an abuse of discretion to deny an amendment unless the
adverse party can show meaningful prejudice. (Atkinson v. Elk
Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.)
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend to file a SAC is
granted.  
 
It is so ordered.
