And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to compel production of documents in response to a subpoena. The motion was filed by Plaintiffs MEDINA CULVER, et al. against Defendant COUNTER BRANDS, LLC. The judge found that Plaintiffs' requests for documents related to Defendant's financial condition are improper and not relevant to their claims or damages. The judge also found that the subpoena was issued for an improper purpose, namely to avoid a discovery stay in a separate federal action pending in Minnesota. The judge sustained all of non-party Susan Gregg Renfrew's objections to the relevance of the requested documents. The motion is denied, and the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit.
