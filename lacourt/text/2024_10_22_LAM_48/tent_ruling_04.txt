  CASE NO.: 24STCV12848
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 22, 2024



 
Steven
C. Glickman, counsel of record for Plaintiffs Long Beach Venture LLC, Long Beach
Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund LLC, Pine Avenue LLC, and Pine Avenue Qualified
Opportunity Zone Fund LLC, seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that there has been
a complete breakdown between Plaintiffs and counsel such that counsel can no longer
represent Plaintiffs.  No party opposed the
motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial has not yet been set, and there is no prejudice
to Plaintiffs.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Plaintiffs
and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for Plaintiffs is scheduled for December 17, 2024 at 8:30
a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
Plaintiffs
must retain new counsel by that date or the Court may dismiss their claims.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 22nd day of October 2024
