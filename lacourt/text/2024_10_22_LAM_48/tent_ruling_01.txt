  CASE NO.: 22STCV31186
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 22, 2024



 
Lauren
Katunich, Freda Tjoarman, and Raines Feldman Littrell LLP (counsel of record for
Defendant EMC Topanga LLC) seek to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that there has been
a permanent and irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship to the
extent that counsel can no longer effectively represent Defendant.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Judgment has already been entered, and there is
no prejudice to Defendant.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on EMC Topanga
LLC and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  EMC Topanga LLC must retain counsel before taking
any other action in this case.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
