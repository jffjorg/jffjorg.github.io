And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Steven C. Glickman, counsel for the plaintiffs, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was unopposed and the judge found that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The judge notes that the motion complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.

However, the judge also notes that a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record, and therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to Retain New Counsel is scheduled for December 17, 2024. The plaintiffs must retain new counsel by that date or the court may dismiss their claims.

The judge's ruling is tentative and will become final unless a party informs the court that they intend to submit on the tentative ruling.
