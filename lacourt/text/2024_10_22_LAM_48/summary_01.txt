And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to be relieved as counsel for EMC Topanga, LLC is granted. The motion was unopposed, and Counsel's declaration stated that there has been a permanent and irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, making it impossible for them to effectively represent the Defendant. The Judge notes that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The Defendant is ordered to retain new counsel before taking any further action in the case.
