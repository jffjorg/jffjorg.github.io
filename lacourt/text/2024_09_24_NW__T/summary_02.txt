And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the objections and refusals to answer by Mr. Work at his deposition. The court finds that the objections are without merit. Mr. Work and Mr. Reinsdorf are not lawyers, and the requested information does not touch on attorney work product. The court also finds that the information requested is not protected by attorney-client privilege. The court concludes that the common interest doctrine does not apply to the parties in this case, as they are not aligned. The court grants the motion and orders Mr. Work to answer the questions to which he refused to answer, to complete his deposition, and to produce the documents that he refused to produce. The court will set a hearing on monetary sanctions.
