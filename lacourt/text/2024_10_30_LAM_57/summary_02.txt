And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is granting the Plaintiff's motion for trial preference, as the Plaintiff's sole cause of action is for declaratory relief, which triggers a mandatory trial preference under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1062.3(a). The Judge denies the Plaintiff's request to have the trial set within 120 days, as this provision only applies when the court grants a trial preference under Section 36(e), which is not the basis for this decision. Instead, the Judge is setting the trial for June 16, 2024. The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's ex parte application to advance the hearing on its motion to compel the deposition of Alex Cohen, as the trial will not be set within 120 days. The Judge denies the Defendant's ex parte application for an order shortening time on its motion for reconsideration of the denial of its motion to compel arbitration, as the motion has not yet been filed.
