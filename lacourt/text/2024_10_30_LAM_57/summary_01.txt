And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has ruled that General Motors' (GM) demurrer to the second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action in the complaint is sustained, meaning that these causes of action are not sufficiently specific to support the allegations. The Judge agrees with GM that the complaint is too vague. The Plaintiff has been given leave to amend the complaint, and must file an amended complaint by November 20, 2024.

The Judge has also denied GM's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages in the complaint, as it is moot in light of the ruling on the demurrer.

Additionally, the Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The Judge ruled that the Plaintiff failed to submit separate statements accompanying the motions, as required by California Rule of Court 3.1345. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's recitation of the text of the special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and requests for production and GM's responses and objections thereto within the corresponding motions was not a substitute for separate statements. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff's explanations were cursory and failed to address each objection and request separately.
