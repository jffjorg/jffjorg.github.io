Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the City of San Gabriel's motion for summary judgment and plans to continue the hearing on this motion to hear it simultaneously with the motion for summary judgment filed by the County of Los Angeles. The judge is concerned that adjudicating the issue of who was responsible for maintaining the road where the accident occurred could lead to unfair or inconsistent rulings if the County is not present in court. Additionally, the judge wants to hear from the Plaintiffs regarding their objections to the City's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, specifically whether they believe they have been denied fair notice of the evidence cited by the City in support of its motion.
