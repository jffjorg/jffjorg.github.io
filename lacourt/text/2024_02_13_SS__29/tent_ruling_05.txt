(Miskell Decls., ¶ 2.) On January 12, 2024, Defendant filed the Motions to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents and Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matters Admitted in Request for Admissions. Defendant does not seek sanctions in his motions.  No opposition has been filed. Legal StandardA party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)When a party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)A party must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)When a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Requests for admission may be propounded on a party without leave of court 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by that party, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.020(b).)In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)Where there has been no timely response to requests for admissions, a “requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section 2023.010).”  The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for admission admitted “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)“[P]roviding untimely responses does not divest the trial court of its authority [to hear a motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even if the untimely response “does not contain objections [and] substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion to compel responses … the trial court retains the authority to hear the motion.”¿ (Id. at pp. 408-409.)¿ This rule gives “an important incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”¿ (Id. at p. 408.)¿ If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,” the trial court may “deny the motion to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part, and just impose sanctions.”¿ (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).)  DiscussionOn September 26, 2022, Defendant Demetrius Lamar Williams (“Defendant”) propounded Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for Production of Documents, and Request for Admissions on Plaintiff the Estate of Bertram Parie. (Miskell Decls., ¶ 2.) Defendant has not received any responses. (Miskell Decls., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff Brenda Henry died on March 18, 2022. (Exhibit C). Plaintiffs’ counsel gave notice of the death on February 8, 2023.  A year has passed since the filing of the notice, and almost two years since Plaintiff’s death, but no notice of a new personal representative of the Estate of Bertram Parie or Brenda Henry nor a motion to name a successor in interest has been filed with the Court. These discovery motions were filed in January 2024.  Not surprisingly, given the death of the plaintiff and the absence of any notice or motion to substitute a successor-in-interest, no opposition has been filed. At this time, there is no Plaintiff to compel: the only person to compel (in her own capacity and as the personal representative of the Estate) has died. Defendant’s motions are continued for approximately 30 days.ConclusionDefendant’s motions are continued for approximately 30 days, to March 15, 2024, at 1:30 pm, in Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.The Court, on its own motion, sets an Order to Show cause regarding substitution of a party in place of the deceased plaintiff (in her own capacity and as the representative of the Estate of Mr. Parie), for the same date and time, March 15, 2024, at 1:30 pm, in Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The Court, on its own motion, sets an Order to Show cause regarding why Plaintiff’s counsel Minh T. Nguyen (of Nguyen Theam Lawyers, LLP) and Jeffrey R. Billings (of The Law Offices of Larry H. Parker, Inc.) should not be subject to monetary sanctions of up to $500 each for delay in prosecution for the failure to file a notice or motion regarding substitution of a successor-in-interest for the deceased plaintiff, for the same date and time, March __, 2024, at 1:30 pm, in Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.  These sanctions are in addition to whatever sanctions may be awarded against counsel under the Civil Discovery Act.Plaintiff’s counsel Minh T. Nguyen (of Nguyen Theam Lawyers, LLP) and Jeffrey R. Billings (of The Law Offices of Larry H. Parker, Inc.) are each individually ORDERED to appear, either in person or by remote means, at the OSC hearing.  Failure to appear may lead to the imposition of additional sanctions, including, but not limited to, monetary sanctions of up to $1,000 against each counsel and dismissal of this lawsuit.  These sanctions are in addition to whatever sanctions may be awarded against counsel under the Civil Discovery Act.The Clerk will give notice.
