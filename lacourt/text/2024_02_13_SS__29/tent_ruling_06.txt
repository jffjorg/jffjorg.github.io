 Case Number:  22STCV01221    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE    The Court excuses the personal  appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by  telephone or video conference call.     The Court has reviewed the January 23, 2024  filed Petition for Minor’s Compromise. There is still a deficiency as to the  costs requested. Petitioner claims $764.95 in costs on line 13b and 16d,  however, the total of the expenses provided is $786.73. The amount to be  reimbursed and balance of proceeds to Claimant are therefore also incorrect.   There are also now new deficiencies on the  order, as the amounts to be reimbursed and balance of proceeds are incorrect.  Further, 8b is incorrect as the balance of settlement after payment is not  $3,559.28, that is the requested attorney’s fee. 8a(1) lists the previous,  incorrect balance of proceeds to claimant as attorney’s fees.   Accordingly, the matter is CONTINUED to allow petitioner to rectify  the aforementioned deficiencies. Hearing on Petition to Confirm Minor's Compromise is continued to 03/18/2024 at 01:30 PM in 
Department 29 at Spring Street Courthouse.   Moving party is ordered to give notice.
