Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thinking on the case. The judge is considering the motions filed by the defendant, Demetrius Lamar Williams, to compel the plaintiff, Estate of Bertram Parie, to respond to interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff has not responded to these requests, and the defendant is seeking sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel for delay in prosecution.

The judge is also considering the death of the plaintiff, Brenda Henry, and the absence of any notice or motion to substitute a successor-in-interest. The judge is setting an Order to Show cause regarding substitution of a party in place of the deceased plaintiff and regarding why plaintiff's counsel should not be subject to monetary sanctions for delay in prosecution.

The judge is continuing the defendant's motions for approximately 30 days and setting an OSC hearing for March 15, 2024, to consider these issues further. The judge is also ordering the plaintiff's counsel to appear at the OSC hearing and threatening sanctions against them if they fail to appear.
