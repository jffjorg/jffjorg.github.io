 Case Number:  23STCV06609    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Set Aside Dismissal and Enter Judgment, filed
by Plaintiff Amguard Insurance Company. 
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On March 27,
2023 Plaintiff Amguard Insurance Company(“Plaintiff”) filed its complaint
against Defendant Victor Manuel Salazar (“Defendant”), and Does 1 through 5, for
damages.
 
On April 27,
2023, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written stipulation for the entry
of judgment, which would be discharged upon the payment of $37,906.90. (Benson
Decl., ¶ 4.)  Pursuant to that agreement,
the case was dismissed, but the Court retained jurisdiction to enforce the
settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 in the event of breach.
 
On December 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to set
aside dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant. No opposition has been
filed.
 
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
provides that “[i]f parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.)  In ruling on a motion to enter judgment, the
court acts as a trier of fact.  The court
must determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.  To do so, the court may receive oral
testimony in addition to declarations.  (Kohn
v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
“[W]here the plaintiff has filed a voluntary
dismissal of an action …, the court is without jurisdiction to act further …,
and any subsequent orders of the court are simply void.” (Paniagua v. Orange
County Fire Auth. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 83, 89, (internal quotes
omitted).) The result is different where a signed, written settlement agreement
(or oral settlement before the court) states the court retains jurisdiction to
enforce the settlement because that agreement could be enforced under C.C.P. §
664.6. (See Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 439-440; Khavarian
Enterprises, Inc. v. Commline, Inc. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 310, 326—court
had continuing jurisdiction to consider attorney fees and costs motions after
dismissal where settlement agreement provided court retained jurisdiction to
enforce agreement pursuant to CCP § 664.6.)) 
C.C.P. § 664.6(a) states: “If requested by
the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement.”
Counsel may sign the request on behalf of their clients (C.C.P. § 664.6(b)(2)
(added eff. 1/1/21)). The request should be made while the court still has
jurisdiction. (Wackeen v. Malis, supra, 97 CA4th at 433; see Sayta
v. Chu (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 960, 962.)
 
Discussion
On April 27,
2023, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a written stipulation for the entry
of judgment, which would be discharged upon the payment of $37,906.90. (Benson
Decl., ¶ 4.) This agreement has been attached as Exhibit 1. Defendant was to
pay $100.00 a month after his insurance carrier paid $10,000.00 toward the
settlement amount. (Id.) Defendant failed to make any payments. (Id.,
¶ 5.)
 
The Stipulation
Agreement appears to have been executed, with signatures from the two parties. (Exhibit
1.) As such, there is a valid agreement.
 
On June
20, 2023, the stipulation was filed with the Court to allow the Court
jurisdiction to enforce the stipulation. (Exhibit 1, ¶ 1.) The Order for Dismissal
and Court Retaining Jurisdiction was signed on June 20, 2023. Therefore, the
Court has jurisdiction to enforce this Stipulation Agreement.
 
Plaintiff
contends Defendant failed to make any payments and that the balance due is
$27,906.90. (Beson Decl., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff also requests filing costs of $72.00.
(Id., 2:8-11.) Plaintiff requests a total judgment entered of
$27,978.90. (Id.)
 
The Court finds Plaintiff has established that
there was a valid agreement between the parties, that the Court retains
jurisdiction, and that there is a need to set aside the dismissal and enter
judgment against Defendant.
Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to set
aside the dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant.
 
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS the motion to set aside the
dismissal. Judgment is entered against Defendant for $27,978.90. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
