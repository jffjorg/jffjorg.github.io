Kilcullen.
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied.
 
Background
On July 23, 2021, Plaintiff Lena
Foster (“Plaintiff”) filed her complaint against Defendant Irene Kilcullen
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50, for negligence cause of action arising
from auto accident occurring on August 1, 2019.
 
On December 6, 2023, the Court
ordered Plaintiff to serve verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
Special Interrogatories, Set One and Demand for Production of Documents, Set
One without objection within 30 days. (Cloud Decl., ¶ 2.)
 
On January 17, 2024, Defendant filed
this Motion for Terminating Sanctions. No
opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice
to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing,
may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The court may impose a terminating
sanction …."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery."  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246
Cal.App.4th at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are
“willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v. Super.
Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle
of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery sanction
should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better
position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with
its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge
v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2
Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A “terminating
sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary discovery
sanction is never justified.”  (Newland,
supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) 
Discussion
On December 6, 2023, the Court
ordered Plaintiff to serve verified responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
Special Interrogatories, Set One and Demand for Production of Documents, Set
One without objection within 30 days. (Cloud Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff was also
ordered to pay monetary sanctions of $1,080.00 to Defendant. (Id., ¶ 3.)
Defendant served notice of the Court’s order on December 7, 2024. (Exhibit A.)
Plaintiff has yet to provide responses. (Cloud Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
Defendant
moves for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff for failing to respond to
discovery requests as well as failing to comply with this Court’s order to
respond to discovery requests.  
Plaintiff’s failure in providing discovery
responses is substantial discovery abuse. 
Serious sanctions are warranted for this conduct.  
For terminating sanctions, however, a party
must present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process,
as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendant has not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions.
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Defendant.
Defendant does not seek any lesser sanctions.

Accordingly,
the Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
The
denial is without prejudice to Defendant seeking other sanctions or seeking a
terminating sanction at a later stage of the proceedings, based on a further
showing of misuse of the discovery process.
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED.
Defendant
is ordered to give notice.
