And here is the English text summary:

The Tentative Ruling denies the Defendant's Motion for Terminating Sanctions, which was filed on January 17, 2024. The motion was filed due to the Plaintiff's failure to serve verified responses to discovery requests as ordered by the Court on December 6, 2023. The Court found that while the Plaintiff's failure is substantial discovery abuse, it did not constitute a repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process. Therefore, the Court did not find that a terminating sanction was warranted at this time. The denial is without prejudice to the Defendant seeking other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of the proceedings.
