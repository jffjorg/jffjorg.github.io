The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has shown sufficient evidence of necessity and reasons for the discovery, but notes that the Plaintiff has not shown diligence in filing the motion. The Judge imposes conditions on the reopening of discovery, including allowing the Defendant to depose the new expert witnesses and to counter-designate expert witnesses on the same subjects.
