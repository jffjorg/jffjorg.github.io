 Case Number:  24STCV02116    Hearing Date:   August 12, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ CAMILLE BROOKS, Plaintiff(s), vs. FCA US LLC, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.:¿ 24STCV02116 Hearing Date: August 12, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING UNOPPOSED MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY  I.  BACKGROUND Plaintiff Camille Brooks (“Plaintiff”) served on defendant FCA US LLC (“Defendant”) request for production of documents (“RPDs”), set one, on April 1, 2024. (Parzivand Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. 1.) On May 8, 2024, Defendant served unverified discovery responses to the RPDs, set one, in addition to a link containing no documents. (Id. ¶¶ 5-6.) The parties discussed the issue, signed a protective order regarding production, and Defendant served verifications on June 24, 2024. (Id. ¶¶ 7-14.) However, to date, Defendant has not provided any of the referenced documents. (Id. ¶ 15.) Any opposition was due on or before July 30, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.   II.  DISCUSSSION For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.  (CRC, Rule 8.54(c).) Defendant has not opposed the motion demonstrating that the documents referred to in its responses to Plaintiff’s RFP, set one, have been made available to Plaintiff to date.  III. CONCLUSION Plaintiff’s motion to compel RPDs, set one, is GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to serve responsive documents as referenced in its responses to Plaintiff’s RFP, set one, within ten (10) days of this Order (CCP § 2031.300(a),(b).)  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: August 9, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
