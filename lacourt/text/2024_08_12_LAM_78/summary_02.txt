This is a tentative ruling granting defendant Structured Asset Mortgage Investment II Trust 2007-AR7, Inc.'s (SAMI) motion to quash service of summons. The case involves a wrongful foreclosure of residential real property and allegations against several defendants, including JPMorgan Chase Bank. SAMI argues that it is a non-existent entity and was improperly served, while the plaintiffs argue that it is a corporation owned by Chase Bank and was properly served. The court finds that the plaintiffs have not met their burden of proving that service was proper and grants SAMI's motion to quash service of summons.
