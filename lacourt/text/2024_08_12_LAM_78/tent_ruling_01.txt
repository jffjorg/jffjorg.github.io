  Case Number:  21STCV41913    Hearing Date:   August 12, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ ELIZABETH'S FOOD CO., INC., Plaintiff(s), vs. ALEJANDRO CASTRO, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 21STCV41913 Hearing Date: August 12, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING CLAIM OF EXEMPTION  On July 25, 2023, the Court entered default judgment for Elizabeth’s Food Co. Inc. (“Judgment Creditor”) against defendant Alejandro Castro (“Judgment Debtor”) in the amount of $54,883.82. On June 13, 2024, Judgment Creditor filed a notice of hearing on claim of exemption and a notice of opposition to the claim of exemption. The hearing on the claim of exemption was set for August 12, 2024. On August 2, 2024, Judgment Debtor filed a motion to set aside default judgment, set to be heard on October 30, 2024. Considering the motion to set aside default judgment may have an outcome in terms of the claim of exemption, the Court finds good cause to continue the claim of exemption to be heard at the same time as the motion to set aside. Therefore, the Hearing on Claim of Exemption/Third-Party Claim is continued to October 30, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 78 of Stanley Mosk Courthouse.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: August 9, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
