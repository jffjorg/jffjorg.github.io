This tentative ruling continues the hearing on the claim of exemption to October 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 78 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The hearing was originally scheduled for August 12, 2024, but the Court finds good cause to continue it due to the pending motion to set aside the default judgment. The Judgment Debtor has filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, and the Court believes that the outcome of this motion may impact the claim of exemption. The Court orders the moving party to give notice of the continued hearing date.
