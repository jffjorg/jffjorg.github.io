And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement agreement. The settlement agreement is fair, adequate, and reasonable based on the evidence presented. The court finds that the settlement is a compromise of disputed claims that has been reached through arm's length bargaining. The court also finds that the settlement is reasonable based on the strength of the plaintiff's case, the risk, expense, complexity, and likely duration of further litigation, and the amount offered in settlement.

The settlement agreement provides for a gross settlement amount of $325,000, which includes attorneys' fees, reimbursement of litigation costs and expenses, and a release of claims. The settlement agreement also provides for the distribution of settlement funds to class members and the determination of attorney fees.

The court has set a schedule for the preliminary approval hearing, the deadline for serving notices to class members, and the deadline for objecting or opting out. The court has also set a deadline for class counsel to file a motion for final approval of the settlement and a motion for attorney fees.

The court has conditionally certified the class and found that there is a community of interest among the class members. The court has also found that the named plaintiff has claims typical of the class and that class counsel is experienced in similar litigation.

The court has approved the release of claims and has granted the motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement agreement. The court will hold a final fairness hearing to consider any objections to the settlement and to determine the reasonableness of the attorney fees.
