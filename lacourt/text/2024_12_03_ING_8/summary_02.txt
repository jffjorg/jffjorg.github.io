And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Ryan Q. Keech, Esq. and Connor J. Meggs, Esq., who are the attorneys of record for Defendant Shinichi Kakefu. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in communications and a breach of the engagement agreement by the Defendant, who has failed to pay significant amounts of outstanding fees and costs despite being offered alternative payment options. The attorneys complied with all procedural requirements and the court finds that the withdrawal of representation would not cause an injustice or undue delay in the proceedings. However, the court emphasizes that proofs of service are required to be filed before the granting of this motion.
