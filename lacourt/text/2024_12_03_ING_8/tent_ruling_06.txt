BACKGROUNDA. FactualOn June 24, 2024, Plaintiffs, Christin Jesus Alegria and Paola Jannette Chaname (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint, in pro per, against Defendants, Hui Q. Wong, an individual, Wong Family Trust, a Living Trust, and DOES 1 through 10. The complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Constructive Eviction; (2) Breac of Habitability; (3) Negligence; (4)Breach of Quiet Enjoyment; (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (6) Violation of State and Local Health and Safety Codes; and (7) Loss of Use.On July 21, 2024, Defendant, Hui Q. Wong, Trustee of the Wong Living Trust (erroneously sued as Hui Q. Wong, an individual, Wong Family Trust, a Living Trust) (hereinafter “Defendant”) propounded his first set of discovery on both of the Plaintiffs. On August 15, 2024, Plaintiffs responded with their responses. However, Defendant argues that instead of properly answering the discovery, Plaintiffs objected to each and every request/interrogatory. As such, Defendant has filed these motions to compel further responses.B. ProceduralOn October 7, 2024, Defendant filed these three Motions to Compel Further Responses from Plaintiff, Paola Jannette Chaname as to the Requests for Admission, and the Motions to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admission and Form Interrogatories for Plaintiff, Christian Jesus Alegria. To date, no opposition has been filed.III. ANALYSISA. Legal StandardA motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive, or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) A motion to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) In Digital Music News LLC v Superior Court (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 216 at 224, the Court defined “good cause” as a showing that there “a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.” If the moving party has shown good cause for the requests for production, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the objections. (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct (2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.) ¿"The court shall limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.020(a).) Generally, objections on the ground of burden require the objecting party to produce evidence of (a) the propounding party's subjective intent to create burden or (b) the amount of time and effort it would take to respond. (See West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior Court In and For Los Angeles County (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) However, no such evidence is necessary where discovery is obviously overbroad on its face. (See Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290, subdivision (a), provides that “[o]n receipt of a particular response to requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) An answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete[;] (2) An objection to a particular request is without merit or too general.” Notice of the motion must be given within 45 days of service of the verified response, otherwise the propounding party waives the right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (c).) Additionally, Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides that “[o]n receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that . . .”[a]n answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)The motions must also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b).) Finally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3)).B. Discussioni. Meet and ConferThe declaration of counsel for Defendant, Larry Rothman (“Rothman Decl.”) he has attached his meet and confer letter to the Plaintiffs. (Rothman Decl., ¶ 4.) Rothman indicates that he offered to allow Plaintiffs an extension of time to further respond if they would have allowed him additional time to bring this motion. (Rothman Decl., ¶ 4.) Further, Rothman states he sent Plaintiffs an original letter upon being retained whereby he requested their email and phone number so he could meet and confer with them whenever necessary, but that they have not responded to said requests. (Rothman Decl., ¶ 4.) Rothman also notes that in their discovery responses to him, they objected to the Form Interrogatory request as to their phone numbers, and as such, he has had a complete inability to meet and confer with Plaintiffs concerning their responses to discovery. (Rothman Decl., ¶ 6.)The Court believes Rothman has done everything in his ability to attempt to meet and confer with the Plaintiffs prior to bringing these motions to compel. As such, the Court finds that Defendant has attempted to meet and confer in good faith prior to bringing these motions to compel further.ii. Motion to Compel Plaintiffs’ Further Responses to Requests for Production of DocumentsPer Defendant’s separate statement, it appears that the single Motion to Compel Further is actually for both of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents. Both Plaintiffs were requested RFP Nos. 1 through 31. Here, the court finds that the requests for production of documents are relevant to the case at bar. The court alsofinds each request to be straightforward. As such, the court GRANTS Defendant’s Motions to Compel Plaintiffs’ further responses to Requests for Production of Documents. The verified further responses without objection, and the production of the responsive documents shall be served by Plaintiff on or before December 31, 2024.iii. Motion to Compel Plaintiffs’ Further Responses to Requests for AdmissionHere, Defendant argues that both Plaintiffs have violated Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220, subdivision (a), as neither have admitted, denied, or specified they lacked sufficient information to admit or deny the request. The separate statement argues that further responses are required as each of the requests are not objectionable. The court disagrees. Each Plaintiff was asked to respond to RFAs 1 through 9.As to RFAs 1 through 9 as to each Plaintiff, the court DENIES Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Response. Each RFA asked both of the Plaintiffs to admit or deny multiple facts. For example, in RFA No. 1 alone, Plaintiffs are each requested to admit or deny that they have resided at the subject property, that since they have resided there, the property needed repairs, that Defendant neglected to address said repairs, that despite these ongoing issues, Plaintiffs have paid rent on time and maintained the property in good condition, that there has been a continuous roach infestation, that there has been significant mold growth, that both have severely impacted the health and well-being of Plaintiffs and their family members, and that these issues have been repeatedly reported to Defendant, but that no effective resolution has been provided. The objection by Plaintiffs is sustained. The RFA is compound, confusing, and Plaintiffs nonetheless provided an admission or denial of each of the 9 requests each. As written, the court does not find reason to compel further responses from either Plaintiff as to the Requests for Admission. Thus, Defendant’s motion is DENIED, without prejudice to more narrowly tailored single-fact or single issue RFAs in the future.iv. Motions to Compel Plaintiffs’ Further Responses to Form InterrogatoriesAs to the Form Interrogatories for each Plaintiff, the Court finds good cause to compel further responses from both Plaintiffs. Per the separate statement, Plaintiffs leave blank, leave in notes like “[insert],” and object to almost every form interrogatory on the basis of privacy, overbreadth, and claim that they are unduly burdensome. The court disagrees and emphasizes that most form interrogatories are approved by the Judicial Council and are often found to be relevant, even just for background information on the party being requested. As such, the court orders Plaintiffs to provide verified, code-compliant further responses to each form interrogatory, without objection. Plaintiffs should be answering in the structure and format as requested. The verified further responses without objection shall be served by Plaintiff on or before December 31, 2024.v. SanctionsAlong with each motion, Defendant has requested sanctions in the amount of $4,132 ($12,396 total). This amount is based on Rothman’s declaration that he spent a total of 25.25hours working on the three (3) motions. (Rothman Decl., ¶ 5.) Rothman admits that there is much repetition in the motions and letters, and thus he has divided his hours by three (3) for a net amount of 8.42 hours per motion. Rothman also claims that he plans to appear online for 2 hours at the hearing, and spend 3 more hours preparing any response. Rothman notes that filing fee is $75 per motion and estimates a Federal Express of $25 per motion.Here, the Court will be awarding sanctions, but in an lowered rate based on the following: (1) First, no opposition brief has been filed, and thus the 3 hours of anticipated time preparing a response will be eliminated as Defendant has not even filed a notice of non-opposition; (2) Second, the Court will not be spending two (2) hours on an unopposed, and general discovery motion; (3) The Court finds the hours spent or claimed to be spent on the three motions are excessive; and (4) The Court does not find good cause to grant the Motion to Compel Plaintiffs’ Further Responses to Requests for Admission. Thus, the court will award $2,500 total, $1,250 per each of the two granted motions. Monetary sanctions are payable by Plaintiffs to counsel for Defendants on or before December 31, 2024.IV. CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s Motions to Compel Further are GRANTED as to the Requests for Production of Documents and Form Interrogatories, but DENIED as to the Requests for Admission. Plaintiffs are ordered to provide further, code-compliant, verified responses without objections to Defense counsel on or before December 31, 2024.Further, Plaintiffs are ordered to pay Defense Counsel sanctions in the amount of $2,500 total on or before December 31, 2024.Defendant is ordered to provide notice.************************Number 2*******************************MOVING PARTY: Defendant, Hui Q. Wong, trustees of the Wong Living Trust, sued erroneously as Hui Q. Wong, an individual; Wong Family Trust, a living trust.RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff, Christin Jesus Alegria and Paola Jannette Chaname (No Opposition).TRIAL DATE: Not Set.MOTION: (1) Motion for Protective Order.Tentative Rulings: (1) ARGUE. The motion appears to have been filed on the 35th day after service by mail of the subject discovery to Defendants, which may make the motion timely, but there is a lack of foundation for the matters typically addressed in a motion for protective order.I. BACKGROUNDA. FactualOn June 24, 2024, Plaintiffs, Christin Jesus Alegria and Paola Jannette Chaname (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint, in pro per, against Defendants, Hui Q. Wong, an individual, Wong Family Trust, a Living Trust, and DOES 1 through 10. The complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Constructive Eviction; (2) Breach of Habitability; (3) Negligence; (4) Breach of Quiet Enjoyment; (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (6) Violation of State and Local Health and Safety Codes; and (7) Loss of Use.Here, Defendant, Hui Q. Wong, Trustee of the Wong Living Trust (erroneously sued as Hui Q. Wong, an individual, Wong Family Trust, a Living Trust) (hereinafter “Defendant”) now files a Motion for an Extension to Respond to Discovery/Protective Order.B. ProceduralOn September 30, 2024, Defendant filed this Motion for an Extension to Respond to Discovery/Protective Order. To date, no opposition has been filed.III. ANALYSISA. Legal StandardA protective order may issue under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2017.020, 2025.420, 2030.090, 2031.060, and 2033.080. In each case, a protective order should be issued for good cause, such as to prevent unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden and expense. Additionally, prior to making such a motion the moving party must attempt to informally resolve the issue and attach a declaration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040.B. DiscussionPreliminarily, the Court notes that Defendant’s threadbare motion does not indicate a Code section or any legal authority for which he moves under. Thus, this Court will assume that Defendant is moving for a protective order under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.090, and is seeking an order granting defendants additional time to respond to the Plaintiffs’ discovery requests.Defendant states that after receiving Plaintiffs’ discovery, Defendant’s counsel became engaged in numerous hearings and appellate brief which caused him a delay in being able to timely respond to said discovery. Defendant contends he is a sole practitioner. Defendant’s counsel purports that Plaintiffs have failed to put any email or telephone number on any of their filings, and that at the outset of this cause, Defendant sent a letter asking for such information. However, Plaintiff did not respond, leaving Defense counsel unable to contact them concerning an extension. Defendant states he has not waived his objections by filing this motion for a protective order and waiting for the hearing rather than serving blanket objections or meritless responses. The propounded discovery is dated July 29, 2024, but attaches a proof of service indicated mailed service on August 26, 2024.The Court will address the further foundation for the protective order at the hearing.
