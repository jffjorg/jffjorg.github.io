And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which addresses several motions filed by the Defendant, Hui Q. Wong, and the Wong Family Trust, a living trust. The motions include requests to compel further responses to discovery requests, a request for sanctions, and a motion for a protective order.

The Judge grants the motions to compel further responses as to the Requests for Production of Documents and Form Interrogatories, but denies the motion as to the Requests for Admission. The Judge orders the Plaintiffs, Christin Jesus Alegria and Paola Jannette Chaname, to provide further, code-compliant, verified responses without objections to Defense counsel on or before December 31, 2024.

The Judge also awards sanctions to the Defendant in the amount of $2,500, payable by the Plaintiffs to Defense counsel on or before December 31, 2024.

The Judge notes that the Defendant's motions lack foundation for the matters typically addressed in a motion for protective order, and sets the motion for argument.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling provides guidance on the discovery process and the requirements for responding to discovery requests, while also addressing the issues raised by the motions filed by the Defendant.
