And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to the fraud cause of action and a motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Kamran Harsini, filed a complaint against the defendants, including the Hill Community Association, Classic Property Management Company, and others, alleging causes of action including fraud. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that it does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for fraud against a corporation.

The judge sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, giving the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The judge also noted that the defendants' motion to strike portions of the complaint was mooted by the sustaining of the demurrer.

The judge's decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff's complaint does not plead the names of the persons allegedly making the false representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written, as required by California law. The judge also found that the defendants' meet and confer efforts were sufficient and that the plaintiff's counsel did not respond to those efforts.

The judge's ruling is a tentative ruling, meaning that it is subject to change after a hearing on the matter.
