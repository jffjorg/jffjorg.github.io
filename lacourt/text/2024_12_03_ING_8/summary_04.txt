And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Travis Graham v. Florence W. Kelley, et al. The case involves a motion by Plaintiff's attorney, Jacob O. Partiyeli, to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiff. The motion was filed on October 1, 2024, and the trial is set for February 24, 2025.

The judge notes that the attorney has complied with all procedural requirements in filing the motion, but requires further evidence to be presented in camera to determine the necessity of the motion. The court is concerned that the motion is being made so close to the trial date and wants to review the matter further before making a decision.

The judge will require an in camera review with Partiyeli to determine why the motion is necessary and whether it would cause an injustice or undue delay in proceeding. The court's decision will be based on the legal standard set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 284 and the court's discretion in exercising its power to change attorneys.
