BackgroundOn January 20, 2023, Plaintiff, Travis Graham (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants, Florence W. Kelley, Eddie Suber, and DOES 1 through 100. The complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Violation of California Civil Code section 1942.4; (2) Tortious Breach of the Warranty of Habitability; (3) Private Nuisance; (4) Business and Professions Code section 17200, et seq.; (5) Negligence; (6) Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; (7) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (8) Negligence Per Se; (9) Violation of Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California Civil Code section 1750, et seq.; and (10) Disgorgement of Fees Paid for Unlicensed Contractor Services.On October 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s attorney, Jacob O. Partiyeli, Esq. (“Partiyeli”) filed a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff.Trial is set for February 24, 2025.II. Legal Standard & DiscussionCode of Civil Procedure section 284 states that “the attorney in an action…may be changed at any time before or after judgment or final determination, as follows: (1) upon the consent of both client and attorney…; (2) upon the order of the court, upon the application of either client or attorney, after notice from one to the other.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 284; CRC 3.1362.) The withdrawal request may be denied if it would cause an injustice or undue delay in proceeding; but the court's discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (See Mandell v. Superior (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4; Lempert¿v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.)In making a motion to be relieved as counsel, the attorney must comply with procedures set forth in Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362. The motion must be made using mandatory forms: Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel directed to the client – Civil (MC-051); Declaration “stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship” reasons the motion was brought (MC-052); and a Proposed Order (MC-053). (Ibid.) The forms must be filed and served on all parties who have appeared in the case. (Ibid.)Here, Plaintiff’s attorney, Partiyeli, moves the court to relieve him as attorney of record for Plaintiff. Partiyeli properly filed a Notice of Motion, Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, Declaration, and Proposed Order in accordance with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. Partiyeli’s declaration indicates that the Plaintiff was served by mail at the client’s last known address with copies of the motion papers served with the declaration. Partiyeli also attests that Plaintiff’s last known address has been confirmed within the past thirty (30) days via the telephone conversation with the Plaintiff.In the declaration, Mr. Partiyeli states that the reason for the motion is that there has been a breakdown in client communications, which makes it impossible for [his] firm to proceed with this case and to act in the best interest of the Plaintiff.” Partiyeli continues that “[t]he Plaintiff’s behavior prevents [his firm] from effectively representing him in this matter.”Here, Plaintiff’s attorney has complied with all procedural requirements in filing his motion to be relieved as counsel. However, with the impending trial date, the court requires an in camera review with Partiyeli as to why this motion is necessary so close to the current trial date.III. Conclusion & OrderFor the foregoing reasons, Jacob O. Partiyeli, Esq.’s Motion to Be Relieved As Counsel requires further evidence to be presented in camera.
