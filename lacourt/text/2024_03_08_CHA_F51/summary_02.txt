And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further discovery responses from Ford Motor Company (Defendant) in a case brought by Raymundo Rosales (Plaintiff) under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Plaintiff is seeking to compel the Defendant to provide further responses to certain discovery requests, including requests for admission and requests for production of documents.

The court has denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the requests for admission, finding that the request at issue is seeking a legal conclusion and is not relevant to the Plaintiff's claims. The court has also denied the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to certain requests for production of documents, finding that the requests are overly broad or not relevant.

The court has granted the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to certain other requests for production of documents, finding that the Defendant's objections to those requests are without merit.

Finally, the court has imposed sanctions against the Plaintiff's counsel in the amount of $100.00 for denying the Defendant's motion to compel further responses to the requests for admission.

The court's final ruling will be issued after considering any objections to this tentative ruling.
