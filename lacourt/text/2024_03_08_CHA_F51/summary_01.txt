And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Steven Sheridan and The Valley Club House of Los Angeles, California, Inc. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiff, Edwin Tolmas, who had alleged various causes of action, including breach of contract, negligent termination of organization membership, intentional termination of plaintiff member of board of directors, reinstatement as trustee to board of directors, and failure of audit by board of directors.

The judge found that the defendants had met their initial burden to present facts to negate each of the necessary elements of the plaintiff's causes of action, and that the plaintiff had failed to offer any responsive evidence to show a triable issue of material fact. As a result, the judge granted the motion for summary judgment and ordered the defendants to file a proposed judgment within 10 days.

The judge noted that the plaintiff had failed to oppose the motion and had failed to offer any evidence to support his claims. The judge also noted that the defendants had presented evidence to support their defenses, including the termination of the plaintiff's membership due to his misconduct and the lack of any contractual agreement between the parties.
