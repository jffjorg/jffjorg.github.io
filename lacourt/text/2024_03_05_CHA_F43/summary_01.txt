And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories. The Plaintiff, WIN Partners, LLC, propounded form interrogatories on March 28, 2023, and the Defendant, World Tech Toys, Inc., served incomplete responses. The Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further interrogatories on June 27, 2023, and the Court granted the motion on July 24, 2023. The Defendant failed to pay the sanctioned amount of $400, but did serve supplemental responses. The Plaintiff seeks sanctions against the Defendant and their counsel for costs and attorney fees incurred in connection with this motion.

The Court finds that the Defendant's responses to the interrogatory are incomplete and inadequate. The Defendant failed to provide updated verifications, identify the facts, witnesses, and documents supporting each denial, and failed to identify specific documents supporting each affirmative defense.

The Court orders the Defendant to serve supplemental responses within 30 days and to pay sanctions in the total amount of $3,811.65. The Court also declines to impose issue, evidence, and/or terminating sanctions at this time, but reserves the right to do so if the Defendant fails to provide complete responses to the interrogatories.
