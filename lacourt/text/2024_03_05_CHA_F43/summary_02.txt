And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendants, David Simon dba ShanCor and Virachai Pummarachai, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Castaic Truck Stop, Inc., dba Castaic Truck Stop. The defendants argued that the plaintiff is not a real party in interest to the contract, and that Virachai Pummarachai was not a party to the contract. The court sustained the demurrer as to Virachai Pummarachai, but overruled it as to ShanCor. The court also sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff's second and third causes of action, which alleged negligence and professional negligence, as tort remedies for negligence are not permitted for a breach of contract outside of certain circumstances. The court gave the plaintiff leave to amend.
