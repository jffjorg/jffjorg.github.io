And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case regarding the repossession of Plaintiff Ihab Youssef's vehicle. The plaintiff has brought claims against Defendants Loss Prevention Services, LLC and Benchmark Asset Resolution, Inc. for violations of the Collateral Recovery Act, Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Conversion, and Unfair Competition Law. The defendants have moved to strike the complaint's references to punitive damages and certain paragraphs of the complaint. The judge has denied the motion to strike the complaint's references to punitive damages, finding that the allegations of unlicensed activity and malicious conduct support the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The judge has also denied the motion to strike paragraphs 33 and 52 of the complaint, finding that these paragraphs are relevant to the plaintiff's claims. The judge has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice. The parties are required to submit on the tentative ruling, and counsel are encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
