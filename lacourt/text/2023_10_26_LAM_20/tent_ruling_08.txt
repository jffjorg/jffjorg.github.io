 On March 15, 2023, Plaintiff Rafael Ayala filed the operative Complaint against Defendant LA Rentals Live LLC for (1) violation of Civ. Code § 1942.4, (2) breach of warranty of habitability, (3) nuisance, (4) violation of the UCL, and (5) negligence. On August 30, 2023, Defendant filed a Cross-Complaint for (1) breach of contract, (2) nuisance, (3) violation of the UCL, and (4) “damage to real property”.Plaintiff now seeks to strike the entirety of the Cross-Complaint per Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16.Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 sets forth the procedure governing anti-SLAPP motions.  In pertinent part, the statute states, “A cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(b)(1).)  The purpose of the statute is to identify and dispose of lawsuits brought to chill the valid exercise of a litigant’s constitutional right of petition or free speech.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(a); Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1055-1056.)Courts employ a two-step process to evaluate anti-SLAPP motions.  (Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 61.)  To invoke the protections of the statute, the defendant must first show that the challenged lawsuit arises from protected activity, such as an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.  (Ibid.)  From this fact, courts “ ‘presume the purpose of the action was to chill the defendant’s exercise of First Amendment rights.  It is then up to the plaintiff to rebut the presumption by showing a reasonable probability of success on the merits.’ ”  (Ibid.)  In determining whether the plaintiff has carried this burden, the trial court considers “the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(b)(2); see Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 291 (“Soukup”).)Plaintiff argues that the Cross-Complaint was filed as a result of his filing of the initial Complaint. Plaintiff points to, for example, paragraph 15 of the Cross-Complaint, which states, “Plaintiff breached the contract by not paying rent, destroying property, creating a zoo of cats, creating a nuisance, and carrying out an automobile repair business.”  Plaintiff contends the Cross-Complaint was meant to chill Plaintiff’s petitioning rights.  To meet his burden for the first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis, Plaintiff must demonstrate that the Cross-Complaint arises from protected activity.  That is, it must be that “defendant’s conduct by which plaintiff claims to have been injured falls within one of the four categories described in subdivision (e) . . . ‘the act underlying the plaintiff’s cause’ or ‘the at which forms the basis for the plaintiff’s cause of action’ must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.’ ”  (Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 63 (internal citations omitted).)  An “ ‘act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue’ includes: (1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e).)Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e)(1) relates to statements made before an official proceeding.Code Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e)(2) relates to statements made in connection with an issue under consideration by a government body.  (See City of Costa Mesa v. D’Alessio Investments LLC (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 358, 372-273.)  The challenged statements need not be made before an official body, but must “relate[] to the substantive issues in the [underlying] litigation and [must be] directed to persons having some interest in the litigation.”  (Neville v. Chudacoff (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1266.)  The defendant need not separately demonstrate that a statement or writing concerned an issue of public significance if it was made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by an official proceeding or body.  (Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope and Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1113.)Plaintiff has failed to carry his burden.  None of the causes of action target the actual filing of the Complaint.  That the Cross-Complaint was triggered by the Complaint is not sufficient.  (See Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 472-473.)  Neither is the Cross-Complaint’s contextual references to the Complaint and its statements.  (See Haight Ashbury Free Clinics, Inc. v. Happening House Ventures (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1550-1551.)  Had the Cross-Complaint sought damages for the filing of the Complaint, Plaintiff’s arguments would have merit—but that is not the case here.  Indeed, “only those cross-complaints alleging a cause of action arising from the plaintiff's act of filing the complaint against the defendant and the subsequent litigation would potentially qualify as a SLAPP action.”  (Church of Scientology v. Wollersheim (1996) 42 Cal. App. 4th 628, 651 disapproved on other grounds by Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal. 4th 53.)  The Cross-Complaint is actually premised on Plaintiff damaging the subject rental property, having unapproved pets at the property, and running a car repair business at the residential premises.  As Plaintiff has failed to carry his burden for the first prong of the analysis, the Anti-SLAPP Motion is denied.  The objections are overruled.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
