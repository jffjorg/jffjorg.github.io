And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rafael Ayala v. LA Rentals Live LLC. The case involves a dispute over whether the defendant's Cross-Complaint is a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) and whether it should be struck as a result. The plaintiff, Rafael Ayala, filed a Complaint against the defendant, LA Rentals Live LLC, alleging several causes of action, including violation of the California Civil Code, breach of warranty of habitability, nuisance, violation of the Unfair Competition Law, and negligence. The defendant then filed a Cross-Complaint against the plaintiff, alleging breach of contract, nuisance, violation of the Unfair Competition Law, and damage to real property.

The plaintiff seeks to strike the Cross-Complaint under California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, which provides a procedure for anti-SLAPP motions. The court must determine whether the challenged lawsuit arises from protected activity, such as an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech. The court must then consider the pleadings, supporting and opposing affidavits, and other evidence to determine whether the plaintiff has carried his burden.

In this case, the plaintiff argues that the Cross-Complaint was filed as a result of his filing of the initial Complaint and that it was meant to chill his petitioning rights. However, the court finds that the Cross-Complaint is not a SLAPP because it is not directed at the plaintiff's exercise of his right of petition or free speech. The court concludes that the Cross-Complaint is premised on the plaintiff's alleged damage to the rental property, having unapproved pets at the property, and running a car repair business at the residential premises. As a result, the court denies the plaintiff's motion to strike the Cross-Complaint.
