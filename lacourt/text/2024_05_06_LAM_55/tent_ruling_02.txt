 Case Number:  23STCV00370    Hearing Date:   May 6, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment.
BACKGROUND
LINDA CARRILLO (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint for
Legal Malpractice against ERNEST J. KIM (“Kim”) and KIM & LEE LLP (collectively,
“Defendants”), the attorney and law firm who prepared an estate plan for
Plaintiff and her late husband Carmen Edward Carrillo (“Eddie”). Plaintiff
alleges that Kim prepared The 2016 Carmen Edward Carrillo Irrevocable Trust
dated October 11, 2016 (the “2016 Trust”) but failed to ensure that all
property was titled to the trust, as to which Plaintiff is a trustee and
beneficiary.
Defendants bring a motion requesting summary judgment.
Plaintiff opposes the motion.
LEGAL STANDARD
In moving for summary judgment, a “defendant . . . has
met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the
party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not
separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense
to the cause of action.” Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(2). Once the defendant has
satisfied that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff “to show, by
responsive separate statement and admissible evidence, that triable issues of
fact exist.”  Ostayan v. Serrano
Reconveyance Co. (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1411, 1418, disapproved on
other grounds by Black Sky Cap., LLC v. Cobb (2019) 7 Cal. 5th 156,
165; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(2). 
The function of a motion for summary judgment is to
allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary
support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal
without the need for trial. Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 843.
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The Court overrules Defendants’ evidentiary objections
to the declaration of Joshua Furman.
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff’s legal malpractice claim alleges that she
is a trustee and beneficiary of the 2016 Trust. Compl., ¶ 7. She alleges that Kim
knew that Plaintiff and Eddie intended for all relevant property to be titled
to the 2016 Trust but that Kim failed to perform the tasks necessary to fulfill
this intent. Id., ¶¶ 7, 9. Eddie died in 2021 and Plaintiff opened
probate for his estate. Id., ¶ 11. Eddie’s daughter from a prior
marriage claimed that some property remained in an old trust and was not
transferred to the 2016 Trust. Id., ¶ 12. Plaintiff alleges that Kim
failed to ensure that all applicable properties were transferred to the 2016
Trust even after Eddie’s death, and even though he could have done so in his
role as the “Trust Protector” of the 2016 Trust. Id., ¶¶ 13-16. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants’ conduct constitutes a breach of their professional
duties to Plaintiff. Id., ¶¶ 19-21. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ conduct
resulted in damages to Plaintiff in the form of litigation costs from the
probate case with Eddie’s daughter and the potential loss of the assets that
were not transferred to the 2016 Trust. Id., ¶¶ 17, 22. Plaintiff
alleges that Kim agreed to toll the statute of limitations in this dispute from
1/3/22 through 11/30/22. Id., ¶ 18.
The elements of a claim for attorney malpractice are: 

Duty
     of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence that other
     members of the profession commonly possess and exercise;
Breach
     of that duty;
Proximate
     causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury;
     and
Actual
     loss or damage resulting from the professional's negligence. 

Landmark Screens, LLC v. Morgan, Lewis
& Bockius, LLP (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 238, 247-48.
Whether an attorney breached a duty is ordinarily a question of fact and can
only be resolved as a matter of law in “rare” cases where there can be no
reasonable doubt as to the attorney’s breach. Dawson v. Toledano (2003)
109 Cal.App.4th 387, 396-97.  Causation
of damages is determined by case-within-a-case approach, involving a decision
as to what should have been the result in the underlying matter, and questions
about what would have happened had lawyers acted otherwise are issues of fact
unless reasonable minds could not differ as to the legal effect of the
evidence.  Ambriz v. Kelegian
(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1531-32.  
1.     Duty
Defendants argue that they had no duty to Plaintiff to
compel the transfer of assets into the 2016 Trust because the undisputed facts
show at or about the time Kim prepared the 2016 Trust, Defendants, Plaintiff,
and Eddie agreed that the property at issue (the “Bledsoe house”) would not be
transferred into the Trust for about six months, because of potential adverse
tax consequences. Mot., pp. 13-14. Defendants also contend that that Plaintiff
cannot establish the existence of duty and/or causation because Plaintiff and
Eddie never asked for Defendants’ further help with the transfer of the Bledsoe
house into the 2016 Trust and Defendants formally gave notice of the end of
their representation to Plaintiff and Eddie. Id. 
Defendants contend they had no duty to Plaintiff but of
course they had a duty to Plaintiff as her attorneys. Their argument really
amounts to a contention that their legal representation of Plaintiff met the
standard of care. Whether attorney advice and actions breached the standard of
care turns upon whether they were so legally deficient when given, that it
demonstrates a failure to use the skill, prudence, and diligence that lawyers
of ordinary skill and capacity commonly possess and exercise. Unigard Ins.
Group v. O'Flaherty & Belgum (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1237. Importantly,
“even when a retention is expressly limited, the attorney may still have a duty
to alert the client to legal problems which are reasonably apparent, even
though they fall outside the scope of the retention.” Nichols v. Keller
(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1672, 1684, 1686 (“Foreseeability of harm,… has become
the chief factor in duty analysis.”). 
“[E]xpert testimony may be required, as is frequently
the case, in order to resolve the factual issue of whether the attorney adhered
to the standard of care.” Dawson v. Toledano (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 387,
397. “‘[I]f the attorney’s negligence is readily apparent from the facts of the
case, then the testimony of an expert may not be necessary.’” Stanley v.
Richmond (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1093.
The Court concludes that, even if Defendants had presented
evidence to support their position as to the standard of care, triable issues
of fact exist. Here, there is evidence of Defendants’ failures to meet the duty
of care, as to which reasonable minds could differ without the need for expert
opinion. Even with expressly limited representation (Ernest Kim Declaration, ¶¶
9-10), Defendants had a duty to anticipate foreseeable problems and advise the
clients about seeking further attorney representation or how to handle
themselves the transfer of the real property after waiting at least six months.
Defendants did not explain to Plaintiff as a client what to do later to transfer
assets, including the Bledsoe house to the 2016 Trust. See Sep. Stmt. in
Support of Oppn. To MSJ No. 11. Also, the written “Explanation Checklist” in
evidence does not expressly communicate that information. Further, its incomplete
statement, without the blank filled in, is unhelpfully uncertain as to the
mechanics and timing of transferring the house property— "We transferred
___ real properties to your Trust.” Ernest Kim declaration, ¶8.
Although Defendants may not have known the decedent’s imminent
health risks (Ernest Kim declaration, ¶ 7), anyone could be at risk of dying at
any time, such that arranging to guard against needless delay in property
transferring, would be prudent foresight. 
In their reply, Defendant contend they have also demonstrated
lack of duty because the undisputed facts show that Kim had no power to
transfer the Bledsoe house in his role as the Trust Protector of the 2016
Trust. Reply, p. 1. Defendants’ moving papers and separate statement did not
raise the Trust Protector issue as a basis for establishing a lack of duty. In
any event, the scope of powers for a Trust Protector, and whether Kim met the
standard of care in his refusal to transfer the Bledsoe house to the 2016
Trust, would require expert testimony for which none was provided by
Defendants. 
            2.         Statute of Limitations 
Defendants contend this case was untimely filed beyond
the one-year statute of limitation of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.6,
which accrued upon the death of Eddie in 2021, without any tolling other than
the agreement to toll. 
As to the statute of limitations in legal malpractice
cases, the time of actual injury is predominately a factual inquiry properly
resolved by the trier of fact. Callahan v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP
(2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 557, 576. “As determining actual injury ‘require[s]
examination of the particular facts of each case in light of the alleged
wrongful act or omission,’ there are no bright line rules regarding the
occurrence of actual injury.” Jocer Enterprises, Inc. v. Price (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 559, 567. “[A]ctual injury may occur even if the loss is
contingent on … final adjudication.” Pointe San Diego Residential Community,
L.P. v. Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves & Savitch, LLP (2011) 195
Cal.App.4th 265, 276. The Statute of Limitations regarding legal malpractice is
tolled while the attorney continues to represent the client regarding the same
specific subject matter, and tolling depends upon objectively viewing the
circumstances from the client’s perspective to ascertain if the client
reasonably should expect the continued representation. Laclette v. Galindo
(2010) 184 Cal.App. 919, 928.
Triable issues of fact exist as to whether, in 2021,
there existed alternative ways to title the subject property to the trust, such
that damages did not accrue earlier. See Sep. Stmt. in Support of Oppn. To MSJ
Nos. 20-21. Per the opposing Joshua Furman declaration, the parties entered
into tolling agreements, such that the last day to file this action was 2/24/23,
which would make it timely. Further, because Defendants admittedly did more
work on behalf of Plaintiff in or around February 2021 in connection with the
probate case, (Ernest Kim declaration, ¶13), disputes exist about whether the
statute of limitations was tolled based upon whether the client reasonably
expected continuing representation due to not knowing how to transfer the
Bledsoe house after six months, and whether damages first irreparably accrued
after that date. 
In their motion and reply, Defendants cite to a case that
is distinguishable. That case involved no later solution for the client harm
suffered after attorney representation had caused the harm-- Callahan v.
Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 557, 572-574. See Motion,
pp. 19-20. But here, various possible solutions through Probate Court continued
after attorney representation, such that client harm had not accrued at the
time of the representation. See Opposition, p. 13.
So, there are disputes as to whether this lawsuit was
filed timely on 1/9/23.
CONCLUSION
The Court denies the motion.
