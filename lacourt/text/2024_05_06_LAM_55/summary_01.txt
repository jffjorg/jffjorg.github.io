The court has issued a tentative ruling on the petitioners' motion to compel arbitration. The petitioners, DON MUIR, ZACHARY PATRONE, RORY JACKSON, JORDAN HE, and MATTHEW PANGANIBAN, seek to compel XSET, INC. to arbitrate their claims, which arise from a dispute over revenue related to the video game Valorant. The court finds that the arbitration clause in the parties' agreement requires XSET to pay all fees associated with the arbitrator's fee, including JAMS filing fees. The court grants the petitioners' motion to compel arbitration and stays the related actions pending the outcome of the arbitration. The court also grants the pro hac vice application filed by Paul Niehaus.
