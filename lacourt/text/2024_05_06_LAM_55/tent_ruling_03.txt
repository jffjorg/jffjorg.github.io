 Case Number:  24STCV02730    Hearing Date:   May 6, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Verified Application of John M. Remy to Appear as Pro Hac Vice.
This is an employment discrimination case filed by GREG
ADAMS (“Plaintiff”) against LAKESHORE LEARNING MATERIALS, LLC (“Defendant”).
Before the Court is a pro hac vice application filed
by Virginia attorney John M. Remy, who seeks to appear as counsel pro hac vice
for Defendant.
A judge’s determination of whether to grant an
application to appear pro hac vice is evaluated under the
abuse-of-discretion standard. Walter E. Heller Western, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 706, 711. There is no statement
of the limit of court discretion in ruling on applications to appear pro hac
vice in civil cases. Sheller v. Superior Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th
1697, 1713.
The Court finds that the application sufficiently
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 9.40, including the applicant’s
declaration addressing the rule elements. The application is unopposed.  
The application is granted. The Court will sign the
proposed order submitted by Defendant.
