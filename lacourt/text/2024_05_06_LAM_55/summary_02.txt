And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Linda Carrillo, alleges that the defendants, Ernest J. Kim and Kim & Lee LLP, failed to ensure that all property was titled to the 2016 Trust, which was created by Kim in 2016. Kim allegedly failed to transfer the property to the trust, resulting in damages to Carrillo. The defendants argue that they had no duty to Carrillo to compel the transfer of assets into the trust and that Carrillo cannot establish the existence of duty and/or causation. However, the court finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding the defendants' breach of their professional duties and the statute of limitations.
