And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Joseph K. Cofey v. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The Plaintiff, Joseph K. Cofey, alleges that he was forced to wear an ankle monitor as a condition of his parole under Megan's Law. The Defendant, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, demurred to the Complaint.

The Judge noted that the Defendant did not submit a meet and confer declaration, which is required under California Civil Procedure Code, § 430.41(d)(1). However, since there is no indication that the Plaintiff is currently incarcerated, the meet and confer requirement applies. The Judge continued the hearing on the demurrer to December 6, 2024, and ordered the Defendant to attempt to meet and confer with the Plaintiff and submit a meet and confer declaration by November 22, 2024.

The Judge also denied the Defendant's request for judicial notice of an exhibit that is extrinsic to the Complaint and not subject to judicial notice under California Evidence Code, § 452.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling is a procedural order that sets the stage for further proceedings in the case.
