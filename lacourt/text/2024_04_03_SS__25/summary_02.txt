* The third cause of action for tortuous interference with a contract is stricken from the TACC on the Court's own motion.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court sustains the demurrer to the Third Amended Cross-Complaint (TACC) in its entirety without leave to amend. The TACC fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach of contract, and recovery of storage fees. The Court also strikes the third cause of action for tortuous interference with a contract on its own motion due to the lack of permission to add a new cause of action.
