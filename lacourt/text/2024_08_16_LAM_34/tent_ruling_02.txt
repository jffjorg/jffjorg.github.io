[1]            Motions Nos. 1 and 2 were filed on
July 24, 2024, and served on the same date (by U.S. mail and electronic
delivery) and set for hearing on August 16, 2024. Counsel is correct that July
22, 2024, was deemed a court holiday. However, as a result of the July 24, 2024,
filing, the August 16, 2024 hearing date is premature. The court will continue
the hearing for a few days.
