And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Plaintiff Crystal Gomez's motion to compel further responses to her interrogatories and production of documents. The court has also granted Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to her Request for Production of Documents, Set Two. The court has continued the matter to August 23, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. to allow for necessary statutory notice requirement.

The court has found that Defendant N. Francowitz, Inc. and Nancy Franco have failed to provide timely and substantive responses to Plaintiff's discovery requests, despite repeated efforts by Plaintiff to resolve the issues informally. The court has ordered Defendant to serve further, code-compliant responses, without objections, within 20 days from the date of the notice of ruling.

The court has not granted Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $2,500, as the amount was not specified in the declaration filed by Plaintiff's attorney. However, the court has warned Defendant that it may impose monetary sanctions if Defendant continues to fail to comply with discovery requests.
