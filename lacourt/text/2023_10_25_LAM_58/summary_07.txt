And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion filed by the plaintiff, Shimaotong International Co., Ltd., allowing it to serve process on the defendant, R & Su Corporation (R&SU), by personally delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the Secretary of State. The plaintiff has demonstrated that it has made reasonable efforts to serve R&SU at its principal address, but was unable to do so due to the business being locked and no visible business activity. Additionally, the plaintiff's attempts to locate Mayorga, the sole officer and director of R&SU, were unsuccessful. Since R&SU is a dissolved corporation, the plaintiff is entitled to serve process on the Secretary of State. The court finds that the requirements for allowing service through the Secretary of State are satisfied, and service will be deemed complete on the 10th day after delivery of the process to the Secretary of State.
