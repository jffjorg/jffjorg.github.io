And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge sustains the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) with leave to amend. The demurrer was filed by the defendant, J Allyn Construction Inc., alleging that the plaintiff, Touchstone Marble and Granite, has failed to state a claim. The SAC alleges that Touchstone Marble and Granite and J Allyn Construction Inc. entered into an agreement for a construction project, and J Allyn Construction Inc. breached the contract by refusing to pay for the services rendered. However, the pleadings do not explain the inconsistency between the allegations and the exhibits, which show that Touchstone Marble, Inc.'s name appears on the contract and invoices, not Touchstone Marble and Granite's. The judge finds that Touchstone Marble and Granite lacks standing to bring the breach of contract claim and that the pleadings cannot be amended in their current form. The plaintiff is given leave to amend the pleadings to cure the defects and must serve and file the amended complaint by November 27, 2023.
