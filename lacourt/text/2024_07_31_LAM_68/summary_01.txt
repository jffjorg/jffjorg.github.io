Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of the Plaintiff, CIT Bank, N.A., granting their motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The agreement was executed on January 10, 2019, and provides for the sale of the property, with the sale proceeds to be left in an escrow account pending further agreement of the parties or an order of the court. The parties stipulated to a settlement amount of $22,440, payable in monthly installments of $935, with the balance to increase to $32,038.44 in the event of default. The defendant(s) made $5,610 in payments, but defaulted on the March 28, 2023, leaving an unpaid balance of $26,428.44.

The Court has reviewed the declarations and evidence submitted by the parties and finds that the settlement agreement was validly executed and that the defendant(s) defaulted on the agreement. The Court further finds that the settlement agreement complies with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, which provides a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract.

The Court notes that the parties have not provided clear information regarding the sale proceeds, but accepts the sale as having taken place and the distribution of escrow funds. The Court also notes that the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power refunded $51,151.75 in fees paid, which are currently being held in an escrow account.

In granting the motion, the Court accepts the settlement agreement, the represented default on the agreement, and the right to seek a judgment for the outstanding balance. The unopposed motion is granted, and the moving parties are ordered to give notice.
