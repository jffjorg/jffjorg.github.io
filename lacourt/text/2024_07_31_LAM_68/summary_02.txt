```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the unopposed motion to quash service of the summons and complaint filed by Stylenquaza LLC. Stylenquaza LLC, a Texas limited liability company, operates with no business presence in California and denies any continuous or systematic contacts in the state. The court finds that Stylenquaza LLC's activities in California are not sufficient to establish jurisdiction over the company. The court notes that general jurisdiction exists only in the defendant's state of incorporation or principal place of business, and that Stylenquaza LLC's activities in California are not substantial or continuous enough to establish general jurisdiction. The court also finds that specific jurisdiction is lacking because there is no connection between the forum and the underlying controversy. The motion to quash is granted, and the matter is scheduled for further proceedings.
