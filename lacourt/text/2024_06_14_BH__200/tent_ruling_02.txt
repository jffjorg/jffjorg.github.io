[1] Former Trustees also contend, however, that
technically it would be the burden of beneficiary Alexander Hughes
(“Beneficiary”) to exclude this evidence by way of a motion in limine. Instead,
Former Trustees assert they are entitled to revise their witness and exhibit
list to include this new evidence at this Final Status Conference pursuant to
LASC Local Rule 3.25 where there was a substantial period before the last
scheduled trial date it is undisputed there was here.

Significantly, consistent with this Court’s earlier decision on choice of
valuation date, the Spurgeon court determined that the mitigation
valuation date for purposes of offset was the amount at time of trial, not as
of breach. (174 Cal.App.3d at 664)
 


[3] Though Former Trustees have stated previously that
the attorneys’ fees phase of trial will include mitigation of damages, not just
as to fees, they have not identified what any such issue would concern exactly.
Even if failure to mitigate was part of what Former Trustees intended to assert
in this phase of trial, the Court still concludes that the subject of the Offer
would not properly be part of this phase of trial for the reasons stated here.

Indeed, in view of there being no settlement agreement, the parties need to
re-schedule the hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment on that
issue.
