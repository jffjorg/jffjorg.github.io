The Former Trustees seek to introduce evidence of an all-cash offer on the Tower Grove property in order to support their claim that the successor trustee, FTI, failed to mitigate damages. The Beneficiary opposes the motion, arguing that the new evidence is irrelevant to the issues in the attorneys' fees phase of trial. The Judge finds that the duty to mitigate damages is irrelevant to the issues in the attorneys' fees phase of trial and denies the motion to introduce new evidence. The Judge also treats the opposition as a motion in limine to exclude the evidence from the attorneys' fees phase of trial.
