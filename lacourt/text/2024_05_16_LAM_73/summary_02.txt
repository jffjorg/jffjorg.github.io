And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling on the two motions before the court. The first motion is defendant's motion to compel plaintiff to pay expert witness fees for the depositions of defendant's experts. The court finds that plaintiff is obligated to pay the fees, but the amount of fees awardable to defendant's experts is not yet determined, so the motion is continued to allow defendant to submit evidence of defendant's experts' reasonable fees. The second motion is plaintiff's motion to compel defendant Rochelle H. Sterling to attend trial, but the court finds that this motion is moot because trial has not commenced and Sterling has not failed to appear for trial.
