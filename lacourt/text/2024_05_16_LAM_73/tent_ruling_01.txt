I. BACKGROUND
 
This is a wrongful termination action
arising from plaintiff Rene Martinez’s (“Plaintiff’s”) employment with
defendant Farmers Financial Solutions, LLC (“Farmers”) from February 2015
through March 2018. 
 
On January 23, 2019, Plaintiff filed
this action’s Complaint against defendants Farmers, Steve Klein (“Klein”), and Jimmy
Coicoechea (“Coicoechea”). The Complaint asserts the following causes of action
against the defendants: 
1.    
Discrimination in Violation of Cal.
Gov. Code §§ 12940 et seq.; 
2.    
Failure to Prevent Discrimination in
violation of Cal. Gov. Code §§ 12940 Et Seq.; 
3.    
Retaliation; 
4.    
Wrongful Termination in Violation of
Public Policy; 
5.    
Retaliation in Violation of Cal. Labor
Code § 1102.5; 
6.    
Intentional Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage; 
7.    
Negligent Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage; 
8.    
Failure to Provide Accurate Wage
Statements in Violation of Cal. Labor Code §§ 210, 226; 
9.    
Failure to Pay Wages Upon Termination
in Violation of Cal. Labor Code §§ 201, 203; 
10.  Failure to
Pay Overtime in Violation of Cal. Labor Code §§ 510, 1194; 
11.  Failure to
Provide Rest Periods in Violation of Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Orders
and Cal. Labor Code § 226.7; and  
12.  Failure to
Provide Meal Periods in Violation of Cal. Labor Code §§ 226.7, 512 
 
On
March 30, 2022, Plaintiff dismissed without prejudice causes of action six and
seven.
 
On
April 19, 2022, the Court granted summary adjudication as to causes of action one, two, three, eight, nine, ten, eleven, and
twelve. (See Court’s 4/19/22 Minute Order.) 
 
On
January 30, 2024, the parties reached a settlement in this case except for
attorneys fees excluding costs. (See Court’s 01/31/24 Minute Order.) The parties requested the court to retain jurisdiction to hear the
attorneys’ fees motion. (Ibid.)
 
On
February 28, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff’s counsel took this case on contingency
·      
Plaintiff Is Entitled to An Award of Plaintiff Attorney’s Fees
Pursuant to Labor Code §1102.5(j)
o  
Effective January 1, 2021, Assembly Bill 1947 modified Labor Code
section 1102.5 to, in part, include a provision allowing a court to award
attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff.
·      
The Requested Attorney’s Fees are Reasonable
o  
Plaintiff’s counsels hourly rates : $525/hour and $285/hour
o  
Plaintiff is seeking an award of attorney’s fees in the sum of
$776,548.50, which represents a two times multiplier justified because of the
length and highly adversarial nature of this litigation, as well as the amount
of time and effort required to finally reached a settlement on the eve of
trial.
 
On
April 29, 2024, the parties filed a Joint Stipulation to continue the hearing
on Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees. To
allow Farmers the opportunity to timely file an opposition, the parties stipulate
the hearing be continued from May 9, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. to May 16, 2024 at 8:30
a.m.
 
On May 3, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition, arguing: 
·      
Plaintiff is Not Entitled to Any Attorneys' Fees Pursuant to Labor
Code §1102.5(j)
o  
Labor Code §1102.5(j) became effective after he filed this action
in 2019, and cannot be retroactively applied. There is 
·      
Plaintiff is not the prevailing party
o  
When settling this action, Farmers did not make any admissions or
concessions with respect to its liability
·      
Even assuming Plaintiff is the prevailing party, any attorneys’
fees must be substantially reduced because Plaintiff only achieved limited
success 
o  
Plaintiff’s causes of action one, two, three, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
and twelve were all summarily adjudicated
o  
Plaintiff’s other claims for FEHA discrimination and retaliation,
interference with prospective economic advantage, and wage and hour were not
based on the same facts or legal theories as his Labor Code §1102.5 claim.
Plaintiff cannot recover attorneys' fees for work performed in pursuit of his
non-Labor Code §1102.5 claim.
·      
To the extent that the Court believes Plaintiff can recover
attorneys' fees pursuant to Labor Code §1102.5, Farmers respectfully requests
that the Court substantially reduce Plaintiff's unreasonable and inflated
request by 90%.
o  
Plaintiff’s counsels hours are unreasonable, inflated, and
duplicative
§ 
Plaintiff's counsel, Patrick Garofalo, contends that he has spent
a total of 473.95 hours on this matter for total of $248,823.75.
§ 
Plaintiff’s co-counsel Rachel Nelson, contends she spent 489.3
hours on this matter for a total of $139,450.50
o  
Plaintiff is not entitled to a lodestar multiplier
§ 
This was not a novel case but was a straightforward, single
plaintiff, employment case
 
On May 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply, arguing:
·      
California law mandates retroactivity of the attorney fee
provision of Labor Code §1102.5
o  
Legislature is silent about the application of the attorney fee
provision to pending litigation, which omission requires that California case
must apply.
o  
]“For decades, the Courts of Appeal have cited Palermo, Woodland
Hills, or both, for the proposition that they “authoritatively held” that in
the absence of express legislative intent to the contrary, “a new statute
authorizing an award of attorney fees” or a statute “increasing or decreasing
litigation costs, including attorneys' fees” applies to actions pending at the
time of enactment. [USS-Posco Industries v. Case (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th
197, 220 (internal citations omitted)]
·      
Plaintiff is the prevailing party because Plaintiff settled this
case. The “prevailing party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery.
[California Code of Civil Procedure § 1032(a)(4)].
·      
Plaintiff’s claims are interrelated and cannot be separated from
successful claims.
·      
Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees are reasonable
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
 
CCP §§ 1032 and 1033.5 provide that a prevailing
party may recover its costs as a matter of right, and that those costs may
include attorneys’ fees when authorized by statute or contract. 
 
“[A]bsent
circumstances rendering the award unjust, an attorney fee award should
ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent,
including those relating solely to the fee.  We explained that the purpose
behind statutory fee authorizations—i.e., encouraging attorneys to act as
private attorneys general and to vindicate important rights affecting the
public interest—will often be frustrated, sometimes nullified, if awards are
diluted or dissipated by lengthy, uncompensated proceedings to fix or defend a
rightful fee claim.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1133-34 (emphasis in original).)  “The fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.... The lodestar figure may
then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Id. at 1134.) Other factors to consider in fixing the
reasonableness of fees to be considered beyond the fee agreement alone include,
but are not limited to “(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the
legal service properly; (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of the
particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; (3) the fee
customarily charged in this locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount
involved and the results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the
circumstances; and (6) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or
lawyers performing the services.” (Glendora Community Redevelopment
Agency v. Demeter (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 465, 470.)
 
“The verified
time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to
credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.”¿ (Horsford
v. Board Of Trustees Of California State University (2005) 132 Cal. App.
4th 359, 396.)¿ If the motion is supported by evidence, the opposing party must
respond with specific evidence showing that the fees are unreasonable.¿ (Premier
Med. Mgmt. Sys. v. California Ins. Guarantee Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal. App. 4th 550,
560–63.)¿ The Court has discretion to reduce fees that result from inefficient
or duplicative use of time.¿ (Horsford, supra at 395.)¿¿¿ 
 
B.     Request for
Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiff
requests judicial notice of the following:
1.     The Exhibit
List accompanying Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine #1, Exhibit B
2.     The Exhibit
List accompanying Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine #1, Exhibit C
3.     The Exhibit
List accompanying Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine #1, Exhibit D
4.     The Exhibit
List accompanying Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine #1, Exhibit B, Responses to
Request No. 1
5.     The Exhibit
List accompanying Plaintiff’s Motion in Limine #1, Exhibit B, Responses to
Request No. 4
 
Defendant
request judicial notice of the following:
1.     Senate
Judiciary Committee Discussion of AB 1947
 
The court may
take judicial notice of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and
judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) “While
courts take judicial notice of public records, they do not take notice of the
truth of matters stated therein.” (Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213
CA4th 872, 889.)
 
The Court
grants all of Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s requests, but the Court does not take
notice of the truth of the matters stated therein. 
 
C.     Evidentiary
Objections
 
The Court
rules on Plaintiff’s objections to the declaration of Erika Shao as follows:
1.     Nos. 1-16:
Overruled.
 
D.     Discussion
 
a.     Whether
Plaintiff Can Seek Attorneys’ Fees
 
First, the Court finds Labor Code § 1102.5(j)
allows the Court to award attorney’s fees to the prevailing plaintiff in an
action for violation of this statute. 
 
Subsection 1102.5(j) became effective
on January 1, 2021. Defendant asserts that the legislative
history bars retroactive application. The history cited by Defendant, however,
is in relation to the extension of the statute of limitations extension
found in Labor Code § 98.7(a)(1). “It has been authoritatively held (Auto
Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455
[20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937]) that a new statute authorizing an award
of attorney fees applies to actions not yet final at the time the statute
becomes effective.” (California Housing Finance Agency v. E.R. Fairway
Associates (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1508, 1513.) The Court will
apply the subsection to this action as it was pending when the statute became
effective. 
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiff is not entitled to attorney’s fees because Plaintiff is not
the prevailing party. However, Defendant does not provide any authority in
support. Plaintiff settled this case and under California law, the “prevailing
party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery. [California Code of
Civil Procedure § 1032(a)(4)].
 
Thus, the
Court finds Plaintiff is entitled to seek attorney’s fees. 
 
b.     Reasonableness
of Fees¿ 
 
Plaintiff
moves for attorney’s fees in the lodestar amount of $388,274.25. Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that 963.25 hours at $285.00 to $525.00 per hour were spent
prosecuting this action. Plaintiff also requests
the Court award a 2.0 multiplier, thus Plaintiff is seeking an award of attorney’s fees in the sum of $776,548.50
 
                                                   
i.     Hourly Rate
 
“The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in
the community for similar work.” (PLCM Grp. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.) “The ‘experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value
of professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of
course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court
is convinced that it is clearly wrong’ — meaning that it abused its discretion.”
(Id.) 
 
Plaintiff
seeks to recover fees for two attorneys that billed time in connection with
this case. Their hourly rates are as follows: 
 
·       
Patrick
Garofalo : $525/hour 
·       
Rachel Nelson
: $285/hour 
 
The Court finds that the rates requested by Plaintiff is
reasonable and commensurate with rates charged by attorneys with comparable
skill and expertise. In Defendant’s opposition, Defendant does not dispute counsel’s
hourly rate. Mr. Garofalo
and Ms. Nelson attest to their experience and reasonableness of the rates. (Garofalo
Decl., ¶¶ 8-17; Nelson Decl., ¶¶ 4-7.) Based on the evidence before it, the Court does not reduce
the hourly rates requested.
 
                                                  
ii.     Number of
Hours
 
A prevailing party’s verified billing invoices are prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred.¿ (Hadley v.¿Krepel¿(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.”¿ (Lunada¿Biomedical
v. Nunez¿(2014) 240 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)¿ 
 
The Court has reviewed Defendant’s objections to Plaintiffs’
counsel’s billed hours finds most of them to be unavailing. Defendant
objects to time counsel spent on discovery, opposing the MSJ and other motions.
The
Court has independently reviewed the time entries and does not find they
represent time spent on unreasonable or unnecessary tasks.  
 
In addition, while Defendant
argues that the hours spent prosecuting the unsuccessful non-Labor code claims should
not be included because they were unnecessary to prosecute Plaintiff’s Labor
Code, Defendant does not point to any
specific time entries or activities that were only related to the unsuccessful
claims. Apportionment is permissible where the opposing party has identified
work that was “chargeable only to her unsuccessful causes of action.” (See Cordero-Sacks
v. Housing Authority of City of Los Angeles (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1267,
1286.) Thus, the Court does not reduce any hours billed on this basis. 
 
Defendant next
asserts that on January 14, 2020, Plaintiff’s counsel billed to attend the
FINRA deposition of Rene Martinez. However, Defendant contends the FINRA
deposition was unrelated to this civil action and Defendant had no involvement.
Mr. Garofalo billed 11 hours to attend this deposition and Ms. Nelson billed 10
hours. (Exhibit List
ISO Motion, Exh. D, Exh. E.) Plaintiff does not argue this issue in their reply, thereby
conceding such billed hours were not reasonably incurred. Therefore, the Court
reduces Plaintiff’s request by 11 hours at the rate of $525/hour and 10 hours
at the rate of $285/hour, for a total of $8,625.
 
The Court
will allow 942.25 hours for the work of Mr. Garofalo and Ms. Nelson, for a
total of $379,649.25. 
 
c.      Multiplier
 
The Court is permitted, but not required, to apply a
multiplier to an award for attorney’s fees. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1138.) Relevant factors to determine whether an enhancement is
appropriate include (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,
(2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature
of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award. (Id. at 1132.) 
 
Plaintiff
requests the Court award a 2.0 multiplier to the fee award. Plaintiff has
not shown that the case was particularly novel and complex. Though counsel
represented Plaintiff on a contingent basis, the Court does not find a contingency
warrants increasing fees by a 2.0 multiplier. Since the Court does not find a
multiplier appropriate, counsel will be awarded the fees reasonably incurred.
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $379,649.25. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 

Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $379,649.25.
