English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees in the amount of $379,649.25. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to seek attorneys' fees under Labor Code § 1102.5(j), which became effective on January 1, 2021. The court reduces the requested amount from $776,548.50 to $379,649.25 after reviewing the billing invoices and finding most of the objections to the hours billed to be unavailing. The court also rejects the defendant's request for a 90% reduction in the fees. The court awards the fees reasonably incurred by the plaintiff's counsel, Patrick Garofalo and Rachel Nelson.
