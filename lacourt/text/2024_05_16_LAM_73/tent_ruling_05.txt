BACKGROUND
 
On February
27, 2024, Plaintiff Emma T.
Malloy (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendant Earl Hall (“Defendant”) alleging the following causes of action:
            C/A 1: Financial Elder Abuse
            C/A 2: Quiet Title
            C/A 3: Fraud
            C/A 4: Declaratory Relief
            C/A 5: Punitive Damages
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. On November
28, 1969, Charlie and Emma T. Malloy purchased the residential property located
at 1751 W. 38th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90062. (FAC,
¶ 10.) Title recorded under Charlie and Emma T. Malloy continued to
remain in both names until October 31, 2002, when a Quitclaim Deed was signed,
transferring title from Charlie Malloy and Emma T. Malloy to Defendant Earl
Hall. (FAC, ¶ 11.) Plaintiff became aware of
the fraudulent transfer of title to the Defendant in May 2019, when her
daughter, Tracy Hall, learned that her brother, Defendant, had taken loans out
on the property. (FAC, ¶ 13.) Plaintiff did
not agree nor intend to ever quitclaim her property to the Defendant and does
not remember signing the Quitclaim Deed, nor did Plaintiff agree to the
multiple encumbrances identified in the Title Point Property Search prior to
this fraudulent real property transfer. (FAC, ¶ 16.)
 
On February 26, 2024, Defendant filed a
Demurrer to the FAC, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff’s first, second, third and
fourth causes of action are facially barred by the statutes of limitations 
·      
Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action for punitive damages fails
because punitive damages are a legal remedy, not a valid cause of action.
Plaintiff did not file an opposition.
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard for Demurrer
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context—any
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts
alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153
Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The
only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p.
747.) 
 
B.     Meet and
Confer Requirement 
 
“Before filing a demurrer pursuant to
this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by
telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for
the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would
resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41, subd. (a).)  
 
Here, counsel for Defendants submitted a declaration stating he called
Plaintiff’s counsel to meet and confer regarding the instant motion, but
Plaintiff’s counsel did not answer or return his call. (Davis Decl., ¶¶
2-3.) He states he also sent Plaintiff’s counsel a letter outlining the
deficiencies in the Complaint, but Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond. (Davis Decl., ¶¶ 3-4) While the parties did not meet and confer in person or by
telephone, the failure to meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain
a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd. (a)(4); 435.5 subd. (a)(4).) Thus, the Court
proceeds on the merits.
 
C.     Judicial
Notice
 
Defendant
requests the Court take judicial notice of the following: 
1.     Trust Deed
recorded on June 13, 1984 as Instrument No. 84703287 in the Official Records of
the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California;
2.     Trust Deed
recorded on August 29, 1986 as Instrument No. 861135722 in the Official Records
of the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California; 
3.     Trust Deed
recorded on December 9, 1987 as Instrument No. 871943799 in the Official
Records of the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California;
4.     Trust Deed
recorded on May 11, 1989 as Instrument No. 89756981 in the Official Records of
the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California;
5.     Trust Deed
recorded on October 25, 1991 as Instrument No. 1688751 in the Official Records
of the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California;
6.     Trust Deed
recorded on October 25, 1991 as Instrument No. 1688752 in the Official Records
of the County Recorder of Los Angeles County, State of California.
 
The Court may
take judicial notice of “facts and propositions that are not reasonably subject
to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to
sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452(h).) While courts take judicial notice of
public records, they do not take judicial notice of the truth of matters stated
therein. [Citation.] ‘When judicial notice is taken of a document,…the truthfulness and proper interpretation of the document
are disputable.’ [Citation.]” (Herrera v. Deutsche National Trust Co. (2011)
196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.) Further, “courts have taken judicial notice of the existence and
recordation of real property records...[because] [t]he official act of
recordation and the common use of a notary public in the execution of such
documents assure their reliability, and the maintenance of the documents in the
recorder’s office makes their existence and text capable of ready confirmation,
thereby placing such documents beyond reasonable dispute.” (Fontenot v.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 264.)
 
The Court
judicially notices all of Defendant’s requests. 
 
D.     Demurrer to First,
Second, Third and Fourth Causes of Action: Statute of Limitations
 
Defendant
argues Plaintiff’s causes of actions are facially barred by the statutes of
limitations.
For a statute
of limitations to bar a claim on demurrer, “the defect must clearly and
affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint; it is not enough that the
complaint shows that the action may be barred.” (Committee for Green
Foothills v. Santa Clara County Bd. of Supervisors (2010) 48 Cal.4th 32,
42, internal quotation marks omitted.) In general, a statute of limitations
begins to run “when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements,”
namely, wrongdoing, causation, and resulting harm. (Norgart v. Upjohn Co.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 397 (Norgart).)  
 
The statute of limitations for financial abuse of an elder or
dependent adult is four years after the plaintiff discovers, or through the
exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the facts constituting
the financial abuse. (Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code§ 15657.7).
 
The statute
of limitations for a cause of action for fraud is three years. (Cal. Code Civ.
Proc., § 338, subd. (d).) If an
action is brought more than three years after commission of the fraud, the
plaintiff has the burden of pleading and proving that he did not make the
discovery until within three years prior to the filing of his complaint. (Hobart
v. Hobart Estate Co. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 412, 437.)
 
A claim for declaratory relief is subject to the same limitations
period as the legal or equitable claim on which it is based. (Bank of N.Y.
Mellon v. Citibank, N.A. (2017) 8 Cal. App.5th 935, 943; Ginsburg v.
Gamson (2012) 205 Cal. App. 4th 873, 883.) Similarly, the theory of relief
underlying the action for quiet title determines which statute of limitations
applies. (Leeper v. Beltrami (1959) 53 Cal. 2d 195, 214; Ankoanda v.
Walker-Smith (1996) 44 Cal. App. 4th 610, 615.)
 
Here, the Complaint alleges that Plaintiff discovered the
facts constituting the alleged fraudulent transfer of property in May 2019. The
Complaint states: “Plaintiff
became aware of the fraudulent transfer of title to the Defendant in May 2019,
when her daughter, Tracy Hall, learned that her brother, Earl Hall, had taken
loans out on the property.” (Compl., ¶¶ 13, 24.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s first cause
of action for financial elder abuse would have needed to be brought by May
2023, within four years of her discovery. Plaintiff’s third cause of action for
fraud would have needed to be brought by May 2022, within three years of her
discovery. Plaintiff’s second cause of action for quiet title and declaratory
relief are based on Plaintiff’s financial elder abuse or fraud claims and
subject to the same statute of limitations. Here, Plaintiff filed this action
February 27, 2024. Thus, over four years have passed since the discovery of the
alleged financial abuse, which is past the statute of limitations for
Plaintiff’s first, second, third, and fourth causes of action. 
 
Thus, on the
face of the Complaint, Plaintiff’s first, second, third and fourth causes of
action are barred under the statute of limitations, absent tolling under an
applicable doctrine. Plaintiff
did not file an opposition. 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s
demurrer
to Plaintiff’s first, second, third and fourth causes of action is SUSTAINED
with leave to amend.  
E.     Fifth Cause
of Action: Punitive Damages
 
Defendant
demurs to Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action for punitive damages.
 
A request for
punitive damages is not a cause of action but a type of remedy. While punitive damages can be sought in a lawsuit, they are
incident to a cause of action and cannot constitute the basis thereof. (Gold
v. Los Angeles Democratic League (1975) 49 Cal. App. 3d 365, 373.)  “A punitive damage
claim depends upon a viable claim for compensatory damages for its vitality.” (Prakashpalan
v. Engstrom, Lipscomb & Lack (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1137, as
modified on denial of reh'g (Feb. 27, 2014).)  
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff cannot name her fifth cause of action “punitive damages.” 
Plaintiff must place any request for punitive damages in the prayer for relief
section. 
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is SUSTAINED as to Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action without leave
to amend.
 
F.     
Conclusion

 
The
demurrer to Plaintiff’s first, second, third and fourth causes of action is
SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
The
demurrer to Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to
amend.
