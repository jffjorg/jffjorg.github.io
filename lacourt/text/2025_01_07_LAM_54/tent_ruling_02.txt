COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
The Court may issue an order allowing
an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.) 
The attorney may withdraw from representation where the withdrawal would
not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—for example, counsel
cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.
App. 4th 904, 915; see California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Glaser Weil Fink Howard Jordan &
Shapiro, counsel of record for Plaintiffs Carl Rinsch and Home VFX, seeks to
withdraw from representation of Plaintiffs. Counsel state that withdrawal is
necessary for confidential, ethical reasons. Judgment confirming an arbitration
award has been entered; no prejudice will result from counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel
has complied with CRC 3.1362. 
 
The Court finds there is good cause for
counsel’s withdrawal. The motions are GRANTED.
