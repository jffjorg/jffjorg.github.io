And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by the plaintiff, Siamak Pishvaee. The motion seeks to restrict the deposition of the plaintiff and his brother, Babak Pishvaee, and to implement various other restrictions on the discovery process. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants' discovery requests are improper and seek irrelevant information. The defendants argue that the plaintiff did not meet and confer with them before filing the motion and that the discovery is not voluminous or contentious enough to warrant a protective order.

The judge has denied the motion for a protective order, finding that the plaintiff did not meet and confer with the defendants before filing the motion and that the discovery is not so voluminous or contentious as to warrant a protective order. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's allegations of elder abuse and other claims may require discovery that is relevant to the defendants' defenses. The judge concludes that the discovery process should be allowed to proceed without restrictions, and that the defendants may seek information relating to their defenses.
