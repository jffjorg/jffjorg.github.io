PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
 
“If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action … without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to
produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  (CCP § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
 
The motion must be accompanied by a
good faith meet and confer declaration under section 2016.040 or, “when the
deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice,
by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to
inquire about the nonappearance.”  (CCP §
2025.450, subd. (b)(2).)  
 
Plaintiff moves to compel the
depositions of Defendants Clara Mendoza, Jaime Mendoza, and Jennifer Mendoza. On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff served notices for (1) Jennifer’s
deposition on April 8, 2024, (2) Jaime’s deposition on April 12, 2024, and (3)
Clara’s deposition on April 23, 2024. On April 5, 2024, Defendants’ counsel
stated that those dates were not workable and requested dates in May. Plaintiff
asserts Plaintiff’s counsel proposed May dates but did not hear back from
Defendant’s counsel.
 
In opposition, Defendant’s counsel represents that Defendants are
available to appear for deposition in June. Counsel also states that Plaintiff
has not attempted to meet and confer in person or by telephone.
 
Plaintiff is entitled to take the
depositions of Defendants. The motions are GRANTED. The Court declines to award
sanctions at this stage; this motion likely could have been resolved with
telephonic meet and confer.
