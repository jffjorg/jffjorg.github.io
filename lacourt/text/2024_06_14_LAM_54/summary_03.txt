The court has ruled that the plaintiff's motions to compel depositions of the defendants are granted. The plaintiff has served deposition notices on the defendants and has requested alternative dates. The defendants' counsel has stated that they are available to appear for deposition in June. The court has declined to award sanctions at this stage and has ordered the defendants to appear for deposition within 30 days of notice of ruling. The parties are also ordered to meet and confer regarding a mutually agreeable date for deposition.
