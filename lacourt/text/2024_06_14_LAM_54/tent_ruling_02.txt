(6) Petitions for Minor’s Compromise
Moving Party: Minor Plaintiffs 
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:      THE PETITIONS ARE GRANTED.
 
PLAINTIFFS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:30 am on the
day of the hearing. 
 
The Court considers the petitions. 
No opposition has been received.
 
Compromises of disputed claims brought
by minors are governed in part by CCP § 372. The statute allows a guardian ad
litem to appear in court on behalf of a minor claimant and gives the guardian
ad litem the power to compromise the minor’s claim “with the approval of the
court in which the action or proceeding is pending.”  A petition for court approval of a compromise
must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise or
covenant.  (CRC Rule 7.950.)
 
CRC Rule 7.952(a) requires the
attendance of the petitioner and claimant at the hearing on the compromise of
the claim unless the court for good causes dispenses with their personal
appearance.
 
“Neither section 372 nor the California
Rules of Court (rules 7.950 & 7.952) contemplates a noticed motion and
adversary hearing when court approval of a minor's compromise is sought.
Although we need not decide the question, it would appear that a petition to
approve or disapprove a minor's compromise may be decided by the superior
court, ex parte, in chambers.”  (Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal. App. 4th 1333, 1337.)  
 
Petitioners seeks court approval for a
settlement from Defendants 1864 Cordova St LLC and
Nitinkumar Patel under which the
6 minor Plaintiffs each would receive $5,000.00 out of a total settlement of
$1,500,000.00.  Attorneys’ fees of $1,250.00
and costs of $132.85 will be deducted from the minor claimant’s settlement
amounts.  Minor claimants’ net proceeds
are $3,617.15 each. The settlement funds will be paid to the minor’s parents.
 
This is a landlord tenant action
involving allegations of uninhabitable conditions.   The Court finds that the individual
settlements are fair considering the alleged injuries sustained by claimants.
The Court finds that the attorney’s fees and costs are reasonable. 
 
The petitions are GRANTED.
