I. BACKGROUND
 
On May 24,
2024, Plaintiff Merik Migliore filed the instant action against Defendants FC
US LLC, Premier Automotive of Placentia, LLC dba Premier Chrysler Dodge Jeep
Ram of Buena Park and Does 1-100, alleging the following causes of action:
1.     Violation of Subdivision
(d) of Civil Code section 1793.2
2.     Violation of Subdivision
(b) of Civil Code section 1793.2
3.     Violation of Subdivision
(a)(3) of Civil Code section 1793.2
4.     Breach of
Express Warranty
5.     Breach of
Implied Warranty
6.     Negligent
Repair
Plaintiff alleges this action arises out of the warranty
obligations of Defendants in connection with a vehicle purchased by Plaintiff
and for which Defendants issued a written warranty. 
On September 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Motion to Compel Defendant FCA US LLC’s objection free responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One and a Motion to Compel Defendant FCA US LLC’s
objection free responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. No opposition was filed.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
 
A responding
party has 30 days after service of interrogatories to serve their responses on
the propounding party. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) However, if
interrogatories are served by electronic service, a responding party has an
additional two (2) court days to respond. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd.
(a)(3)(B).)  
 
If the
responding party fails to timely respond to the interrogatories, “The party to
whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option
to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the
interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).” (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)  
  
Furthermore,
the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) And “Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a
motion to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the
propounding party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it
satisfied a ‘meet and confer’ requirement.” (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390,
404.)   
 
B.     Discussion
On July 5,
2024, Plaintiff served Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Form
Interrogatories (Set One) on Defendant FCA
US LLC. (Azimtash Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) The responses were due on or about
August 7, 2024. As of the date of this motion, no requests for an extension of
time or responses have been served. (Id. at ¶ 8.) No opposition to
Plaintiff’s motions have been filed. As such, the Court GRANTS both of Plaintiff’s motions.
III. DISPOSITION

Motion to Compel Defendant FCA US LLC’s responses

Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days of this order.
