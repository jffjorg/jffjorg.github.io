And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Plaintiff's Motion to Amend Order for Sale of Dwelling to Correct Clerical Error is GRANTED. The court finds that the real property address on page 1, line 22 of the Order was entered inadvertently and is a clerical error. The Plaintiff's counsel mistakenly typed the incorrect real property address, and the correct property address is 1540 Potrero Grand Drive, Apt. A, Rosemead, CA 91770. The court grants the motion to correct this clerical error and allows the Plaintiff to file a proposed Amended Order for Sale of Dwelling with the correct property address.
