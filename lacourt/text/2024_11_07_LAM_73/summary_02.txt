"The Court does not find that Defendants are entitled to cost-of-proof sanctions."
```
Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion for attorney's fees and costs filed by the defendants and has denied the motion. The defendants sought to recover attorney's fees and costs incurred in proving the truth of certain requests for admission that the plaintiff denied or objected to. However, the Court found that the plaintiff did not refuse to admit the requests for admission, but rather objected to them, which did not meet the requirements for cost-of-proof sanctions. The Court also found that the defendants did not file a motion to compel further responses, which would have been necessary to obtain a denial of the requests for admission. Therefore, the Court did not find that the defendants are entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs.
