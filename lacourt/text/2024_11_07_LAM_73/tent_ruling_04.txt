PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO AMEND ORDER FOR SALE
OF DWELLING TO CORRECT CLERICAL ERROR (filed 07/15/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Amend Order for Sale of Dwelling to Correct Clerical Error is GRANTED. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action was filed on November 20, 2017. This
is an action to enforce a retail installment sale contract by Defendant Moses
Galimba.  Plaintiff Bank of the West is the owner and holder of the
contract by Defendant, assigned to Bank of the West by the seller of the 2017
Ford F-350 vehicle.  Plaintiff filed this lawsuit after Defendant failed
to make monthly payments when due. Plaintiff’s attempts
to obtain possession of its collateral have been ignored.  Per Commercial
Code §§ 9601 and 9609, Plaintiff seeks cumulative remedies for the possession
of its property as prayed for in its complaint, as well as the damages for the
unpaid balance due. Plaintiff alleges (1) breach of retail installment
sale contract, (2) money lent, (3) recovery of personal property (claim and
delivery), and (4) conversion.
 
On June 21, 2018, the court entered default
judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $96,705.77 plus possession of
the “2017, Ford F-350, vehicle identification number” ending in 8009 (the
“Subject Vehicle”). 
 
On
July 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Amend Order for Sale of Dwelling to Correct Clerical Error. 
 
No
opposition was filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil
Procedure § 473(d) provides that, “the court may, upon motion of the injured
party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders
as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed.” A court
has the inherent power to correct clerical errors in its records so as to make
these records reflect the true facts. (In re Candelario (1970)
3¿Cal.¿3d¿702, 705.)  “The test which distinguishes clerical error from
possible judicial error is simply whether the challenged portion of the
judgment was entered inadvertently (which is clerical error) versus advertently
(which might be judicial error, but is not clerical error). Unless the
challenged portion of the judgment was entered inadvertently, it cannot be
changed post judgment under the guise of correction of clerical error.” Tokio
Marine & Fire Ins. Corp. v. Western Pacific Roofing Corp. (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 110, 117 (internal citation omitted). “An amendment that
substantially modifies the original judgment or materially alters the rights of
the parties, may not be made by the court under its authority to correct
clerical error, therefore, unless the record clearly demonstrates that the
error was not the result of the exercise of judicial discretion.” (In re
Candelario, 3 Cal. 3d. at¿705.) 
 
B.    
Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to amend a
portion of the Order for Sale of Dwelling entered on June 28, 2024 for the sale
of Defendant's/Judgment Debtor's real property. 
 
Plaintiff states that due to a
clerical error, Plaintiff’s counsel mistakenly typed the incorrect real
property address on page 1, line 22, of the Order, to read 1319 Via Camille,
Montebello, CA 90640, as the subject property. The correct property address on
page 1, line 22, should read 1540 Potrero Grand Drive, Apt. A, Rosemead, CA
91770. (Olson Decl., ¶ 3.) The second
page of the Order includes the correct address of 1540 Potrero Grand Drive,
Apt. A, Rosemead, CA 91770. (Olson Decl., Ex. A.) Thus, Plaintiff only seeks to
correct the address on page 1, line 22 of the Order. Plaintiff filed a proposed
Amended Order for Sale of Dwelling with the correct property address. (Olson
Decl., Ex. B.)
 
The Court finds that the record
demonstrates the real property address on page 1, line 22 of the Order was
entered inadvertently and is a clerical error. Therefore, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s motion.
 
DISPOSITION

 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Amend Order for Sale of Dwelling to Correct Clerical Error is GRANTED.
