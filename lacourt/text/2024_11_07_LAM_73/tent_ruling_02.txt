MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS
PURSUANT TO CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 2033.420 (filed by Defendants on 09/30/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure Section 2033.420 is DENIED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On September 28, 2023, Plaintiff NPSC Westmoreland LLC
(“Plaintiff”) filed this forcible detainer action against
Defendants Jose Hernandez and Diane Gomez (“Defendants”)
for the
premises located at 1140 N Westmoreland Avenue, Los Angeles,
California, 90029, County of Los Angeles (the “Premises”). 
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. On or about November 8, 2017, Plaintiff acquired title
to the Premises. (Compl. ¶ 7.) At some time after Plaintiff acquired
the Premises, Plaintiff, through its agents, verbally allowed Nikola Zuvic to
temporarily occupy the Premises as a licensee in exchange for management of the
Premises and other units Plaintiff’s owned. (Id. ¶ 8.) At no time
did Plaintiff provide Zuvic with any authority, explicit, ostensible, or
otherwise, to allow any other person or persons to occupy the Premises or to
rent or lease the Premises to any person or persons. (Ibid.)
 
“Shortly
after Plaintiff’s acquisition of the Premises, Defendants unlawfully entered
and possessed the Premises without the knowledge or permission of Plaintiff. At no time
have Defendants paid rent to Plaintiff for the Premises or otherwise occupied the
Premises with the permission of Plaintiff.” (Id. ¶ 9.) “Since at
least 2018, Defendants have forcibly prevented Plaintiff from regaining
possession of the Premises by changing the locks, physically occupying the
Premises, claiming possession of the Premises verbally and in writing, and
denying entry by all others, including Plaintiff and its agents.” (Id. ¶
11.)
 
On
or about June 6, 2023, Plaintiff caused to be served upon Defendants a Five-Day
Notice to Quit for Forcible Detainer, demanding surrender of the Premises to
Plaintiff. (Id.
¶ 12.) Defendants have retained and continue to retain,
without Plaintiff s consent, possession of the Premises up to and including the
date of Plaintiff s verification of this complaint and Plaintiff is informed
and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Defendants are intending to
remain permanently in possession of the Premises. (Id. ¶ 14.) The Complaint alleges
a single cause of action for forcible detainer. 
 
On
September 19, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment. 
 

On September 30, 2024, Defendants filed a Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs:
·       Defendants
move for an order awarding attorney’s fees in the amount of
$97,077.50[representing Attorney work for $83,825.00 and paralegal/legal
Assistant/Support staff work for $13,252.50] and costs in the amount of
$1,240.00, for a total of $98,317.50, against Plaintiff.
·      
Defendants’ attorney request a lodestar enhancement
of 1.5 based on the contingency nature of the representation and Defendants’
attorney’s assumption of all risk of loss, bringing the total attorney’s fees
request to $145,616.25, and the grand total of expenses to $146,856.25.
·      
The motion is made on the grounds that Plaintiff
denied or objected to certain requests for admission, Nos. 18, 19 and 21
without reasonable grounds to believe the admissions were not true or that the
objections were irrelevant.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition, arguing:
·       Defendants failed to meet their
initial burden to show that it incurred the requested fees specifically to
prove the issues Plaintiff should have admitted.
·       Further, in the event that the Court
finds that Defendants did meet their initial burden, the motion must be denied
simply because Plaintiff did not fail to admit the requests for admission
offered by Defendants in support of their motion.
o  
Following
the service of the responses from Plaintiff, Defendants apparently accepted the
objections raised by Plaintiff and did not file a motion to compel further
responses (or even send a meet and confer letter regarding the objections).
Accordingly, Defendants waived the right to further responses pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.290
·       Further, a significant portion of the
attorney’s fees and costs claimed by Defendants in the motion includes fees for
a period prior to the requests for admission were “denied” and counsel fails to
specify the fees incurred in proving the matters that were “unreasonably
denied.”
 
Defendants filed a reply maintaining that Defendants
are entitled to attorney’s fees and costs.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
The purpose of requests for admissions
is to expedite trial by “setting at rest a triable issue so that it will not
have to be tried.” (Cembrook v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 423,
429.¿ Although a defendant “cannot be forced to admit the fact prior to trial
despite its obvious truth”, the failure to do so comes with consequences,
exposure to a costs of proof award. (Grace v. Mansourian (2015) 240
Cal.App.4th 523, 532.)¿ 
 
C.C.P. §2033.420(a) provides: “If a
party fails to admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter
when requested to do so under this chapter, and if the party requesting that
admission thereafter proves the genuineness of that document or the truth of
that matter, the party requesting the admission may move the court for an order
requiring the party to whom the request was directed to pay the reasonable
expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorney's fees.” 
C.C.P. §2033.420(b) provides: “The
court shall make this order unless it finds any of the following: (1) An
objection to the request was sustained or a response to it was waived under
Section 2033.290. (2) The admission sought was of no substantial importance.
(3) The party failing to make the admission had reasonable ground to believe
that that party would prevail on the matter. (4) There was other good reason
for the failure to admit.” 
 
“Costs of proof are available against
a party only, not its counsel.” (Estate of Manuel (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th
400, 404.) “[I]f a party denies a request for admission (of substantial
importance) in circumstances where the party lacked personal knowledge but had
available sources of information and failed to make a reasonable investigation to
ascertain the facts, such failure will justify an award of expenses . . .” (Brooks
v. American Broadcasting Co. (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 500, 510.) “An RFA has
‘substantial importance’ if it is ‘central to disposition of the case.’” (Doe
v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 675, 690. See also Brooks, supra, 179 Cal.App.3d at 509 (“as
a general rule a request for admission should have at least some direct
relationship to one of the central issues in the case, i.e., an issue which, if
not proven, would have altered the results in the case.”).)¿ 
¿ 
Costs may be awarded when the
requesting party proves the matter at trial or on a motion for summary
judgment. (Barnett v. Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P. (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 494, 497-498.) 
 
The sanction is limited to reasonable
expenses incurred after the denial. (See Garcia v. Hyster Co. (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 724, 736.) Moreover, the sanction is limited to expenses incurred
in “proving the matters denied.” (Id. at 736-737.) 
 
B.     
Whether
Defendants are entitled to recover attorney’s fees
 
Defendants move for costs of proof
sanctions pursuant to C.C.P. §2033.420 on the grounds that Plaintiff denied or
objected to certain requests for admission, Nos. 18, 19 and 21 without
reasonable grounds to believe the admissions were not true or that the
objections were irrelevant.
 
On November 22, 2023, Defendant Hernandez
served Plaintiff with a set of requests for admission. The RFAs at issue were
as follows:
 
Request
No. 18: “Admit that the defendant had exclusive possession of their apartment
unit during their tenancy or at all-time relevant to the action.”
 
Request
No. 19: “Admit that you have no facts supporting your claim that the defendant
is not a tenant at the subject property.”
 
Request
No. 21: “Admit that you have no facts supporting your claim that the defendant
has waived and is estopped and barred from alleging matters set forth in each
cause of action of the Complaint.” 
 
Defendants argue that in light of the
Court’s order granting Defendants’ summary judgment, Defendants are entitled to
recover their fees and costs in proving the admissions true.
 
However, cost-of-proof sanctions are
authorized only where the responding party refused to admit a request for
admission. If the responding party simply objected or gave an incomplete
answer, the proponent must first move to compel further answers. (See Wimberly
v. Derby Cycle Corp. (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 618, 636-637.) However,
objections with responses that are unequivocal denials support cost-of-proof
sanctions. (See American Federation of State, County & Municipal
Employees v. Metropolitan Water Dist. of Southern California (2005) 126
Cal.App.4th 247, 268.) 
 
Upon review of Plaintiff’s responses
to Defendant’s Requests for Admissions, the Court notes that Plaintiff did not
refuse to admit the requests for admission. Plaintiff simply objected to Nos.
18, 19 and 21. The responses were as follows:
 
Response
to Request No. 18: “Objection. This request is impermissibly argumentative, by
requiring the adoption of various assumptions, including “their apartment” and
“their tenancy.” Further, this request is impermissibly compound and
conjunctive. Further, this request is vague and ambiguous as to the term
“defendant,” as there are two defendants in this matter.”
 
Response
to Request No. 19: “Objection. This request is vague and ambiguous as to the
term “defendant,” as there are two defendants in this matter.”
 
Response
to Request No. 21: “Objection. This request, as phrased is unintelligible –
defendant, or either of them, has not alleged any matters in any complaint.
Further, this request is impermissibly compound and conjunctive. Further, this
request is vague and ambiguous as to the term “defendant,” as there are two
defendants in this matter. Further, this request is vague and ambiguous as to
the term “Complaint.”’
 
Thus, Plaintiff provided only
objections to the requests at issue. Plaintiff did not provide denials with the
objections. Defendants also did not file a motion to compel further responses.
Therefore, the Court does not find that Defendants are entitled to
cost-of-proof sanctions. Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 2033.420 is DENIED.
