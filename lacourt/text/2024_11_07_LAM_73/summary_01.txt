Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to set aside the determination of good faith settlement by defendants Nardon and Knoop. The motion was filed by defendant HPC Vineburn, LLC and cross-defendant Highpoint Capital LLC, who claim they did not receive notice of the settlement agreement until after it was granted by the court. The court finds that HPC has submitted evidence that they did not receive the application until after it was granted on September 5, 2024, and therefore grants the motion to allow HPC to contest the good faith settlement.
