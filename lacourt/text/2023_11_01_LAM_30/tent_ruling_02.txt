Castro vs. Room
Forty Inc., et. al., Case
No. 23STCV13508
 
Tentative
Ruling re:  Demurrer to Second Amended
Complaint; Motion to Strike
            
Defendants Room Forty Inc. and
Hospitality Collaborative, LLC (collectively, Defendants) demur to the eighth
cause of action in Plaintiff Amber Castro’s Second Amended Complaint (SAC) and
move to strike portions of the SAC. The demurrer is sustained and the motion to
strike is granted.
 
In reviewing the legal sufficiency of a
complaint against a demurrer, a court will treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions, or
conclusions of law. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 (Blank);
C & H Foods Co. v. Hartford Ins. Co. (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 1055,
1062.) It is well settled that a “demurrer lies only for defects appearing on
the face of the complaint[.]” (Stevens v. Superior Court (1999) 75
Cal.App.4th 594, 601.) “The rules by which the sufficiency of a complaint is
tested against a general demurrer are well settled. We not only treat the
demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but also give the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
their context.” (Guclimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19
Cal.4th 26, 38 (internal quotes omitted).) For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, the complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable
inferences from the facts pleaded. (Wilner v. Sunset Life Ins. Co.
(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 952, 958.) 
 When ruling on a demurrer, the
Court may only consider the complaint’s allegations or matters which may be
judicially noticed. (Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.) The Court may
not consider any other extrinsic evidence or judge the credibility of the
allegations plead or the difficulty a plaintiff may have in proving his
allegations. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,
881.) A demurrer is properly sustained only when the complaint, liberally
construed, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute any cause of action. (Kramer
v. Intuit Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 574, 578.) 
 
            In May 2020, Plaintiff was hired by
Defendant Room Forty, Inc. (Room) as a bartender and server. (SAC ¶ 11.) Room
is a subsidiary of Hospitality Collaborative, LLC (Hospitality). (SAC ¶ 35.) Around
June 2022, Plaintiff was informed by Room’s management and/or staff that mold
was present on Room’s premises. (SAC ¶ 12.) By September 2022, Plaintiff and a
coworker, Jim, were Room’s only remaining employees, with Plaintiff working
Mondays through Fridays, and some Saturdays, for 5-8 hours a day. (SAC ¶ 14.)
Around this time, Plaintiff began to experience fatigue, headaches, flu-like
symptoms, and other issues with her physical and mental health. (SAC ¶¶ 14-19.)

On
December 13, 2022, following pressure from another employee, Room hired a mold
inspector to inspect the premises. The inspector’s report found a “high
likelihood of mold growth” in the workplace, with a “presence of potentially
harmful mold spores.” (SAC ¶ 20.) Plaintiff continued to work on the premises
until January 2023, when Room’s management required that she and her co-worker
move out of the room to resolve the mold issue. (SAC ¶ 24.) On February 28,
2023, Plaintiff told Room that she was quitting and moving away to Washington
due to her health issues. (SAC ¶ 26.)
Plaintiff’s
eighth cause of action against Defendants is for “Employer’s Willful Physical
Assault.” Under this claim, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants “caused Plaintiff
to be touched in a harmful and/or offensive manner due to Defendants’ failure
to examine and remedy any potentially hazardous organisms, such as black mold,
within a reasonable time.” (SAC ¶ 64.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
intended to cause her harm “through their improper concealment of the mold
situation and failure to examine and remedy” the mold. (SAC ¶ 65.) Plaintiff
seeks punitive damages pursuant to this cause of action. (SAC ¶ 68.)
Under the workers’
compensation exclusive remedy rule, “[i]f an injury is compensable under the
workers' compensation laws, then recovery under those laws is generally the
worker's only remedy against . . . his employer.” (Soares v. City of Oakland
(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1822, 1825; Lab. Code § 3602, subd. (a).) An exception to
this rule applies “[w]here the employee’s injury or death is proximately caused
by a willful physical assault by the employer.” (Lab. Code § 3602, subd.
(b)(1).) “ ‘[W]illful’ employer assaults within the meaning of section
3602(b)(1) do not include all common law batteries, but only those batteries
that are specifically intended to injure.” (Soares, 9 Cal.App.4th
at 1828–1829.)
Defendants’
alleged failures to examine and remedy the mold issues do not show conduct
“specifically intended to injure” as required to plead willful physical assault
under Section 3602(b)(1). The allegations also fail to satisfy the element of
intentional harmful contact.  (Ashcraft v. King (1991)
228 Cal.App.3d 604, 613 [“A harmful contact, intentionally
done is the essence of a battery.”]; CACI
No. 2801 [“1. That [name of defendant] . . . touched [name of plaintiff or
caused [name of plaintiff] to be touched in a harmful or offensive manner.”.)
Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained as to the eighth cause of action.
Defendants move to strike the punitive damages
allegation under the eighth cause of action and the related prayer for punitive
damages. (SAC ¶ 68, Prayer 13.) Because the demurrer is sustained as to that
cause of action, the motion to strike is denied as moot.
