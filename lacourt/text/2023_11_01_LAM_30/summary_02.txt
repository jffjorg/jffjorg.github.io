Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the eighth cause of action, which is for "Employer's Willful Physical Assault". The plaintiff, Amber Castro, alleges that her employer, Room Forty Inc., and its subsidiary, Hospitality Collaborative, LLC, caused her to experience health issues due to their failure to examine and remedy mold growth on the premises. The judge has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The judge has also denied the motion to strike the punitive damages allegation, as the demurrer is sustained and the motion is therefore moot.

The judge's ruling is based on the exclusive remedy rule in California Labor Code ยง 3602, which provides that an employee's injury or death is generally the employee's only remedy against their employer, unless the injury or death is proximately caused by a willful physical assault by the employer. The judge has determined that the defendants' alleged failures to examine and remedy the mold issues do not show conduct "specifically intended to injure" as required to plead willful physical assault under Section 3602(b)(1).
