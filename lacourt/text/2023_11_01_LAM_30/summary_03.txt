The motion is granted, and the Plaintiff is ordered to produce the witnesses for deposition. The Judge finds that the witnesses are "officers, directors, managing agents, or employees" of the Plaintiff and have knowledge of the case. The Plaintiff's objection to the depositions is deemed meritless. The Judge also awards monetary sanctions to the Defendant in the amount of $2,825, which must be paid by the Plaintiff within 30 days.
