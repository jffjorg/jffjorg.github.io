And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the cross-complainant's motion to compel further discovery responses from the cross-defendant, Freedom Forever, LLC. The motion is related to Request Nos. 23 and 24 in the Requests for Production (Set Four), which seek templates for solar agreements and performance guarantees used by Freedom Forever from January 2017 to present. Freedom Forever had previously objected to these requests, claiming they were irrelevant, overbroad, and unduly burdensome. However, the Court finds that the requested templates are relevant to the cross-complainant's claim for public injunctive relief under the Consumer Legal Remedies Act and that Freedom Forever has presented no evidence showing that production would be unduly burdensome. As a result, Freedom Forever is ordered to provide a supplemental verified response and responsive documents to the cross-complainant within 15 days of today's date.
