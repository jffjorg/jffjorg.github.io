ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT ROGER KARAYAN’S MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM DEFAULT JUDGMENT
I.        INTRODUCTION
          This is an action arising from the alleged breach of a
lease agreement due to nonpayment of rent concerning a property located at 3920
Foothill Blvd., La Crescenta, California 91214 (the “Premises”). 
          On September 18, 2023, Plaintiff Westport La Crescenta, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) filed an Unlawful Detainer Complaint against Defendants Roger Karayan
(“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 20.  
          On September 25, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer to the
Unlawful Detainer Complaint. 
          On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant. 
          On December 28, 2023, default was entered against
Defendant. 
          On April 3, 2024, the Court entered default judgment for
Plaintiff and against Defendant in the total of $93,886.73.
          On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served Notice of
Entry of Judgment. 
          On July 11, 2024, Defendant, who is self-represented, filed
the instant Motion for Relief from Default Judgment.[1]
Defendant seeks an order vacating the default and default judgment entered
against him. Defendant’s motion is made on the grounds that he “was unaware
that he needed to file an additional answer and he had the mistaken belief that
his original answer was all that he needed to file and that he was never
properly served with any of the court’s notices regarding hearing dates.” (Not.
of Mot. at p. 2:2-7.) 
          On July 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served an opposition
to the motion.
          As of July 25, 2024, no reply brief has been filed. Any
reply brief was required to have been filed and served at least five court days
prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD     
 “The court may, upon any terms as may be just,
relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal,
order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).) “Application for . . . relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the
answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding was taken.” (Ibid.) “It is well settled that appellate courts
have always been and are favorably disposed toward such action upon the part of
the trial courts as will permit, rather than prevent, the adjudication of legal
controversies upon their merits.” (Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1948) 31
Cal.2d 523, 525.)   
III.     ANALYSIS
Improper Notice of Motion
Plaintiff argues that the motion should be denied as
it is deficient under CCP § 1005(b). Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s motion
was not served with the required notice period. The Court agrees. 
“[A]ll moving and supporting papers shall be served
and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).) “[I]f the notice is served by mail, the required 16-day period of
notice before the hearing shall be increased by five calendar days if the place
of mailing and the place of address are within the State of California . . . .”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
Initially, the Court finds that the proof of service
concerning the motion is defective as it indicates that the motion was served
on Plaintiff via mail on July 8, 2023. Service of the motion on July 8, 2023
would not have been possible given that this action was not filed until
September 18, 2023. 
Even if Defendant made an error in the proof of
service and Plaintiff was, in fact, served with the motion by mail on July 8,
2024, service on such date would not be compliant with CCP § 1005(b). The
motion is noticed for a July 30, 2024 hearing date and therefore it should have
been served on Plaintiff no later than July 1, 2024, which is 16 court days plus
five calendar days before the hearing date. Thus, the service of the motion is
untimely as Plaintiff was not given adequate notice of the motion.  
The Court recognizes that
Defendant is pro per.
Litigants who represent themselves in pro per
“are held to the same standards as attorneys.” (Kobayshi v.
Superior Court (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 536, 543.) 
Even if the motion had
been procedurally proper, Defendant did not make the required showing to set
aside the default and default judgment. Defendant declares that he did not know
that he was required to file an additional answer to the FAC, which resulted in
the default and default judgment against him. (Karayan Decl., ¶ 7.) Defendant
does not dispute that he was served with the FAC. The Court reminds Defendant
that “[a]ny alleged ignorance of legal matters or failure to properly represent
himself can hardly constitute mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable
neglect as those terms are used in section 473.” (Goodson v.
Bogerts, Inc. (1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 32, 40.) Also, Defendant
has failed to show that he “exercised such reasonable diligence as a man of
ordinary prudence usually bestows upon an important business matter.” (Ibid.) Defendant has chosen to represent himself and
“he is not, for that reason, entitled to any more (or less) consideration than
a lawyer.” (Ibid.)
 
 
IV.     
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 Based on the foregoing, Defendant Roger
Karayan’s Motion for Relief from Default Judgment is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
Plaintiff to give notice of this order.
