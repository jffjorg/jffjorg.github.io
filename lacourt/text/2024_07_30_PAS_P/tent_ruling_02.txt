 Case Number:  23AHCV00462    Hearing Date:   July 30, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT SAN GABRIEL VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER LP’S MOTION TO
DISMISS ACTION PURSUANT TO CCP § 581(f)(1)    I.  INTRODUCTION
          This is an action arising from alleged medical malpractice.
On March 6, 2023, Plaintiff Hong Gan (“Plaintiff”), who is self-represented,
filed a Complaint against Defendant San Gabriel Valley Medical Center.  
          On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant San Gabriel Valley Medical Center
alleging causes of action for: (1) Intentional Tort, Sexual Abuse; (2)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (3) Negligence; (4) False
Involuntary Detention in a Mental Hospital; and (5) Patient Rights Violation.  
          On November 14, 2023, Defendant AHMC San Gabriel Valley
Medical Center LP filed a demurrer to the entire FAC.   On
March 27, 2024, this action was reassigned to the Honorable Jared D. Moses
sitting in Department P at Pasadena Courthouse effective April 2, 2024. 
          On April 30, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court
sustained Defendant AHMC San Gabriel Valley Medical Center LP’s demurrer to the
FAC without leave to amend on the grounds that this action is barred by the
doctrine of res judicata. (04/30/24 Minute Order.) 
          On June 3, 2024, Defendant San Gabriel Valley Medical
Center LP (“Defendant”), who indicates that it was erroneously sued as San
Gabriel Valley Medical Center, filed and served the instant Motion to Dismiss
Action Pursuant to CCP § 581(f)(1). 
          On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to
Defendant’s demurrer; however, such opposition is moot and irrelevant given
that the hearing on the demurrer has already occurred. Plaintiff did not appear
at the hearing on the demurrer. (04/30/24 Minute Order.) 
          On July 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended
Complaint; however, the Court notes that such pleading was not filed with leave
of court and the Court sustained the demurrer to the FAC without leave to amend.

          Thus, the Court finds it appropriate to strike Plaintiff’s untimely
opposition to the demurrer as well as the purported Second Amended Complaint
pursuant to CCP § 436. 
          As of July 25, 2024, the motion to dismiss is unopposed.
Any opposition was required to have been filed and served at least nine court
days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
           II.      LEGAL
STANDARD     
A court may dismiss a
complaint “after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained without leave to
amend and either party moves for dismissal.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 581, subd.
(f)(1).) 
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          Here, in its April 30, 2024 order, the
Court sustained the demurrer of Defendant to the FAC without leave to amend.
(04/30/24 Minute Order.) Thus, under CCP § 581(f)(1), the Court may dismiss
this action as Defendant has requested dismissal thereunder. The Court
therefore finds that dismissal of this action is appropriate under CCP §
581(f)(1). 
 
IV.     
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 Based on the foregoing, Defendant
San Gabriel Valley Medical Center LP’s Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. 
          Defendant San Gabriel Valley Medical Center LP to give
notice of this order.
 
          
Dated: July 30, 2024
