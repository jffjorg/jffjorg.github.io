And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Roger Karayan's motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against him in the amount of $93,886.73. The defendant had argued that he was unaware of the need to file an additional answer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, which resulted in the default and default judgment. However, the judge found that the defendant was aware of the need to file an additional answer and had failed to show that he exercised reasonable diligence in filing his response. The judge also found that the defendant's motion was deficient under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b), which requires that moving and supporting papers be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. Therefore, the judge denied the defendant's motion without prejudice.
