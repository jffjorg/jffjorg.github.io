```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the defendant's motion to dismiss the action, which is based on the doctrine of res judicata. The plaintiff had previously filed a complaint and a first amended complaint, but the court sustained the defendant's demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiff did not appear at the hearing on the demurrer and did not file a timely opposition to the demurrer. As a result, the court strikes the plaintiff's opposition to the demurrer and the second amended complaint that was filed out of time. The defendant's motion to dismiss is granted under CCP § 581(f)(1), and the action is dismissed.
