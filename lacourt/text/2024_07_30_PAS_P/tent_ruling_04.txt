The Court notes that Plaintiff filed two essentially identical motions for
relief from default judgment. The motions are the same but for the spacing of
the motions being different. The motions rely on the same arguments, cases and
statutes, declaration, and exhibits. Also, the Court notes that the caption in
the notice of motion requests to quash service but the notice of motion sets
forth no grounds for such relief and the memorandum of points and authorities
makes no argument concerning quashing service. Thus, the Court will treat
Defendantâ€™s motion solely as a motion for relief from default judgment.
