And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to file a third amended complaint, which adds two new causes of action for negligent misrepresentation and intentional misrepresentation. The judge found that the delay in filing the amended complaint is unexplained and will cause prejudice to the defendants. The judge noted that the defendants will likely need to conduct additional discovery to respond to the new causes of action, and that the defendants' attempts to file a timely motion for summary judgment may be thwarted by the ever-changing complaint. The judge also pointed out that the plaintiffs failed to explain the delay in filing the misrepresentation claims, and that the claims may have been discovered during discovery rather than being a result of the defendants' alleged representations.
