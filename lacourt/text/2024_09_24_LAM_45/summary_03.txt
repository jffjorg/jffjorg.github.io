And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Tamar Kaloustian, and her legal counsel, KJT Law Group. The court finds that the plaintiff intentionally destroyed evidence of toxicity in the Paleo Puffs products, which underpinned her case. As a result, the test results purporting to show that one of the two samples of the Paleo Puffs purchased in 2021 had prohibited levels of toxicity are hereby excluded as evidence. Additionally, the court imposes monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,000.00 upon the plaintiff and her legal counsel, jointly and severally, and awards them to the defendant. The plaintiff will be permitted to proceed with the case, but the court's decision excludes the excluded evidence and monetary sanctions. The monetary sanctions are due within 20 days of the date of this order.
