ANALYSIS:
 
On February 13, 2020, Plaintiff Prime Point Contracting,
Inc. (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action for motor vehicle negligence
against Defendant Araksya Dulbenchyan (“Defendant”). On the same date,
Plaintiff filed a notice of related case with respect to small claims case LASC
No. 19VESC06412 (“the Small Claims case”). (Notice of Related Case, filed
02/13/20.) The Small Claims case was transferred to Department 26 in the Spring
Street Courthouse on February 14, 2020. (LASC No. 19VESC06412, Application and
Order for Transfer, 02/14/20.) 
 
Plaintiff filed proof of personal service of the Summons and
Complaint in this action on February 15, 2022. When Defendant failed to file a
responsive pleading, Plaintiff obtained their default on June 6, 2022. The
Court set an Order to Show Cause re: Entry of Default or Dismissal, which was
continued multiple times. At the Order to Show Cause on April 13, 2023,
Defendant appeared and indicated they would move to vacate default. 
 
On September 11, 2023, Defendant filed the instant Motion to
Vacate Default and Quash Service. The motion came for hearing on October 5,
2023 at which time both parties appeared. (Minute Order, 10/05/23.) At
Plaintiff’s request, the Court continued the hearing to November 7, 2023.
(Minute Order, 10/05/23.) Plaintiff served an opposition on October 26, 2023,
which it filed the next day. (Opp., filed 10/27/23, p. 42.) The Motion came for
hearing on November 7, 2023 and was continued to December 5, 2023 with notice
given by the Court. (Minute Order, 11/07/23.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves to vacate the entry of default pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), section 473.5, or Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d). 
 
Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), an application for relief must be made
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving
defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be
corrected if Defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing
date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.) 
 
The instant Motion was not timely filed within six months of
entry of default on June 6, 2022. The six-month deadline is jurisdictional and
not subject to tolling. (Manson, Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176
Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) Therefore, Defendant cannot obtain relief under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
 
The Motion is also brought under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473.5, subdivision (a): 
 
When service of a summons has not resulted
in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or
default judgment has been entered against him or
her in the action, he or she may serve and file a
notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for
leave to defend the action.  The notice of
motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event
exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment
against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or
her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has
been entered.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)
Additionally, the motion “shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the party's lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was
not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party
shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other
pleading proposed to be filed in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd.
(b).) Defendant’s Motion is timely under this statute and they contend they did
not receive actual notice in time to defend the action. (Motion, Dulbenchyan
Decl., ¶8.) However, the declaration does not state that Defendant’s lack of
actual notice was not caused by avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect,
nor is the Motion accompanied by a copy of Defendant’s proposed responsive
pleading. Both of these are required before the Court can grant relief under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. 
 
Finally, Defendant moves to vacate the default on
grounds that it is void, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (d), which states that “[t]he court may, .... on motion of
either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or
order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d).) The Motion points to Rogers v.
Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1116, which holds that the
limitations period contained in Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 applies
by analogy to motions brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (d). As noted above, the Motion is timely under Code of Civil
Procedure section 473.5. Defendant contends that the entry of default is void
due to defective service, which was the same ground raised in Rogers. In
support, Defendant submits a declaration disputing that service occurred as
stated in the proof of personal service filed on February 15, 2022. 
 
“When a defendant
challenges the court’s personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the
facts requisite to an effective service.’” (Summers
v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413; see also Lebel v. Mai
(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160.) However, a proof of service
containing a declaration from a registered process server invokes a rebuttable presumption
affecting the burden of producing
evidence of the facts stated in the return. (Cal. Evid. Code, § 647; see American
Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383,
390.)
 
Here,
the challenged
proof of service is not attested to by a registered process server, and
therefore, is not entitled to a presumption of truth in its contents. (Proof
of Personal Service, filed 02/15/22 ¶7e.) The burden to prove the facts requisite to an effective service,
therefore, falls to Plaintiff. The proof of service is attested to by Melanie
Simon, who declares that they personally delivered the Summons and Complaint on
Defendant at 6230 Sylmar Avenue, Van Nuys, California 91401 “(in the hallway
outside Department P)” on February 14, 2020 at 8:45 am. (Id. at ¶¶4-5.)
Simon also submits a declaration in support of the opposition stating that they
accompanied Plaintiff’s attorney Jesse Terrell to the small claims court and
served Defendant in the hallway of the Van Nuys courthouse after the hearing on
February 14, 2020. (Opp., Simon Decl., ¶2.) In the Motion, Defendant denies
that they were served with the papers on February 14, 2020 in the hallway
outside the small claims courtroom. (Motion, Dulbenchyan Decl., ¶8.) Defendant,
however, admits to being at the location of service on the date and time
service purportedly took place and meeting with Plaintiff’s other attorney, Mainak
D’Attaray. (Ibid.) Defendant’s declaration does not match the facts in
the Court’s record. The Court takes judicial notice of the order entered in LASC
No. 19VESC06412 on February 14, 2020, noting an appearance on behalf of
Plaintiff by Attorney Terrell, not Attorney D’Attaray. (LASC No. 19VESC06412 Minute Order,
02/14/20.) Attorney D’Attaray also provides
a declaration in support of the opposition denying being at the small claims
court on February 14, 2020. (Opp., D’Attaray Decl., ¶2.) 
 
Accordingly, the Court finds Attorney Terrell’s declaration
of service credible and that Defendant’s version of the events on the date of
service does not demonstrate that the entry of default was void and should be
vacated under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d). Defendant’s
motion to vacate the entry of default is denied. Likewise, Defendant’s request
to quash service of the Summons and Complaint pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10 is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Araksya Dulbenchyan’s Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment, If Entered, and Motion to Quash Service is DENIED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
