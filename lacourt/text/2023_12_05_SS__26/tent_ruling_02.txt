ANALYSIS:
 
Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain (“Judgment Creditor”), in pro
per, filed the instant action for fraud against Alina  Grygoryshyna (“Judgment Debtor”), also in pro
per, on July 6, 2020. Following Judgment Debtor’s failure to appear, the Court
entered default judgment in Judgment Creditor’s favor on January 4, 2021.
Judgment Creditor filed the instant Motion for Private Place Order on September
25, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Judgment Creditor
moves for an order that the Sheriff’s Office serve subpoenas duces tecum upon material
third-party witnesses Judgment Debtor’s mother-in-law Guitty Hakim,
Judgment Debtor’s mother Svitlana Grygoryshyna, and Judgment Debtor’s
aunt-in-law Sylvia Hakim. These third-parties are avoiding service by
concealing themselves at a private residence. The Court should order the
sheriff’s office to serve Guitty, Syliva, and Svitlana with the subpoenas duces
tecum and to seize Judgment Debtor’s 2022 Land Rover, which is also concealed.
 
The Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedures
section 1988 and 699.030. Code of Civil Procedure section 1988 states in
relevant part: “If a witness is concealed in a building or vessel, so as to
prevent the service of a subpoena upon him, any Court or Judge, or any officer
issuing the subpoena, may, upon proof by affidavit of the concealment, and of
the materiality of the witness, make an order that the Sheriff of the county
serve the subpoena; and the Sheriff must serve it accordingly, and for that
purpose may break into the building or vessel where the witness is concealed.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1988.) 
 
Judgment Creditor contends that Guitty Hakim is a material
witness because she is Judgment Debtor’s mother-in-law, and married to Masud
Hakim, for whom an order for appearance and examination was issued on June 27,
2023. The affidavit in support of the order for appearance and examination of
Masud Hakim, however, does not demonstrate that Guitty Hakim is a material
witness because it says nothing about Guitty Hakim. (Affidavit for ORAP for
Masud Hakim, filed 06/27/23.) Nor is simply being a family member sufficient to
demonstrate the materiality of a witness, i.e., that a person who has
information material to the proceedings. 
 
Regarding the materiality of Svitlana Grygoryshyna, Judgment
Debtor’s mother, there is evidence that she is in possession of a financed
vehicle for which Judgment debtor has an individual auto loan for which monthly
payments of $1,000.00 are being made. (Affidavit for Order for Appearance and
Examination of Svitlana Grygoryshyna, filed 09/12/23, ¶3; Affidavit for OSC re
Contempt, filed 05/16/23, ¶16 and Exh. D at p. 14:11-13.) Judgment Creditor has
also demonstrated that Svitlana Grygoryshyna is avoiding service by concealing
herself at 1045 Carolyn Way, Beverly Hills, California. (Motion, Liepe Decl. ¶3.)

 
Finally, Judgment Creditor contends that Judgment Debtor’s
aunt-in-law, Sylvia Hakim is a material witness because bank records show funds
transfers and/or payments received from and/or sent to Sylvia Hakim. (Affidavit
for Order for Appearance and Examination of Sylvia Hakim, filed 09/25/23, ¶3;
Supp. Krain Decl., filed 09/12/23, Exh. A at p. 20.) The records show a single
transfer of funds from Judgment Debtor to Sylvia Hakim in the amount of $200.00
on December 5, 2022. (Supp. Krain Decl., filed 09/12/23, Exh. A at p. 20.) The
Court finds this single transaction is not sufficient to demonstrate the
materiality of Slyvia Hakim as a witness in this action. No information is
provided regarding the purpose of the transaction, nor is there any indication
of repeated transfers from Judgment Debtor to Sylvia Hakim. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Judgment Debtor is only entitled to
an order for service of a subpoena on Svitlana Grygoryshyna pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1988. 
 
Judgment Debtor also moves for an order levying two vehicles
owned by Judgment Debtor that are located in a private place. Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 699.030, the judgment creditor may apply to the court
for an order directing the levying officer to seize the judgment debtor’s
private property if located in a private place. (Code Civ. Proc., § 699.030,
subd. (b).) Specifically, Judgment Creditor provides evidence that Judgment
Debtor purchased a red Tesla Model 3 in December 2022 that is currently located
at 1045 Carolyn Way, Beverly Hills, California or 1006 Elden Way, Beverly
Hills, California. (Motion, Exh. D; Liepe Decl., ¶¶2-3.) Judgment Creditor also
contends that Judgment Debtor owns a 2022 Land Rover but presents no evidence
of this purchase. He points to an automobile loan opened in May 2022 but this
does not demonstrate what vehicle is associated with the loan. (Affidavit for
OSC re Contempt, filed 05/16/23, ¶16 and Exh. E, p. 5.) Therefore, the request
for an order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 699.030 is granted
with respect to the red Model 3 Tesla located at 1045 Carolyn Way, Beverly
Hills, California or 1006 Elden Way, Beverly Hills, California.
