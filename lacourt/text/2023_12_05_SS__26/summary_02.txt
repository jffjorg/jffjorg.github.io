And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants in part and denies in part the motion for private place order filed by Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain. The motion is granted for service of a subpoena duces tecum on Svitlana Grygoryshyna, Judgment Debtor's mother, at 1045 Carolyn Way, Beverly Hills, California. The motion is denied for service of a subpoena duces tecum on Guitty Hakim and Sylvia Hakim, Judgment Debtor's mother-in-law and aunt-in-law, respectively.

The motion is also granted for levy of the red Model 3 Tesla located at 1045 Carolyn Way, Beverly Hills, California or 1006 Elden Way, Beverly Hills, California. However, the motion is denied for levy of the 2022 Land Rover, as Judgment Creditor failed to provide sufficient evidence of the vehicle's existence.

The judge finds that Svitlana Grygoryshyna is a material witness because she is in possession of a financed vehicle and is avoiding service by concealing herself at a private residence. The judge also finds that Svitlana Grygoryshyna is a material witness because she is Judgment Debtor's mother and has information material to the proceedings. However, the judge denies the motion for service of a subpoena duces tecum on Guitty Hakim and Sylvia Hakim because they are not material witnesses.

The judge's ruling is based on Code of Civil Procedure sections 1988 and 699.030, which provide for service of subpoenas duces tecum and levy of private property, respectively.
