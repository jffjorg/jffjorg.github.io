Discussion
 
The First
Amended Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) violation of Consumers Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code § 1750 et seq.; and (2) violation of California
Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq., based on the following facts.
On November 14, 2019, Plaintiff went to 5 Star Auto Group dba Billion Auto
Group’s (“Seller”) place of business and purchased a 2018 Ford Focus (“the
subject vehicle”) pursuant to a retail installment sales contract (“the
Contract”). (FAC, ¶¶13, 19.) Prior to purchase, Seller made representations
about the subject vehicle’s history and/or repair condition but did not
disclose that it had been in a major accident, underwent substandard repair, or
suffered structural damage to its frame. (Id. at ¶¶14-15.) The true
condition of the subject vehicle was that it had suffered structural damage to
its frame/unibody due to a major accident, or had unrepaired structural damage,
frame damage, or unibody damage. (Id. at ¶16.) The true condition of the
vehicle was that it had defects, including but not limited to defective tire
sensor, electrical defects, and structural defects. (Id. at ¶17.) 
 
Plaintiff would
not have purchased the subject vehicle if not for Seller’s misrepresentations
and was not able to discover its true condition prior to purchase. (Id.
at ¶¶18, 21.) After purchase and within the last three years, Plaintiff
discovered the vehicle had been involved in a major accident and/or had
frame/unibody damage or it had substandard repair and any statute of
limitations is tolled by the discovery rule. (Id. at ¶¶23-24.) Plaintiff
has been harmed by relying on Seller’s fraudulent representations. (Id.
at ¶¶30-32.) The Contract was subsequently assigned to Defendant and by
accepting it, Defendant is liable for the claims and defenses pursuant to the
Contract. (Id. at ¶¶34-35.) 
 
The Demurrer is supported by a meet and confer declaration,
as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. (Demurrer, Castaño, Jr.,
Decl., ¶2.) Defendant demurs to both causes of action in the Complaint for
failure to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action and uncertainty.
(Citing Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) 
 
 
1st Cause of Action for Violation of Consumers Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code § 1750 et seq.
 
Defendant first argues that this cause of action is not
alleged with the requisite particularity. The Court of Appeals has held that “causes
of action under the CLRA and UCL must be stated with reasonable particularity,
which is a more lenient pleading standard than is applied to common law fraud
claims.” (Gutierrez v. Carmax Auto Superstores California (2018) 19
Cal.App.5th 1234, 1261.) The elements of the cause of action are (1) a
misrepresentation; and (2) reliance on the misrepresentation. (Cohen v.
DIRECTV, Inc. (2009) 178 Cal. App. 4th 966, 980.) Additionally, the
pleading must identify the particular section of the statutory scheme that was
violated with reasonably particular facts supporting the violation. (Khoury
v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619.) 
 
As with the Complaint, the First Amended Complaint still
does not allege what particular section(s) of the statutory scheme was
violated. It alleges that Seller’s conduct violated the CLRA “in a number of
respects” and provides the particular facts that demonstrate these violations.
(FAC, ¶¶42-47.) However, the particular section of the CLRA, which spans four
chapters, is not cited. Also, Defendant previously argued that Plaintiff has
not alleged reliance with the requisite particularity because the specific
alleged misrepresentations were only possible. (Citing Compl., ¶43.) By
removing the term “possibly,” the First Amended Complaint now alleges
Plaintiff’s reliance on Seller’s representations with the necessary
particularity. However, simply removing the term “possibly” is not enough to
correct the deficiency noted above regarding alleging the statute with the
requisite particularity. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer to the first cause of
action is sustained. 
 
2nd Cause of Action for Violation of Business &
Professions Code section 17200, et seq.
 
Defendant argues that the second cause of action is entirely
derivative of the first cause of action, and must fail for the same reason. The
second cause of action does not allege what specific unlawful, unfair, and/or
fraudulent business acts and/or practices give rise to the second cause of
action other than “as is set forth in this complaint” and “as delineated
above.” (Compl., ¶¶56-59.) The “unlawful, unfair, and/or fraudulent” practices,
therefore, must refer to the violations of the CLRA in the first cause of
action. 
 
Therefore, the demurrer to the second cause of action is
also sustained.   
 
Leave to Amend
 
Plaintiff’s opposition requests
leave to amend if the demurrer is sustained but offers no facts that would be
added to correct the lack of particularity noted above. (Opp., p. 4:1-6.) Leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment but the burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.) Leave to amend is denied.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Tustin
Community Bank’s Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
