ANALYSIS:
 
On August 17, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant Doris
Anderson (“Defendant”) served Special Interrogatories, Set One and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Sisi Missy, Inc.
dba CDP Construction (“Plaintiff”) (Motions, Brooke
Decl., Exh. A.) Following Plainitff’s failure to serve timely responses,
Defendant filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions, on September 28, 2023. No oppositions have been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Based on Plaintiff’s failure
to timely respond to the propounded discovery, Defendant is entitled to an
order compelling service of verified responses to the discovery requests
without objections. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the sanctions sought are excessive for
simple and unopposed discovery motions. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions
are awarded in the amount of $523.30 based on one hour of attorney time billed
at $400.00 per hour and filing fees of $61.65 per motion. (Motions, Brooke Decl., ¶7.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Doris Anderson’s (1) Motion to
Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED. PLAINTIFF/CROSS-DEFENDANT SISI MISSY, INC. DBA CDP
CONSTRUCTION IS TO SERVE VERIFIED
RESPONSES TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS WITHOUT OBJECTIONS WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE
OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF/CROSS-DEFENDANT IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $523.30
TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
