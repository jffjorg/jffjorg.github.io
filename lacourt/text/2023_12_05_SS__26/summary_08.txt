And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for reconsideration of the judgment entered against them on October 3, 2011. The defendants, Eder Albert Martel and Guadalupe Clemente Ramirez, filed the motion on September 21, 2023, seeking to reconsider the judgment based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law. However, the court finds that the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 and lacks jurisdiction to reconsider the prior ruling. The court also finds that the defendants failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide the evidence earlier, which is a strict requirement of diligence. Therefore, the motion is denied.
