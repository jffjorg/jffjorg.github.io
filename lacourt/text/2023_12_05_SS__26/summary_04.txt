The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days of service of the order. The plaintiff is also ordered to pay sanctions of $523.30 to defense counsel within 20 days of service of the order. The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to timely respond to the discovery requests was a misuse of the discovery process, and that sanctions are appropriate under the California Code of Civil Procedure.
