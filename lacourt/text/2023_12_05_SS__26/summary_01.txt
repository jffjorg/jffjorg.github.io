And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion filed by Defendant Araksya Dulbenchyan to vacate the default and default judgment, if entered, and to quash service of the summons and complaint. The judge has denied the motion, finding that it is untimely and lacks sufficient evidence to support the claim of defective service. The judge has also denied the request to quash service of the summons and complaint.

The judge notes that the motion was filed more than six months after the entry of default, which is outside the time limit for seeking relief under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The judge also finds that the motion does not meet the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, subdivision (a), as it does not include an affidavit showing that the defendant did not receive actual notice of the action in time to defend.

The judge further notes that the defendant's declaration disputing service does not match the facts in the court's record, and that the court finds the plaintiff's declaration of service credible. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to vacate the default and default judgment, if entered, and the request to quash service of the summons and complaint.
