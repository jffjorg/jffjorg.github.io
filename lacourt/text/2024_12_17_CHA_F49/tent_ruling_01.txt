ANALYSIS
 
“Any party may obtain
discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to the action admit
the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of
fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for
admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the
parties.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.)  “Within 30 days after
service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed
shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a
copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared ....”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).) 
 
If a party to whom
requests for admissions is served fails to provide a timely response, the party
to whom the request was directed waives any objections, including one based on
privilege or the work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
The requesting party can move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (b).) The court shall issue this order unless the party to whom the
request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the
hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
A.   
Motion to
Deem Request for Admission, Set One, Admitted
 
Defendant’s counsel, Sunny Lee (“Lee”), attests that on
April 24, 2024, Siteone served its written discovery requests, including the
Request for Admission, Set One, on Defendant Calvin Alexander Kim (“Kim”). (Lee
Amended Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. “A.”) The deadline for Kim’s responses to the discovery
requests was due on May 29, 2024. (Ibid.) On June 6, 2024, Siteone’s
counsel contacted Kim’s counsel inquiring about the discovery responses and
extended the deadline to respond to June 30, 2024. (Id. ¶ 7.)  However, as of August 2, 2024, Siteone has
not received any responses from Defendant Kim. (Id. ¶ 10.)
 
Based on the above records, the
Court determines that Defendant Kim failed to serve a timely response, thereby waiving
any objection to the requests, including those based on privilege or the
protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2033.280, subdivision (a).
 
Nevertheless, under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), the court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
2033.230. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.
 
Here, Defendant Kim did not file an
Opposition to the Motion. Nor did he move separately for relief from the
waiver. Additionally, there is no record indicating any responses have been
subsequently served by Kim prior to the hearing. Consequently, the Court finds
that
relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS the unopposed Motion.
 
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or
attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for
admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).))
 
The Court finds that the mandatory
sanctions apply in this case. Utilizing the lodestar approach, the Court
determines the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs
incurred for the work performed in connection with the Motion to be $860.00,
calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $400.00 for two hours
reasonably spent, plus a $60.00 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Siteone
Landscape Supply LLC’s unopposed Motion for Request for Admission being Deemed
Admitted as to Defendant Calvin Alexander Kim is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff
Siteone Landscape Supply LLC’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN
PART. 
 
Defendant
Calvin Alexander Kim is ordered to pay $860.00 to Plaintiff’s attorney of
record within 20 days.
