AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
Walter Cuevas (“Cuevas”) 
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants/Cross-Complainants
Centurion Protection Services (“Centurion”) and Richard Ray Dudgeon (“Dudgeon”)
(collectively, “Cross-Complainants”)
 
The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers.   
 
BACKGROUND
This
action arises out of an employment relationship.  Cuevas’s first amended complaint (the “FAC”)
alleges: (1) Private Attorneys General Act; (2) failure to pay overtime wages
in violation of Labor Code section 510; (3) failure to reimburse and indemnify
for expenditures; (4) failure to provide meal and rest periods or compensation
in lieu thereof in violation of Labor Code section 226.7; (5) Labor Code
section 203 waiting time penalties; (6) Labor Code section 1198.5, subdivision
(k) penalty; (7) Labor Code section 226, subdivision (f) penalty; (8)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; (9) violation of Penal Code
section 637.7; and (10) negligent infliction of emotional distress.
 
Cross-Complainants’
second amended cross-complaint (the “SAXC”) alleges: (1) breach of contract;
(2) intentional interference with contractual relations; (3) intentional
interference with prospective economic relations; (4) intentional
misrepresentation; (5) defamation; and (6) libel.
 
On
July 18, 2023, Cuevas filed: (1) a motion to compel Dudgeon’s responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set 1 (the “Dudgeon SPROG Motion”); and (2) a motion
to compel Centurion’s responses to Special Interrogatories, Set 3 (the
“Centurion SPROG Motion”), and on July 25, 2023, Cuevas filed: (1) a motion to
compel Centurion’s compliance with its responses to Requests for Production,
Set Two (the “Centurion RFP Motion”).[1]
 
On September 8, 2023, Cuevas filed a
demurrer (the “Demurrer”) to the fifth and sixth causes of action on the
grounds that the SAXC fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of
action and is uncertain with respect to both claims.  On September 8, 2023, Cuevas also filed a
motion to strike the SAXC (the “MTS”).
 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Cross-Complainants’ Request
for Judicial Notice is GRANTED as to the existence of the documents, but not to
the truth of the matters asserted therein. 
(See Scott v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th
743, 752-54.)
 
DEMURRER
Meet and Confer
The meet and confer requirement has been met
for the Demurrer and MTS. 
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court
accepts as true all material factual allegations and affords them a liberal
construction, but it does not consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions,
speculation, or allegations contrary to law or judicially noticed facts.  (Shea
Homes Limited Partnership v. County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246,
1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the
complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the
facts pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  A demurrer will be sustained without leave to
amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  
 
Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and are
granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot
reasonably respond.  (Lickiss v.
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.)  A
demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in
some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.  (Chen v.
Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 811, 822.)
 
Defamation/Libel
The elements of a defamation claim are: (1) a
publication that is; (2) false; (3) defamatory; (4) unprivileged; and (5) has a
natural tendency to injure or causes special damage. (John Doe 2 v.
Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1300, 1312.)  The general rule is that the words constituting
an alleged libel must be specifically identified, if not pleaded verbatim, in
the complaint.  (Kahn v. Bower
(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1599, 1612, fn. 5.) 
If a reasonable reader would perceive a defamatory meaning without
extrinsic aid beyond his or her own intelligence and common sense, there is a
libel per se.  (Bartholomew v.
YouTube, LLC. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 1217, 1226.)  If the reader would be able to recognize a
defamatory meaning only by virtue of his or her knowledge of specific facts and
circumstances, extrinsic to the publication, which are not matters of common
knowledge rationally attributable to all reasonable persons, then the libel
cannot be libel per se but will be libel per quod.  (Id. at 1226-27.)
 
On October 10, 2023, the Court granted
Cuevas’s anti-SLAPP motion (the “anti-SLAPP Motion”) and struck paragraphs
numbers 16, 31, 39, 50, and 63 from the SAXC on the grounds that these
allegations concern statements made in connection with pending litigation.  The allegations targeted by the anti-SLAPP
Motion describe the same underlying conduct—that on August 24, 2022, Cuevas
sent the wife of Cross-Complainants’ client a text message in which he
referenced this litigation, stated that Cross-Complainants’ had put his family
in danger, and threatened to disclose the client’s personal information unless
the client met with Cuevas to discuss the litigation.  (See SAXC ¶ 16.)  
 
            The allegations that
were stricken from the SAXC form the crux of the fifth and sixth causes of
action.  Aside from these allegations,
the SAXC does not identify any specific allegedly false statements made by
Cuevas.  The Court therefore SUSTAINS the
Demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action with 20 days leave to amend.
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
Legal Standard
Under California Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 436, a motion to strike either: (1)
strikes any irrelevant, false or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or
(2) strikes any pleading or part thereof not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule or order of court.  (CCP § 436.)
 
The Motion seeks to
strike the entire SAXC on the grounds that it was not timely filed pursuant to
the Court’s July 31, 2023 order granting Cross-Complainants’ leave to file the
pleading, and also seeks to strike the prayer for attorney’s fees.
 
The Court observes
that Cross-Complainants’ initial attempt to timely file the SAXC was rejected
due to the document being mislabeled, and the pleading was officially filed on
August 8, 2023.  The Court exercises its
discretion and declines to strike the pleading based on its filing date.  (See Harlan v. Department of
Transportation (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 868, 873.)
 
The SAXC does not
state the basis for requesting attorney’s fees. 
The Court therefore GRANTS the MTS with respect to the prayer for
attorney’s fees with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
DISCOVERY MOTIONS
Under CCP section 2031.320, subdivision (a),
if a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling in accordance with that party's statement of compliance, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling compliance.  (CCP § 2031.320, subd. (a).)
 
            Under
CCP section 2030.290, subdivision (b), when a party directs interrogatories
towards a party and that party fails to serve a timely response, the party
propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to
the interrogatories.  (CCP § 2030.290, subd. (b).)  The moving party
need only show that the interrogatories were served on the opposing party, the
time has expired to respond to the interrogatories and no responses have been
served in order for the court to compel the opposing party to
respond.  (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902,
906.)  
 
Cross-Complainants do not dispute the
arguments set forth in the Discovery Motions. 
Instead, the Motions argue that discovery was stayed during the pendency
of the anti-SLAPP Motion.  (See CCP
§ 425.16, subd. (g).)  This argument is
not convincing, because Cross-Complainants’ failures to submit discovery
responses addressed in the Discovery Motions predate the filing of the
anti-SLAPP Motion, and any discovery stay is lifted in light of the resolution
of the anti-SLAPP Motion.  The Court
therefore GRANTS the Discovery Motions. 
Cross-Complainants are ordered to submit responses within 20 days of the
date of this order.[2]
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
