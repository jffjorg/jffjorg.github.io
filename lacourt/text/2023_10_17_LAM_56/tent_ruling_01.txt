  CASE NO.: 19STCV28385
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO VACATE JUDGMENT
 
Date: October 17, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Danny Navarro
(“Moving Defendant”)
 
            The Court has
considered the moving papers.  No
opposition papers were filed.  Any
opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine
court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure
(“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b). 
 
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiffs’
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) breach of implied warranty of
habitability; (2) breach of statutory warranty of habitability; (3) breach of
covenant of quiet enjoyment; (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress;
(5) nuisance; and (6) negligence. 
 
 
 
 
Moving Defendant
did not appear at the trial held on April 12, 2021, and on May 21, 2022, the
Court entered judgment (the “Judgment”) against him.  On March 22, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an
abstract of judgment (the “Abstract”).  
 
On September 21,
2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion to vacate the Judgment and strike the
Abstract pursuant to the Court’s equitable powers.
 
DISCUSSION
A final judgment
can be set aside upon a showing of extrinsic fraud or mistake.  (Kasperbauer v. Fairfield (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 229, 237.)  Equitable relief
from an order or judgment otherwise final may be granted on [he theory of
extrinsic mistake where the aggrieved party has been unable to make a case of
extrinsic fraud, but has shown excusable neglect, hardship or other grounds for
the failure to press a claim or defense. 
(Id.)  Among other things,
where a party has refrained from litigating a claim or defense in reliance on
some agreement or promise to act or refrain from acting, which promise is
subsequently breached, such reliance may establish a case of excusable
extrinsic mistake.  (Id.)  Extrinsic mistake occurs when circumstances
extrinsic to the litigation have unfairly cost a party a hearing on the
merits.  (Kramer v. Traditional
Escrow, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 13, 30.) 
In contrast with extrinsic fraud, extrinsic mistake exists when the
ground of relief is not so much the fraud or other misconduct of one of the
parties as it is the excusable neglect of the defaulting party to appear and
present his claim or defense.  (Id.)  If that neglect results in an unjust
judgment, without a fair adversary hearing, the basis for equitable relief on
the ground of extrinsic mistake is present. 
(Id.)  The positive
misconduct of a party’s attorney may support a finding of extrinsic
mistake.  (See, e.g., People v. One
Parcel of Land (1991) 335 Cal.App.3d 579, 584.)
 
In support of the Motion, Moving Defendant
provides evidence that the attorney he retained to represent him in this matter
misled him about the status of the proceedings. 
Moving Defendant regularly discussed this matter with Shawn Golan
(“Golan”), the attorney he retained on December 19, 2020, and believed that
Golan was properly handling his defense. 
(See Declaration of Danny Navarro (“Navarro Decl.”) ¶¶
10-13.)  Throughout their communications,
Golan failed to inform Moving Defendant of the April 12, 2021 trial date, and
Moving Defendant did not learn of the Judgment until he received a copy of the
Abstract in the mail on or about June 20, 2022. 
(Navarro Decl. ¶ 13.)  Moving
Defendant thereafter contacted Golan, who assured him that he would take
measures to vacate the Judgment.  (See
Navarro Decl. ¶¶ 14-18.) 
Golan’s active misrepresentations about his efforts to address the
Judgment and Abstract with the Court continued through August 2023.  (See Navarro Decl.
¶¶ 19-21.)  After Moving Defendant
had a representative attempt to visit Golan at his registered business address
on July 31, 2023, Golan contacted Moving Defendant to tell him to stop
contacting him.  (Navarro Decl. ¶ 20.)[1]  Moving Defendant thereafter retained his
current counsel on August 10, 2023. 
(Navarro Decl. ¶ 21.)  
 
The Court finds that the Motion presents
sufficient evidence that Moving Defendant’s failure to participate in this
litigation and present a defense is attributable to extrinsic mistake caused by
the ongoing assurances of his former counsel. 
For this reason and because it is unopposed, the Court GRANTS the
Motion.  The Court schedules a status
conference on December 7, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. in this department.
 
            Moving party is ordered
to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
