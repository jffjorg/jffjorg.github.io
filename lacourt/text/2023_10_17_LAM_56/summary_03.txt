And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motions filed by the parties, including a demurrer, a motion to strike, and discovery motions. The demurrer was filed by the plaintiff, Walter Cuevas, to the fifth and sixth causes of action of the cross-complaint filed by the defendants, Centurion Protection Services and Richard Ray Dudgeon. The Court sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.

The motion to strike was filed by the defendants to strike the entire cross-complaint on the grounds that it was not timely filed. The Court declined to strike the pleading based on its filing date and granted the motion to strike the prayer for attorney's fees with 20 days leave to amend.

The discovery motions were filed by the plaintiff to compel the defendants to submit responses to interrogatories and requests for production. The Court granted the discovery motions and ordered the defendants to submit responses within 20 days.

The Court also granted the anti-SLAPP motion filed by the plaintiff and struck certain allegations from the cross-complaint.

The parties are ordered to comply with the Court's ruling and are directed to submit any further pleadings or motions as necessary.
