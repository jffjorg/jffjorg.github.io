And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a personal injury case. The plaintiff, Jose B. Monge Chinchilla, was injured in a motor vehicle accident on June 28, 2022. The plaintiff has filed a complaint against the defendant, Logan Thomas Erautt, and his employer, Vance Corporation, alleging causes of action for motor vehicle negligence, general negligence, and negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle.

The plaintiff has filed four discovery motions, seeking to have requests for admission, interrogatories, and requests for production of documents deemed admitted or compelled. The defendant has served unverified responses to these discovery requests, which have not been verified as of the date of the hearing.

The court has denied the plaintiff's motions as moot, except for sanctions. The court has awarded sanctions in the reduced amount of $350.00 for each motion, to be paid within 30 days of the notice of ruling. The court has also ordered the defendant to verify his responses to the discovery requests.

The court's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.260, 2030.290, 2031.260, 2031.300, 2033.250, 2033.280, and 2033.280(c), which govern discovery and sanctions in civil cases. The court has considered the totality of the circumstances and has determined that the defendant's delay in verifying his responses was without substantial justification, and therefore sanctions are appropriate.
