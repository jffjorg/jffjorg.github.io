And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Jose Luis Alcaraz, the plaintiff. The demurrer is filed to the first four causes of action in the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Patricia B. Arrieta, the defendant. The first cause of action is for fraud, the second is for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the third is for partition of real property, and the fourth is for accounting.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action, finding that Arrieta has adequately pled the elements of each cause of action. The judge has also denied Alcaraz's motion to strike certain paragraphs of the First Amended Cross-Complaint, finding that Arrieta has pleaded the elements of fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress with sufficient particularity.

The parties are directed to review the Department H Case Management Conference Standing Order and to file and serve trial documents in accordance with that order. The case is set for a final status conference on December 9, 2024, and a court trial on December 16, 2024.
