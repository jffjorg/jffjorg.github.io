I.        Background 
Plaintiff Jose B. Monge Chinchilla
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that he sustained injuries and damages in a June 28, 2022
motor vehicle accident at or near the 60 Freeway and South Lemon Avenue in
Diamond Bar, California.
On September 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a complaint, asserting causes of action against Vance Corporation, Logan Thomas
Erautt (“Erautt”), and Does 1-100 for:
1.       Motor
Vehicle;
2.       General
Negligence; and
3.       Negligent
Entrustment of a Motor Vehicle. 
Pending before the Court are four
discovery motions, where Plaintiff seeks (1) to have requests for admissions
deemed admitted and (2) to compel responses to interrogatories and requests for
production of documents. 
In support of Plaintiff’s motions, Plaintiff’s
counsel Nikta Yazdi (“Yazdi”) represents as follows:
Plaintiff
served the subject discovery on November 3, 2023. (Yazdi Decl., ¶ 7, Exh. 1.) Yazdi’s office subsequently granted four
separate discovery extension requests from Erautt’s counsel, up to January 23,
2024. (Id., ¶¶ 9-12, Exhs. 2-5.) On January 22, 2024, Erautt served
unverified responses. (Id., ¶ 13, Exh. 6.) As of the date of the filing
of the motions, Erautt’s counsel has not provided verification for the subject
discovery, despite Yazdi’s requests. (Id., ¶¶ 14-16, Exhs. 7-9.) 
Erautt, in turn, represents that the motion is moot because
he provided a verification for the subject discovery as of August 28, 2024.
Based on the above
representation made by Erautt and for the reasons stated herein, the motions are denied as moot, except as to sanctions,
which are granted in the reduced amount of $350 per motion.[FN1]
 
II.      Legal Standard
Responses
to requests for admission, interrogatories, and requests for production of
documents are due 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.250, subd.
(a), 2030.260, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a).) If
timely responses are not served, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling responses or deeming matters admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2033.280, subd. (b), 2030.290, subd. (b), 2031.300,
subd. (b).)
As
to requests for admissions, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction . . . on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated [a] motion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
As to interrogatories and requests for production of
documents, “[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories [or a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
III.     Discussion
A.       Motion for Requests for Admissions To Be Deemed
Admitted
Plaintiff moves the Court for an order deeming the truth of the matters asserted in Plaintiff’s
Requests for Admission, Set No. One admitted against Erautt. Plaintiff also seeks
monetary sanctions against Erautt and his attorneys of record, jointly and
severally, in the amount of $1,430.00.
In light of
Erautt’s representation that a verification was provided on August 28, 2024,
the Court denies the motion as moot, except as to sanctions. Because
verification was not provided until after Plaintiff filed the motion and
because the Court finds that there was no substantial justification for the
delay, the Court determines that sanctions are appropriate.
Plaintiff seeks
sanctions in the amount of $1,430.00 [calculated
as follows: 2 hours preparing motion, plus 0.6 hours attending hearing at
$550.00/hour]. Utilizing a Lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of
the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with
the instant motion is $350.00 (i.e., 1 hour at $350.00/hour). Sanctions are payable within 30 days from the date of the notice of ruling.

 
B.       Motion to Compel Verified Responses to Form Interrogatories
Plaintiff moves the Court for an order compelling
Erautt’s verified responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff
also seeks monetary sanctions against Erautt only in the amount of $1,430.00.
In light of Erautt’s representation that a
verification was provided on August 28, 2024, the Court denies the motion as
moot, except as to sanctions. Because verification was not provided until after
Plaintiff filed the motion and because the Court finds that there was no
substantial justification for the delay, the Court determines that sanctions
are appropriate.
Plaintiff seeks
sanctions in the amount of $1,430.00 [calculated
as follows: 2 hours
preparing motion, plus 0.6 hours attending hearing at $550.00/hour]. Based on
the analysis set forth above in connection with the first motion, sanctions are
reduced to $350.00 and are payable within 30 days from the date of the notice
of ruling.

to Compel Verified Responses to Special Interrogatories

In light of Erautt’s representation that a
verification was provided on August 28, 2024, the Court denies the motion as
moot, except as to sanctions. Because verification was not provided until after

reduced to $350.00 and are payable within 30 days from the date of the notice
of ruling.
