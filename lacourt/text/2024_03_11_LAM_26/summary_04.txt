This tentative ruling is about a case management conference that has been continued to May 2, 2024, at 8:30 am. The Plaintiff's Counsel has failed to file proof of service of the summons and complaint for all defendants, including Daniel O'Connor. As a result, the court has ordered Plaintiff's Counsel to appear at the next hearing and explain why sanctions, including monetary sanctions of at least $500 and/or dismissal, should not be imposed. Plaintiff's Counsel is also required to file a declaration explaining the failure to file proof of service and any efforts made to serve the summons and complaint on the unserved defendants. If proof of service is not filed by the next hearing, the court will consider imposing sanctions or dismissing the case. Additionally, failure of the Plaintiff to appear at the next hearing will be deemed as consent to dismiss the entire case.
