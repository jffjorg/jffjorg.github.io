This tentative ruling is issued by the Judge regarding a petition hearing scheduled for March 11, 2024. The Petitioner has failed to provide identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for the Court to run a criminal history assessment. The Judge orders the Petitioner to provide identification through one of three options: providing a California driver's license number or California ID number, providing a driver's license number or DMV-issued ID number from another state, or contacting the Name Change Clerk to obtain fingerprints for a California Record Review Live Scan. The petition is continued to April 29, 2024, at 9:30 am to enable the Petitioner to comply with these instructions. If the Petitioner fails to provide sufficient information for a criminal history assessment prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice. The Court Clerk is instructed to give notice of this ruling.
