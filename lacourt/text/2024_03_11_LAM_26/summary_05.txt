The Counsel is also ordered to file a declaration explaining the failure to file proofs of service and any efforts undertaken to attempt service. If proof of service has not been filed, the Counsel will face sanctions, including monetary sanctions of at least $500 and/or dismissal.

Additionally, the Counsel is ordered to appear on the same date to explain their failure to cause entry of default as to all served defendants who have not responded, including Heritage Enterprises Inc and Jairo International LLC. If defaults have not been entered, the Counsel will face similar sanctions. The Case Management Conference is continued to April 18, 2024, at 8:30 am. Failure of the Counsel to appear at the next hearing will be deemed consent to dismiss the entire case.
