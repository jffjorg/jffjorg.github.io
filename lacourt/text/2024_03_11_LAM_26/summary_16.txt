And here is the English-text summary:

In a tentative ruling, the judge orders the Petitioner to provide identification verified by fingerprint to enable the Court to run a criminal history assessment. The Petitioner failed to provide identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for the assessment. The judge gives the Petitioner three options to provide the necessary identification: providing a California driver license number or California ID number, providing a driver license number or DMV-issued ID number from another state, or contacting the Name Change Clerk for instructions on how to have fingerprints taken for a California Record Review Live Scan. The Petitioner is ordered to pursue one of these options and provide the necessary information by the next hearing date, which is set for April 29, 2024 at 9:30 am. If the Petitioner fails to provide sufficient information, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice. The Court Clerk is ordered to give notice to the Petitioner of these instructions and deadlines.
