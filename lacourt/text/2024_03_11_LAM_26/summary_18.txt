The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition. The petitioner has failed to provide identification tied to a fingerprint, which is necessary for a criminal history assessment. The court has instructed the petitioner to provide identification through one of three options: providing a California driver's license number or California ID number, providing a driver's license number or DMV-issued ID number from another state, or contacting the Name Change Clerk for instructions on how to obtain fingerprints for a California Record Review Live Scan. The petition has been continued to April 29, 2024, to enable the petitioner to pursue one of these options. If the petitioner fails to provide sufficient information prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice.
