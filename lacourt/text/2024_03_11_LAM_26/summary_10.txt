And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Petitioner has failed to provide any form of identification tied to a fingerprint on file, which is necessary for Probation/the Court to run a criminal history assessment. The Court is ordering the Petitioner to provide some form of identification verified by a fingerprint to enable Probation/the Court to run the assessment. The Petitioner can do this by one of three options: providing a California driver license number or California ID number, providing a driver license number or DMV-issued ID number from another state, or contacting the Name Change Clerk to obtain instructions on how to have fingerprints taken for a California Record Review Live Scan. The petition is continued to April 29, 2024, at 9:30 am to enable the Petitioner to pursue one of these options. If the Petitioner fails to follow these instructions and provide sufficient information prior to the next hearing date, the petition will be denied and dismissed without prejudice. The Court Clerk is ordered to give notice.
