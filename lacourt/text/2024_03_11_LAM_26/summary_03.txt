And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling denies the petition without prejudice. The petitioner failed to provide identification tied to a fingerprint, which is necessary for probation to run a criminal history assessment. Despite the court's previous order on January 29, 2024, the petitioner did not provide the required identification. The court will not proceed with the petition until the petitioner provides the necessary identification.
