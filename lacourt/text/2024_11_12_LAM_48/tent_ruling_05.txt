  CASE NO.: 23STCV06597
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO TAX COSTS
  
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
November 12, 2024



 
On September 12, 2024, the Court
entered judgment in favor of Plaintiffs Jennifer Getz and Kay Tornborg, in their
capacities as the Co-Administrators of the Estate of George P. Abrahams, and against
Defendant Benjamin Goldwasser.
On
September 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum of costs.
On
October 17, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to tax costs.  Defendant asks the Court to strike or to reduce
Plaintiffs’ requested costs that were incurred after Defendant made a section 998
statutory offer to compromise on March 22, 2023.
If
a plaintiff rejects a defendant’s settlement offer under Code of Civil Procedure
section 998 and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment, the plaintiff
may not recover his post-offer costs and must pay the defendant’s costs from the
time of the offer.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 998,
subd. (c)(1).)
Defendant’s
998 offer was for a total sum of $13,500.00, with each party to bear their own costs
and attorney fees.  (Pongracz Decl., Ex. A.)  Defendant argues that the 998 offer far exceeds
the value of Plaintiffs’ judgment because they did not receive any monetary award
and the Court found that the cost of removing the encroaching fence and wall was
$3,425.00.  (Motion at p. 4.)
Plaintiffs
argue that the monetary value of what they received by way of the judgment is more
favorable than the 998 offer, and they did not seek an away of monetary damages.  (Opposition at p. 2.)  The Court’s judgment ordered (1) Plaintiffs were
as of the date the complaint was filed in this action the owners of the residential
property; (2) Defendant has no easement, equitable or otherwise, over any part of
Plaintiffs’ property; (3) the location of the properties’ boundaries is established
through specific surveys; (4) the wood fence and garden walls encroach on Plaintiffs’
property; (5) Defendant must remove the encroachments at his own cost and restore
possession to Plaintiffs; and (6) Defendant shall refrain from interfering with
Plaintiffs’ right of possession of the property.  The Court deemed Plaintiffs the prevailing parties
entitled to costs.
When
a 998 offer contains only a monetary offer but the relief recovered is both monetary
and nonmonetary, the trial court must consider the offer in light of the totality
of the recovery.  (Arias v. Katella Townhouse
Homeowners Assn., Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 847, 856.)  The Court may put a monetary value on the injunctive
relief.  (Ibid.)
Defendant
contends that the value of the judgment is $3,425.00, the cost for demolishing the
fence and walls.  (Reply at p. 2.)  But Plaintiffs did not obtain only the removal
of the encroachments.  Plaintiffs obtained
a judgment ordering that they are the owners of the property, Defendant has no easement,
and Defendant may not interfere with Plaintiffs’ right of possession.  The monetary value of this relief is the value
of the property that Defendant was wrongfully encroaching upon.  During trial, Defendant’s appraiser testified
that the reasonable value of a permanent easement on the property was $13,500.00.  (Final Statement of Decision at p. 12.)
Plaintiffs
calculate their preoffer costs to be $9,867.95. 
(Gottesman Decl. ¶ 6.)  This amount
must be added to the amount of the 998 offer, resulting in a total of $23,367.95.  (See Martinez v. Eatlite One, Inc. (2018)
27 Cal.App.5th 1181, 1184 [“By specifying postoffer costs are excluded for
purposes of determining whether plaintiff obtained a more favorable judgment, the
statute necessarily implies preoffer costs are included.”].)
The
$13,500.00 offer with each side bearing their own costs is less favorable than the
value of Plaintiffs’ actual award (property valued at $13,500.00) plus their preoffer
costs.
The
motion to tax costs is DENIED.  Plaintiffs
shall recover $21,696.02 in costs from Defendant, pursuant to their memorandum of
costs.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
