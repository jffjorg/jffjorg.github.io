And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Benjamin Goldwasser's motion to tax costs. The motion was filed after the Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiffs Jennifer Getz and Kay Tornborg, who are the Co-Administrators of the Estate of George P. Abrahams. The Plaintiffs had rejected a section 998 offer of $13,500.00 made by the Defendant on March 22, 2023. The Court held that the value of the judgment, which includes the Plaintiffs' ownership of the property and the Defendant's obligation to remove encroaching fences and walls, is more favorable than the 998 offer. Therefore, the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their preoffer costs of $9,867.95, which brings the total to $23,367.95. The Court awarded the Plaintiffs $21,696.02 in costs from the Defendant.
