And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Defendant FCA US LLC's motion to bifurcate the trial into liability and punitive damages phases. The court has also ordered that evidence of Defendant's profits or financial condition may not be admitted until after the trier of fact finds that Defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. Punitive damages can only be recovered if Plaintiffs prove by clear and convincing evidence that Defendant was guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. The motion to bifurcate punitive damages is granted, and the court will not allow evidence of Defendant's profits or financial condition to be introduced until after the trier of fact finds that Defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud.
