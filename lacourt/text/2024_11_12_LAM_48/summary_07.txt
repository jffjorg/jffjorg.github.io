The judge found that Plaintiff did not make a reasonable effort to meet and confer with Defendant's counsel before filing the motion, as required by law. The judge also noted that Plaintiff's counsel did not respond to Defendant's family law counsel's email informing them of the contempt proceedings and did not attempt to negotiate or resolve the issue informally. The judge ruled that the motion to compel deposition is denied.
