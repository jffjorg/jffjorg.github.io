Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is a partial grant of APPA's motion to expunge or reduce Zwick's mechanic's lien. The lien, which was filed in the amount of $7,008,704.52, is excessive and unreasonable. The Court finds that Zwick did not establish the probable validity of its claim by a preponderance of the evidence. The Court reduces the lien to $784,545.57, which is the maximum amount that Zwick is entitled to based on the evidence presented. The Court also orders Zwick to give notice of the reduced lien amount.

The Court's decision is based on its review of the evidence presented, including the parties' filings and declarations. The Court finds that Zwick's lien is excessive because it includes amounts that are not supported by evidence and are not reasonable. The Court also finds that Zwick did not establish the probable validity of its claim by a preponderance of the evidence, as required by law.

The Court's decision is consistent with California law, which provides that a claimant must establish the probable validity of its claim by a preponderance of the evidence in order to maintain a mechanic's lien. The Court also finds that the reduction of the lien to $784,545.57 is appropriate, as it is the maximum amount that Zwick is entitled to based on the evidence presented.
