[1] Zwick
argues that Lambert is distinguishable and outdated.  (Opposition at pp. 7-11.)  Zwick focuses in part on amendments to Civil
Code section 3123, which added the language currently in Civil Code section
8430, subdivision (c).  (Id. at
pp. 8-9.)  Lambert remains binding
on this Court and was not superseded or overruled by the Civil Code amendments.  Nevertheless, the Court does not further cite
Lambert.
