The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorney fees and costs filed by Massachusetts Bay Insurance Company (Defendant) in a lawsuit against FEI Enterprises, Inc., Gabriel Fedida, and Esther Fedida (Plaintiffs).

The judge has also denied some of the Defendant's claims, including its request for additional costs and fees incurred during the appeals. The judge has reduced the amount of attorney fees and costs awarded to the Defendant due to excessive billing by its counsel.

The judge has also addressed several procedural issues, including the timeliness of the Defendant's motion for attorney fees and the necessity of apportioning fees between causes of action. The judge has granted the Defendant's request for judicial notice of documents filed during the appeals and has denied the Plaintiffs' objections to various declarations filed by the Defendant's counsel.
