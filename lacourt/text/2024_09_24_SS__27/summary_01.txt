And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the petition to approve a minor's compromise. The petition is denied due to several deficiencies. The claimant and the guardian ad litem are excused from personal appearance, and counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call. The court has identified several issues with the petition, including contradicting information in Items 10a and 10b, incomplete information in Item 10c, and missing attachments. The court has ordered the petitioner to correct these deficiencies no later than 5 days before the new court date. Failure to do so may result in sanctions. The court has set a new court date for a non-appearance case review on a future date, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
