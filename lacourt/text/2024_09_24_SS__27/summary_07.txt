And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Uber's motion for a protective order in part. The motion was filed to protect Uber's trade secrets related to its relationships with third-party drivers and the utilization of its software application. The judge found that Uber has demonstrated that the information sought by the plaintiff is trade secrets and that the plaintiff's discovery requests would require the disclosure of such information. The judge modified the scope of the protective order to cover only the relationship between Uber and its third-party drivers, as well as how Uber's third-party drivers are able to access and use Uber's software application. The judge also declined to impose a protective order concerning Defendant Mack's alleged private information.
