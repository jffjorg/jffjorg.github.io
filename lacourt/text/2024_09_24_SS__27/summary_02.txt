And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to continue the trial date. The plaintiff, Deeanne Linsmaier, is seeking to continue the trial date to allow for a hearing on her new motion for summary adjudication, which focuses on the elements of negligence. The defendant, Wail Bushara, opposes the continuance, arguing that the plaintiff's new motion is barred by the previously denied motion for summary adjudication.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's new motion is separate and distinct from the earlier issue of contributory negligence defense, and that the defense of comparative negligence is not relevant to the court's adjudication of the elements of negligence.

The judge also notes that the defendant has not provided any legal authority for the court to deny the continuance based on the grounds that the plaintiff's motion is barred by the previously denied motion for summary adjudication. The judge finds that numerous courts of appeal have held that a trial court cannot refuse to consider a motion for summary judgment that is timely filed.

The judge concludes that the motion to continue the trial date is timely and that the court will discuss scheduling with the parties to determine a date for the hearing on the motion for summary adjudication that does not require a change in the trial date.
