Chu and Esther Pang

Ruling: MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS IS GRANTED.
 
Background
On December 14, 2023,
Defendants Jack Chu and Esther Pang served Plaintiff with their Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One) and a Request for Production
of Documents (Set One). On March 28, 2024, Defendants propounded Requests for
Admissions (Set One) on Plaintiff.
Plaintiff was
previously represented by Edward M. Morgan of Downtown L.A. Law Group, but the
Court granted his withdrawal on March 28, 2024.
Plaintiff did not serve
discovery responses to Defendants' first set of discovery requests, and as a
result, Defendants moved the court to compel initial responses. On June 6,
2024, the Court heard Defendants’ motion to deem RFAs admitted. Plaintiff did not
file an opposition or appear at the hearing. The Court granted Defendants'
motion and deemed the contents of Defendants' RFA, Set One, admitted, and
ordered Plaintiff to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,320 by June 26, 2024. On
July 17, 2024, the Court heard Defendants’ Motions to Compel Plaintiff’s
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for
Production of Documents (Set One). Plaintiff did not file an opposition or
appear at the hearing. The Court granted Defendants’ Motions and ordered
Plaintiff to provide the discovery responses and pay sanctions in the amount of
$2,000 to Defendants by August 17, 2024.
To date, Plaintiff has
not provided responses to any of the discovery requests nor paid any of the
sanctions. Defendants now move the court for terminating sanctions.
Legal Standard¿ 
¿¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030
gives the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process. Misuse of the discovery process includes
failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court
order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) A
court may impose terminating sanctions by striking pleadings of the party
engaged in misuse of discovery or entering default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.030, subd. (d).) A violation of a discovery order is sufficient for the
imposition of terminating sanctions. Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.¿ 
¿ 
A court
should consider the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful, the detriment to the
propounding party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) If a
lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a greater sanction is warranted. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) However, “the
unsuccessful imposition of a lesser sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to
the utilization of the ultimate sanction.” (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d
at p. 787.) Before any sanctions may be imposed the court must make an express
finding that there has been a willful failure of the party to serve the
required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966)
246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may be deemed willful where the
party understood its obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to
comply. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v.
Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.)
The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the burden of
showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at
p. 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250;
Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.) 
 
Discussion 
 
The Court finds a history of discovery abuse in this case. Plaintiff
consistently failed to provide the requested discovery responses at multiple
stages throughout the litigation, prompting the filing of several motions to
compel. Despite the Court granting these motions, Plaintiff continued to
neglect his obligations by neither serving the discovery requests nor paying
the court-ordered sanctions. The Court deems Plaintiff’s repeated
non-compliance as willful. Plaintiff did not file an opposition contesting the
present motion nor present any argument demonstrating how his failure to comply
was not willful.
 
Furthermore, based on Plaintiff’s conduct leading up to this
motion, including his failure to oppose and appear at the hearings for the
discovery motions, and his failure to file an opposition to the present motion
for terminating sanctions, it appears to the Court that Plaintiff has abandoned
his case. A lesser sanction would not likely curb further discovery abuses.
Therefore, the Court grants Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions.
