And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel initial responses from the defendant, Scott Equipment Inc. The defendant failed to provide responses to the plaintiffs' discovery requests, which were due on June 11, 2024. Despite this, the defendant did not request an extension or file an opposition to the motion. The court has ordered the defendant to provide complete and verified responses to the requests for production, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories without objections within 20 days.

The judge has also denied the plaintiffs' motion to deem the contents of their requests for admissions admitted. The defendant's defense counsel represented that both defendants, Western Rental and Scott Equipment, had served responses to the requests for admissions, which was confirmed by the plaintiffs' counsel.

The judge has imposed sanctions on the defendant in the amount of $1500 for failing to act with substantial justification. The sanctions are payable to the plaintiffs within 20 days. The parties have been notified that if they do not submit to the tentative ruling, they should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
