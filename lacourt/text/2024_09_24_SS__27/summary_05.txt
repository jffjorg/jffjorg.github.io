And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel initial responses from Defendant Scott Equipment Inc. The defendant failed to provide any responses to the discovery requests, which were due on June 11, 2024. The judge has ordered the defendant to provide complete and verified responses to the requests within 20 days. The judge has also granted the motion to compel initial responses from Defendant Western Rental, as defense counsel represented that both defendants had served responses to the Requests for Admissions.

The judge has denied the motion to deem the contents of the Requests for Admissions, Set One, admitted, as the defense counsel's representation was confirmed by the plaintiffs' counsel.

The judge has imposed sanctions on the defendant in the amount of $1500, payable to the plaintiffs within 20 days, for failing to provide discovery responses. The defendant and its attorney are jointly and severally liable for the sanctions.
