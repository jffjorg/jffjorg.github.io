Judge Hon. Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Luisa Bonilla, et al. vs City of Los Angeles, et al. (Case Number: 23STCV15297). The judge has decided to deny the petition to approve the minor's compromise due to several deficiencies in the petition. Specifically, the judge has identified contradictions in Item 10a and 10b of the petition, a lack of information in Item 10c, and a failure to submit the Proposed Order and Order to Deposit Money into Blocked Account using the required forms (Form MC-351 and Form MC-355). The judge has ordered the petitioner to correct these deficiencies no later than 5 days prior to the new court date set for October 31st, 2024. Failure to do so may result in sanctions. The court has also set a non-appearance case review for October 31st, 2024, at 4:00 PM in Department 27, and ordered the moving party to give notice.
