```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for terminating sanctions brought by defendants Jack Chu and Esther Pang against plaintiff Miguel Montes. The judge finds that plaintiff has consistently failed to provide discovery responses to defendants' requests, prompting the filing of several motions to compel. Despite the court granting these motions, plaintiff continued to neglect his obligations by neither serving the discovery requests nor paying the court-ordered sanctions. The judge deems plaintiff's repeated non-compliance as willful. The judge also finds that plaintiff has abandoned his case and that a lesser sanction would not likely curb further discovery abuses. Therefore, the judge grants the motion for terminating sanctions.
