And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Plaintiff's motion to quash the subpoena in part, limiting the scope of the subpoena for Plaintiff's insurance, medical, and billing records. The Court has ordered that the records be limited to those reflecting or relating to treatments for back pain, ankle pain, knee pain, body soreness, anxiety, insomnia, and depression from ten (10) years prior to the date of the subject incident to the present. The Court has also ordered that billing records be limited to records from the time of the incident and to bills for treatments for back pain, ankle pain, knee pain, body soreness, anxiety, insomnia, and depression.

The Court has declined to issue sanctions under the circumstances, as it granted the Plaintiff's motion only in part, and the parties had a legitimate dispute regarding the scope of the subpoena. The Court finds that both parties have acted with substantial justification.

The Court's ruling is based on the principle of balancing the interests between the right of civil litigants to discover relevant facts and the right of an individual to maintain reasonable privacy. The Court has evaluated the relevance of the requested documents and has determined that the requested records are directly relevant to the issues of ongoing litigation and necessary for the fair resolution of the lawsuit.
