Relevant Procedural History
On March 18, 2014, Plaintiff Mendez amended the complaint to correct a
typographical error naming her “Eneida Mendez” instead of “Eneyda Mendez.”
That same day, the Court entered judgment in this action after a court
trial, finding for Plaintiff Mendez as against Defendants Rodolfo and Sylvia
Ruiz, dba Rancho Plaza Carniceria, in the amount of $28,339.73.
On March 20, 2014, the Clerk gave notice of entry of judgment.
On July 8, 2014, the Court entered an amended judgment in the amount of
$56,167.54.
On July 14, 2014, the Clerk gave notice of entry of amended judgment.
On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff Mendez filed an application for renewal
of judgment in the amount of $119,447.47.
On November 28, 2023, the Clerk noticed a renewal of judgment.
On December 4, 2024, Plaintiff Mendez filed an application for writ of
execution on the money judgment.
On December 5, 2023, the Clerk issued the writ.
On February 2, 2024, Plaintiff Mendez filed an abstract of judgment.
That same day, the Clerk issued the abstract.
Motion Before the Court
Prior to the issuance of the abstract of judgment, on January 19, 2024,
Defendant Sylvia Ruiz noticed a claim of exemption seeking the release of unspecified
property levied from her Bank of America account(s).
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff Mendez filed a notice of hearing on claim
of exemption.
That same day, Plaintiff Mendez filed a notice of opposition to claim of
exemption.
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff
Mendez filed a motion for order determining claim of exemption, which
identified the levied property as an unspecified number of dollars held in
Sylvia Ruiz’s Bank of America account(s).
Defendant Sylvia Ruiz’s claim of
exemption is now before the Court.
 
Claim of Exemption

Legal Standard
Except as otherwise provided by
law, all property of the judgment debtor is subject to enforcement of a money
judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 695.010, subd. (a).) After entry of a money
judgment other than those arising from the Family Code (subject to additional
requirements), and upon application of the judgment creditor, the clerk of the
court shall issue a writ of execution, which must be directed to the levying
officer in the county where the levy is to be made and to any registered
process server. (Code Civ. Proc., § 699.510.)
Property that has been levied upon
may be claimed to be exempt as provided in Code of Civil Procedure sections
703.510 to 703.610 unless otherwise provided by statute. (Code Civ. Proc., §
703.510, subd. (a); see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 703.510-703.610 [Enforcement of
Money Judgments, Exemptions, Procedure for Claiming Exemptions After Levy].)
The debtor must make the claim
within 15 days of the date the notice of levy on the property was served (20
days if the notice of levy was served by mail). (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.520,
subd. (a).)
The claim must be executed under
oath and include the name and mailing address of the claimant, a description of
the property claimed to be exempt, a financial statement as required by section
703.530, a citation of the statute on which the claim is based, and a statement
of facts necessary to support the claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.520, subd.
(b).) A financial statement is required where property is claimed as exempt
pursuant to a provision exempting property to the extent necessary for the
support of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment
debtor. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.530, subd. (a).) The financial statement must
be executed under oath by the judgment debtor and the debtor’s spouse unless
the same are living separate and apart, and must include:
(1) The name of the spouse of the
judgment debtor;
(2) The name, age, and relationship
of all persons dependent upon the judgment debtor or the spouse of the judgment
debtor for support;
(3) All sources and the amounts of
earnings and other income of the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents
of the judgment debtor;
(4) A list of the assets of the
judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor and the
value of such assets; and
(5) All outstanding obligations of
the judgment debtor and the spouse and dependents of the judgment debtor. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 703.530, subds.
(b)(1)-(5), (c).)
 The hearing on the motion shall be held not
later than 30 days from the date the notice of motion was filed with the court
unless continued by the court for good cause. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.570,
subd. (a).)
The claim of exemption is deemed
controverted by the notice of opposition to the claim of exemption and both
shall be received in evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.580, subd. (c).) If no
other evidence is offered, the court, if satisfied that sufficient facts are
shown by the claim of exemption (including the financial statement if one is
required) and the notice of opposition, may make its determination thereon.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 703.580, subd. (c).) If not satisfied, the court shall
order the hearing continued for the production of other evidence, oral or
documentary. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.580, subd. (c).)
At the hearing on the claim of
exception, the claimant has the burden of proof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.580,
subd. (b).)
Order Granting Claim of
Exemption: DENIED.
Here, after review, the Court
DENIES the claim of exemption.
First, the Court notes that the
levying officer—the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (see Notice of
Hearing on Claim of Exemption, p. 1, § 1)—has not filed the papers related to
the claim of exemption with the Court, as required by Code of Civil Procedure
section 699.510. However, the Court can proceed with its discussion based on
Plaintiff Mendez’s attachment of those documents. (Mendez Mot., Ortiz Decl.,
Ex. A.)
Second, the Court notes that the
motion filed by Plaintiff Mendez seeking a determination on the claim of
exemption was served on Defendant Sylvia Ruiz. (Mendez Mot., Proof of Service.)
Third, the Court notes that the
claim of exemption is not supported by any attachments or supporting evidence,
instead arguing in full that the levied monies are needed for “living expenses”
and protected under Code of Civil Procedure sections “704.070,” “706.050,” and
“706.051.” (Mendez Mot., Ortiz Decl., Ex. A, EJ-160, p. 1, §§ 4-5.)
Fourth, the Court determines that
relief is not available here because no financial statement supports the claim
of exemption, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 703.530,
subdivision (a).
Last, the Court agrees with
Plaintiff Ruiz that the claim of exemption does not state proper statutory
authority. Section 704.070 simply defines paid earnings for exemption purposes,
and subdivision (b)(2) does not apply to the facts here. Section 706.051 only
details the definition for family of a judgment debtor, and clarifies
circumstances where relief is not available. Section 706.050 is applicable
insofar as it touches upon disposable earnings as exempt property, but the
claim of exemption—unsupported by any attachments—does not properly support
relief pursuant to this statutory section.
Defendant Sylvia Ruiz’s claim is
thus DENIED. 
Conclusion
Defendant Sylvia Ruiz’s Claim of Exemption is DENIED.
