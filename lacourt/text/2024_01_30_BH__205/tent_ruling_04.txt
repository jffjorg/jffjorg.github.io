Case Number: 23SMCV04600   Hearing Date: January 30, 2024     Dept: 205   Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  LEWIS LINSWEILER,     Plaintiff, v.  MICHAEL SARLO AND LORY SARLO as Trustees of the ATLANTIS TRUST dated November 8, 2007, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV04600     Hearing Date:  January 30, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANTS MICHAEL SARLO AND    LORY SARLO’S DEMURRER AND    MOTION TO STRIKE COMPLAINT    This case arises from alleged violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (“UCRA”).  Plaintiff Lewis Linsweiler requires a wheelchair or walker for mobility.  Plaintiff visited Detour Bistro and Bar (the “Business”), which is owned and operated by Defendants Michael and Lory Sarlo as trustees of the Atlantis Trust dated November 8, 2007.  Plaintiff alleges the Business’s parking lot was not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (“ADAAG”).   This hearing is on Defendants’ demurrer and motion to strike the Complaint.  Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5 requires that before the filing of a demurrer or motion to strike, the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer or motion to strike for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer or motion to strike.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a), 435.5(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(2), 435.5(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41(a)(3), 435.5(a)(3).)   Defendants submit the Declaration of Graham Ulyshen, which fails to show the parties met and conferred by phone or in person.  The declaration only avers that defense counsel “spoke with” counsel for Plaintiff.  There is also no indication that these conversations were at least five days before the date the demurrer and motion to strike were filed.  Also, the Declaration references an “Exhibit 1,” which presumably documents the parties’ meet and confer efforts, but there is no such exhibit attached.  There is also no statement that the parties’ meet and confer encompassed all of the grounds asserted in the demurrer and motion to strike.   For the foregoing reasons, the Court continues the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike to February 20, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  Defendants are ordered to submit a declaration in compliance with Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5.      IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: January 30, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B. Moreton, Jr. Judge of the Superior Court
