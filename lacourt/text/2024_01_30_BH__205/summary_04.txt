Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge rules that the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike the Complaint will be continued to February 20, 2024. The Defendants, Michael and Lory Sarlo, are ordered to submit a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts with the Plaintiff, Lewis Linsweiler, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.41 and 435.5. The Judge finds that the Defendants' declaration fails to show that they met and conferred with the Plaintiff, and therefore, the hearing is continued to allow for the submission of a compliant declaration.
