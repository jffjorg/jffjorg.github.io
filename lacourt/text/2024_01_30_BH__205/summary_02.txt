And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to vacate the default and judgment entered against the defendants, Khosrow Shoumer and Fariba Shoumer, individually and as trustees of the Shoumer Trust. The ruling is based on the defendants' declarations that they did not receive actual notice of the action until November 21, 2023, and they were not seeking to avoid service. The Judge credits the defendants' declarations and finds that the policy favoring resolution of actions on their merits supports granting the motion.

The Judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendants, as the plaintiff has not filed any declaration supporting her claim that the defendants were attempting to avoid service.

Furthermore, the Judge will not deem the defendants' proposed answer as filed and will allow the plaintiff to amend her complaint as of right. The Judge sets a case management conference for March 12, 2024, and orders the plaintiff to file her amended complaint within 10 days.
