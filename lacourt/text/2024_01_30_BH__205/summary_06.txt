Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer hearing for the case between Yasam Legacy, LLC (the landlord) and Gayle Hooks, et al. (the defendants). The landlord claims that the defendants breached their responsible person agreement and lease agreements, and that they made misrepresentations about their units and rents. The defendants argue that the landlord's claims are insufficiently pled and that the landlord failed to meet the specificity requirements for pleading fraud.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action for breach of lease agreement against Christopher Hooks, finding that the landlord has sufficiently alleged the existence of a lease agreement with Christopher.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, finding that the landlord's claim is already "completely covered by contract" and that there can be no implied covenant.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for intentional misrepresentation, finding that the landlord has failed to allege the claim with the required specificity.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for conversion, finding that the landlord has failed to plead the claim with particularity and that the allegations are conclusory.

The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days' leave to amend its complaint to cure the defects identified in the demurrer.
