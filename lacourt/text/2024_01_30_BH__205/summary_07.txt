And here is the summary in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiffs' motions to continue the hearing on the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion and demurrer, and to permit limited discovery on their habitability claims. The judge finds that the plaintiffs lack good cause to continue the hearing, as they have failed to show that they cannot prepare an opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion within the statutorily mandated timeframe. The judge also finds that the limited discovery sought by the plaintiffs is irrelevant to the resolution of the anti-SLAPP motion, which is based on litigation privilege and can be resolved on the pleadings alone. The judge concludes that the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion should be heard within 30 days, as required by law, and that the demurrer should be heard within 35 days of filing or the first date available to the court thereafter.
