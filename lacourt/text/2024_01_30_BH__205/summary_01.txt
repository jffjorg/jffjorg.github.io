And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the request for default judgment against Francesco Romano, Cross-Defendant, in the case of Frances Diaz v. Robert Cundall. The case involves a financial elder abuse claim, where Romano is alleged to have failed to pay rent and taken money from Robert Cundall without authorization. The Court found that Cross-Complainant has properly complied with the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment, including providing evidence of damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. The Court also noted that the relief requested in the complaint is more complicated, requiring the exercise of judgment to ascertain the damages, and therefore, the Court must affirmatively establish entitlement to the specific judgment requested. The Court granted the request for default judgment against Romano, ordering default judgment in the amount of $215,174.50, which includes damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.
