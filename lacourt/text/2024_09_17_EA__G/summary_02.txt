Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted MMA's motion for attorney fees and costs in the reduced amount of $5,246.00 against Bently Real Estate LLC and $72.90 against Diamond City Shopping Center, LLC and Bently Real Estate LLC. The motion was filed to recover attorney fees and costs incurred in opposing Diamond City and Bently's motion to vacate the entry of default and default judgment. The judge found that MMA was the prevailing party in the motion and that the requested attorney fees and costs were reasonable. However, the judge reduced the amount of attorney fees awarded to MMA due to excessive time requested for drafting the present motion. The judge also denied MMA's request for attorney fees and costs against Diamond City, as Diamond City was not a party to the architectural services agreement.
