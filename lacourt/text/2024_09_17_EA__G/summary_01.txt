And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion to file a late expert designation. The Plaintiff, Janelle Josie Venegas, was involved in a motor vehicle collision in April 2021 and alleges that the Defendant, Yolanda Catalina Cuevas, was negligent. The Plaintiff filed a complaint and cross-complaint against the Defendant, but dismissed Felipe Cuevas, a co-defendant, from the action. The Plaintiff seeks to file a late expert designation, citing exceptional circumstances, but the Court finds that the justification provided is not sufficient. The Court notes that being in trial and failing to calendar a deadline do not constitute exceptional circumstances, and even if they did, the Plaintiff's counsel failed to explain how this resulted in the untimely filing of the motion. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's counsel failed to justify the untimely filing of the motion and that the provision under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 is inapplicable.
