 Case Number:  23PSCV01334    Hearing Date:   September 17, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff MMA’s Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs Respondent: Defendants Diamond  City Shopping Center, LLC and Bently Real Estate LLC TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff MMA’s Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs is  GRANTED in the reduced amount of $5,246.00 in attorney fees against Defendant Bently  Real Estate LLC and $72.90 in costs against Defendants Diamond City Shopping  Center, LLC and Bently Real Estate LLC. BACKGROUND This is a breach of contract  action arising from an architectural services agreement. In July 2020,  Plaintiff MMA and Defendant Bently Real Estate LLC (Bently) entered into an  agreement in which MMA agreed to provide architectural services to Bently for the  development of a commercial property in West Covina. Subsequently, MMA alleges  Bently began to fall behind on payments for MMA’s services. In January 2023,  MMA terminated the agreement as a result of Bently’s alleged failure to make  payments. On February 1, 2023, MMA recorded a mechanic’s lien against the West  Covina property which is allegedly owned by Defendant Diamond City Shopping  Center, LLC (Diamond City). On May 2, 2023, MMA filed a  complaint against Diamond City, Bently, and Does 1-10, alleging the following  causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) foreclosure of mechanic’s lien on  real property, and (3) promissory estoppel. On October 19, 2023, the court  entered default against Diamond City and Bently after they failed to timely  file an answer. On December 5, 2023, the court granted default judgment for MMA  against Diamond City and Bently. On June 12, 2024, the court denied a motion by  Diamond City and Bently to vacate the entry of default and default judgment. On August 12, 2024, MMA filed  the present motion. A hearing on the present motion is set for September 17,  2024. ANALYSIS MMA  moves for an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs against Diamond City  and Bently. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS MMA’s motion. Legal Standard “Except  as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and  mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the  agreement, express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or  proceedings are entitled to their costs . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1021.)  The prevailing party on a contract which specifically provides for attorney  fees and costs incurred to enforce the agreement is entitled to reasonable  attorney fees in addition to other costs.  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a); Code  Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).)  The court, upon notice and  motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an  element of the costs of suit, the reasonable attorney fees.  (Civ. Code, § 1717,  subd. (a), (b).) “The  amount to be awarded to a party as attorney fees is a matter within the sound  discretion of the trial judge.” (Contractors Labor Pool, Inc. v. Westway  Contractors, Inc. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 152, 168.) In determining the  reasonableness of an attorney fees award, the court considers “the nature,  difficulty, intricacy and importance of the litigation, the amount involved,  the skill required and success of the attorney's efforts, his or her learning,  age and experience, and the time consumed.” (Id., at p. 169.) Discussion As  an initial matter, the court notes Diamond City and Bently have filed an  untimely opposition and declaration in support of their opposition on September  10, 2024. But as defaulted defendants, they are prohibited from taking  “affirmative steps such as filing a pleading or motion” until the entry of  default is set aside. (Sporn v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126  Cal.App.4th 1294, 1301; see Bailey v. Citibank, N.A. (2021) 66  Cal.App.5th 335, 347 [“The entry of a defendant's default cuts off the  defendant's right to file pleadings and motions (other than a motion to set  aside default under § 473), and it also cuts off the defendant's right to  notices and the service of pleadings or papers.”].) Thus, the court declines to  consider any arguments or evidence raised in their untimely opposition. In  this case, MMA seeks attorney fees and costs incurred in opposing Diamond City  and Bently’s motion to vacate the entry of default and default judgment. The  recovery of attorney fees and costs is allowed by paragraph X of the  architectural services agreement between MMA and Bently. (Lee Decl., Ex. 1, ¶  X.) MMA fails to point to any authority, however, that permits recover attorney  fees and costs against Diamond City as Diamond City was not a party to the architectural  services agreement, which was only signed by Bently. Further,  while MMA pursued causes of action for breach of contract and promissory  estoppel against Bently, the only cause of action alleged against Diamond City was  foreclosure of a mechanic’s lien which does not provide for attorney fees. (Abbett  Electric Corp. v. California Fed. Savings & Loan Assn. (1991) 230  Cal.App.3d 355, 358 [“Attorney's fees are not available to a prevailing  litigant absent a contractual agreement or statutory authorization, and no  statute provides for attorney's fees in mechanic's lien foreclosures.”].) Thus,  MMA may only seek an award of attorney fees against Bently. Here,  MMA has established they were the prevailing party in opposing Diamond City and  Bently’s motion to vacate the entry of default and default judgment since the  court denied the motion. MMA seeks an award of $8,944.40 in attorney fees for 8.7  hours of drafting the opposition and attending the hearing for the motion to  vacate, 4.1 hours drafting the present motion, 3.0 hours drafting a reply to  Diamond City and Bently’s opposition, and 1.0 hour attending the hearing on the  present motion at an hourly rate of $430.00. (Lee Decl., ¶ 2-4.) Based  on the experience of MMA’s counsel and in the court’s own experience, the court  finds an hourly rate of $430.00 to be reasonable. (Lee Decl., ¶ 2.) While the  court finds the request of 8.7 hours to reasonable, the court finds the time  requested for the drafting the present motion to be excessive and accordingly  reduces the requested time to 2.0 hours for drafting the present motion, 1.0  hour for drafting a reply, and 0.5 hours for attending the hearing on the  present motion. Thus, the total amount of attorney fees awarded is $5,246.00  for 12.2 hours at an hourly rate of $430.00. MMA  also requests costs in the amount of $155.09, including $16.74 in mailing costs  for service of the opposition, $82.19 in legal research costs, $19.71 in  e-filing costs for the opposition, $16.74 in mailing costs for the present  motion, and $19.71 in e-filing costs for the present motion. Because legal  research costs are not recoverable, the court reduces the amount of awarded  costs to $72.90. (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19  Cal.App.4th 761, 776 [“Fees for legal research, computer or otherwise, may not  be recovered under [Code of Civil Procedure] section 1033.5.”].) Accordingly,  the court GRANTS MMA’s motion. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, MMA’s  motion for attorney fees and costs is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $5,246.00  in attorney fees against Bently and $72.90 in costs against Diamond City and  Bently.
