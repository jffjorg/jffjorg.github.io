And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a deposition notice and for a protective order filed by Defendant Aurora Las Encinas LLC. The motion seeks to prevent the production of documents and testimony related to Defendant's knowledge of a patient's violent behavior and the patient's admission to Defendant's facility. The Judge has denied the motion in part, allowing Plaintiffs to question Defendant's person most knowledgeable (PMK) about the patient's admission, room placement, and Defendant's knowledge of the patient's violent behavior. The Judge has also allowed Plaintiffs to inquire about Defendant's contractual and financial relationship with the County of Los Angeles and the production of documents and communications related to that relationship. The Judge has denied the request to subpoena encrypted emails between Defendant and the County, stating that Defendant did not object on the grounds that producing those emails would be unduly burdensome or expensive to un-encrypt them. The Judge has set a hearing date of October 4, 2024, and has instructed parties who intend to submit on the tentative to send an email to the Court indicating their intention to do so.
