Legal Standard
 
Standard for Demurrer – A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn v.¿Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.
App. 4th 740, 747.) ¿When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context.¿ (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power¿(2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.)¿ In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.¿ (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.30(a).)¿A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.¿ (SKF Farms v.
Superior Court¿(1984) 153 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)¿ Therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.¿¿(Ibid.)¿¿The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn,¿supra,¿147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A general demurrer admits the truth of all
factual, material allegations properly pled in the challenged pleading,
regardless of possible difficulties of proof.¿¿(Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿ Thus, no matter how unlikely or improbable,
plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling on
the demurrer.¿¿(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.¿(1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)¿ Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations
expressing mere conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits
to the complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.¿¿(Vance
v. Villa Park¿Mobilehome¿Estates¿(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.)¿A general
demurrer does not admit contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the complaint; facts impossible in law; or allegations contrary to
facts of which a court may take judicial notice.¿¿(Blank,¿supra,
39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Pursuant to¿Code Civ. Proc.¿§430.10(e), the
party against whom a complaint has been filed may object by demurrer to the
pleading on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.¿ It is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer
without leave to amend if there is a reasonable probability that the defect can
be cured by amendment.¿¿(Schifando¿v. City of Los Angeles¿(2003) 31
Cal.4th 1074, 1082,¿as modified (Dec. 23, 2003).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿

Meet and Confer Requirement–
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to strike, the demurring or moving party
is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred
to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purposes of
determining whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended
pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and 435.5.) Defense counsel Valeria Granata
(“Granata”)’s declaration it appears that this requirement has been met.

Discussion
 
Application – 
 
i.       Demurrer
 
a.    
First Cause of Action (Motor Vehicle)
 
Martinez argues that Plaintiff’s
Complaint fails to allege facts that support the First Cause of Action as it is
a form complaint and there is no attachment for the First Cause of Action and
no supporting facts, directing the parties and the Court to page four of the
Complaint. Martinez next argues that because there is no attachment, the First
Cause of Action is uncertain. 
 
Plaintiff argues that he has used
a judicial counsel form which simplified the art of pleading and properly
completed judicial council form complaints are legally sufficient to state a
cause of action. Plaintiff contends that his form for the First Cause of Action
is filled properly as it apprises Martinez of the essential elements for the
claim.
 
In Reply, Martinez argues that
there is no attachment to the Motor Vehicle Negligence cause of action, so
there is no supporting facts.
 
The Court is not swayed by
Martinez’s arguments. First, the form for the First Cause of Action is approved
for optional use by the Judicial Council of California and it is filled out.
(See Complaint at p. 4.) The Court is unsure as to what attachment Martinez
seeks as this is the proper attachment for a motor vehicle cause of action. The
Court directs the parties to People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation v.
Superior Court (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1480 (“People ex rel. Dept. of Transportation”)
for a discussion of form complaints in a demurrer setting. People ex rel.
Dept. of Transportation holds that while sometimes merely checking a box on
a Judicial Council form Complaint is sufficient, other times it is not. (Id.
at 1486.)
 
In this case, there is generally
a motor vehicle attachment, filled by the boxes, and a general negligence where
the general negligence cause of action has more alleged facts. This is a common
practice and is what is presented at issue for this Demurrer. Another legal
standard that the Court must bring to the parties’ attention is that the Court
is “not bound by the captions or labels of a cause of action in a pleading and
the nature and character of a pleading is to be determined from the facts
alleged, not the name given by the pleader to the cause of action.  Thus, regardless of whether the complaint
gives the causes of action. . .it is the facts behind the label which govern
the nature and character of the primary right sued upon.” (Ananda Church of
Self-Realization v. Massachusetts Bay Insurance (2002) 95 Cal. App. 4th
1273, 1281.)
 
Here, the General Negligence
cause of action provides the necessary alleged facts. That is, the elements for
motor vehicle negligence are the same as those for general negligence and in
the First Cause of Action, Plaintiff alleges that the acts of Defendants were
negligent and the proximate cause of injuries and, should Martinez have any
inquiry as to what he has to answer to, all elements (duty, breach, and
causation) are laid out in the Second Cause of Action (General Negligence).
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer to the
First Cause of Action is OVERRULED. 
 
b.    
Third Cause of Action (Willful Misconduct)
 
Martinez argues that the Third
Cause of Action fails because it is not an independent tort, but rather an
aggravated form of negligence, differing in quality rather than degree from
ordinary lack of care, with pleading requirements similar to negligence but
stricter. That is, a plaintiff must establish (1) actual or constructive
knowledge of the peril to be apprehended, (2) actual or constructive knowledge
that injury is a probable, as opposed to a possible, result of the danger, and
(3) conscious failure to act to avoid the peril. Martinez presents that
Plaintiff’s Third Cause of Action is duplicative of the Second Cause of Action
(Negligence) and, as such, the same factual predicate cannot give rise to two
independent obligations to exercise due car. Martinez further presents that
Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to contain allegations as to the heightened form of
negligence. 
 
Plaintiff argues that Martinez
misstates the laws surrounding a willful misconduct cause of action as
California courts recognize willful misconduct and have called it by other
names such as “gross negligence” and “recklessness.” Plaintiff argues that his
Complaint outlines the misconduct – (1) Martinez had actual knowledge of the
peril by knowingly consuming alcohol to the point of intoxication before
operating a vehicle, a clear recognition of the danger of driving under the
influence; (2) Martinez had constructive knowledge that injury
was not only possible but
probable, as intoxicated driving significantly increases the likelihood of
causing an accident; and (3) Martinez consciously failed to act to avoid peril
by choosing to drive in a state of intoxication, directly leading to the collision
and Plaintiff’s resulting injuries. Plaintiff contends that Martinez did not
address the elements of willful misconduct and instead only focuses on claiming
that the Third Cause of Action is a duplicative cause of action so that the
Demurrer will be sustained and impact the Motion to Strike. 
 
In Reply, Martinez argues that
Plaintiff is wrong and willful misconduct is a heightened form of negligence
only. Martinez directs the parties and the Court to Mercer-Fraser Co. v.
Industrial Acci. Com. (1953) 40 Cal.2d 102 (“Mercer-Fraser Co. v.
Industrial Acci. Com”), citing that there is no separate tort for willful
misconduct. 
 
While Martinez cites to Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518; Snider v. Whitson (1960) 184
Cal.App.2d 211; Simmons v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1976) 62
Cal.App.3d 341; and other cases to support the argument that willful misconduct
is not an independent tort, Martinez concedes that willful misconduct has a
different pleading standard from ordinary negligence. Further, Martinez’s
citation to Mercer-Fraser Co. v. Industrial Acci. Com. appears to
distinguish negligence from willful misconduct:
 
The courts of this
state have frequently had occasion to discuss and to define the terms
"negligence," "wilful misconduct," and "serious and
wilful misconduct," and to emphasize the basic and substantial differences
between negligence and wilful misconduct. For guidance in stating
comprehensively the elements which must control the Industrial Accident
Commission and the courts in applying the pertinent statutes to the facts of
particular cases  we have reviewed the
decisions in all related types of cases which have come to our attention. We
bear in mind that the discussions and definitions in the respective cases
ordinarily relate primarily to the term or terms as used in the particular
statute with which the court was then concerned and that, for example, it is
not necessarily true that "wilful misconduct" under the automobile
guest statute ( Veh. Code, § 403) has been unvaryingly regarded as being
precisely the same as "serious and wilful misconduct" under the Labor
Code (§ 4553.) But the discussions and definitions evolved in cases considering
these several statutes and related statutes or common law principles are
helpful in determining what the Legislature must have meant in phrasing the
statute in question.
 
Thus, in Donnelly
v. Southern Pac. Co. (1941), 18 Cal.2d 863 [118 P.2d 465], this court in
defining what is meant by "willful and wanton negligence" as that
phrase has been used by the federal courts, declared (pp. 869-870):
 
"Negligence is
an unintentional tort, a failure to exercise the degree of care in a given
situation that a reasonable man under similar circumstances would exercise to
protect others from harm. (Rest. Torts, secs. 282, 283, 284; Prosser, Torts,
secs. 30 et seq.) A negligent person has no desire to cause the harm that
results from his carelessness, (Rest. Torts, sec. 282(c)), and he must be
distinguished from a person guilty of willful misconduct, such as assault and
battery, who intends to cause harm. (Prosser, Torts, p. 261.) Willfulness and
negligence are contradictory terms. . . . [Citations.] If conduct is negligent,
it is not willful; if it is willful, it is not negligent. It is frequently
difficult, however, to characterize conduct as willful or negligent. A tort
having some of the characteristics of both negligence and willfulness occurs
when a person with no intent to cause harm intentionally performs an act so
unreasonable and dangerous that he knows, or should know, it is highly probable
that harm will result. (Rest. Torts, sec. 500 et seq.; Prosser, Torts, pp. 260,
261.) Such a tort has been labeled 'willful negligence,' 'wanton and willful
negligence,' 'wanton and willful misconduct,' and even 'gross negligence.' It
is most accurately designated as wanton and reckless misconduct. It involves no
intention, as does willful misconduct, to do harm, and it differs from
negligence in that it does involve an intention to perform an act that the
actor knows, or should know, will very probably cause harm. . . . [Citations.]
Wanton and reckless misconduct is more closely akin to willful misconduct than
to negligence, and it has most of the legal consequences of willful
misconduct."
 
And as appears from Porter
v. Hofman (1938), 12 Cal.2d 445, 447-448 [85 P.2d 447] (a case involving
the term "wilful misconduct" as used in the so-called guest statute,
Veh. Code, § 403), and cases there cited, this court has approved the following
definitions: "Wilful misconduct . . . necessarily involves deliberate,
intentional, or wanton conduct in doing or omitting to perform acts, with
knowledge or appreciation of the fact, on the part of the culpable person, that
danger is likely to result therefrom."
 
"Wilfulness
necessarily involves the performance of a deliberate or intentional act or
omission regardless of the consequences."
 
"'Wilful
misconduct' means something different from and more than negligence, however
gross. The term 'serious and wilful misconduct' is described . . . as being
something 'much more than mere negligence, or even gross or culpable
negligence' and as involving 'conduct of a quasi criminal nature, the
intentional doing of something either with the knowledge that it is likely to
result in serious injury, or with a wanton and reckless disregard of its
possible consequences' . . . The mere failure to perform a statutory duty is
not, alone, wilful misconduct. It amounts only to simple negligence. To
constitute 'wilful misconduct' there must be actual knowledge, or that which in
the law is esteemed to be the equivalent of actual knowledge, of the peril to
be apprehended from the failure to act, coupled with a conscious failure to act
to the end of averting injury. . . ." Substantially the same principles
are stated in Helme v. Great Western Milling Co. (1919), 43 Cal.App.
416, 421 [185 P. 510]; in James I. Barnes etc. Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com.
(1944), 65 Cal.App.2d 249, 254 [150 P.2d 527]; in Parsons v. Fuller (1937), 8
Cal.2d 463, 468 [66 P.2d 430]; and in Cope v. Davison (1947), 30 Cal.2d
193, 198 [180 P.2d 873, 171 A.L.R. 965]; see, also, North Pac. S. S. Co. v.
Industrial Acc. Com. (1917), 174 Cal. 500, 502 [163 P. 910]; Ethel D.
Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com. (1934), 219 Cal. 699, 704 [28 P.2d 919]; Hargrave
v. Industrial Acc. Com. (1940), 5 Cal. Comp. Cases 129.
 
In Meek v. Fowler
(1935), 3 Cal.2d 420, 425-426 [45 P.2d 194] (a case also involving the
so-called guest statute, and quoting in part from Howard v. Howard
(1933), 132 Cal.App. 124, 128 [22 P.2d 279] [guest statute]; see, also, Weber
v. Pinyan (1937), 9 Cal.2d 226, 230-235 [70 P.2d 183, 112 A.L.R. 407]
[guest statute]), the pertinent principles are discussed as follows:
"While the line between gross negligence and wilful misconduct may not
always be easy to draw, a distinction appears . . . in that gross negligence is
merely such a lack of care as may be presumed to indicate a passive and
indifferent attitude toward results, while wilful misconduct involves a more
positive intent actually to harm another or to do an act with a positive,
active and absolute disregard of its consequences. It seems clear that in
excluding all forms of negligence as a basis for recovery in a guest case, the
legislature must have intended that to permit a recovery in such a case the
thing done by a defendant must amount to misconduct as distinguished from
negligence and that this misconduct must be wilful. While the word 'wilful'
implies an intent, the intention referred to relates to the misconduct and not
merely to the fact that some act was intentionally done. In ordinary negligence,
and presumably more so in gross negligence, the element of intent to do the act
is present and any negligence might be termed misconduct. But wilful misconduct
as used in this statute means neither the sort of misconduct involved in any
negligence nor the mere intent to do the act which constitutes negligence.
Wilful misconduct implies at least the intentional doing of something either
with a knowledge that serious injury is a probable (as distinguished from a
possible) result, or the intentional doing of an act with a wanton and reckless
disregard of its possible result.
 
"Such intent
and knowledge of probable injury may not be inferred from the facts in every
case showing an act or omission constituting negligence for, if this were true,
any set of facts sufficient to sustain a finding of negligence would likewise be
sufficient to sustain a finding of wilful misconduct. As has been repeatedly
declared, '"wilful misconduct" means something more than negligence
-- more, even, than gross negligence.' [Citations.]" Manifestly, serious
and wilful misconduct" cannot be established by showing acts any less
culpable, any less deliberate, or any less knowing or intentional, than is
required to prove wilful misconduct.
 
(Mercer-Fraser Co. v.
Industrial Acci. Com., supra, 40 Cal.2d 102, 116-18.)
 
An informative case not cited by
Martinez is Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993) 6 Cal.4th
965 (“Potter”), a California Supreme Court case. In Potter, the
California Supreme Court provided the following:
 
Among the existing
tort categories, liability for maliciously induced fear of cancer fits most
comfortably within the tort of willful misconduct. This is "a tort
separate and distinct from negligence and involves different principles of
liability and different defenses." (Palazzi v. Air Cargo Terminals,
Inc. (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 190, 195 [52 Cal.Rptr. 817]; see Shepardson
v. McLellan (1963) 59 Cal.2d 83, 89 [27 Cal.Rptr. 884, 378 P.2d 108]; Savage
v. Van Marle (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 241, 245 [114 Cal.Rptr. 51].)
"[W]illful misconduct implies the intentional doing of something either
with knowledge, express or implied, that serious injury is a probable, as
distinguished from a possible, result, or the intentional doing of an act with
a wanton and reckless disregard of its consequences." (Williams v. Carr
(1968) 68 Cal.2d 579, 584 [68 Cal.Rptr. 305, 440 P.2d 505]; see also Goncalves
v. Los Banos Mining Co. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 916, 918 [26 Cal.Rptr. 769, 376
P.2d 833]; Bastian v. County of San Luis Obispo (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d
520, 533 [245 Cal.Rptr. 78]; Prosser & Keeton on Torts (5th ed. 1984) § 34,
pp. 212-214.) Willful misconduct, like negligence, is subject to the rule of
comparative fault. (Southern Pac. Transportation Co. v. State of California
(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 116, 121 [171 Cal.Rptr. 187]; Sorensen v. Allred
(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 717, 725 [169 Cal.Rptr. 441, 10 A.L.R.4th 937].)
 
Justice Traynor,
writing for a majority of this court, has explained that "[n]egligence is
an unintentional tort, a failure to exercise the degree of care in a given
situation that a reasonable [person] under similar circumstances would exercise
to protect others from harm." (Donnelly v. Southern Pacific Co. (1941)
18 Cal.2d 863, 869 [118 P.2d 465].) "A negligent person," in other
words, "has no desire to cause the harm that results from his [or her]
carelessness . . . ." (Ibid.) By contrast, an act performed with an
intent to cause harm is termed "willful." "Willfulness and
negligence are contradictory terms. . . . If conduct is negligent, it is not
willful; if it is willful, it is not negligent." (Ibid., citations
omitted; accord, Lambreton v. Industrial Acc. Com. (1956) 46 Cal.2d 498,
503 [297 P.2d 9]; Tognazzini v. Freeman (1912) 18 Cal.App. 468, 473-474
[123 P. 540]; see also ArvinKern Co. v. B. J. Service, Inc. (1960) 178
Cal.App.2d 783, 792 [3 Cal.Rptr. 238].)
 
Between these two
clearly distinguishable forms of behavior--negligence and willfulness--we find
what is now generally known as willful misconduct. Justice Traynor described
the tort this way: "A tort having some of the characteristics of both
negligence and willfulness occurs when a person with no intent to cause harm
intentionally performs an act so unreasonable and dangerous that he [or she]
knows, or should know, it is highly probable that harm will result. . . . Such
a tort has been labeled 'willful negligence,' 'wanton and willful negligence,'
'wanton and willful misconduct,' and even 'gross negligence.' It is most
accurately designated as wanton and reckless misconduct. It involves no
intention . . . to do harm, and it differs from negligence in that it does
involve an intention to perform an act that the actor knows, or should know,
will very probably cause harm." (Donnelly v. Southern Pacific Co., supra,
18 Cal.2d 863, 869, citations omitted.)
 
 This description of willful misconduct
corresponds closely to the majority's description of behavior for which
fear-of-cancer damages are recoverable absent both physical injury and a
probability that cancer will result. The majority explains that "fear of
cancer damages may be recovered without demonstrating that cancer is probable
where it is shown that the defendant is guilty of 'despicable conduct which is
carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.' (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1) [defining one
type of 'malice'].) 'A person acts with conscious disregard of the rights or
safety of others when [he] [she] is aware of the probable dangerous
consequences of [his] [her] conduct and willfully and deliberately fails to
avoid those consequences.' (BAJI No. 14.71 (1992 rev.) (7th ed. pocket pt.)
[defining 'malice'].)" (Maj. opn., ante, p. 998; see also, Taylor v.
Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 895-896 [157 Cal.Rptr. 693, 598 P.2d
854].) 3
 
 Thus, the tort of willful misconduct seems to
me an appropriate home for the liability that the court today recognizes for
malicious contamination of a substance or substances likely to be consumed by
others. Certainly, the tort of willful misconduct would be a more appropriate
home than the tort of negligence. But there is another possibility worthy of
mention.
 
(Id. at 1016-18.)
 
While the underlying facts of Potter
are different from the case at hand, the gravamen of the cited portion of the
opinion is that the California Supreme Court has held that willful misconduct
is a tort separate and distinct from negligence. The California Supreme Court's
opinions “… are binding upon and must be followed by all state courts of
California.” (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d
450, 45.) As such, the Court allows the Third Cause of Action. 
 
The Court then turns to the
elements required for willful misconduct. Both parties agree that following
elements must be alleged: (1) actual or constructive knowledge of the peril to
be apprehended, (2) actual or constructive knowledge that injury is a probable,
as opposed to a possible, result of the danger, and (3) conscious failure to
act to avoid the peril. (See Motion at 9[1]:9-14
[citing Berkley v. Dowds, supra, 152 Cal. App.4th 518]; see also
Opposition at 6:9-12 [citing New v. Consolidated Rock Products Co.
(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d. 681, 689-690].) The Court applies this standard as it is
the correct legal standard for willful misconduct as held by the California
Appellate Courts. 
 
Here, as pled, (1) Martinez’s “acts
and omissions were done with the knowledge and/or notice that driving a vehicle
under the influence could, likely would, and in fact did cause injury, damages,
and harm to others, including Plaintiff” (Complaint at p. 6); and (2) “Martinez
voluntarily consumed alcoholic beverages to the point of intoxication knowing
full well from the outset that he must thereafter drive a motor vehicle” (ibid.).
A further alleged fact to support these allegations is Martinez’s own concession
that he was drinking and driving upon his arrest. (See ibid.) It appears
that, while Plaintiff has pled that Martinez had knowledge Martinez had actual
knowledge that injury could occur while driving a vehicle under the influence
and Martinez consciously failed to act to avoid the peril, there are no
allegations as to whether Martinez knew that injury was probable. Plaintiff’s
argument regarding Martinez’s knowledge of probable injury is: “Second,
Defendant Martinez had constructive knowledge that injury was not only possible
but probable, as intoxicated driving significantly increases the likelihood of
causing an accident.” (Opposition 6:27-7:1.) However, this is not alleged in
the Complaint. (See Complaint at p. 6 [wording used by Plaintiff in Opposition
not found in Complaint].) The gravamen of the allegations of the Complaint, as
related to Martinez, is that Martinez knew that driving drunk was unsafe and
could pose a danger to the public, Martinez drove knowing that he was unfit to
operate a motor vehicle, and Martinez caused Plaintiff’s injuries. This is the
argument that was relied upon in Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24
Cal.3d 890 (“Taylor”) for punitive damages under Cal. Civ. Code § 3294.
The standard under Taylor for punitive damages is the same as what this
Court must review for the determination of the second element of willful
misconduct: “the plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the
probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he wilfully and
deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” (Taylor, supra,
24 Cal.3d at 895-96.) The California Supreme Court held that, “[o]ne who
voluntarily commences, and thereafter continues, to consume alcoholic beverages
to the point of intoxication, knowing from the outset that he must thereafter
operate a motor vehicle demonstrates, such a conscious and deliberate disregard
of the interests of others that his conduct may be called wilful or wanton[]”
and that met the standard for punitive damages. (Id. at 899.) Because
the probable standard was used in Taylor and the California Supreme Court held
that one who shows a conscious and deliberate disregard of others meets such a
standard, the Court finds that the pleadings are sufficient. 
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer to the
Third Cause of Action is OVERRULED.
 
ii.    
Motion to Strike
 
The Motion to Strike seeks to
strike references to punitive damages on the basis that the Third Cause of
Action (Willful Misconduct) is not a cause of action, and punitive damages
cannot be asserted in negligence-based claims. Martinez argues that the
Complaint contains no allegations of fraud, oppression, and/or malice against
him.
 
This argument necessarily fails
for reasons discussed, ante, in the Third Cause of Action (Willful
Misconduct.) For any further clarification, the Court directs Martinez to Taylor
in which it was held punitive damages can be awarded in a drunk driving case.
(Discussed ante [see discussion on Taylor holding].) 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to Strike
is DENIED.

Conclusion
 
Defendant Richard Michael
Martinez’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.
