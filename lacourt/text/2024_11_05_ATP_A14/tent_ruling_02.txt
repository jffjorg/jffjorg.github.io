Martinez’s Demurrer does not include consecutive page numbers. After page 3,
the end of the notice, Martinez’s Demurrer contains a “1” as a page number for
all other pages. The Court counts the first page of the Demurrer as page one
and addresses the page by the consecutive Arabic numeral related to the page
that contains the citation.
