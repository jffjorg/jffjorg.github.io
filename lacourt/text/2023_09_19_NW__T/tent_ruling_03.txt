 Case Number:  23VECV00789    Hearing Date:   September 19, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECV00789 Eddy v Altamura
Tentative ruling: Grant motion for protective order as to taking of the deposition of the minor Sebastian Eddy.  Given the testimony about their involvement, the court does not find that these depositions will be unduly burdensome except perhaps as to cost.  However, if the depositions seek to obtain personal information about the deponents unrelated to the case, or are burdensome or harassing, or seek the sexual or romantic history of the plaintiff, then plaintiff may adjourn the deposition to obtain a further protective order.  These deponents are not parties to this case and have privacy rights that need to be respected. The court is also concerned about the cost of the depositions requested which could be fairly substantial in relation to the value of the case.  It would be helpful to find out what a copy of 1 hour depo might cost if a copy is requested on a non-expedited basis, and what are the medicals claimed by plaintiff. Finally, the court is unclear about conversations about the decision to hire an attorney.  If this is being requested, why?
