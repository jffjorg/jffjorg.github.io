And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion for a protective order to prevent the deposition of minor Sebastian Eddy. The Judge grants the motion, but with some conditions. The Judge believes that the deposition will not be unduly burdensome, except for the cost, which may be substantial. However, if the deposition seeks personal information unrelated to the case, is burdensome or harassing, or seeks the sexual or romantic history of the plaintiff, the Judge will allow the plaintiff to adjourn the deposition and request further protection. The Judge is also concerned about the cost of the depositions and requests more information about the medical claims made by the plaintiff. Finally, the Judge is unclear about the conversation surrounding the decision to hire an attorney and requests more information about this.
