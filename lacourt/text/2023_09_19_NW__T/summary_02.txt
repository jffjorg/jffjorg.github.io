**Text Summary**

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by defendants Jake & Nina Bruck, Bruck & Marko, Jake & Nina Bruck Trust, and Marko Family Trust against plaintiff Darhooneh Construction Inc. 

The court found that the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract (first, second, and third causes of action), common count (fourth cause of action), and  Penal Code section 496 damages (seventh cause of action) are sufficiently alleged. However, the fifth cause of action for fraud requires further amendment to meet specific fact pleading requirements.

The sixth cause of action for conversion was dismissed without leave to amend because the plaintiff failed to adequately differentiate the money owed from the contract damages. 

The court emphasized the importance of properly identifying trusts and their trustees in legal proceedings.

And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Jake & Nina Bruck Trust, Marko Family Trust, and Marko. The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the sixth cause of action for conversion, without leave to amend. The judge has also sustained the demurrer as to the fifth cause of action for fraud, with 20 days' leave to amend. The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the first cause of action for breach of contract and the second cause of action for mechanic's lien foreclosure. The judge has also overruled the demurrer as to the fourth cause of action for common count/quantum meruit and the seventh cause of action for penalty damages. The judge has granted the plaintiff, Darhooneh Construction Inc., 20 days' leave to amend the fifth and sixth causes of action. The judge has also limited the plaintiff's leave to cure the pleading defects identified in the ruling, but not to add new causes of action.

The judge's ruling is based on the allegations made in the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges two separate contracts with the defendants, as well as allegations of breach of contract, mechanic's lien foreclosure, fraud, conversion, and penalty damages. The judge has determined that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the elements of each cause of action, except for the fifth cause of action for fraud, which lacks specific factual allegations.

The demurrer is overruled as to all else. Plaintiff's leave is limited to curing the pleading defects identified in the ruling and not to add new causes of action. The Judge's ruling is based on the fact that trusts are not legal entities and do not have capacity or standing to sue or be sued, and claims against the two trusts must be alleged against the real party in interest – the trustees of the two trusts. The Judge also overrules Defendants' arguments that Plaintiff failed to allege facts in support of the element of Plaintiff's performance, that the trusts are protected from suit because they are general partners in a partnership, and that Plaintiff must plead that a criminal judgment against Defendants was first obtained. However, the Judge sustains Defendants' demurrer to the sixth COA for conversion without leave to amend and sustains with leave to amend the fifth COA for fraud and all claims against Jake & Nina Bruck Trust and Marko Family Trust. The Judge also overrules Defendants' argument that the fourth COA for common count/quantum meruit is duplicative of the two breach of contract claims.

## English Summary

The judge reviewed the arguments made by both sides in this case. Plaintiff, Darhooneh Construction Inc., is suing Bruck and Marko, along with two trusts they control, for unpaid construction work.

The judge found that the trusts were not properly named in the lawsuit and that some of the claims against them were not specific enough. Plaintiff has 20 days to fix these issues and re-file the fifth cause of action (fraud) and all claims against the trusts.

The judge found that Plaintiff's claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and violation of Penal Code section 496 were sufficient and overruled the demurrers filed by the defendants. However, Plaintiff's claim for conversion was dismissed because it lacked sufficient factual support.
