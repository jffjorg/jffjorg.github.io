And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the defendants' motion for order requiring the plaintiffs to furnish a bond pursuant to Corporations Code § 15910.06. The defendants argued that there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of this action will benefit the Paloma Partnership or its shareholders, citing the Superior Court's decision in case no. 20STCV11588 that the usage of the Ellison Apartments as a short-term rental was allowable. However, the Court found that this argument misconstrues the scope of the complaint, which alleges breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and other causes of action based on the defendants' alleged mismanagement of the property. The Court also rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs' failure to provide capital contributions to the partnership is a reason to require a bond, as this issue is in dispute and a complaint is not evidence. As a result, the defendants do not carry their burden, and the motion is denied.
