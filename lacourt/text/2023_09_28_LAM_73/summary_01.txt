And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the defendants' motion for order requiring the plaintiffs to furnish a bond pursuant to Corporations Code § 15910.06. The defendants argued that there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of this action will benefit the Paloma Partnership or its shareholders, citing the Superior Court's decision in case no. 20STCV11588 that the usage of the Ellison Apartments as a short-term rental was allowable. However, the Court found that this argument misconstrues the scope of the complaint, which alleges breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and other causes of action based on the defendants' alleged mismanagement of the property. The Court also rejected the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs' failure to provide capital contributions to the partnership is a reason to require a bond, as this issue is in dispute and a complaint is not evidence. As a result, the defendants do not carry their burden, and the motion is denied.

## Tentative Ruling Summary:

**Case Number:** 23STCV10614

**Plaintiffs:** H. Duane Weaver and Negative Asset Limited Partnership 
**Defendants:**  7th St. Associates, Inc., Lance Jay Robbins Paloma Partnership, and Lance Jay Robbins

**Key Events:**

* **May 10, 2023:** Plaintiffs file a lawsuit against Defendants alleging breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, abuse of control, and other claims related to mismanagement of the Ellison Apartments, a rent-stabilized building.
* **June 26, 2023:** Defendants file a motion to require Plaintiffs to post a bond, arguing the lawsuit is unlikely to benefit the partnership and that Plaintiffs are in breach of the partnership agreement.

**Arguments and Rulings:**

* **Defendants' Argument 1:** The lawsuit regarding short-term rentals at the Ellison Apartments is likely to favor Defendants based on a previous court ruling.
    * **Court's Ruling:** This argument is rejected because the lawsuit encompasses broader claims beyond short-term rentals, such as mismanagement, disrepair, and unpaid distributions. 
* **Defendants' Argument 2:** Plaintiffs are in breach of the partnership agreement and therefore, the lawsuit will not benefit the partnership.
    * **Court's Ruling:** This argument is rejected because the alleged breach is disputed and based solely on an unverified complaint.

**Outcome:**

* The Court denies Defendants' motion for a bond, finding that they did not meet their burden of proving the lawsuit is unlikely to benefit the partnership.

**Legal Basis:**

* California Corporations Code § 15910.06 


**Additional Notes:**

* The Court took judicial notice of a previous court order and a complaint filed by the Defendants.
* The Court emphasizes that its decision does not determine the merits of the case.

The defendants have failed to meet their burden of showing that there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action will benefit the limited partnership or its partners.

The defendants argued that the litigation surrounding the usage of the Ellison Apartments as a short-term rental business is trending in their favor, but this argument is misconstrued. The defendants also argued that the plaintiffs are in breach of the partnership agreement by failing to provide necessary capital contributions, but this argument is based on an unverified complaint and is insufficient to meet their burden.

The court finds that the defendants' arguments are insufficient to meet their burden, and therefore the motion is denied. The defendants are ordered to give notice.

Duane Weaver and Negative Asset Limited Partnership against Defendants Paloma Partnership, 7th St. Associates, Inc., and Lance Jay Robbins. The Plaintiffs have filed a Verified Complaint with various causes of action, including Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Breach of Contract, Abuse of Control, Appointment of Receiver, Declaratory Relief, Accounting, Violation of Inspection Rights, Negligent Hiring, Supervision, and/or Retention, and Negligence.

The Defendants claim that the Complaint is based on a false premise and that the Plaintiffs are in breach of the amended partnership agreement by failing to provide necessary capital contributions.

However, the Court has denied the motion, stating that Defendants have not met their burden of showing that any cause of action has no reasonable possibility of benefiting the partnership or its shareholders. The Court has ordered Defendants to give notice.
