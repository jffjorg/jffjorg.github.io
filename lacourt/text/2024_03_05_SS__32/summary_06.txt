And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel the depositions of the plaintiffs, Kwan Jung Yoon and Hae Sook Yoon. The defendant, Mi Sun Chung, has moved to compel the depositions three times, citing the plaintiffs' failure to appear for scheduled depositions. The plaintiffs have opposed the motion, stating that they were not available for the scheduled depositions. The judge finds that the motions to compel are moot because one deposition has already been completed, and the other was scheduled to be completed before the hearing. The judge also finds that monetary sanctions are not warranted because valid reasons were given sufficiently in advance of the depositions for the nonappearances. The judge denies the defendant's motions to compel as moot.
