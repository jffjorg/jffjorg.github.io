And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several requests made by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had requested sanctions against the defendant's counsel, both jointly and severally, due to the defendant's failure to complete discovery. However, the judge has declined to award sanctions against the current defense counsel, as they were only associated with the case on December 6, 2023, after the discovery was served. The judge has determined that the current counsel is not responsible for the defendant's failure to complete discovery, and therefore sanctions will not be awarded.
