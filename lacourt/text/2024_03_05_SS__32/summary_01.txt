And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiffs' motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The case was initially dismissed without prejudice after the plaintiffs failed to appear at a hearing on July 25, 2023. The plaintiffs then filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, which was placed off-calendar after the plaintiffs failed to appear at a hearing on January 8, 2024. The plaintiffs then filed an amended motion to vacate the dismissal on January 22, 2024. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs' failure to appear at the hearing was due to a calendaring error, which constitutes excusable neglect. Therefore, the judge grants the motion to vacate the dismissal and sets an Order to Show Cause Re Failure to Enter Default Judgment for April 9, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
