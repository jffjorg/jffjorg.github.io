MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Set Aside Dismissal 




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Lauren Cameron




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
BACKGROUND
 
On December 20, 2021, Plaintiff Lauren Cameron (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint against Defendants Gregory Diaz and Does 1 to 10 for negligence
related to a motor vehicle accident.  
 
On June 21, 2023, the case was called for trial and there were no
appearances. As a result, the Court dismissed the complaint filed by Plaintiff
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581(b)(3). (Min. Order, 6/21/23.) 
 
On January 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to set aside the
dismissal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake
is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party
failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the burden of
demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a
court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)   
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision
does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals
for failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted],
dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted],
and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].”
(Id.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Procedurally,
the present motion is untimely since it was filed over six months after the
case was dismissed.  The six-month
limitations periods of the mandatory and the discretionary relief provisions of
section 473(b) mean the longer of six calendar months or 182 days.
(See Jimenez v. Chavez (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th
50, 58.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s deadline to file this motion was December 21,
2023. Since the motion was filed on January 8, 2024, it is untimely under
section 473(b). 
 
Therefore, since Plaintiff does not argue
an alternate basis for granting relief, the motion to set aside
the dismissal is denied as procedurally defective. 
             
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal.

 
Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
