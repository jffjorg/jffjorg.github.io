And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, seeking permission to conduct two medical examinations of the plaintiff, Maria Vela-Zuniga. The examinations are sought to determine the extent of the plaintiff's orthopedic and neurological injuries, which she alleges resulted from a fall in a bus.

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to permit the orthopedic examination, but has denied the motion to permit the neurological examination due to procedural defects. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to appear for the orthopedic examination at a mutually convenient date and time, and has required the defendant to provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service.

The judge has also noted that the defendant's motion did not provide sufficient specificity regarding the neurological examination, including the specific tests that would be performed. The judge has emphasized the importance of specificity in describing the examination procedures to ensure that the examiner complies with the court's parameters and to prevent unwarranted intrusion upon the plaintiff.
