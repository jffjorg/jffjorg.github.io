TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


March
  5, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


23STCV16590




MOTIONS:  


Compel
  Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Davidra Jewel Jackson




OPPOSING PARTY:


None



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            Defendant Davidra Jewel Jackson (“Defendant”)
moves to compel Plaintiff Jose Lozano’s (“Plaintiff”) responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One. Defendant also seeks monetary sanctions. No
opposition has been filed.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290 (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)(1),
(a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does
not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)  
 
If a motion to compel responses is filed, the Court shall
impose a monetary sanction against the losing party “unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290 (c).) Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery
Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant asserts that on October 27, 2023, Defendant served Form
Interrogatories, Set One on Plaintiff. (Kelly Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Extensions to
respond, without objections, were granted until January 8, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5.)
As of the date of filing this motion, no responses have been served. (Id.
¶ 6.) Therefore,
because Plaintiff does not oppose and verified responses have not been served,
the motion to compel is granted. 
 
            Defendant requests sanctions against
Plaintiff for $960.[1] This
amount appears to be based on an hourly rate of $200 and the $60 filing fee. Given
the type of motion at issue, the fact no opposition was filed, and counsel can
appear remotely at the hearing, the Court finds this amount is excessive and
reduces it to $360.00 (1.5 hours of attorney time, plus the $60 filing fee).
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to compel is GRANTED. Plaintiff Jose
Lozano shall serve properly verified responses, without objections, to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, within 10 days.
 
The Court further GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff in the reduced amount of $360.00. Said monetary sanctions are
to be paid to counsel for Defendant within 30 days of the date of this order.
 
Defendant
to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
