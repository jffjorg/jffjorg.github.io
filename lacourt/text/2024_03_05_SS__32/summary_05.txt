And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion to relieve counsel, Devin A. Cutting, of Bish & Cutting, APC and Jacoby & Meyers Attorneys LLP, from representing Plaintiff Trenna Jones. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, but the Court found that relieving counsel would likely prejudice Plaintiff's rights. The Court noted that the trial date is approaching and that no motion to continue trial has been filed. The Judge ruled that counsel did not take reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of Plaintiff and therefore denied the motion.
