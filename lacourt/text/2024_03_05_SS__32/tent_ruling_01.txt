CASE NUMBER:


21STCV19598




MOTIONS:  


Amended
  Motion for Relief from Dismissal




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiffs Bryan Pacheco and Franibel
  Duarte




OPPOSING PARTY:


Unopposed



 
BACKGROUND
 
On July 25, 2023, this case was called for an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Enter Default Judgment. Counsel for Plaintiffs Bryan Pacheco and Franibel
Duarte (Plaintiffs), did not appear. As a result, the Court ordered the
complaint dismissed without prejudice. (Minute Order, 7/25/23.) 
 
On October 3, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the dismissal,
set to be heard January 8, 2024. On the date of the hearing, counsel for
Plaintiffs failed to appear, despite being registered to appear via Court
Connect. On the Court’s own motion, the motion was placed off-calendar. (Min.
Order, 1/8/24.) 
 
On January 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant amended motion, again
seeking relief from the July 25, 2023 dismissal. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a
dismissal taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.  This application must
be filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake
is a basis for relief under section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party
failed to make a timely response.  Surprise occurs when a party is
unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without any negligence of his
own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the party has shown some
reasonable excuse for the default.  (Credit Managers Association of
California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d
1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the burden of
demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a
court’s vacating a judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990)
220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)   
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89
Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief provision
does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals
for failure to serve a complaint within three years [citations omitted],
dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations [citations omitted],
and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].”
(Id.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Procedurally,
the present motion is timely because it was filed within six months after the
case was dismissed. The Declaration of Roberto Dominguez Quiroga states that he
was filing and appearing for hearings to enter default judgment against
Defendant Yesenia Beltran before the case was dismissed. (Quiroga Decl. ¶
8–11.) He declares that from June 17, 2023 to July 9, 2023, he took a leave of
absence and other attorneys were assigned the present case. (Id. ¶ 12–13.) After
the OSC was continued to July 25, 2023, Counsel’s office failed to calendar the
hearing in the firm’s calendar. (Id. ¶ 16.) A calendaring error constitutes excusable
neglect. (Nilsson v. City of Los Angeles (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 976,
980.) Therefore, based on counsel’s declaration, the Court grants
the motion to vacate the dismissal. 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the dismissal.  
 
The Court sets an Order to Show Cause Re Failure to Enter Default
Judgment for April 9, 2024  at 8:30 a.m.
in Department 32 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Plaintiffs to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
