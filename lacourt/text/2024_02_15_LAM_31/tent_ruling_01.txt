MOTION
TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Cyrous Forouzesh
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Shahram
Einalhori
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On September 20, 2021, Plaintiff, Cyrous Forouzesh, filed a
Complaint against Defendants, Shahram Einalhori (“Einalhori”), and Harvest
Trading Co., Inc., alleging causes of action for (1) Breach of Contract; (2)
Fraud; and (3) Common Counts.  This action arises out of an alleged oral
agreement by Plaintiff to lend Einalhori and his Company, Harvest Trading Co.
$802,495.47 in return for repayment of the full amount plus profits of the
company split 50/50 between Einalhori and Plaintiff.  Einalhori allegedly
did not pay back $152,010.97 of the loan and has refused to pay Plaintiff his
50% share of the Company’s profits.  Einalhori is further alleged to have
falsely inflated the expenses of the Company to reduce Plaintiff’s share of
profits, among other things. 
 
Plaintiff served Einalhori with Form Interrogatories—General,
Set Two, and Request for Admissions, Set Two. 
The interrogatories consisted of Form Interrogatory No. 17.1, which
refers to responses to Request for Admissions.
 
On October 13, 2023, Einalhori served a response to Form
Interrogatory No. 17.1.  Einalhori
objected because Plaintiff did not serve the requests for admissions with the interrogatories.
 
On October 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel Einalhori’s
response to Form Interrogatories—General, Set Two.  Plaintiff requests sanctions against Einalhori
and its counsel.
 
Einalhori filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replies.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARDS 
 
            If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without
objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿ Failure to timely
serve responses waives objections to the requests.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿¿¿ ¿¿ 
 
Monetary
Sanctions¿¿ 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
 
            If the
court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or inspection demands, the court “shall impose a
monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c),
2031.310, subd. (h).)¿¿¿  
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff seeks an order compelling Einalhori to provide
responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set Two, No. 17.1.  
 
            The parties
disagree on the date of service of the at-issue discovery.  Plaintiff’s notice of motion states the discovery
was served on May 16, 2023.  In reply,
Plaintiff changes course and states the discovery was actually served on May
30, 2023.  Courts generally do not
consider matters raised for the first time in reply.  
 
            Defendant
also effectively challenges that Form Interrogatories, Set Two, was served any
earlier than September 13, 2023.  He
attaches an email dated September 13, 2023 wherein Plaintiff’s counsel states
“Turns out we previously served a set one, without FROG 17.1.  We will serve a set two with only No.
17.1.”  (Ingman Decl., Ex. 2.)  For these reasons, Plaintiff is not entitled
to an order compelling Defendant’s initial response to Form
Interrogatory No. 17.1.  
 
            Further, whatever
the date of service, Defendant served a response (an objection) on October 13,
2023, prior to the filing of this motion. (See Motion, Ex. D.)  Plaintiff’s recourse is to file a motion to
compel further.[1]
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motion
to compel responses to Form Interrogatories—General, Set Two, is DENIED.  
 
            The court
declines to impose sanctions on any party. 

 
Defendant Shahram Einalhori to give notice.
