DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Jose Madriz 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
 
            On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff, Jose Madriz, filed a
Complaint against Defendant, Successor Trustee of the Robert and Maria Yee
Family Trust of 1991 – Survivor’s Trust U/A Dated November 15, 1991, for
violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Unruh Civil Rights
Act.
 
            On December
5, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer to the Complaint.
 
            On January
18, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Demurrer to Defendant’s Answer to the Complaint.
 
            On the same
day, Defendant filed an Amended Answer to the Complaint.
 
“A party may amend its pleading once without leave of the
court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or
after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion
to strike is heard if the amended pleading is filed and served no later than
the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike. A party
may amend the pleading after the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer
or motion to strike, upon stipulation by the parties. The time for responding
to an amended pleading shall be computed from the date of service of the
amended pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).)
 
Given that Defendant filed her Amended Answer within the time
for filing an opposition to Plaintiff’s Demurrer, the demurrer is MOOT.
Clerk of the Court to give notice.
