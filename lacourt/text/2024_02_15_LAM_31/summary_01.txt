And here is the English text summary:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Cyrous Forouzesh v. Shahram Einalhori, et al. (Case Number: 21STCV34685). The case concerns a dispute over a loan agreement between the plaintiff, Cyrous Forouzesh, and the defendant, Shahram Einalhori, and his company, Harvest Trading Co., Inc. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to pay back the loan and has refused to pay the plaintiff his 50% share of the company's profits.

The plaintiff served the defendant with Form Interrogatories, Set Two, and the defendant served a response, objecting to the late service of the discovery. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel the defendant's response, requesting sanctions against the defendant and his counsel.

The judge denied the motion to compel the defendant's response, finding that the plaintiff's notice of motion stated the discovery was served on May 16, 2023, but in reply, the plaintiff changed the date of service to May 30, 2023. The judge also found that the defendant served a response to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 on October 13, 2023, before the filing of the motion.

The judge declined to impose sanctions on any party, citing the need for a finding that the party "advised" the conduct resulting in sanctions. The judge also noted that monetary sanctions against a party's attorney require a finding that the attorney "advised" the party to engage in the conduct resulting in sanctions.
