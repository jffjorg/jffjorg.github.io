And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Counsel, Stephen M. Sanders, to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Stephen Brown and Hazel & Oak Construction, LLC. Counsel cites a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship as the reason for the motion. The judge notes that a Substitution of Attorney was filed on June 12, 2024, substituting Larry Letofsky and Robyn McClain as counsel for Defendant Stephen Robert Brown, making the motion to be relieved as counsel for Brown moot.

The judge finds that the motion to be relieved as counsel for Hazel & Oak Construction, LLC is substantively proper, but procedurally improper because Counsel did not lodge a proposed order (form MC-053) with the court and because the proof of service does not indicate that the client, Hazel & Oak Construction, was served. The judge denies the motion to be relieved as counsel for Hazel & Oak Construction, LLC and orders Counsel to provide notice of the court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
