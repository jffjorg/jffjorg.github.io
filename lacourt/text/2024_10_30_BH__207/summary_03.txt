And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the concept of justiciability, which involves the intertwined criteria of ripeness and standing. Standing requires that a party have an actual and substantial interest in the outcome of the case, and that they would be benefited or harmed by the result. Ripeness, on the other hand, refers to the requirement that there be a current controversy between the parties. The judge notes that a controversy becomes ripe when the facts have sufficiently congealed to permit an intelligent and useful decision to be made. The judge is reviewing these concepts in the context of an action brought by the plaintiff, and is considering whether the plaintiff has standing to bring the action and whether the controversy is ripe for adjudication.
