MOTION
 
This case arises from a landlord/tenant dispute.  On May 28, 2024, Plaintiff and
Cross-Defendant Willie Frank Bell (“Plaintiff”) filed suit against his new
landlords, Defendants Joseph P. Kendall; Midvale Telmadge LLC; and Rocio
Angelina Flamenco (“Defendants”) alleging two causes of action for (1) breach
of quiet enjoyment and (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress.  
 
On September 5, 2024, Defendant Rocio Angelina Flamenco (“Flamenco”)
filed a hand-written cross-complaint in pro per.  Plaintiff now demurs to Flamenco’s
cross-complaint on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action and for uncertainty, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure, section 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f), respectively.  The demurrer is unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if on consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
UNCERTAINTY
 
“[D]emurrers for uncertainty are disfavored.”  (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.)  A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained
only where the pleading is so bad that the responding party cannot reasonably
respond - i.e., he or she cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied, or what claims are directed against him or her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Where a
demurrer is made upon the ground of uncertainty, the demurrer must distinctly
specify exactly how or why the pleading is uncertain, and where such
uncertainty appears by reference to page and line numbers.  (See Fenton v. Groveland Comm.
Services Dist. (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)  
 
Flamenco alleges verbatim in the cross-complaint as follows:
 
“I Rocio Angelina Flamenco notify the courts the
current abuse suffering from Willie Frank Bell. 
Willie Bell has damage my cars, has emotional & physical attack me
has violated a Restraining Order # 24STRO03468 has falsy accuse me in a civil
case to continue destroying my life & affecting my workplace.  Willie Frank Bell has not only put my life in
danger but has also affected my living & workplace relapship &
financial income by getting me & my witnesss fired from my workplace &
in danger my living situation.  Mr.
Willie Frank Bell has violated TRO, Damage Personal Property, cause financial
harmshee intentional infliction of emotional distress exists when there is
extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with intention of causing of
the emotional distress I proof the courts a approve TRO.  Proof of violations of TRO.  False testify of draft settlements &
proof of property damage, also employmen t& living current proof of
harmship requested by Willie Frank Bell.
 
Defendant’s conduct of repeated false accusations
& violations on current Restraining Order #24STRO03468 which a new hearing
for violations is being held on 9/26/2024 at 8:30 AM in LA Hills Street
Courthouse.
 
Prayers for Relief.
 
Wherefore, Plaintiff seeks I seek justice I Rocio
Angelina Flamenco request the courts judgment against defendants as follows:
 
1.  All
medical expenses, car damages, consequential and incidental including but not
limited to loss of income, employment loss, damages for emotional distress in a
sum according to proof.  Loss of business
income.” [sic]
 
(Cross-Complaint.)
            
Attached to the Cross-Complaint is a copy of a Civil Harassment
Restraining Order After Hearing, filed June 10, 2024, case number 24STRO03408,
which protects Flamenco and restrains Plaintiff to not “harass, intimidate,
molest, attack, strike, stalk, threaten, assault (sexually or otherwise), hit,
abuse, destroy personal property of, or disturb the peace” and stay 15 yards
away from Flamenco, as well as Flamenco’s home, workplace, and vehicle.  The Restraining Order expires at midnight on June
10, 2025.  
 
Also attached is the request for temporary restraining order and
declaration filed in that case, as well as photographs of a light colored
dented vehicle and a dark colored vehicle with light discoloring along the edge
of the driver’s side door.
 
Flamenco’s declaration filed in case number 24STRO03408 provides
verbatim as follows:
 
On 6/10/24 at 2150 inc # 4469 I called that cops
& reported a violation of the order granted Willie/attorney send someone to
hit my window terrifying me.  My apt
window was almost broken per person send by the defendant.  Cops arrive on 6/10/24 after I called 911
defendet had lie to law enforcement & said he had no idea who it was,
documents left at my door after person sent by defendet hit my window  & scream my name was confirm send by the
defedent & he is in violation of the order by this actions after the
current order was served to defedent & attorney.  He was continue to harass me, intimidate me,
molest, attack, defendant has contact my workplace.
 
My Willie Bell has continue to engage in a very
disturbing behavior in which he contact my workplace & presented a lawsuit
with lies & creating problems with other tenants law sue file in a
different court case # 24SMCV02523. 
Defedent has continue to harass me & stalk me creating a very
stressful cituation which is now affecting my health.  I have contact law enforcement & they
advice me to reach out to that courts because its clear he when against the
order & they have also a criminal case pending but is not sufficient to
make an arrest.  Criminal case has been
send to the district attorney case # ID472795 DA office (310) 725-3000.  Mr Willie Bell has continue in daily basics
to inteminated by opening that door daily to stalk me, when I go out he is
intimidating me & using others to deliver messages & harassment.  I want to continue with my TRO & I ask
the courts to please enforce it.  [sic].
 
(TRO
Declaration attached to Cross-Complaint.)
 
            Although Flamenco has pleaded
factual allegations that could potentially give rise to several different
causes of action, the Court cannot discern what specific cause(s) of action
Flamenco seeks to pursue.  As such, it is
uncertain what cause(s) of action are directed against Plaintiff.
 
            Therefore, the Court sustains
Plaintiff’s demurrer to the cross-complaint on the basis of uncertainty.
 
2.    
LEAVE TO AMEND
 
A plaintiff has the burden of showing in what
manner the complaint could be amended and how the amendment would change the
legal effect of the complaint, i.e., state a cause of action. (See The
Inland Oversight Committee v. City of San Bernardino (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th
771, 779; PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 156, 189.) A plaintiff must not only state the legal basis for
the amendment, but also the factual allegations sufficient to state a cause of
action or claim. (See PGA West Residential Assn., Inc. v. Hulven Int'l, Inc.,
supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at p. 189.) Moreover, a plaintiff does not meet his
or her burden by merely stating in the opposition to a demurrer or motion to
strike that “if the Court finds the operative complaint deficient, plaintiff
respectfully requests leave to amend.” (See Major Clients Agency v Diemer
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1133; Graham v. Bank of America (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 594, 618 [asserting an abstract right to amend does not satisfy the
burden].)
 
Here, Flamenco has failed to meet its burden as Flamenco did not
file an opposition to the demurrer, and therefore does not address whether
leave should be granted if the demurrer is sustained.
 
Notwithstanding, “Providing access to justice for self-represented
litigants is a priority for California courts.” 
(California Rules of Court, rule 10.960, subdivision (b).)  “[W]hen a litigant is
self-represented, a judge has the discretion to take reasonable steps,
appropriate under the circumstances and consistent with the law and the canons,
to enable the litigant to be heard.” (See also ABA Model Code of Jud. Conduct,
canon 2, rule 2.2, com. 4 [“[i]t is not a violation of this Rule [regarding
impartiality and fairness] for a judge to make reasonable accommodations to
ensure pro se litigants the opportunity to have their matters fairly heard”].)
The canons and commentary thus provide a path to ensure a self-represented
litigant can be fairly heard on the merits while the court maintains its
impartiality and does not assume (or appear to assume) the role of advocate or
partisan. (See Cal. Code Jud. Ethics, canon 3 [“a judge shall perform the
duties of judicial office impartially, competently, and diligently”].)”  (Holloway v. Quetel (2015) 242
Cal.App.4th 1425, 1434.)
 
Therefore, because Flamenco has alleged facts that could give rise to
a cognizable cause of action, the Court grants Flamenco leave to amend the
Cross-Complaint to specify what specific cause(s) of action Flamenco seeks to
pursue against Plaintiff.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court sustains Plaintiff’s Demurrer to
Flamenco’s Cross-Complaint with leave to amend.

conformance with this Court’s ruling on or before December 6, 2024.  
 
Further, on the Court’s own motion, the Court continues the Case

Case Management Conferences.  In particular,
