Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the demurrer to Flamenco's cross-complaint and has sustained it on the basis of uncertainty. The court finds that the cross-complaint does not specify what specific cause(s) of action Flamenco is seeking to pursue against Plaintiff. The court grants Flamenco leave to amend the cross-complaint to specify the cause(s) of action. The court also continues the Case Management Conference from December 2, 2024 to March 19, 2025 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.

The court's decision is based on its analysis of the demurrer and the cross-complaint, as well as the court's discretion to take reasonable steps to enable the self-represented litigant to be heard. The court notes that providing access to justice for self-represented litigants is a priority for California courts.
