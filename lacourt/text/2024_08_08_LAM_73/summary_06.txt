And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for attorneys' fees and litigation costs filed by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are entitled to $46,900.85 in attorneys' fees and $50,557.29 in costs to be paid out of the settlement fund. The court found that the common-fund doctrine applies, as the plaintiffs successfully prosecuted their derivative claims against the defendants, resulting in a settlement fund to be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs for the benefit of their shareholders. The court also found that the plaintiffs' request for attorneys' fees and costs is reasonable, considering the extensive work performed by the plaintiffs' counsel in litigating the case.
