And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees and litigation costs is granted. The court awards the plaintiffs $46,900.85 in attorneys' fees and $50,557.29 in costs to be paid out of the settlement fund. The plaintiffs filed a shareholder derivative action against the defendants, alleging that the defendants failed to pay property taxes, manage the property, and provide books and records. The parties executed a settlement agreement, which was preliminarily approved by the court. The plaintiffs' counsel spent over 470 hours on litigation tasks, including discovery, depositions, and arbitration. The court finds that the plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys' fees and litigation costs under the common-fund doctrine, as they successfully prosecuted their derivative claims against the defendants, resulting in a common fund for the benefit of the shareholders. The court also finds that the plaintiffs' request for attorneys' fees and litigation costs is reasonable, considering the amount of work performed by their counsel and the expenses incurred in the litigation.
