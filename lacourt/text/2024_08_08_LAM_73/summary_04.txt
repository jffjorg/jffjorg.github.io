And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees and litigation costs. The plaintiffs seek to recover $46,900.85 in attorneys' fees and $50,494.74 in litigation costs from the settlement fund. The judge finds that the common-fund doctrine applies, as the plaintiffs successfully prosecuted their derivative claims against the defendants, resulting in a settlement fund for the benefit of the shareholders. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' counsel has performed a substantial amount of work litigating the case and that their request for attorneys' fees and litigation costs is reasonable. The judge awards the plaintiffs $46,900.85 in attorneys' fees and $50,557.29 in costs to be paid out of the settlement fund.
