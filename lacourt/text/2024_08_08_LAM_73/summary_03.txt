And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, Odyssey Growth Group, LLC, is seeking judgment against the defendant, Daniel Patrick, Inc., for breach of contract. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant breached the contract on November 30, 2021, and that the plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of $29,847.50. The plaintiff filed a Default Judgment packet on April 12, 2024, seeking judgment in the amount of $38,812.42, but later amended the packet on July 30, 2024, to seek judgment in the amount of $35,612.42. The court notes that the forms submitted by the plaintiff are inconsistent in the amount of judgment sought, and therefore cannot grant the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment at this time. The court will continue the hearing to August 8, 2024, to give the parties an opportunity to resolve the issues.
