pLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT (filed 7/30/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment
is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On December 29,
2023, Plaintiff Odyssey Growth Group filed the instant action against Defendant
Daniel Patrick, Inc. alleging a cause of action for breach of contract. 
 
The Complaint alleges the following. On or about September 5,
2020, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a Consulting Agreement, which
Plaintiff attached to the Complaint. (Complaint, ¶
5, Ex. A.) Plaintiff alleges that it performed all conditions and promises
required by them on their part of the contact. (Complaint, ¶ 6.) Plaintiff further alleges that
Defendant breached the contract on or about November 30, 2021 and Plaintiff has been damaged in
the sum of $29,847.50. (Complaint, ¶ 7.)
 
On
April 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Default Judgment packet. Plaintiff sought
judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $38,812.42, consisting of
the principal sum of $29,847.50, interest in the amount of $7,040.66, costs in
the amount of $638.83, and attorney fees in the amount of $1,285.43. 
 
On
May 17, 2024, the Court scheduled the Order to Show Cause re Default Judgment and
thereafter continued the hearing to August 8, 2024.
 
On
July 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amended default judgment form. Plaintiff’s
counsel stated in its declaration that on or about April 12,
2024, a Stipulation for Judgment was prepared for both parties to sign so that
this action can be disposed of with a filing of the Request for Dismissal.
(Booska Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendant subsequently
made two installment payments totaling $3,200.00 for May and June of 2024. (Booska
Decl., ¶ 4.) No payments have been received
thereafter. (Ibid.) Thus, Plaintiff proceeded with preparing its Request
for Entry of Default and Default Judgment. Plaintiff amended the total amount
it is seeking against Defendants to the total sum of $35,612.42 to account for
the two installment payments made by Defendant. Thus, Plaintiff is seeking
judgment in the total amount of $35,612.42, consisting of the principal sum of $26,647.50, interest in the amount of
$7,040.66, costs in the amount of $638.83, and attorney fees in the amount of
$1,285.43.

JC Form CIV-100 must be used to request court
judgment. On July 30, 2024, Plaintiff submitted its amended JC Form CIV-100 and default packet.
Plaintiff’s counsel stated in its declaration that on or about April 12,
2024, a Stipulation for Judgment was prepared for both parties to sign so that
this action can be disposed of with a filing of the Request for Dismissal.
(Booska Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendant subsequently
made two installment payments totaling $3,200.00 for May and June of 2024. (Booska
Decl., ¶ 4.) No payments have been received
thereafter. (Ibid.) Thus, Plaintiff proceeded with preparing its Request
for Entry of Default and Default Judgment. 
 
On
April 12, 2024, Plaintiff had filed a Default Judgment packet seeking judgment
against Defendants in the total amount of $38,812.42, consisting of the
principal sum of $29,847.50. On July 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed
an amended default judgment packet.
 
However, the
Court notes that it appears the forms that Plaintiff submitted on July 30, 2024
are inconsistent in the amount of judgment that Plaintiff is seeking. Section 2
of Plaintiff’s CIV-100 form filed on July 30, 2024 seeks a total sum of $38,812.42. Whereas, section 6 of JUD-100 form also
filed on July 30, 2024 seeks a total sum of $35,612.42. 
 
Thus,
the Court cannot grant Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment at
this time based on the inconsistencies in the forms. 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED
without prejudice.
