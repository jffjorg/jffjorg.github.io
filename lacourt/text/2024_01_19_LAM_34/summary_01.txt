And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment against the plaintiff. The plaintiff did not oppose or respond to the motion, and the defendant has met its burden to show that there are no triable issues of material fact. The plaintiff is proceeding in propria persona, but the court will not give her special treatment. The court finds that the defendant's care and treatment complied with the standard of care and did not substantially cause the plaintiff's alleged damages. The motion for summary judgment is granted in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff on all causes of action in the First Amended Complaint.
