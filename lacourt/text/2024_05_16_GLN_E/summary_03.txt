And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses three motions filed by the plaintiffs to compel responses to discovery requests. The motions were filed on August 29, 2023, and the court scheduled a hearing for May 9, 2024. However, the Defendant failed to file timely oppositions to the motions, and the court considered the untimely oppositions.

The court denied the motions as moot since the Defendant provided verified responses to the discovery requests after the motions were filed. The court also warned the plaintiffs that they must pay the additional filing fee for each individual discovery method and clarify which discovery method each motion pertains to in the future.

The court also addressed sanctions under the Discovery Act, stating that the court may award sanctions in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even if no opposition was filed or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.
