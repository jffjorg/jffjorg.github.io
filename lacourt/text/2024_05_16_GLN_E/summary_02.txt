And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling states that the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to interrogatories should be denied as moot because the defendant provided responses after the motion was filed. However, the judge wants to discuss the issue of sanctions with the parties. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's motion lumps two separate motions into one and that the defendant's opposition is untimely. The judge warns the plaintiff that all motions must provide sufficient notice to the defendant.
