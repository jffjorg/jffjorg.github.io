English-text summary:

The case is about the Plaintiff, Mariely Garcia-Romero, who filed a complaint alleging three causes of action against the Defendant, FCA US LLC, under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Plaintiff served various discovery requests on the Defendant, including form and special interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admissions. The Defendant failed to respond to these requests, and the Plaintiff filed motions to compel responses. The Defendant filed oppositions to these motions, claiming that they had provided responses. However, the Court found that the Defendant did not provide verifications of their responses. The Court ruled that the motions to compel were denied as moot, as the Defendant had provided responses after the filing of the motions. The Court also warned the Plaintiff that all motions must provide sufficient notice to the Defendant and that the Plaintiff needs to clarify which discovery method each motion pertains to.
