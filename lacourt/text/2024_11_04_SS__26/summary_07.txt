And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to change the venue of the trial from Los Angeles, California to Wenatchee, Washington, where the subject accident occurred and the non-party witnesses are located. The defendant argued that the convenience of the witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change of venue, and the judge has accepted this argument. The judge notes that the plaintiff's opposition to the motion was filed 12 days late and therefore declined to consider it. The defendant is ordered to file a proposed order within 10 days of the ruling.
