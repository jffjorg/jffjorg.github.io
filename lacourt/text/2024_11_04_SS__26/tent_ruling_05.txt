 Case Number:  23STLC06800    Hearing Date:   November 4, 2024    Dept:  26  Anda  v. City of Whittier, et al.1 OF 2. MOTION TO VACATE ORDER(CCP § 473(b))TENTATIVE RULING:    Plaintiff Martha Delia Anda’s Motion to Vacate Order of  Court Deeming Admitted Defendant’s Requests for Admissions is DENIED.                                                                                                                                     ANALYSIS:   On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff  Martha Delia Anda (“Plaintiff”) filed this premises  liability action against Defendants City of Whittier (“Defendant  Whitter”), Cappo Management XLI LLC dba Ocean Honda of Whittier (“Defendant  Cappo”), Victory Automotive Group, LLC, and Victory Automotive Group, Inc.  (“the Victory Defendants”). On July 30, 2024, the Court granted Defendant  Whittier’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for  Monetary Sanctions against Plaintiff. (Minute Order, 07/30/24.) Plaintiff was  ordered to pay Defendant Whittier sanctions of $245.00 within 20 days’ service  of the order. (Ibid.) Notice of the ruling was served on Plaintiff the  same date. (Notice of Ruling, filed 07/31/24.)    Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Vacate Order of Court  Deeming Admitted Defendant’s Requests for Admissions on September 5, 2024. Defendant  filed and served an untimely opposition on October 28, 2024. The opposition  should have been served by October 18, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1005,  1010.6.) Accordingly, the Court declines to consider Defendant Whittier’s  opposition.    Discussion   Plaintiff moves for relief from the  Court’s July 30, 2024 order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473,  subdivision (b), which states that an application for relief must be made no  more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought and  must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake,  inadvertence, surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001)  94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) When based on party fault, the neglect must have been  excusable and brought within a reasonable time. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.  (b).)    The Motion was timely filed  approximately one month after entry of the order and is supported by a  declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel. The declaration sets forth the following  facts as amount to excusable neglect. When the case was initial filed in  October 2023, it was assigned to Attorney Kenneth Kleeger, however, Attorney  Kleeger’s employment with Plaintiff’s counsel’s firm ended in October or  November 2023. (Motion, Clift Decl., ¶4.) Defendant Whittier’s discovery  requests were served on Plaintiff to Attorney Kleeger’s email address in April  2024, but that email address was not being actively monitored such that the  firm did not provide a timely response to the discovery. (Id. at ¶5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel did not appear to oppose the Motion to Deem Requests for  Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions because, “through inadvertence  and/or inadequate supervision of Counsel’s support staff, the Opposition was  not filed.” (Id. at ¶8.) Also, the hearing on the Motion to Deem  Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions was not calendared. (Ibid.)  None of this conduct was willful and was on account of excusable inadvertence.  (Id. at ¶9.)    The Court does not find that  Plaintiff’s counsel’s conduct as detailed above was excusable. As Plaintiff’s  own Motion explains, what constitutes “excusable neglect” under Code of Civil  Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) is neglect which might have been the act  of a reasonably prudent person under the same circumstances. (Kooper v. King  (1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 621, 626-627.) A law firm’s failure to reassign active cases  of an attorney who has left the firm for more than eight months is not  reasonable. A law firm’s failure to inadequately supervise its staff such that  an opposition to a pending discovery motion is not filed—especially one of such  magnitude as deeming admissions admitted—is also not reasonable. Finally, a law  firm’s failure to appear at a hearing, for which opposition papers were  apparently prepared but the hearing was not calendared, is also not reasonable.  The case on which Plaintiff relies involved a delay in reassigning the case to  a new attorney of only 16 days. (Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th  973, 976.)    As Plaintiff has not shown that  any of these circumstances alone, let alone in combination over the course of  almost a year, should constitute excusable neglect, relief from the order  deeming the requests for admission admitted and awarding sanctions is not  warranted under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).   Conclusion   Plaintiff Martha Delia Anda’s Motion to Vacate Order of  Court Deeming Admitted Defendant’s Requests for Admissions is DENIED.      Court clerk to give notice. 2 OF 2. MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS(CCP § 2023.010)TENTATIVE RULING: 

 

DEFENDANT CAPPO MANAGEMENT XLI
LLC DBA OCEAN HONDA OF WHITTIER’S MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS IS GRANTED. PLAINTIFF MARTHA DELIA ANDA’S COMPLAINT, FILED ON OCTOBER 20, 2023, IS
DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE AS TO DEFENDANT CAPPO MANAGEMENT XLI LLC DBA

ANALYSIS: 

 

On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff
Martha Delia Anda (“Plaintiff”) filed this premises
liability action against Defendants City of Whittier (“Defendant
Whitter”), Cappo Management XLI LLC dba Ocean Honda of Whittier (“Defendant
Cappo”), Victory Automotive Group, LLC, and Victory Automotive Group, Inc.
(“the Victory Defendants”). Defendant Cappo filed its Answer on December 15,
2023. On June 10, 2024, the Court granted Defendant Cappo’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set
One, Request for Sanctions and Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Sanctions. (Minute Order, 06/10/24.) On
June 11, 2024, the Court granted Defendant Cappo’s Motion to Compel Responses
to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Request for Sanctions. (Minute
Order, 06/11/24.) Plaintiff was ordered to serve verified responses to the
discovery within 20 days’ service of the orders. (Minute Orders, 06/10/24 and
06/11/24.) 

 

Defendant
Cappo filed the instant Motion for Terminating Sanctions on July 12, 2024. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on September 10, 2024 and Defendant Cappo replied on September 18,
2024. The Motion initially came for hearing on September 25, 2024, at which
time the Court took the matter under submission. (Minute Order, 09/25/24.)
Thereafter, the Court ordered the parties to file briefs addressing Plaintiff’s
argument regarding lack of proper service based on non-acquiescence to
electronic service of the discovery documents. (Minute Order, 10/07/24.)
Defendant Cappo filed its brief on October 18, 2024 and Plaintiff filed their
brief on October 25, 2024. 

 

Discussion

 

Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence or monetary sanctions.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subds. (d), (g); R.S. Creative, Inc. v.
Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) The court should
look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether terminating
sanctions are appropriate. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1246.) Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful
discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules. (Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) “[A] penalty as
severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with
discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad
faith.” (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.) “The court
may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 

 

(1)  
An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.

(2)  
An order staying further proceedings by that party
until an order for discovery is obeyed.

(3)  
An order dismissing the action, or any part of the
action, of that party.

(4)  
An order rendering a judgment by default against that
party.”

 

(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).)

 

 

Discussion

 

The Court granted Defendant Cappo’s (1)
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Request for
Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
Request for Sanctions; and (3) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, Request for Sanctions, on June 10 and 11,
2024. (Minute Orders, 06/10/24 and 06/11/24.) Defendant Cappo served
Plaintiff with notice of the orders on June 12, 2024. (Motion, Sawyer Decl., ¶9
and Exh. C.) As of the filing of the instant Motion, Plaintiff has not complied
with the order to serve responses or pay sanctions. (Id. at ¶¶10-11.)
Plaintiff’s opposition contends that verified responses to the discovery
requests were served on July 12, 2024, however, the opposition exhibits pertain
solely to discovery propounded by Defendant Whittier. (Opp., Labat Decl., Exhs.
B-C.) 

 

At the hearing, Plaintiff also argued that none of the
discovery documents were properly served because they were served
electronically, a method to which Plaintiff had not agreed. Following
consideration of the parties’ briefs regarding electronic service, the Court
makes the following ruling. To the extent both parties cite California Rules of
Court 8.78, the Court disregards this authority, which pertains only to Supreme
Court and Courts of Appeal. California Rule of Court 2.251 is the relevant rule
for the state trial court. Effective January 1, 2022, Rule 2.251 stated:

 

(b) Electronic service by express
consent

 

(1) A party or other person indicates
that the party or other person agrees to accept electronic service by:

(A) Serving a notice on all parties
and other persons that the party or other person accepts electronic service and
filing the notice with the court. The notice must include the electronic
service address at which the party or other person agrees to accept service; or

(B) Manifesting affirmative consent
through electronic means with the court or the court’s electronic filing
service provider, and concurrently providing the party’s electronic service
address with that consent for the purpose of receiving electronic service. A
party or other person may manifest affirmative consent by serving notice of
consent to all parties and other persons and either:

(i) Agreeing to the terms of service
with an electronic filing service provider, which clearly states that agreement
constitutes consent to receive electronic service; or

(ii) Filing Consent to Electronic
Service and Notice of Electronic Service Address (form EFS-005-CV).

(2) A party or other person that has
consented to electronic service under (1) and has used an electronic filing
service provider to serve and file documents in a case consents to service on
that electronic filing service provider as the designated agent for service for
the party or other person in the case, until such time as the party or other
person designates a different agent for service.

 

(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.251(b).) Under this rule,
“manifesting affirmative consent through electronic means with the court or the
court’s electronic filing service provider” requires a party to agree to the
terms of service with an electronic filing service provider, and serve notice
of consent to all parties and other persons. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.251(b)(1)(B).) 

 

However, neither party considers the next subdivision of the
Rule, which provides: “A court may require parties to serve documents
electronically in specified civil actions by local rule or court order, as
provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.251(c)(1).) Effective January 1, 2023, Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6
has stated: “A person represented by counsel, who has appeared in an action or
proceeding, shall accept electronic service of a notice or document that may be
served by mail, express mail, overnight delivery, or facsimile transmission.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (b)(2).) The language of subdivision (b)(2)
means that a represented party who has appeared in the action must
accept electronic service. Therefore, Plaintiff’s contention that they
were improperly served electronically is incorrect. 

 

The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted for
Plaintiffs’ non-compliance with the discovery orders. Despite notice of the
Court’s ruling, Plaintiffs failed to serve responses or pay sanctions as
ordered by the 20-day deadline, which passed on July 2, 2024. No explanation is
provided for failing to comply with the Court’s orders. (See Opp., Labat Decl.,
¶7.) This demonstrates that Plaintiff’s compliance with the Court’s orders
cannot be achieved through lesser sanctions. Although terminating sanctions are
a harsh penalty, “[t]he court [is] not required to allow a pattern of abuse to
continue ad infinitum.” (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 262, 280.) 

 

However, to the extent Defendant Cappo asks that the
terminating sanctions order also be applied to the Victory Defendants because
they “share an interest with regards to the matters at issue,” with Defendant
Cappo, the request is denied. No explanation or evidence is offered of this
“shared interest” other than that they share the same counsel, and no authority
is cited that any such “shared interest” is grounds to apply the discovery
sanctions order on behalf of the non-moving parties. 

 

Conclusion

CAPPO MANAGEMENT XLI LLC DBA OCEAN HONDA OF WHITTIER’S MOTION FOR TERMINATING
SANCTIONS IS GRANTED. PLAINTIFF MARTHA
DELIA ANDA’S COMPLAINT, FILED ON
OCTOBER 20, 2023, IS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE AS TO DEFENDANT CAPPO
