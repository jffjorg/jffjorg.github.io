ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Aspire General Insurance Company (“Defendant”)
propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Admission, Set One,
on Defendant Michico Marie Alexander (“Defendant”) on February 27, 2024.
(Motions, Tapper Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort, Defendant
has not served responses as of the filing of the instant (1) Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; (2)
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and Request for
Sanctions on September 30, 2024. (Id. at ¶3 and Exh. B.) 
 
Based on Defendant’s failure to serve initial responses to
the discovery, the Motions to compel responses to interrogatories, and to deem
admissions admitted, are granted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.)
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to
compel initial responses or deem admissions admitted can be filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought any time
after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290; 2033.280.) Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling
Defendant to serve verified responses to the interrogatories without
objections. The Court also deems the requests for admission admitted against
Defendant.
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for
these straightforward and unopposed motions. Sanctions are awarded against
Defendant in the amount of $530.00 based on two hours of attorney time billed
at $225.00 per hour, plus $40.00 in filing fees per motion. (Motions, Tapper Decl., ¶4.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Aspire General Insurance Company’s (1) Motion to
Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions;
and (2) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, and Request
for Sanctions, are GRANTED. DEFENDANT MICHICO MARIE ALEXANDER IS TO SERVE
VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE INTERROGATORIES WITHIN 20 DAYS’
NOTICE OF THIS ORDER. ALSO WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER, DEFENDANT MICHICO
MARIE ALEXANDER IS PAY SANCTIONS OF $530.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL.
