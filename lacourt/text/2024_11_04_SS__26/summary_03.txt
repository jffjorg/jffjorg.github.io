And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's Motion for Summary Adjudication as to Plaintiff's "Reasonable Licensee" Affirmative Defense. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff's employee, Moya, was acting within the scope of his employment when he sexually abused a patient, and therefore the Plaintiff cannot prove the reasonableness of its and its agents' conduct. The Judge found that the Defendant had not carried its initial burden of proof to demonstrate that Moya was the Plaintiff's agent within the meaning of section 1424's reasonable licensee defense. The Judge also noted that the facts of this case are not analogous to those of Samantha B. v. Aurora Vista Del Mar, LLC, a case that held that sexual exploitation of patients by employees is a foreseeable hazard that arises from the circumstances of the job. The Judge concluded that the Defendant's motion was denied because the Plaintiff has not failed to prove the reasonableness of its and its agents' conduct.
