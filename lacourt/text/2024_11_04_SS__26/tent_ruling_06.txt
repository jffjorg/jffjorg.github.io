ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Dominque Hernandez (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for motor vehicle negligence against Defendants Yuliya Dudenko
(“Defendant Dudenko”) and Bryan Altman on December 4, 2023. Defendants answered
on February 8, 2024, and on September 18, 2024 filed a Notice of Change of
Handling Attorney. 
 
On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Compel Plaintiff’s Attendance at Deposition and Request for Monetary Sanctions.
Defendant Dudenko filed an opposition on October 22, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, section (a) states
in relevant part: 
 
If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must
also “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice” and “be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (b)(1), (2).) 
 
The Motion is supported by a declaration setting forth the
following facts. In April 2024, the parties’ attorneys communicated regarding a
deposition date for Defendant Dudenko and agreed to July 19, 2024. (Motion,
Shah Decl., ¶3.) On May 7, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel served the Notice of
Deposition and Request for Production of Documents. (Id. at Exh. 1.) A
few days before the deposition date, defense counsel’s office called to inform
Plaintiff’s counsel that the handling attorney had left the firm and a new
attorney would reach out. (Id. at ¶4 and Exh. 2.) A new defense attorney
never reached out to reschedule the deposition or otherwise communicate with
Plaintiff’s counsel. (Ibid.) Plaintiff’s attorney reached out several
times over the next couple of months, and finally, after requesting a new
deposition date on September 27, 2024, heard back from defense counsel’s
office. (Id. at ¶¶5-6.) The communication from defense counsel’s office
was that the attorney assigned to the case had also left but did not indicate
when another attorney would be assigned. (Id. at ¶6.)
 
The Motion does not point out that on September 19, 2024,
Defendants filed and served a Notice of Change of Handling Attorney indicating
that the new attorney assigned to represent them was Scott C. Stratham.
(Notice, filed 09/18/24.) Also, on September 30, 2024, following Plaintiff’s
counsel’s inquiry about the new attorney, defense counsel’s office responded
that Attorney Stratham was assigned to the case. (Opp., Stratham Decl., ¶¶5-6
and Exh. A.) Therefore, the Court finds that the meet and confer requirement is
not satisfied. Plaintiff’s counsel was provided a Notice of Change of Handling
Attorney on September 19, 2024 by electronic service. Plaintiff’s counsel was
also contacted on September 30, 2024 by defense counsel’s office with the name
of the handling attorney following their inquiry one business day earlier on
September 27, 2024. Yet Plaintiff filed the instant Motion on October 2, 2024.
The Court also agrees with the opposition that there has been no failure to
appear at deposition, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.250.
The deposition notice with respect to the July 19, 2024 date appears to have
been withdrawn by Plaintiff following mutual agreement with defense counsel’s
office. No new deposition notice was served. Therefore, the request to compel
Defendant Dudenko’s appearance at deposition is denied.
 
Defendant Dudenko also requests sanctions pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.020, for failing to meet and confer in good
faith. Sanctions are awarded to Defendant Dudenko in the amount of $500.00.
(Opp., Stratham Decl., ¶8.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Dominique Hernandez’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s
Attendance at Deposition and Request for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.
PLAINTIFF DOMINQUE HERNANDEZ AND COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY
ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $500.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS
ORDER.
