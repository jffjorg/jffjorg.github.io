And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the parties. The first motion is Plaintiff Martha Delia Anda's Motion to Vacate Order of Court Deeming Admitted Defendant's Requests for Admissions. The judge has denied this motion, finding that Plaintiff's counsel's conduct was not excusable neglect. The judge notes that the law firm's failure to reassign active cases of an attorney who has left the firm, inadequately supervise its staff, and appear at a hearing are not reasonable and do not constitute excusable neglect.

The second motion is Defendant Cappo Management XLI LLC DBA Ocean Honda of Whittier's Motion for Terminating Sanctions. The judge has granted this motion, finding that Plaintiff's non-compliance with the discovery orders is willful and that terminating sanctions are warranted. The judge notes that Plaintiff failed to serve responses or pay sanctions as ordered by the 20-day deadline, and that this demonstrates that Plaintiff's compliance with the Court's orders cannot be achieved through lesser sanctions.
