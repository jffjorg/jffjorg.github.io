[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
MOTION BY
  DEFENDANT HALEH ALLAHVERDI TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF SOLOMON GOLTCHE TO PROVIDE
  RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SETS ONE AND TWO AND FOR IMPOSITION OF
  MONETARY SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,171.65 AGAINST PLAINTIFF SOLOMON
  GOLTCHE AND HIS ATTORNEY OF RECORD BEHROUZ SHAFIE, ESQ. OF BEHROUZ SHAFIE
  & ASSOCIATES, JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY
 



 
Background
Plaintiff Solomon
Goltche (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on February 28, 2020. On May 30, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative Verified First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against
a number of defendants, including Haleh Allahverdi (“Allahverdi”). The
FAC alleges eleven causes of action. 
Allahverdi now moves for an order “[c]ompelling [Plaintiff] to Provide
Responses to the Form Interrogatories – General, Sets 1 and 2, without
objections, and for Imposition of Monetary Sanctions in the amount of $1,171.65
against Plaintiff and his attorney for [sic] record Behrouz Shafie, Esq. of
Behrouz Shafie & Associates, jointly and severally.” The motion is unopposed.

Discussion 
A.   
Legal Standard 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the
interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010).” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b), “[t]he party propounding
the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.” 
 
B.   
Motion to Compel 
In her declaration in support of the instant motion, Allahverdi’s
counsel indicates that on August 24, 2023, Allahverdi served, inter alia,
Form Interrogatories - General, Set No. One on Plaintiff. (Pugh Decl., ¶ 6, Ex.
4.) On September 14, 2023, Allahverdi served, inter alia, Form
Interrogatories - General, Set No. Two on Plaintiff. (Pugh Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. 6.) 
Allahverdi’s counsel states that “[p]ursuant to Plaintiff’s requests,
the deadline for his responses was extended to November 15, 2023…On the day his
responses were due, namely November 15, 2023, Plaintiff again requested thirty
days extension…On the same day, Defendant explained that no additional
extensions would be granted because this case has been pending since February
28, 2020 and the trial is scheduled for October 2024.” (Pugh Decl., ¶¶ 8-10.)
Allahverdi’s counsel states that “[a]s of the date of this Motion, Plaintiff
has not responded to the subject discovery and request for prior pleadings and
discovery and has not produced any responsive documents.” (Pugh Decl., ¶ 11.)
On April 16, 2024, an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) was held
in this matter. The Court’s April 16, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia,
that “[t]here is no appearance by Plaintiff this date. The Court sets an Order
to Show cause as follows: Order to Show Cause Re: Why the Court should not
impose $250.00 in sanctions for the failure of Plaintiff Solomon Goltche at the
meet and confer IDC is scheduled for 05/17/24 at 01:30 PM in Department 50 at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse…Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) is continued to
05/17/24 at 01:30 PM in Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.” 
On May 17, 2024, another IDC was held. The Court’s May 17, 2024 minute
order provides, inter alia, that “Plaintiff failed to appear at the
Informal Discovery Conference for a second time. Defendant Allahverdi may
proceed with the discovery motions currently set on May 28, 2024 and May 29,
2024.” 
Plaintiff does not oppose the instant motion and thus
does not provide any evidence that Plaintiff served responses to Allahverdi’s Form
Interrogatories - General, Set No. One and Form Interrogatories – General, Set
No. Two. The Court
finds that the evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff did
not timely serve responses to these discovery requests.
Therefore, the Court finds that Allahverdi is entitled to an order compelling a response to Allahverdi’s Form
Interrogatories - General, Set No. One and Form Interrogatories – General, Set
No. Two. 
C.    Request for Sanctions 
Allahverdi also
seeks monetary sanctions in connection with the motion. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter
7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” Plaintiff does not oppose the instant motion. Thus, the
Court does not find that sanctions are warranted under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c) here. 
Allahverdi also cites to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), which provides that “[m]isuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following:… (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.” However, other than citing this provision, Allahverdi’s
motion does not contain any argument as to why sanctions should be imposed
pursuant to this provision here. Allahverdi does not appear to cite any further
legal authority supporting any purported request for sanctions for the misuse
of the discovery process.  
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Allahverdi’s request for
sanctions.  
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Allahverdi’s motion to compel is granted. Allahverdi’s request for sanctions is denied.

The
Court orders Plaintiff to serve complete verified responses, without
objections, to 
Allahverdi’s s Form
Interrogatories - General, Set No. One and Form Interrogatories – General, Set
No. Two.
Allahverdi is
ordered to give notice of this Order.
