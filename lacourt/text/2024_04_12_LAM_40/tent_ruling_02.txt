 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiffs
  Michelle Mangione and High Heals Kitchen, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Further
  Responses to Requests for Production.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiffs High Heals Kitchen, Inc. and Michelle Mangione sue Defendants
Global Cannabis Applications Corp. (Global) and Does 1 through 10 pursuant to a
September 29, 2023, First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging claims of (1) Breach
of Contract and (2) Fraud.
The breach of contract claim arises from the following allegations. On or
about May 14, 2019, the parties entered into a Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA).
Pursuant to the NDA, the parties entered into protected discussions, in which
Plaintiffs shared confidential information about their proprietary intellectual
property and business strategies relating to a unique algorithm to standardize
measuring THC and CBD levels in cannabis products. Global offered to buy the
proprietary technology for $5 million, which Plaintiffs declined in favor of a
higher offer or a licensing agreement. Thereafter, Global probed into, and
Plaintiffs shared information regarding, Plaintiffs’ intended incorporation of
blockchain and data collection into their dosing algorithm and their business
plans relating to the development of universal regulatory standards for the
cannabis industry. This further sharing of information was prompted by
representations from Global that it would attempt to raise further monies for
purchase and that Global would be interested in a collaborative partnership. Global
subsequently developed a patent that incorporated the misappropriated confidential
information shared by Plaintiffs, thus breaching various specifically
identified clauses in the NDA and harming Plaintiffs as a result.
The fraud claim arises from allegations that Global
used the confidential information disclosed by Plaintiffs to develop its own
patent while simultaneously making false representations to Plaintiffs that Global
intended to either purchase their proprietary dosing technology or enter a
collaborative partnership. Global made these false representations so that it
could continue to mine Plaintiffs for confidential information about the
applicability of the technology in the cannabis industry and Plaintiffs’
strategies relating to global deployment, including Plaintiffs’ work developing
global standards for the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), all
with no intention of ever moving forward on these plans. Plaintiffs justifiably
relied on these representations in sharing the confidential information
pursuant to the NDA and were harmed by these actions in releasing proprietary
information without benefit of the bargain.
B. Relevant
Procedural History
On November 9, 2023,
Plaintiffs served their Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (RDPs,
Set One).
On January 18, 2024, Global
served its responses to RPDs, Set One.
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiffs’
counsel emailed Global’s counsel to request an extension for a
motion to compel further responses to March 19, 2024, to which Global’s counsel
agreed.
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiffs’
counsel emailed Global’s counsel to request a further extension to
April 5, 2024.
Between March 11, 2024,
and March 13, 2024, counsel met and conferred, with Global’s counsel
ultimately refusing to stipulate to a further extension.
On March 14, 2024,
after review of Global’s responses, Plaintiffs’ counsel requested
further responses to RPDs, Set One, from Global.
On March 15, 2024,
counsel met and conferred via Zoom, with Global’s counsel
only agreeing to meet and confer as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 17 and 19, according
to Plaintiffs’ counsel.
On March 16, 2024, Plaintiffs’
counsel emailed a meet and confer letter stating the grounds for a motion to
compel further discovery.
C. Motion Before the
Court
On March 19, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed a motion to compel further responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 8, 22-43,
46-48, and 57-62.
On March 28, 2024, Global
filed a supplemental response to RPDs, Set One, No. 8.
On March 29, 2024, Global
filed an opposition to Plaintiffs’ March 19, 2024, motion. Global’s opposition
fails to attach a separate statement, hampering the Court’s ability to address Global’s
arguments in support of its opposition.
On April 5, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a reply to Global’s opposition.
Plaintiffs’ motion is
now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Compel Further
Production
A.
Legal Standard
A
motion to compel a further response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory
answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories, demands to produce,
or requests for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
To
request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the
production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra,
at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the
responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, complete, or
evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s
objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
B.
Analysis
1. RPDs, Set One, Nos. 8, 22-43, 46-48,
and 57-62 
RPDs,
Set One, Nos. 8, 22-43, 46-48, and 57-62 can generally be summarized as
follows:
(1)
RPDs, Set One, No. 8 requests documents relating to Global’s drafting of patent
applications in Canada;
(2)
RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-39 request documents and communications relating to the
development, marketing, and sales of Global’s products Efixxi, clearESG, and
Prescriptii (hereafter, not including “any other competitive [Global]
products,” the Global Products);
(3)
RPDs, Set One, Nos. 40-43 request documents showing the total gross and net
revenues, sales prices, quantity sold, and gross profits, net profits, and
profit margins for each of the Global Products;
(4)  RPDs, Set One, Nos. 46-48 request documents
relating to the testing, commercialization, and licensing policies for the Global
Products (including royalties and other types of payments); and
(5)
RPDs, Set One, Nos. 57-62 request documents and/or communications relating to
business plans for use of the Global Products (including profit projections)
from January 1, 2018 to the present, customer feedback of the Global Products,
dates of design and development for the Global Products, presentation material
used at seminars, exhibitions, convention, or trade shows related to the Global
Products, and user manuals for the Global Products.
(Mot.,
Ohanian Decl., Ex. A.)
2. Global’s Responses 
In
response to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 8, 22-43, 46-48, and 57-62, Global served
objection-only responses based on the following objections:
(1)
Lack of relevance or no likelihood to lead to discovery of admissible evidence
(RPDs, Set One, Nos. 8, 22-43, 46-48, 57-62);
(2)
Requests are not described with the requisite reasonable particularity (RPDs,
Set One, Nos. 8, 22-39, 46-48, 57-60);
(3)
Because of point (2), the requests are overbroad, oppressive, and unduly
burdensome (RPDs, Set One, Nos. 8, 22-39, 46-48, 57-60);
(4)
Overbreadth as to scope, time, and/or jurisdiction (RPDs, Set One, Nos. 8
[includes jurisdiction], 22-43, 46-48, 57-62 [no jurisdiction]);
(5)
Requests seek confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information (RPDs,
Set One, Nos. 8, 22-43, 46-48, 57-62);
(6)
Attorney-client and/or work product privileges (RPDs, Set One, No. 8);
(7)
Vagueness and ambiguity as to term at issue (RPDs, Set One, Nos. 46-48); and
(8)
Compound question (RPDs, Set One, Nos. 60).
(Mot.,
Ohanian Decl., Ex. B.)
3. Court’s Determination
a. RPDs, Set One, No. 8: MOOT.
The Court determines that
Plaintiffs’ motion is MOOT as to RPDs, Set One, No. 8.
Further supplemental responses were
served in relation to this RPD by Global on March 28, 2024. (Opp’n, Chaney
Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. 1; see Reply, pp. 3-6 [discussing RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-39,
40-43, 46-48, 57-62 but no RPDs, Set One, No. 8].) A further § 2031.210 or §
2031.320 motion may be brought as applicable.
b. RPDs,
Set One, Nos. 22-39, 40-43, 46-48, and 57-62: GRANTED.
i. Relevance
The Court finds that discovery
relating to the Global Products— Efixxi, clearESG, and Prescriptii—is facially
relevant.
“‘Relevant evidence’ means
evidence, including evidence relevant to the credibility of a witness or
hearsay declarant, having any tendency in reason to prove or disprove any
disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action.”
(Evid. Code, § 210.)
As described by the moving papers, evidence
relating to the Global Products can be relevant because it may lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence that tends to prove or disprove “the extent of
Defendant’s use of Plaintiffs’ innovative technologies, and to determine the
damages resulting from Defendant’s breach of the NDA and fraud.” (Mot., p. 11
[argued in relation to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-30, 46-49].) Otherwise stated,
discovery into the Global Products is relevant insofar as Plaintiffs seek to
determine whether the Global Products were produced by wrongfully using proprietary
information obtained by Defendants from Plaintiffs in breach of the parties’
agreements and laws relating to fraud.
Regarding RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-39,
40-43, and 57-62, the discovery of development evidence for the Global Products
could permit discovery into, for example, whether the Global Products are
derivative of Plaintiffs’ proprietary information. And the discovery of
marketing, sales, business plans, customer feedback, and seminar, etc. evidence
for the Global Products can permit discovery into, for example, when these
products came into being, the profits earned by Global as a result, and damages
suffered by Plaintiffs as measured by Global’s profits or Plaintiffs’
corresponding losses.
Regarding RPDs, Set One, Nos.
46-48, the discovery of testing, commercialization, and licensing of the Global
Products can, for example, lead to evidence that Global’s patents derive from
Plaintiffs’ proprietary information, e.g., lack of right to sell products based
on illegality.
ii. Global’s
Initial Objections
The Court first determines that the
relevance objection raised by Global in its initial responses to RPDs, Set One,
Nos. 22-39, 40-43, 46-48, and 57-62 lacks merit as discussed in the preceding
subsection.
Second, the Court determines that the
requests are described with sufficient particularity. Global’s objection based
on failure to describe a specific type of communications or documents in
relation to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 8, 22-39, 46-48, and 57-60 lacks merit because
the Court determines that these requests are qualified as involving the development,
marketing, sales, testing, commercialization, licensing policies, business
plans, etc. of Global’s products.
Third, Global’s objections that
RPDs, Set One, Nos. 8, 22-39, 46-48, and 57-60 are overbroad, oppressive, and
unduly burdensome also fail, for the same reasons.
Fourth, the scope and time of the
requests is not overbroad for two reasons. The requests are necessarily limited
by the parties’ interactions, which are alleged to have taken place in 2018 and
2019. Moreover, evidence of when the Global Products came into being, how they
came into being, and the monies derived therefrom is relevant to damages if
Plaintiffs can prove that the Global Products are derivative of Plaintiffs’
proprietary information.
Fifth, the confidential,
proprietary, and trade secret information objections are only cursorily stated
in the initial objections to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 8, 22-43, 46-48, and 57-62,
the opposition points and authorities fail to develop this objection, and the
record completely fails to show that Global filed a separate statement.
Sixth, the attorney-client
privilege can be raised subject to a privilege log or protective order, as
applicable. Moreover, as with the objections discussed in the preceding
paragraph, Global has insufficiently elaborated this objection.
Last, the vagueness, ambiguity, and
compound question objections are without merit. RPDs, Set One, No. 8, 46-48,
and 60 are clear.
iii. Opposition
Arguments
Regarding RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-39,
the Court finds no merit to the argument that the sought-after discovery does
not relate to the already-established universe of allegations in the operative
pleadings. First, the standard is whether the production requests could lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Here, for example, RPDs, Set One, Nos.
22-39 could support a breach of the NDA insofar as information wrongfully
obtained by Global in breach of those agreements could have resulted in the
development of the Global Products. Second, the discovery could lead to the
production of documents showing additional harms and injuries to Plaintiffs as
a result of wrongful conduct by Defendants.
The Court finds some merit in Global’s
argument that the causal link between information derived from the parties’
interactions and the development of the Global Products is not entirely clear.
(See Opp’n, pp. 5-9.) For example, the moving papers do not indicate whether
Plaintiffs have knowledge to establish that Global created the Global Products
only after interacting with Plaintiffs and entering the NDA, supporting an
inference that the creation of the Global Products benefitted from use of
Plaintiffs’ propriety information. However, absent evidence from Global that
these products were developed prior to interactions with Plaintiffs, the Court
finds that the requested information remains discoverable. This opposition
argument is thus unavailing.
Any possible abuse or intrusiveness
in RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-39, 40-43, 46-48, and 57-62 can be mitigated through production
under the existing protective order signed on January 9, 2024 (Opp’n, p. 9).
Global’s past production of
documents relating to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 40-43 is an insufficient ground
absent a proper showing of undue prejudice, which is not present here. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2019.030, subds. (a)(1)-(2); Carter
v. Superior Court (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 994, 997 [duplicate discovery as to
the same subject permitted in different forms—§ 2031 production requests and
deposition production requests—even if duplicative, absent § 2019.030 showing].)
Global fails to attach a separate
statement to the opposition papers, thus failing to further elaborate on Global’s
arguments for denying Plaintiffs’ motion as to each request involved in RPDs,
Set One, Nos. 22-39, 40-43, 46-48, and 57-62.
The Court notes that Global fails
to raise objections in relation to its foreign status, thus waiving objections
for lack of jurisdiction as to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-39, 40-43, 46-48, and
57-62. (See Mot., Ohanian Decl., Ex. B, Response to RPDs, Set One, No. 8
[raising jurisdiction]; cf. id. at Responses to RPDs, Set One, Nos. 22-39,
40-43, 46-48, 57-62 [no jurisdiction argument].)
iv. Final
Determination
Based on the above determinations,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion, with any documents designated as
Confidential subject to the Protective Order entered in this case. 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiffs Michelle Mangione and
High Heals Kitchen, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for
Production is MOOT in part and GRANTED in part:
(1) MOOT as to RPDs, Set One, No.
8; and
(2) GRANTED as to RPDs, Set One,
Nos. 22-39, 40-43, 46-48, and 57-62.
