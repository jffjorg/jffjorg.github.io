Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part Plaintiffs Michelle Mangione and High Heals Kitchen, Inc.'s motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The court finds that the requests for production are relevant and non-duplicative, and that the objections raised by Global are without merit. The court grants the motion as to requests for production Nos. 22-39, 40-43, 46-48, and 57-62, but denies it as to request No. 8. The court also finds that Global's objections to the requests are premature and that the court will issue a further order regarding the production of documents.
