I. Background
A. Pleadings
On April 5, 2019, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Taft
Electric Company, Inc. (Taft Electric) initiated this action by filing a
Complaint alleging claims of various breach of contract and related claims
against Defendant/Cross-Complainant Cal-City Construction, Inc. (Cal-City) and
Defendants Antelope Valley-East Kern Water Agency (Antelope Water), Western
Surety Company (Western Surety), and Does 1-25.
On June 4, 2019,
Cal-City filed a Cross-Complaint alleging a breach of contract claim against
Taft Electric.
B. Procedural
History
Between November 6 and
16, 2023, a trial took place in this action. On November 22, 2023, the Court
took the matter under submission.
On December 13, 2023, the
Court issued a tentative statement of decision.
On January 30, 2024, after
considering the objections and holding a hearing, the Court issued a final
statement of decision after trial.
That same day, the
Court entered judgment, and the clerk gave notice of entry of judgment.
C. Motion Before the
Court
On March 14, 2024, Taft
Electric filed a memorandum of costs.
That same day, Taft
Electric filed a motion for attorney’s fees and costs related to the trial
court proceedings.
On April 2, 2024,
Cal-City filed an opposition to Taft Electric’s motion.
On April 5, 2024, Taft
Electric filed a reply to Cal-City’s opposition.
Taft Electric’s memo of
costs and motion for fees and costs are now before the Court.
 
II. Motion for Fees and Costs
After Trial
A.
Fees: GRANTED.
1. Legal Standard
A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4), (b).) Attorney’s fees are also recoverable as
costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5,
subd. (a)(10).)
The
Court begins this inquiry “with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (PLCM Group).) From there,
the “lodestar figure may then be adjusted [according to a multiplier
enhancement] based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order
to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.” (Ibid.)
Relevant multiplier factors include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
No
specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations for attorney’s fees are
required; the record need only show that the attorney’s fees were awarded
according to the “lodestar” or “touchstone” approach. (Rebney v. Wells Fargo
Bank (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1344, 1349, disagreed with on other grounds in In
re Marriage of Demblewski (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 232, 236, fn. 7
[disagreement as to statement of decision requirements]; see Yu v. Superior
Court of Los Angeles County (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 636, fn. 6 [disapproving
dictum In re Marriage of Demblewski re: whether motions may be filed
before a referee’s decision is entered].) 
2. Analysis
Taft
Electric seeks $548,256 in legal fees for 1,345.20 billable hours expended on
this action by counsel between October 13, 2017, and February 19, 2024. (Mot.,
p. 4 at Attorney Fees; Mot., Yokomizo Decl., Ex. B [summary at p. 142].)
The
Court briefly notes that it considers the opposition because although it was untimely
filed eight court days before the hearing (see Reply, p. 2), plaintiff has had
an opportunity to fully respond and there would be no prejudice to the plaintiff
in the Court’s consideration of the opposition.
The
Court also notes that Taft Electric is entitled to fees as the prevailing party
at trial and based on a contract with Cal-City providing for attorney’s fees,
which the Court noted in the final statement of decision. (1/30/24 Statement of
Decision, pp. 34-35 at § 6.)
Although
Taft stated that it would be entitled to additional fees for responding to the
reply and appearing at the hearing, no additional fees were sought in the Reply.
a. Reasonable Fee Rate
After review, the Court determines
that the fees sought by Cal-City are eminently reasonable.
As described by the moving papers,
the rates are: “$385 per hour in 2017 to $410 per hour from January 2018 for
Mr. Hurst and $400 per hour in 2021 to $450 per hour for Mr. Yokomizo.” (Mot.,
p. 7.) Counsel’s declaration attached to the moving papers describes counsel’s
legal experience. (Mot., Yokomizo Decl., ¶¶ 7, 13, 15-16.) The Court itself observed
the quality of advocacy at trial at least as to Mr. Yokomizo (as Mr. Hurst did
not participate at trial), and based thereon, can state that these hourly rates
are low in comparison to the high quality of advocacy.
b. Reasonable
Hours
After review, the Court determines
that the 1,345.20 billable hours for which Taft Electric seeks recovery are
reasonable. (See Mot., pp. 7-9; Mot., Yokomizo Decl., Ex. B.)
Throughout parts of this litigation
and at trial, Defendants unreasonably opposed a large number of issues, forcing
Taft Electric to litigate them all. Defendants
also entered into stipulations just weeks before trial as to multiple change
orders, which delayed resolution on matters that could have been resolved much
sooner. Cal-City cannot tenaciously litigate this action only to now be heard to
complain that the time spent by Taft Electric’s counsel in response was
excessive. (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1141.)
The Court
otherwise notes that spending 1,345.20 hours on this action over six years and
four months amounts to 17.7 hours spent on this case per month and 212.4 hours
per year. The tasks listed in Exhibit B to the Yokomizo declaration are
described with sufficient particularity, do not show block billing, and are
reasonable in relation to the nature of the task and the times required to
perform those tasks. (Mot., Yokomizo Decl., Ex. B.) The Court finds that the
matter was complex and hard-fought, and that the Plaintiff’s attorneys
exercised skill and attention to detail throughout the litigation.
c. Multiplier
Enhancement Award
The moving papers do not request a
multiplier enhancement award.
d. Fees
Conclusion
Fees are thus GRANTED in the amount
of $548,256.
B. Costs: GRANTED.
1. Legal
Standard
A prevailing party is entitled to
recover costs as a matter of right. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subds. (a)(4),
(b).) Attorney’s fees are also recoverable as costs when authorized by
contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10); see also Kaufman
v. Diskeeper Corp. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1, 8-9 [Civ. Code, § 1717 fees
and costs motion not subject to Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700’s requirements]).
2. Analysis
a. Costs
Generally
The Court GRANTS Taft Electric’s
requests for costs.
First, the Court notes that any
objections to costs based on the limits of allowable costs in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5 is inapplicable where the scope of allowable costs
here was set by the parties’ contractual agreement, which permits an award of
“all costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees, related to the presentation
and prosecution of such claims.” (Complaint, Ex. A, Jan. 11, 2017, Subcontract,
§ 13.) That language is not qualified to costs that are allowable under section
1033.5, but rather, includes all costs and expenses related to the reasonable presentation
and prosecution of the claims. (Ibid.; see Hart v. Clear Recon Corp.
(2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 322, 326 [reciprocity of unilateral fees provision].) For
these reasons, the Court’s analysis is not restricted by allowable costs under
section 1033.5.
A review of the amounts claimed in
costs—including the internal communications, mediation, deposition, and
transcript costs addressed in the opposition and as rebutted in the reply—shows
that the costs requested are reasonable, as supported by documentary evidence.
(Memo of Costs, p. 1; Mot., Yokomizo Decl., Ex. C [documentary evidence].)
All the sought-after costs are thus
proper and may be awarded.
The Court nevertheless separately
analyzes the reasonability of the expert costs.
b. Expert
Costs
Cal-City argues that expert witness
fees should not be recoverable, because no expert witnesses were ordered by the
court (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5 subd. (a)(8)), and because fees of experts not
ordered by the court are not allowable as costs, “except when expressly
authorized by law.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5 subd. (b)(1).) However, as
pointed out by Taft, here, the contract specified that the parties agreed to
the award to the prevailing party of “attorney’s fees, witness fees, and other
expenses related to the preparation and presentation of its case in a
reasonable amount.” (Complaint, Ex. A, Jan. 11, 2017, Subcontract, § 13.) 
            As pointed
out by Taft, this Court has already decided that Taft is entitled to reasonable
expert fees based on this contract provision. (1/30/24 Statement of Decision at
p. 34:4-6.) This is an appropriate conclusion, based on California caselaw. In Applied
Medical Distribution Corp. v. Jarrells (2024) 100 Cal.App.5th 556, 226-227
(Jarrells), the court of appeal was presented with a similar contractual
provision; in that case, the provision provided that the prevailing party was
entitled to “reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses incurred in
obtaining such relief.” 
There, the court first noted that,
in Thrifty Payless, Inc. v. Mariners Mile Gateway, LLC (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1050, 1066 (Thrifty), under a contractual provision, expert
expenses are not necessarily recoverable where the agreement merely mentions
“fees” and “costs,” but are recoverable where the parties agreed to recovery of
“expert fees.” (Jarrells, supra, 100 Cal.App.5th at p. 226.) 
The Jarrells court then
rejected the losing party’s argument that the term “expert witness” must appear
in the contractual language, holding that “nothing in Thrifty Payless—or
in any other case cited to us by either party—holds that to authorize recovery
of out-of-pocket expenses beyond recoverable statutory costs, contracting
parties must specify precisely what expenses they are referring to. We see no
basis to require parties who wish to agree to authorize recovery of expenses
beyond statutory costs to specifically enumerate every category of additional
‘expenses’ they intend their contract to embrace …. We therefore hold expert
fees were recoverable by [plaintiff] pursuant to the Agreement to the extent
they were reasonable in amount and reasonably incurred to obtain equitable
relief.” (Jarrells, supra, 100 Cal.App.5th at p. 227.)
The Court here finds that the
parties similarly did not limit their contractual language to recovery of
“fees” and “costs,” which would have limited them to the costs recoverable
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5. The Court also finds that the
expert fees requested here were reasonable in amount and “related to the
preparation and presentation of its case.” Both sides had experts, and though
it is true that plaintiff’s expert worked with plaintiff’s counsel at the
beginning of the case as well as through trial, the Court finds that the early
work was necessary, as it related to the presentation of the case in court if
the matter did not settle. At trial, plaintiff’s expert’s careful and credible
testimony provided a calculation and explanation of the damages requested to
the Court, rebutted defendant’s expert testimony, and was largely adopted by
the Court.
Plaintiff’s request for $94,606.25
in expert witness fees is thus GRANTED as a part of the costs and reasonable
expenses. 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Taft Electric Company’s Motion for an Award of
Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED in the amount of $548,256 in attorney fees
and $143,856.52 in costs.
