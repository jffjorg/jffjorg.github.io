And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has continued the hearing on Airbnb's demurrer to a date to be determined. The judge has also ordered Airbnb's counsel to meet and confer with Plaintiff Kimberly Costley's counsel regarding the demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing the meet and confer efforts. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the parties did not adequately meet and confer, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, which requires parties to meet and confer in person or by telephone to determine whether an agreement can be reached to resolve objections to the demurrer. The judge finds that Airbnb's counsel only met and conferred with Plaintiff's counsel via email, which does not satisfy the code requirements.
