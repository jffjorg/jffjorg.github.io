Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Malik Crawford’s Motion for Approval of
Private Attorneys General Act Settlement Agreement and Release, Award of
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs, General Release Fee, and Settlement Administration
Costs is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This is a wage and hour
action brought pursuant to the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA). Defendants
West Covina Nissan and West Covina Motor Group, LLC (West Covina Motor Group) employed
Plaintiff Malik Crawford as an hourly non-exempt employee. On July 6, 2021, Crawford
filed a complaint individually and on behalf of other aggrieved employees
against West Covina Nissan, West Covina Motor Group, and Does 1 through 100,
alleging violations of Labor Code section 2698 et seq. for (1) failure to pay
overtime, (2) failure to provide meal periods, (3) failure to provide rest
periods, (4) failure to pay minimum wage, (5) failure to timely pay wages upon
termination, (6) failure to timely pay wages during employment, (7) failure to
provide complete and accurate wage statements, (8) failure to keep complete and
accurate payroll records, and (9) failure to reimburse necessary
business-related expenses and costs.
On August 20, 2024, Crawford
filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against West Covina Nissan; West Covina
Motor Group; Trophy Automative Dealer Group, LLS (Trophy); and Does 100, alleging
the same cause of action.
On October 14, 2024, Crawford
filed the present motion. A hearing on the motion and an OSC Re: Dismissal are
set for December 10, 2024.
ANALYSIS
Crawford
moves for court approval of PAGA settlement pursuant to Labor Code section
2699, subdivision (l). For the following reasons, the court GRANTS Crawford’s motion.
Legal Standard
Labor
Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2) states:¿“The superior court shall review
and approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part. The
proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same time that it
is submitted to the court.”  “A copy of the superior court’s judgment in
any civil action filed pursuant to this part and any other order in that action
that either provides for or denies an award of civil penalties under this code
shall be submitted to the agency within 10 days after entry of the judgment or
order.”  (Lab. Code, §2699, subd. (l)(3).)
While
PAGA requires court review and approval of settlements, it does not specify the
standard or criteria for such review. (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 56, 75 (Moniz).) Thus, courts have generally applied the
same review standards used for class actions, which inquire “independently
whether a PAGA settlement is fair and reasonable.” (Id., at p. 77.)
To
determine if a PAGA settlement is fair and reasonable, courts consider factors
“including the strength of the plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the
proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of further litigation, and the
settlement amount.” (Ibid.) Lastly, courts will also consider if the
settlement is “adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor
law violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor
laws.” (Ibid.)
Discussion
In
this case, West Covina Nissan, West Covina Motor Group, and Trophy
(collectively Defendants) have agreed to settle the present matter with
Crawford for the gross amount of $145,000.00. (Mayer Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. 1, §
3(a).) From this, the following would be deducted: attorney fees ($58,000.00 or
40% of gross settlement amount), litigation costs ($16,547.96), a general
release fee to Crawford ($5,000.00), and settlement administration costs (up to
$3,400.00). (Mayer Decl., Ex. 1, § 3(a).) This leaves a net settlement amount
of $62,052.04. Pursuant to Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (i), seventy-five
percent is payable to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA), and twenty-five
percent is payable to the aggrieved employees.  Thus, the sum of $46,539.03
is payable to the LWDA, and $15,513.01 will be divided among approximately 160
employees. (Mayer Decl., Ex. 1, § 3(b).)
Civil Penalties
In
the FAC, Crawford seeks civil penalties for thirteen different violations of
the Labor Code including (1) failure to pay overtime in violation of Labor Code
sections 510 and 1198; (2) failure to provide meal periods in violation of
Labor Code sections 226.7 and 512, subdivision (a); (3) failure to provide rest
periods in violation of Labor Code section 226.7; (4) failure to pay legally
required minimum wages in violation of Labor Code sections 1194, 1197, and
1197.1; (5) failure to pay wages upon termination in violation of Labor Code
sections 201 and 202; (6) failure to timely pay wages during employment in
violation of Labor Code section 204; (7) failure to provide complete and
accurate wage statements in violation of Labor Code section 226, subdivision
(a); (8) failure to keep complete and accurate payroll records in violation of
Labor Code section 1174, subdivision (d); (9) failure to reimburse necessary
business-related expenses and costs in violation of Labor Code sections 2800
and 2802; (10) failure to timely produce personnel records in violation of Labor
Code sections 1198.5; (11) failure to provide sick leave in violation of Labor
Code sections 227.3 and 245 et seq.; (12) failure to pay reporting time pay in
violation of Labor Code section 1198; and (13) failure to provide a day of rest
in violation of Labor Code sections 551, 552, and 1198.
In
analyzing the strengths, risks, and complexity of this case, Crawford’s counsel
believes there is sufficient evidence to support the allegations that Defendants
violated the Labor Code. (Mayer Decl., ¶ 15.) Crawford’s counsel estimates the
total value of all stacked civil penalties are $5,639,150.00, including $319,300.00
for failure to pay overtime wages, $794,250.00 for failure to pay minimum
wages, $319,300.00 for failure to provide compliant meal periods, $319,300.00
for failure to provide compliant rest periods, $15,400.00 for failure to pay
wages upon termination, $3,153,000.00 for failure to provide compliant wage
statements, $80,000.00 for failure to maintain payroll records, and $638,600.00
for failure to reimburse necessary business expenses. (Mayer Suppl. Decl., ¶ 9-10)
If penalties are assessed on a per capita basis per individual, Crawford’s
counsel estimates the total value of the civil penalties would be reduced to $312,000.00.
(Mayer Suppl. Decl., ¶ 10) If penalties are assessed on an unstacked basis, Crawford’s
counsel estimates the total value of the civil penalties would be reduced to
$327,000.00. (Mayer Suppl. Decl., ¶ 11.)
Nonetheless,
Crawford’s counsel also acknowledges there is a risk a court could find the
current action unmanageable and require individual inquiries into these alleged
violations. (Mayer Decl., ¶ 15.) In addition, Crawford’s counsel points to
defenses or challenges that can be raised by the Defendants to reduce or eliminate
recovery including that they did not engage in a uniform policy and systematic
scheme of wage abuse, that they have legally compliant employment policies and
practices, that the present action should be subject to arbitration, that
standing is lacking, that discovery or trial should be limited or bifurcated,
and that heightened or cumulative penalties are inappropriate. (Mayer Decl., ¶
17-19.) As a result, Crawford’s counsel suggests a reduction of 60% to 85% of
the potential civil penalties is reasonable. (Mayer Suppl. Decl., ¶ 9-11.)
Here,
the court determines that the civil penalties agreed upon are fair and reasonable.
While the court acknowledges that the total award is only 2% of the maximum
amount of civil penalties available and 46% of the civil penalties available if
calculated on a per capita basis, the court finds this amount takes into
account the legal issues and complexities of the case and the risk to the
parties in proceeding.
Attorney
Fees and Costs
Pursuant
to Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (g), an employee who prevails in a PAGA
action is entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs. Here, Crawford
requests attorney fees in the amount of $58,000.00 (40% of gross settlement
amount) and litigation costs in the amount of $16,547.96. (Mayer Decl., ¶ 21,
23.) In support of this request, Crawford’s counsel provided a declaration that
outlined their experience and qualifications. (Mayer Decl., ¶ 2-6.) Crawford’s
counsel also provided an overview of the work performed by counsel in the
present action. (Mayer Decl., ¶ 13-14.) Considering counsel’s experience and work
performed as well as the contingent risk borne by counsel, the court finds the
requested attorney fees are fair and reasonable. Crawford’s requested
litigation costs also appear to be proper. (Mayer Decl., ¶ 23, Ex. 5.) Thus, the
requested award of attorney fees and costs is granted.
General
Release Fee
While
a plaintiff may receive reasonable enhancement payments as a class
representative, courts must balance such an award between the interests of compensating
the plaintiff for the expense or risk they incurred in bringing the suit while
avoiding creating a perverse incentive for the plaintiff to accept suboptimal
settlements in exchange for a higher enhancement payment. (See Munoz v. BCI
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 399, 412.)
Here, the
settlement agreement awards Crawford a general release fee of $5,000.00. (Mayer Decl., ¶ 24, Ex. 1, § 3(a).) In support of this request,
Crawford submitted a declaration outlining Crawford’s involvement in the
present action. (Crawford Decl., ¶ 3-6.) Considering Crawford’s involvement and
the risks taken, the court determines that a general release fee of $5,000 is
reasonable. (See Uribe v. Crown Building Maintenance Co. (2021) 70
Cal.App.5th 986, 995, 998 [noting trial court reduced request for $10,000
enhancement award in a $370,000 PAGA settlement to $5,000].)
Settlement
Administration Costs
Crawford
requests a maximum amount of $3,400.00 to be set aside for settlement
administration costs. (Motion, p. 29:20-30:3; Mayer Decl., Ex. 1, § 3(a).) The parties have
agreed to retain Simpluris Inc. as the settlement administrator. (Mayer Decl.,
¶ 11.) The court finds this allocation to be fair and reasonable.
CONCLUSION
Based
on the foregoing, Crawford’s motion for approval of PAGA settlement is GRANTED.
