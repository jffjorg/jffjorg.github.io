And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion by Baxter, Bailey, & Associates, Inc. (Baxter Bailey) to vacate the dismissal of Aldi Foods Inc. and Woods Distribution Solutions LLC. The court has denied the motion. Baxter Bailey seeks to amend the previous dismissal of Aldi and Woods, but the court lacks jurisdiction to consider the request as it was not filed within six months of the original dismissal date. The court also disagrees with Baxter Bailey's argument that the court has jurisdiction to consider the request under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, which pertains to setting aside default judgments, not dismissals. The court has cited several authorities to support its decision, including Manson v. Black and Gibble v. Car-Lene Research, Inc. The court concludes that Baxter Bailey's motion to vacate the dismissal is denied.
