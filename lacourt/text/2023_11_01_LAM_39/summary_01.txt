Mr. Javidzad has had two serious heart incidents including a heart attack and has been less available to assist in this case, and I have been overwhelmed with trial preparation in three trials. . . . ' This does not provide sufficient information to explain why Plaintiff Steve Javidzad could not provide discovery for three full months."

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Steve Javidzad and Laleh Javidzad v. Eric Adler, Adler Construction, Inc., and Adler Ventures, Inc. The case involves a dispute over a rental property in Beverly Hills, where the Javidzads claim they were wrongfully evicted by the Defendants. The Defendants have filed motions to compel discovery responses from the Javidzads, which the Court has granted in part.

The Court has also ordered the Javidzads to pay monetary sanctions to the Defendants for their failure to provide discovery responses.

The Court has denied the Defendants' request for punitive damages and attorney's fees, as the Javidzads have failed to allege any specific facts to support these claims. The Court has also ordered the Javidzads to file a second amended complaint within 30 days, or they will waive their right to seek punitive damages and attorney's fees.
