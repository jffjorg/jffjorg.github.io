And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling advances and continues the hearing on Pitzer College's motion to declare Schultz to be a vexatious litigant from November 1, 2023, to December 11, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. The hearing was initially set for November 1, 2023, but the Court denies the motion without prejudice due to insufficient notice. Defendant's counsel failed to provide sufficient notice, adding 10 days to the notice period due to mailing the motion from out-of-state. The Court authorizes Schultz to file a written opposition to the motion, which must be served by November 14, 2023, if mailed from out-of-state, November 20, 2023, if mailed from within California, or November 27, 2023, if served via email. The reply brief must be filed based on statutory deadlines for the new hearing date.
