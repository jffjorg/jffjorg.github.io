 Case Number:  23STCV09474    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  39 Georges Mikhael v.
Carwell, LLC, et al. 
Case No. 23STCV09474
Motion to Compel
Arbitration
 
            Plaintiff
Georges Mikhael (“Plaintiff”) filed this warranty and fraud action against the dealership,
Carwell, LLC, doing business as Mercedes-Benz of Southbay (the “Dealership”)
and the manufacturer, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (the “Manufacturer”).  Now, both Defendants move to compel arbitration
in this matter.  The motion is granted as
to the Dealership, as there is a valid arbitration agreement, which covers this
dispute.  Plaintiff argues that he may
rescind this agreement and that Defendants waived the right to seek arbitration,
but the agreement provides that the arbitrator will resolve disputes over the
interpretation, scope, or validity of the agreement.  Therefore, Plaintiff must raise these issues
in the arbitration.  The Court denies the
motion as to the Manufacturer, per Ford
Motor Warranty Cases (2023)
89 Cal.App.5th 1324, 1335-1336.
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the Court orders
as follows:
 
            1.         The
Court grants the motion as it relates to Carwell, LLC doing business as
Mercedes Benz of Southbay and orders the parties to proceed to arbitration.
 
            2.         The
Court denies the motion as it relates to Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC. 
 
            3.         The
Court stays the case pending resolution of the arbitration.  The Court issues an Order to Show Cause why
the stay should not be lifted for July 1, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The Court orders Plaintiff’s counsel to file
a status report on the arbitration two weeks before the hearing.
 
            4.         Counsel
for Carwell, LLC shall provide notice and file proof of such with the
Court.
