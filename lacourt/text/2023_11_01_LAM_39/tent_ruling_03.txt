 Case Number:  23STCV10042    Hearing Date:   November 1, 2023    Dept:  39 Brendan
Schultz v. Pitzer College, Case No. 23STCV10042
 
Defendant
Pitzer College (“Defendant”) previously filed a motion to declare Plaintiff to
be a vexatious litigant under Code of Civil Procedure section 391 et seq. 
The Court denied the motion without prejudice and authorized Defendant to
notice a new motion for hearing on November 1, 2023.  (See Court’s Minute
Order, dated September 11, 2023).  The Court ordered “Defendant’s counsel
to file and serve the motion sufficiently in advance to afford statutory notice
. . . .”  (Ibid.)
 
Defendant’s
counsel filed this motion on October 11, 2023, and the motion was mailed from
out-of-state, which adds ten (10) days to the notice period, per Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005.  Because Defendant’s counsel did not afford
sufficient notice, the Court cannot hear the motion on November 1, 2023.
 
Therefore,
the Court advances and continues the hearing on Defendant’s motion to declare
Plaintiff to be a vexatious litigant from November 1, 2023, to December 11,
2023, at 8:30 a.m.  The Court advances and continues the Order to Show
Cause why the stay of discovery should be lifted from November 1, 2023, to
December 11, 2023, at 8:30 a.m.  
 
The
Court authorizes Plaintiff to file a written opposition to the motion based on
the statutory deadline for the new hearing date.  The opposition shall be
due on November 14, 2023, if served by mail from out-of-state; November 20,
2023, if served by mail from within California; or November 27, 2023, if served
via email.  The reply brief shall be due based upon statutory deadlines
for the new hearing date.  
 
The
Court’s clerk shall serve this order upon Defendant’s counsel. 
Defendant’s counsel shall provide notice and file proof of such with the
Court.
