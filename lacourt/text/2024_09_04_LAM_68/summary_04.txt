And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for trial preference filed by the plaintiff, Wendy Viridinia Solano-Castro, on behalf of her minor daughter, Rebecca, who would have been under 14 years old at the time of the filing of the motion. The plaintiff sought to have the case given preferential treatment due to the minor's age, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (b). However, the judge found that the language of the statute requires a finding of the proper age at the time of the hearing, and since Nicole, the minor, will be over 14 years old at the time of the hearing, the court cannot grant the motion. The judge also noted that there is no authority on the specific issue of whether a minor can preserve preference by filing a motion prior to the hearing. The case is set for a case management conference on September 6, 2024.
