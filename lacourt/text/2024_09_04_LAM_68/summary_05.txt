And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by the defendants. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the cross-complaint and the statute of limitations.

The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the causes of action for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, finding that the cross-complaint sufficiently states the elements of these causes of action.

The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the declaratory relief cause of action, finding that the cross-complaint fails to state a prospective claim.

The judge has given the defendants 30 days to amend the cross-complaint to cure the defects identified in the demurrer. If the defendants do not file an amended cross-complaint, the plaintiff will be required to answer the remaining causes of action within 10 days of the lapse of the amendment deadline.

The judge has also set a case management conference and OSC re: Failure to Obtain Defaults for October 11, 2024.
