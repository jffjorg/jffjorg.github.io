```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion of Satila America Corporation to expunge the mechanics lien filed by Current Electric, Inc. The motion is based on a factual challenge to the amount in dispute and identified in the mechanics lien. The court finds that the Declaration of Ted Grebelius lacks specific evidence of the total contract price, and/or value of work and material provided, and instead only cites to records of change orders and payments made to other third-party contractors to allegedly complete the work, with assumptions of liquidated damages and valuations. The court also finds that the unchallenged declaration of Michael Delaney sufficiently specific and explanatory. The court declines to find a matter of law or in equity that Satila makes a sufficient showing of "probable validity" that no remaining balance due on the lien remains due. The motion is denied, and the trial remains set for February 24, 2025.
