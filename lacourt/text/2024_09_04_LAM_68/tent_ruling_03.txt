RULING: Denied.
Cross-Defendant
Sylvia Huynh moves for a protective order precluding any deposition unless and
until service on Cross-Defendant Catherine Yan is completed, thereby allowing
Yan to participate in any deposition session of Yan. Defendant,
Cross-Complainant, RLoom, LLC fka OneWorld Apparel, LLC (RLoom) opposes the
motion as lacking a valid basis for blocking the right to take the deposition
of a party simply based on the possibility of appearing for a second deposition
session upon any appearance of Yan. Huynh filed a “notice of non-opposition.” 
 
The
opposition contains a proof of service showing electronic service on August 21,
2024. The court finds no basis to dispute the veracity and validity of the
proof of service, even counsel if Huynh denies ever receiving the opposition.
The court considers therefore the motion.
 
A
Court may make any order that justice requires to protect a party from
“unwanted annoyance, embarrassment or oppression or undue burden and expense.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b).) A deponent
may seek that the deposition is not taken at all, the deposition only taken on
specified terms and conditions, or only certain matters are allowed for
inquiry. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b)(1)(5)(9).) The
burden of proof is on the party seeking the protective order to show “good
cause” for the order he or she seeks. (Fairmont
Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
 
A
motion for a protective order “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (a).) “A meet and confer declaration in
support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith
attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) The motion contains a sufficient meet and confer
effort. [Declaration of David Palmer, Ex. 9.] 
 
Huynh
appears in the subject action as an alleged co-conspirator with Yan. Yan
remains unserved with the cross-complaint. Huynh requests a protective order
until the case is at issue (e.g. service on Yan is completed). 
 
The
right of Cross-Complainant to conduct discovery remains undisputed. The
circumstances require additional considerations, however.
 
On
August 5, 2024, the court considered a motion for leave to authorize service in
China, due to concerns over delays with efforts to complete service on Yan. It
remains unclear as to the progress of efforts for bringing Yan into the action.

 
Regardless,
even assuming Cross-Complainants successfully effects service, whether Yan will
appear or the clerk will receive a request for entry of a default, remains to
be determined. The court can also appreciate a scenario whereby a default would
be entered and Yan could seek relief from said default well into the six month
deadline for filing, with further delay for obtaining a hearing date on the
motion. 
 
Such
scenarios while not articulated by either party, presents a potentially
significant open ended period of the requested protective order before the case
becomes at issue, thereby dramatically delaying discovery as to Huynh. The
court finds no support for such a potentially broad, unaddressed scenario given
the magnitude of uncertainty over the status of Yan. The court in its
discretion therefore finds the requested relief too uncertain to justify
concerns and considerations over the claimed prejudice of a potential second
deposition on an indeterminate date, while all other deadlines for trial
completion and adjudication as to all other parties continues. The motion is
DENIED.
