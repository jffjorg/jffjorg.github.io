And here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' application for a writ of attachment against defendant Joan Blake. The plaintiffs, TRE D, Inc. and Wilson, are seeking to secure $349,909.69 in damages for breach of a construction agreement, unjust enrichment, and foreclosure of a mechanic's lien. The judge previously denied a similar application against 25157 Malibu Rd. LLC, citing that the mechanic's lien is sufficient security for the debt. The current application is seeking to attach Joan Blake, the managing member of 25157 Malibu Rd. LLC, but the judge finds that the writ of attachment would be duplicative since the mechanic's lien already secures the debt. Additionally, the judge concludes that the plaintiffs have not established the probable validity of their claims, as the defendant argues that the amounts were previously paid and the debt is not fixed.
