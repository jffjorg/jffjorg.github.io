TRE D v. Joan Blake, Case no. 24SMCV00937
Hearing date January 13, 2025
Plaintiffs’ Application for Writ of Attachment against Blake
Plaintiffs TRE D, Inc. and Wilson sue for breach of
construction agreement, unjust enrichment and foreclosure of mechanic’s lien
arising from defendants’ failure to pay plaintiffs for construction and repair
work on three projects in Malibu. Plaintiffs recorded a mechanic’s lien of
$349,909.69 on 1/26/24 and moved for a writ of attachment and right to attach
order against defendant 25157 Malibu Rd. LLC. The court denied the application
on the grounds the mechanic’s lien was sufficient. Min. Order 11/26/24. Plaintiffs
now move for a writ of attachment and right to attach order against defendant
Joan Blake. Defendants oppose.
A writ of an attachment may issue on a claim for money based
on contract where the total amount owed is equal to or greater than $500, and
the amount sought is “fixed or readily ascertainable” by reference to the
contract. A writ of attachment may not issue against a claim secured by real
property, and it may only issue against a natural person when the claim arises
out of the conduct of a “trade, business, or profession.” Code Civ. Proc.
§483.010. A writ of attachment will only issue if the court finds (1) the claim
on which the writ is based is one upon which an attachment may be issued, (2)
plaintiff established the probable validity of the underlying claim, (3) the
attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim
upon which the attachment is based, and (4) the amount to be secured by the
attachment is greater than zero. Code Civ. Proc. §484.090.
Plaintiffs seek a writ of attachment to secure $349,909.69
in damages. Plaintiffs’ alleged damages arise from the same work done on the
same property as in plaintiffs’ previous application; the only difference
between the applications is the target of the writ. Plaintiffs currently have a
mechanic’s lien on the property securing the alleged $349,909.69 debt,
therefore a writ of attachment would be duplicative. That the writ of
attachment would be against Blake instead of 25157 Malibu Rd. is irrelevant --
the funds sought by plaintiffs in this case are already secured by the
mechanic’s lien.
Further, as the court previously noted, plaintiff cannot
establish the probable validity of the claims, as defendant argues the amounts
were previously paid, and the alleged debt is not a fixed amount. Min. Order
11/26/24. Plaintiffs also failed to establish that Blake, as managing member of
25157 Malibu Rd., is party to the contract on which the application is based.
DENIED.
