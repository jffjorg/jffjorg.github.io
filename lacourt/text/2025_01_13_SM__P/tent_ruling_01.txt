offers the declaration of counsel Hettena. No opposition was filed.
If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment- pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement. Cal. Code

defendant to make monthly payments to plaintiff against the principal balance
of $44,317.77. Decl. Hettena exh. A. Per the agreement, the court retained
