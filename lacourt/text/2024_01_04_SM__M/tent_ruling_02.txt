McCarroll, et al.
CASE NO.:                23SMCV02701
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses 
HEARING DATE:   1/4/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand,
the demanding party must seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.)
Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work
product. Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief
from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There
is no deadline for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to
respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court
before filing the motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the
inspection demand, no showing of "good cause" is required.
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The
statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have
been served. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of
interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to
respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant Landon McCarroll moves to
compel initial discovery responses from Plaintiff Athony DiGirolamo as to: a)
special interrogatories, set one; b) form interrogatories, set one; and c)
requests for production of documents, set one.
 
            Defendant served Plaintiff with his first
set of discovery on October 2, 2023. (Costa Decl., ¶ 2, Exs. A.) Responses were
therefore due on November 3, 2023. On November 7, 2023, counsel followed up
with Plaintiff regarding the outstanding discovery requests but received no
response. (Id., ¶¶ 3-5, Exs. B.) Defendant has not received any response to the
above discovery. Given Plaintiff’s failure to respond to the properly served discovery
requests, the motions to compel are GRANTED.
 
Further
responses are ordered without objection within 10 days.  Defendant to give notice.
