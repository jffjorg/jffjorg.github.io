And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to strike the defendant's memorandum of costs filed on August 15, 2023. The plaintiff, Ryan Davis, argues that a memorandum of costs and disbursements should be stricken when no judgment has been entered in favor of the party who filed the memorandum. However, the court entered a judgment in favor of Sotheby's International Realty Inc. prior to the filing of this motion, and therefore the plaintiff's sole argument is not well-taken. The judge notes that the prevailing party is entitled to recover costs for suit as a matter of right, and that the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that the items claimed as costs were not reasonable or necessary.
