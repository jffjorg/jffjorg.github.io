```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for terminating, issue, and/or monetary sanctions against the plaintiff. The motion is procedurally improper because it does not specify a particular discovery violation or prior Court order regarding discovery. The judge is not inclined to impose a terminating sanction solely based on the deleted text messages around the time of the accident, and instead will consider the issue as part of the overall discovery process. The judge also notes that the motion focuses on conduct prior to the previous hearing on the motion, which was already considered or should have been raised by the defendant at that time. Finally, the judge will not usurp the role of the trier of fact by excluding or commenting on the evidence/testimony regarding the plaintiff's alleged misrepresentations and actions.
