Legal
Standard
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter of right to
recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17
Cal.4th 599, 606.) “Prevailing party” includes the party with a net
monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a
defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a
defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against
that defendant. (CCP § 1032 (a)(4).)  “Allowable
costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather
than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.” (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).)
“If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden
is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or
necessary.” (Ladas v. California
State Auto. Assn. (1993)
19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) On the other hand, if the items are properly objected
to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them
as costs. (Ibid.)
 
            Unless objection is made to the
entire cost memorandum, the motion to strike or tax costs must refer to each
item objected to by the same number and appear in the same order as the
corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of costs and state why each
item is objectionable. (CRC rule 3.1700(b)(2).) Any grounds not stated are
waived. (Boyd v. Oscar Fisher Co. (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 368, 383.)
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff Ryan Davis moves to
strike Defendant Sotheby’s International Realty Inc.’s memorandum of costs
filed on August 15, 2023. Plaintiff argues that a memorandum of costs and
disbursements should be stricken when no judgment has been entered in favor of
the party who filed the memorandum. Plaintiff ignores the fact that there is a
judgment in favor of Sotheby’s. On August 25, 2023, prior to the filing of this
motion, the Court entered a Judgment of Dismissal as to the entire action,
including the claims against Sotheby’s. Thus, Plaintiff’s sole argument is not
well-taken. 
 
Accordingly, the motion to strike
is DENIED.
