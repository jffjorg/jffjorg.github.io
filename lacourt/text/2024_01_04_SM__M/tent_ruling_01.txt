CASE NAME:                       Gabriel R. Sanchez v. Kasra Mizban, et al.
CASE NUMBER:                 21STCV02647
MOTION:                              Motion for Terminating Sanctions
HEARING DATE:                01/04/2024
 
Background
 
On January 22, 2021, plaintiff Gabriel R. Sanchez
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against defendants Kasra Mizban and Nasser
Mizban (collectively, “Defendants”) for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle
collision that occurred on October 6, 2019.  
 
On June 9, 2023, Defendants filed this
motion for terminating, issue, and/or monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff.  Defendants bring this motion
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 on the ground that “Plaintiff
has deliberately set in motion an unconscionable scheme to interfere with the
discovery process and the judicial system’s ability to impartially adjudicate
this case.” Defendants claim that Plaintiff has materially misrepresented his
preexisting medical condition to fraudulently inflate his purported damages, perjured
himself about material issues throughout the course of discovery, repeatedly
deceived the Court, and spoliated critical evidence. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            If
a party engages in the misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose
sanctions including terminating, issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (b)-(d).) 
 
Where a party
willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts have discretion to impose
terminating, issue, evidence, or monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010(d), (g), 2023.030; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd.
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.)  Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.040
requires that “[a] request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion,
identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought,
and specify the type of sanction sought.”  Furthermore, the notice of
motion shall be supported by a memorandum of points and authorities, and
accompanied by a declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any
monetary sanction sought.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.040.) 
 
Monetary sanctions may
be imposed “ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process,
or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct…unless
[the Court] finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(a).) 
 
Issue sanctions may be
imposed “ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in the
action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses.”  (Code of Civ.
Proc. § 2030.030(b).) 
 
Evidence sanctions may
be imposed “by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence.”  (Code
of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(c).) 
 
In more extreme cases,
the Court may also impose terminating sanctions by “striking out the pleadings
or parts of the pleadings,” “staying further proceedings,” “dismissing the
action, or any part of the action,” or “rending a judgment by default” against
the party misusing the discovery process.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §
2030.030(d).)  The court should look to the totality of the circumstances
in determining whether terminating sanctions are appropriate.  (Lang v.
Hochman (2000) 77¿Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  Ultimate discovery
sanctions are justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a
history of abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with discovery rules.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert
(2011) 196¿Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516; Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)  “[A] penalty as severe as dismissal or
default is not authorized where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an
inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.”  (Brown v.
Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 701, 707.)  “Although in extreme cases
a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure
[citations], a terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the
court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful
and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.”  (Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 566, 604-605.) 
 
In City of Los
Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC, the Court ruled that Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 2023.010 and 2023.030 list the available discovery sanctions but
do not independently authorize a court to impose specific sanctions.  (PriceewaterhouseCoopers
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 503-504.)  Thus, a court’s authority to
impose the sanctions specified in sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 must arise
from a statute governing a particular method of discovery.  (Ibid.) 
 
“[T]he intentional
destruction of evidence after litigation has commenced” constitutes “a misuse
of the discovery process that is subject to a broad range of punishment,
including monetary, issue, evidentiary, and terminating sanctions,” and “[a]
terminating sanction is appropriate in the first instance without a violation
of prior court orders in egregious cases of intentional spoliation of
evidence.” (Williams v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1215,
1223.) 
 
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
 
Defendants’
objections are overruled as immaterial. 
 
AnalysiS
 
 
Defendants
move for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.030 and 2023.010
only. Section 2023.010 describes conduct which qualifies as misuse of the
discovery process. Section 2023.030 authorizes sanctions only to the extent
authorized by the Code of Civil Procedure chapter governing any particular
discovery method. (Code Civ. Proc., §2023.030; see also City of Los Angeles
v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504, review
granted Jan. 25, 2023, [persuasive authority only, Rules of Ct. Rule 8.1104,
8.1115].) Defendant has not sought sanctions in conjunction with a specific
discovery violation or prior Court order regarding discovery. Accordingly, the
motion is procedurally improper, and the Court is not inclined to impose a
terminating sanction based solely on Sections 2023.030 and Section 2023.010 as
was previously discussed in the prior rulings on the motion for terminating
sanctions.
 
Further,
as pointed out by Plaintiff, Defendants have already made the same motion based
on essentially the same basis which was denied. (See 1/9/23 Minute Order.) This
is not a motion for reconsideration, nor would one be proper at this time. Most
of the motion focuses on conduct prior to the hearing on the previous motion
which was already considered or should have been raised by Defendants at that
time. If Defendants wish to make another motion based on conduct after the
previous January 9, 2023 hearing, then the motion must focus on any post
January 9, 2023, conduct and make it clear which conduct is the basis for the
motion, even if the prior conduct may be considered by the Court as an alleged
history of abuse. 
 
As
to spoilation of evidence, the Court is not inclined to impose a terminating
sanction based solely on the deleted text messages around the time of the
accident, though a lesser sanction may be appropriate. Defendants have not
shown that the text messages were deleted after the litigation commenced.
Further, the papers and ruling on the previous motion for terminating sanctions
addressed spoilation, yet the deleted text messages were seemingly not brought
up. Defendants’ memorandum does not sufficiently provide the Court with the
basis for a sanction as it does not discuss when this even occurred or why it
is relevant to obtain who the text messages were to and what they stated when
Defendants have already obtained records that the messages were sent.  Finally, as to the numerous inconsistencies,
false statements, and changes in testimony, the trier of fact will consider
those issues when determining the credibility of Plaintiff.  The Court will not usurp that role by
excluding, or even commenting in the form of a court order, upon such
evidence/testimony.
 
Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED without prejudice.
