And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a case involving two brothers who have litigated and arbitrated several cases. The court has decided to deny the notice of related cases, as the judges who presided over the other cases are unavailable. The defendant contends that the matter is barred by res judicata and statute of limitations, citing prior litigation and arbitration. However, the court believes that the matter will likely be barred by prior litigation, either now or when it becomes final. The court has asked the parties to discuss a mechanism to open the Kashet in front of a witness and catalogue what is inside. If the Kashet is opened, the court believes the res judicata or abatement argument might be ripe for dismissal or stay.
