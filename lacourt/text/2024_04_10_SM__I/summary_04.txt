And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by a plaintiff who alleges that a defendant engaged in sexual misconduct during therapy sessions. The defendant has moved to compel arbitration of the dispute, but the judge has denied the motion. The judge found that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable due to its limitations on damages, and that the contract was presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. The judge also expressed concerns about the limitations on damages and the potential for punitive damages. The judge declined to strike the offending clause and instead denied the motion to compel arbitration. The judge stayed the matter until the time to appeal has expired or until any timely appeal is resolved.
