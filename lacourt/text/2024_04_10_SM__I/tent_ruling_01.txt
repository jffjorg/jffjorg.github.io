  Case Number:  21SMCV00857    Hearing Date:   April 10, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to strike is DENIED.  The court agrees that the case is odd.  UMRO’s cross complaint against the former
tenant was served very late, and the former tenant’s cross complaint later
still.  But having said that, given that
the case has been severed (and the remainder of the case has settled), the
court is hard pressed to see the prejudice. 
Cross-defendants are correct that leave of court was required to file
the cross-complaint, and technically the court would be within its rights to
grant the motion to strike on that basis. 
But all that accomplishes is that cross-complainant will bring a motion
for leave to file the cross-complaint, which would likely be granted.  Accordingly, the court believes that the
better practice is to allow the cross-complaint to proceed.  The court notes that the motion was far
stronger when filed.  At that time, trial
was imminent in the remainder of the case and this part of the case had not
been severed.  Thus, if this motion were
denied, the trial would have been continued for many months.  But that is no longer the case.
 
Cross-defendants are to answer or otherwise respond to the
cross-complaint within 30 days.  As that
order implies, cross-defendants are at liberty to file a demurrer on any ground
that they believe has merit, and they may also file a cross-complaint against
the cross-complainant.  The court wonders
whether the right answer is for all parties to stand down at this time, but of
course the court is not so ordering.
