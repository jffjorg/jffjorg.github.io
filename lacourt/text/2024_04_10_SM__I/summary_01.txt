And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has denied the motion to strike the cross-complaint filed by the former tenant against UMRO. Although the cross-complaint was served late and the former tenant's cross-complaint was served later, the court believes that the prejudice to the cross-defendants is minimal. The court notes that the motion was stronger when it was filed, but trial was imminent at the time and the case had not been severed. Now that the case has been severed and the remainder of the case has settled, the court believes that allowing the cross-complaint to proceed is the better practice. Cross-defendants are required to answer or respond to the cross-complaint within 30 days, and they also have the option to file a demurrer on any ground that they believe has merit."
