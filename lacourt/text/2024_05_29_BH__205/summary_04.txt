And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's request for default judgment against the Defendants is denied. The Plaintiff invested $585,500 in the Defendant's company, BlockChain Consulting Group, LLC, and executed a personal guaranty of repayment. The Plaintiff demanded payment, but the Defendants refused. The Plaintiff filed a Complaint, which alleges five claims against the Defendants. The Plaintiff sought a default judgment of $622,026.98, comprising of $583,000 in actual damages and $38,526.98 in interest. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff did not properly comply with the requirements for a default judgment, including failing to provide a declaration calculating the amount of interest due. Therefore, the Judge denied the request for default judgment and continued the Order to Show Cause to July 24, 2024.
