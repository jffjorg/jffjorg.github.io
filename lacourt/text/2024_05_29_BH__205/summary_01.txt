**Tentative Ruling**

This tentative ruling is on Bradley Fischer's motion for leave to amend the complaint. Fischer, a film producer, sued New Republic Pictures, LLC (NRP) for breach of contract, declaratory relief, and accounting. NRP refused to pay Fischer bonus payments, allegedly withholding them as an offset against debt Fischer allegedly owed NRP. Fischer seeks to add claims for conversion and violation of the Labor Code. NRP has filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion.

The court has discretion to grant or deny a motion for leave to amend. The court will not consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading in ruling on a motion for leave to amend. Fischer's counsel's declaration in support of the motion satisfies the requirements under California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324. The court concludes that there was no undue delay in bringing the motion to amend.

The court grants Fischer's motion for leave to file an amended complaint.
