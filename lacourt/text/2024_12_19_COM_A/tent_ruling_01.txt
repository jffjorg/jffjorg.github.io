TRIAL:
  None set
 



 
1.    
Background
This is a personal injury action. Plaintiff Jailyn
Robateau (“Plaintiff”) alleges in the complaint that defendants Nationwide
Guard Services and Seko Logistics (collectively, “Defendants”) maintained a guard
shack in an unsanitary state, resulting in an unsafe work environment. Plaintiff
alleges that Nationwide Guard Services (“Nationwide”) was his employer and that
defendant Seko Logistics (“Seko”) owns the premises on which the guard shack
sits. The complaint alleges a cause of action for business intentional tort.
Nationwide has been dismissed from the case, leaving
Seko as the remaining defendant.
2.    
Demurrer
with Motion to Strike
Seko demurs to the complaint on the grounds that it
fails to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action and that it is
uncertain. Seko contends that Seko is not alleged to have employed Plaintiff
and did not owe any duty to Plaintiff to provide a safe and healthy workplace.
Seko further contends that “business intentional tort” is not a recognized
cause of action. Seko moves to strike the complaint’s sole cause of action for
business intentional tort based on these grounds. Seko also moves to strike the
complaint’s claim for punitive damages on the grounds that Plaintiff does not
allege malice, oppression, or fraud; as well as moving to strike Plaintiff’s
claim for $500,000 in damages on the grounds that the complaint impermissibly
states an amount of damages in a personal injury case in violation of Code of
Civil Procedure section 425.10, subdivision (b).
On September 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed opposition to
Defendant’s motion to strike, contending that Seko’s demurrer and motion to
strike are untimely. Plaintiff also contends that Seko responded to the
complaint by communicating with Plaintiff with options of settlements and that
nothing in the complaint is improper or uncertain. Plaintiff further contends
that Code of Civil Procedure section 425.10 does not prohibit a complaint from
stating punitive damages.   
3.    
Demurrer
and Motion to Strike Standards
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747
(Hahn).)¿When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)¿In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters.¿Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.”¿(SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p.
747.)¿The ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well
as all facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.¿(Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see
also Shields v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133
[stating, “[o]n demurrer, pleadings are read liberally and allegations
contained therein are assumed to be true.”]) “The court does not, however,
assume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.]”
(Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a
pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part
thereof.¿(Code of Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1322, subd. (b).)¿The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its
discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of California,
a court rule, or an order of the court.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782.)
In order to state a prima facie claim for punitive
damages, a complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the general
punitive damage statute, Civil Code section 3294.¿(College. Hospital, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 721 (College Hospital).)¿These
statutory elements include allegations that the defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).)¿¿¿ 
“In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation
of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief
must be pled by a plaintiff. [Citations.]¿In passing on the correctness of a
ruling on a motion to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to
a motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their
truth.¿[Citations.]¿In ruling on a motion to strike, courts do not read
allegations in isolation.¿[Citation.]”¿(Clauson v. Superior Court (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)¿“The mere allegation an intentional tort was
committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive
damages.¿[Citation.]¿Not only must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud
or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a
claim.¿[Citation.]”¿ (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d
159, 166.) 
4.     Discussion

a.    
Demurrer
Plaintiff merely asserts an “intentional tort”
claim against Seko.  In describing
reasons for liability against Seko, Plaintiff states that the hazardous
condition of the guard shack was located on Seko’s premises, and that Seko was
aware of the unsanitary guard shack on their premises and failed to resolve the
issue, instead exposing Nationwide’s employees to unsanitary and unsafe working
conditions. However, Plaintiff does not allege that Seko and Plaintiff were in
an employment relationship; rather, Plaintiff alleges that Nationwide and
Plaintiff were in an employment relationship, as part of which Plaintiff worked
in the guard shack on Seko’s premises. Plaintiff does not allege that Seko retained
control over the work process or premises. 

Even interpreting the complaint broadly as
attempting to state a cause of action for premises liability under a negligence
theory, Plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to give rise to any duty on
the part of Seko to Plaintiff in connection with insect bites Plaintiff
allegedly suffered while working at her employment with Nationwide.  Duty is an essential element of the tort of
negligence.  (Potter v. Firestone Tire
& Rubber Co. (1993)
6 Cal.4th 965, 984.)  Everyone is
responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for
an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in
the management of his or her property or person, except so far as the latter
has, willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or
herself.”  (Civil Code §1714, subdiv.
(a).) Generally speaking, “a landowner has a duty to act reasonably in the
management of property ‘in view of the probability of injury to others.’ ”  (Garcia v. Paramount Citrus Assn., Inc. §(2008)
164
Cal.App.4thh 1448, 1453, quoting Rowland v. Christian (1968)
69 Cal.2d 108, 119.)  “In the case of a
landowner's liability for injuries to persons on the property, the
determination of whether a duty exists” involves balancing the Rowland factors. (Rinehart
v. Boys & Girls Club of Chula Vista (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 419,
430.)  The complaint is entirely devoid
of any factual allegations that would trigger an analysis under Rowland with respect to any purported duty Seko may
have owed to employees of Nationwide while working on Seko’s premises.
Accordingly, Plaintiff fails to allege facts
stating a valid cause of action. The court sustains Seko’s demurrer with leave
to amend.
b.    
Motion to Strike
As the court has
sustained Seko’s demurrer to the complaint’s sole cause of action for business
intentional tort, the motion to strike is denied as it is moot. 
5.    
Conclusion

Based on the
foregoing, the court SUSTAINS Seko’s demurrer with leave to amend. As a result,
the motion to strike is DENIED as it is moot. 
Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint not later than twenty (20)
days from the date of this order.  

Seko is ordered to give notice of this order.
