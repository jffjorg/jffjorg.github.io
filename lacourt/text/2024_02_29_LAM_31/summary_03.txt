And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion to disqualify Abtin Amir as counsel for the defendants, Porsche Cars North America, Inc. and Beverly Hills Porsche, in a "lemon law" action brought by Faram Arzbardi. The motion was based on allegations of abusive and intolerable conduct, including sending profanity-laced emails, using defamatory and discriminatory epithets, calling the plaintiff's counsel and clients con-artists, tricksters, and liars, reneging on a prior settlement agreement, and making threats to file complaints to the California State Bar.

The court denied the motion, finding that the evidence presented did not rise to the level warranting disqualification. The court noted that while counsel do not get along, the evidence showed that the conduct was not severe enough to justify disqualification. The court also admonished both counsel to comport themselves with professionalism and integrity as set forth in the California Rules of Professional Conduct.
