And here is a summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the Judge addresses three issues: (1) the Defendant's failure to make a good faith attempt to meet and confer before filing a Declaration of Demurring party, (2) the Defendant's initial request for a 30-day extension to respond, and (3) the Plaintiff's request for sanctions.

The Judge notes that the Declaration requires a good faith attempt to meet and confer, but the Defendant's explanation fails to comply with this requirement. The Judge will hear from counsel on this issue.

Regarding the initial request for a 30-day extension, the Defendant effectively countered the Plaintiff's argument by submitting emails showing an effort to evaluate the case.

The Judge also addresses the Plaintiff's request for sanctions, noting that the request is not supported by sufficient detail and will not be awarded in the amount requested. Instead, the Judge will award sanctions in a reasonable amount to oppose a motion to set aside a default, taking into consideration the issues discussed in the ruling.
