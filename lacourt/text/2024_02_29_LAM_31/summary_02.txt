And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a dispute between VGA, the plaintiff, and an unknown defendant. VGA brought a Song-Beverly action, which allows consumers to seek replacement or restitution for defective vehicles. However, the defendant argues that VGA's failure to comply with inspection demands and surrender the vehicle without notification frustrates their ability to inspect the vehicle and establish its condition. The judge finds that VGA had every right to return the vehicle at the end of the lease, and that the defendant's delay in pursuing a remedy against VGA's discovery abuse is significant. The judge also notes that the vehicle was sold 5 months after it was returned, which may compromise its evidentiary value. The judge concludes that the defendant has not made an initial prima facie showing to shift the burden to VGA, and that the dispute is one of frustration and evidence, rather than standing to seek relief under the Act.
