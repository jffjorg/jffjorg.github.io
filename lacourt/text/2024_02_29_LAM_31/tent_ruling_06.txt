[1] Plaintiff contends Mr. Merino did
not attempt to meet and confer prior to filing the Declaration of Demurring
party.  By filing such a declaration, the
demurring party is “stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt
to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could
not meet and confer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)  Defendants explain that the Declaration was
based on an inability to meet and confer, but this explanation fails to comply
with the statutory requirement that counsel explain that a good faith attempt
to meet and confer was made and explain the reasons why the parties could not
meet and confer. The court will hear from counsel.  


[2] Plaintiff also argues Defendants’
initial request for a 30-day extension to respond was untruthful because
Defendants did not engage in any efforts to settle the case.  However, Defendants effectively counter that
argument by submitting emails from Mr. Merino showing an effort to evaluate the
case.  (See Reply, Merino Decl., Ex. A.)


[3] Rule 3.110(g) states, “If a
responsive pleading is not served within the time limits specified in this rule
and no extension of time has been granted, the plaintiff must file a request
for entry of default within 10 days after the time for service has elapsed. The
court may issue an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed if
the plaintiff fails to timely file the request for the entry of default.”


[4] Counsel
request for sanctions is not supported by any description of work or time
spent.  The detail is insufficient to
award sanction in the amount requested. 
The court will award sanctions in a reasonable amount to oppose a motion
to set aside a default when taking into consideration issued discussed herein.
