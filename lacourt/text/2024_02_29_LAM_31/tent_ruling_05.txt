MOTION
TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
Anat Ebgi and Joshua Michael Rosenblatt
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Barry
Maiten
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On May 18, 2023, Plaintiff, Barry Maiten, filed this breach of
a contract action against Defendants, Anat Ebgi (“Ebgi”) and Joshua Michael Rosenblatt
(“Rosenblatt”), alleging Defendants ceased making monthly rent payments on
April 1, 2020 pursuant to a lease agreement between the parties.  Defendants vacated the property on or about
July 31, 2021.
 
On June 30, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendants with the
summons and complaint by personal service. 
 
On July 21, 2023, defense counsel Alexander Merino requested
an extension of time to respond to the Complaint.  Mr. Merino agreed to accept service on behalf
of Rosenblatt and subsequently signed a Notice and Acknowledgement of Receipt
of the summons and complaint on August 9, 2023. 
As such, Defendants’ response to the Complaint was extended to September
15, 2023.
 
On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for entry
of default.  On the same day, Mr. Merino
filed a Declaration of Demurring or Moving Party in Support of Automatic
Extension (“Declaration of Demurring Party”) on behalf of Ebgi and Rosenblatt.  For this reason, Plaintiff’s request for entry
of default was rejected.  Defendants’
response was therefore due on October 16, 2023.
 
Defendants did not file a responsive pleading on October 16,
2023.  On October 17, 2023, pursuant to
Plaintiff’s request, default was entered against Defendants. 
 
On October 18, 2023, Defendants filed an Answer to the
Complaint.  The Answer was not rejected
by the court.
 
On October 19, 2023, Mr. Merino contacted Plaintiff’s
counsel to request that the default be set aside.  Plaintiff did not agree.  As such, on January 16, 2024, Defendants
filed this motion to set aside the default.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition.  Plaintiff requests imposition of sanctions
against Defendants if the court is inclined to set aside the default. 
 
Defendants replied.     

 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b) provides that a court may “relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.”  In addition, a court must vacate a default or
dismissal when a motion for relief under Section 473, subdivision (b) is filed
timely and accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect “unless the court finds
that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).)   
 
The party or the legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than six months had elapsed from the
entry of default, and hence relief under section 473 was unavailable”]; People
v. The North River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 712, 721 [motion for
relief under section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months”].)   
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendants move to vacate the default.  Defendants offer the declaration of Mr. Merino
who states he was traveling in Asia and unexpectedly did not have internet
access on October 16, 2023.  Mr. Merino
was able to submit Defendants’ Answer for filing on October 17, 2023, however,
due to the time difference, the Answer was filed on October 18, 2023.  (Merino Decl., ¶ 2.)  For these reasons, Defendants argue the
failure to timely answer the Complaint was the result of counsel’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect. 
Defendants further contend the taking of the default was improper as
Defendants are represented by counsel and had been in communication regarding
discovery (see Merino Decl., ¶ 3) and the merits of the case (see Reply, Merino
Decl., ¶¶ 2-5).  Defendants cite Lasalle
v. Vogel (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 127, 137 for the proposition that counsel
has an ethical obligation to warn opposing counsel of intent to take a default.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff makes much of Defendants having had
a total of 105 days to respond to the Complaint.  However, Plaintiff’s opposition shies away
from the principal issues raised by this motion: whether Defendants timely
sought relief, whether Plaintiff suffered prejudice, and whether Plaintiff’s
counsel violated his obligation not to take the default.  Here, it is undisputed Defendants timely
sought relief.  The party or the legal representative must seek such relief “within a
reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b).)  Default was entered on
October 17, 2023 and this motion followed less than three months later on
January 16, 2024.  As to prejudice,
Plaintiff does not raise a single argument showing any prejudice would result
from setting aside the default.  
 
Plaintiff does not adequately
address Lasalle.  Plaintiff again focuses on the length of time (105 days)
which has passed since service of process and points to having previously
requested entry of default against Defendants on September 15, 2023.  Plaintiff also cites California Rules of Court
(CRC), rule 3.110(g) for the proposition that Plaintiff has an obligation to speedily
seek default.  Plaintiff’s arguments are
unavailing.  
 
First, Defendants were automatically granted a 30-day
extension simply by filing the Declaration of Demurring Party.[1]  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)  Further,
the preceding extensions of time to respond were agreed upon by the parties.[2]
 
Second, Plaintiff filed the first Request for Entry of
Default on September 15, 2023—on the very day Defendants’ responsive pleading
was due.  No evidence has been presented
showing defense counsel was notified prior to the filing of the September 15,
2023 Request.  
 
Third, although CRC rule 3.110(g)[3]
does direct timely requests for entry of default on pain of possible sanctions,
the weight of authority clearly states “[t]he law favors judgments based on the
merits, not procedural missteps.”  (Lasalle,
supra, 36 Cal.App.5th at p. 134.) 
“[A]ny doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor
of the party seeking relief from default [citations].”  (Rappleyea, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p.
980.)  So too here.  
 
Based on the foregoing, the court finds Defendants merit mandatory
rather than discretionary relief under section 473.  A
court must vacate a default or dismissal when a motion for relief under Section
473, subdivision (b) is filed timely and accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).)   Here, Defendants timely filed for 473 relief and have
established by way of defense counsel’s declaration that the default was
taken due to defense counsel’s inadvertence, mistake, or excusable neglect.  Further, Plaintiff does not demonstrate
prejudice will result from setting aside the default.  
 
Sanctions
 
Section 473 delineates two forms of sanctions: mandatory and
discretionary.  Under CCP section 473,
subdivision (b), “The court shall, whenever relief is granted
based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault, direct the attorney to pay
reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel or parties.”
 
CCP section 473, subdivision (c)(1) sets forth the court’s
authority to impose discretionary sanctions. 
“Whenever
the court grants relief from a default, default judgment, or dismissal based on
any of the provisions of this section, the court may do any of the following:
 
(A) Impose
a penalty of no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) upon an offending
attorney or party.
(B) Direct
that an offending attorney pay an amount no greater than one thousand dollars
($1,000) to the State Bar Client Security Fund.
(C) Grant other relief as is appropriate.
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the sum of $11,930.66[4].  Given that the court has granted mandatory
relief based on defense counsel’s declaration, sanctions are likewise
mandatory.  Curiously, both parties agree
that Defendants have not submitted an affidavit of fault from defense counsel.  However, despite the parties’ respective
positions, Mr. Merino’s declaration can only be construed as an affidavit of
fault.  Mr. Merino was aware of the
deadline to file a responsive pleading. 
Accordingly, he was responsible for ensuring that the responsive
pleading was timely filed.  Mr. Merino
cannot avoid that responsibility simply because he was on a trip in Asia
without access to internet.  The
situation was of Mr. Merino’s own making. 

 
Based on the foregoing, the court imposes sanctions against
defense counsel in the sum of $1,200 to be paid to Plaintiff’s counsel.  The court declines to impose any further
sanctions.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motion is GRANTED. 
The default entered against Defendants Anat Ebgi and Joshua Michael
Rosenblatt on October 17, 2023 is VACATED.  Defendants’ Answer is deemed filed on October
18, 2023.
 
The court imposes sanctions against defense counsel in the
sum of $1,200 to be paid to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days of this order.
