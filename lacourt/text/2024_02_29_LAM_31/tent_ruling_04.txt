[1] In the body of the motion,
Plaintiff also requests an order striking Defendants’ pleadings because of Mr.
Amir’s purported misconduct.  The request
is improper.  “A notice of motion must
state in the opening paragraph the nature of the order being sought and the
grounds for issuance of the order.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(a).) 
Here, Plaintiff did not identify the request to strike Defendants’
pleadings in the notice of motion.  Even
if Plaintiff had complied with the procedure, the request would be denied for
the reasons stated herein.  The court
does not consider the request to strike any further.
