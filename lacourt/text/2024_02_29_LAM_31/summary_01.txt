And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The plaintiff returned the leased vehicle to the defendant at the end of the lease term, which is in accordance with the terms of the lease. The defendant claims that the plaintiff destroyed or failed to preserve the vehicle, but the judge finds that there is no evidence of destruction and that the plaintiff's actions were not intentional. The judge also notes that the defendant delayed in bringing the motion and did not take any action to inspect the vehicle until after the lease term had ended.

The judge has also denied the defendant's alternative motion for issue or evidence sanctions, or inferences pursuant to Evidence Code section 413. The judge finds that the defendant's actions were not egregious and that the plaintiff was entitled to return the vehicle at the end of the lease term. The judge will hear from the parties regarding sanctions at the time of trial.

The judge has reserved ruling on the defendant's potential motions in limine and will hear from the parties regarding sanctions at the time of trial.
