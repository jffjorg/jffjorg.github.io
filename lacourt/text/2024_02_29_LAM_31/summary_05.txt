And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default judgment entered against Defendants Anat Ebgi and Joshua Michael Rosenblatt. The default was entered on October 17, 2023, after the Defendants failed to timely respond to the complaint. The Defendants, represented by Defense Counsel Alexander Merino, argue that the default was taken due to their counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.

The Judge finds that the Defendants have established a basis for relief under California Code of Civil Procedure section 473 and grants the motion to set aside the default. The Judge also imposes sanctions against Defense Counsel in the amount of $1,200 to be paid to Plaintiff's counsel.

The Judge notes that the default was taken due to Defense Counsel's failure to timely file the responsive pleading, despite having an obligation to do so. The Judge also finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated any prejudice from the delay and that the law favors judgments based on the merits, not procedural missteps.

The motion is granted, and the default is vacated. The Defendants' answer is deemed filed on October 18, 2023. The sanctions are to be paid within 30 days of the order.
