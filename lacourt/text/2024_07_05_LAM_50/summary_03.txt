English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the defendants, Antelope Valley School Transportation Agency (AVSTA) and Morris Fuselier, against the plaintiff, Gail Boucher. The demurrer challenges the validity of the plaintiff's claims against the defendants, including allegations of retaliation, hostile work environment, and failure to maintain a safe work environment. The judge sustains the demurrer to the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth causes of action as to AVSTA, but overrules the demurrer to the sixth cause of action as to Fuselier, finding that the allegations of the complaint sufficiently allege "extreme and outrageous conduct" for purposes of the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action. The judge also overrules the demurrer to the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The court orders the plaintiff to file an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the date of the order, and the defendants to file and serve their answer within 30 days of the date of the order.
