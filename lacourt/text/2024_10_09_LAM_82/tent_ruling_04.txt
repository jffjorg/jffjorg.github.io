[1] “Non-Profit
Entity,” as defined, does not include a charter school owned and operated by a
school district.  (See 2 CCR § 1859.2.)  Accordingly, the school district must give
preference to “an independently operated charter school” over a
district-operated charter school.  (See
Oppo. 12:12-17 and 14:2-6.)
