MOTION
FOR INTERLOCUTORY JUDGMENT OF PARTITION ON THE PLEADINGS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Steve K. Lopez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Mai
Thai
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
This is a partition action concerning the real property located
at 1114, 1114 ½, and 1116 S. Kern Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90022 (the “Subject
Property”).  On June 27, 2022, Plaintiff Steve
K. Lopez (“Plaintiff” or “Lopez”) filed a Verified Complaint for Partition By
Sale of Real Property against Defendant Mai Thai (“Defendant” or “Thai”)[1].  Plaintiff alleges that he and Defendant are
joint tenants with equal 50% ownership interest in the Subject Property.  The grant deed evidencing the parties’ equal
ownership of Subject Property as joint tenants is attached as Exhibit B to the
Verified Complaint.
 
On February 1, 2024, Defendant filed her Answer.  The Answer is not verified.  Defendant admits that she and Plaintiff each
hold an undivided 50% interest in the Subject Property. 
 
On November 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for
interlocutory judgment of partition and for appointment of a referee.  On March 15, 2024, the court denied the
motion.
 
On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Recording of
Pendency of Action Pursuant to CCP § 405.20 (Lis Pendens) concerning the
Subject Property.
 
Plaintiff now moves for an interlocutory judgment of
partition on the pleadings and for an order appointing a referee.  Defendant filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied.
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.¿
[Citations.]”¿ (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1057
1064.)¿ The court must assume the truth of all properly pleaded material facts
and allegations, but not contentions or conclusions of fact or law.¿ (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Wise v. Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. (2005)
132 Cal.App.4th 725, 738.)¿ “A judgment on the pleadings in favor of the
defendant is appropriate when the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to
state a cause of action.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(3)(B)(ii).)”¿ (Kapsimallis
v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 667, 672.)¿ A motion for
judgment on the pleadings may be brought by a plaintiff on the grounds that
“the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause or causes of
action against the defendant and the answer does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a defense to the complaint.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(3)(A).)  “Presentation of extrinsic evidence is
therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.¿[Citation.]”¿ (Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)¿ “The common law
ground for a motion for judgment on the pleadings is identical to the statutory
ground[.]”  (Korchemny v. Piterman (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 1032,
1055.)  Allegations are to be liberally construed.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)¿¿¿ 
 
If the motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted, it
may be granted with or without leave to amend.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(h)(1).)¿ “Where a demurrer is sustained or a motion for judgment on the
pleadings is granted as to the original complaint, denial of leave to amend
constitutes an abuse of discretion if the pleading does not show on its face
that it is incapable of amendment.”¿ (Virginia G. v. ABC Unified
School Dist.¿(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1848, 1852 (emphasis added).)¿ 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
A.

Plaintiff requests judicial notice of the following
documents: 
(1)  
Plaintiff’s Verified Complaint; 
(2)  
Defendant’s Answer; 
(3)  
Grand Deed transferring the Subject
Property to “Steve K. Lopez, a Single Man,” recorded on May 18, 2012 in the
Official Records of Los Angeles County as Instrument Number 20120748102; 
(4)  
Grant Deed transferring the Property

(5)  
Deed of Trust in favor of Paramount
Residential Mortgage Group, Inc., recorded against the Subject Property on May
18, 2012, in the Official Records of Los Angeles County as Instrument Number
20120748103.
The
unopposed requests are GRANTED.  (Evid.
Code, § 452, subds. (d)(1), (h).)
 
B.    
Analysis
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings may be brought by a
plaintiff on the grounds that “the complaint states facts sufficient to
constitute a cause or causes of action against the defendant and the answer
does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the complaint.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(3)(A).)  “When the complaint is verified, the answer
shall be verified.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
446, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiff seeks a judgment on the issue of his right to
partition of the Subject Property and for the appointment of a referee.
 
A co-owner has an absolute right to partition unless barred
by a valid waiver. (Orien v. Lutz (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 957, 962; Code
Civ. Proc., § 872.210; Code Civ. Proc., § 710, subd. (b); see also Lazzarevich
v. Lazzarevich (1952) 39 Cal.2d 48, 50 [co-owner includes joint tenants].)  The absolute right to partition may be waived
by contract, either express or implied. (See Orien, supra, 16
Cal.App.5th at p. 963; see also LEG Investment v. Boxler (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 484, 493.) “If the court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to
partition, it shall make an interlocutory judgment that determines the
interests of the parties in the property and orders the partition of the
property and, unless it is to be later determined, the manner of partition.”
(Code Civ. Proc., §872.720)  As such, to establish a right to partition, a
plaintiff must allege that he has never waived his right to partition, that the
parties are joint tenants with equal ownership interests, and the manner of
partition, unless it is to be determined later.  Each element is alleged.
 
Waiver
 
The first requirement is that the “court finds that the
plaintiff is entitled to partition unless barred by a valid waiver.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 872.720, subd. (a).) 
 
Here, Plaintiff alleges he “has never waived the right to
partition in writing or in any other manner.” 
(Verified Complaint, ¶ 20.)  In
Defendant’s unverified Answer, Defendant alleges that the “Complaint . . . is
barred by reason of Plaintiff’s actions, representations, conduct and/or
omissions, and Plaintiff has waived each and every alleged cause of action,
remedy, and/or other rights against Defendant.” 
(Answer, Third Affirmative Defense.)  However, because Defendant’s Third Affirmative
Defense is not verified, Defendant’s Answer is insufficient to state a
defense.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 446,
subd. (a).)  Accordingly, the first
element is met.  Defendant does not
present any argument to the contrary. 
 
Ownership Interests
 
The second factor is “the statute’s plain requirement that
the parties’ ownership interests be determined before or when the manner of
partition is decided.”  (Summers v.
Superior Court (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 138, 143.)
 
Here, Plaintiff establishes by Grant Deed that the Subject
Property was granted evenly between Plaintiff and Defendant.  (See
Verified Complaint, ¶ 3, Ex. B.)  In her
Answer, Defendant admits to the same.  She
alleges, “Defendant does not deny she holds an interest in the subject property
located  1114,  1114 1/2, and 1116 S. Kern Avenue, Los
Angeles, CA 90022 (the “Property”), as provided in Paragraph 2 of the
Complaint, as joint tenants with Plaintiff and Defendant each holding an
undivided 50% interest in the Property.”  (Answer, General Denial.)  The second element is satisfied.  Defendant does not raise any relevant argument
to the contrary.[2]      
 
            Based on
the foregoing, Plaintiff demonstrates agreement that the parties have equal
ownership interests in the Subject Property. 
It is further uncontroverted that Plaintiff has not waived his right to
partition.  The court therefore finds
that Plaintiff is entitled to partition. 

 
            Manner
of Partition & Referee
 
Plaintiff alleges that “[p]artition by sale is more
equitable than division in kind for the Property. The Property is a
multi-family residence with a single assessor’s parcel number with no surplus
land, making division in kind in the Property unfeasible as the co-owners would
receive an interest valued at a price materially less than the share of
proceeds the co-owners would receive through the sale of the Property as a
whole, thereby resulting in loss to the co-owners.”  (Verified Complaint, ¶ 22.)  Defendant alleges that the “Complaint … is
barred because Partition of sale of the property would be unfair under the
circumstances.”  (Answer, Eleventh
Affirmative Defense.)  Given this
disagreement, the manner of partition must be determined at a later time. 
 
Given the disagreement in the manner of partition, appointment
of a referee is necessary.  “The referee
or any party may, on noticed motion, petition the court for instructions
concerning the referee’s duties.”  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 873.070.)  Additionally, the
referee has a broad range of authority over the Subject Property as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 873.060, which states, “[t]he referee may
perform any acts necessary to exercise the authority conferred by this title or
by order of the court.” 
 
Here, Plaintiff has nominated Matthew Taylor, an attorney,
to serve as the referee.  Absent
objections to Mr. Taylor’s candidacy, the court grants the request to appoint
Matthew Taylor as the referee. The court orders Mr. Taylor to determine the
manner of partition.  If Mr. Taylor
decides that the tenants must vacate the Subject Property, the parties must
return to the court to specifically request such authority.  The court adopts the Plaintiff’s remaining
proposed terms.  (See Mot., p. 11.)
 
III.         CONCLUSION
                                                                                                                                 
            The motion
for interlocutory judgment of partition on the pleadings is GRANTED.  Interlocutory judgment of partition on the
Subject Property is entered.  
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for appointment of a referee is GRANTED.  Matthew Taylor is appointed as referee.            
 
            The court
sets a Status Conference re: Manner of Partition for July 3, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.  Mr. Taylor is to submit his report regarding
the manner of partition to the court no later than 5 court days prior to the
status conference. 
 
            Plaintiff
to give notice.
