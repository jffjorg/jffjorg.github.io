[1]  Chavez filed a Separate
Statement that spans 675 pages.  “The separate statement serves two
important functions in a summary judgment proceeding: It notifies the parties
which material facts are at issue, and it provides a convenient and expeditious
vehicle permitting the trial court to hone in on the truly disputed
facts.” (Collins v. Hertz Corp. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 64, 74.)
There is nothing convenient or expeditious about Plaintiff’s separate
statement.. In Beltran v. Hard Rock Hotel
Licensing, Inc. (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th
865, 874–876 (Beltran), the Court of Appeal discussed the substantive
and procedural complications presented by hyper-inflated separate
statements.  Needless to say, the
appellate court was highly critical of the parties’ presentations.  The separate statements at issue in Beltran
exceeded 100 pages. Defendant’s submission is more than six times
longer.  Those same concerns and problems
identified by the Beltran Court apply here, multiplied by six.
 Plaintiff’s appendix of evidence is 551
pages long and not bookmarked, making its electronic access cumbersome, to say
the least. .  


[2] The parties spend an enormous amount of time on the
issue whether Chavez was demoted.  As
discussed above, this cause of action is based upon Chavez’s termination, not
his alleged demotion, 
 


[3] The parties engage in protracted
arguments over other employees’ classifications and whether Schlumberger’s classifications
were pretextual.  Given the foregoing,
the court need not wade into this dispute.
