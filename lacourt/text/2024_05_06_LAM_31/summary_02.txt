And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to the Plaintiff's lengthy separate statement, which spans 675 pages. The Judge criticizes the Plaintiff's submission, noting that it is not convenient or expeditious. The Judge also critiques the Defendant's submission, which is over 4000 pages long. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's appendix of evidence is 551 pages long and not bookmarked, making it difficult to access. The Judge concludes that the court need not wade into disputes over the Plaintiff's alleged demotion and the classification of employees by Schlumberger. The Judge references two court cases, Collins v. Hertz Corp. and Beltran v. Hard Rock Hotel Licensing, Inc., to support their ruling.
