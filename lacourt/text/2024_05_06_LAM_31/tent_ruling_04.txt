[1] Defendant is self-represented.


[2] Defendant advances the argument
that this action must be determined by trial. 
The court addressed this issue in denying Defendant’s motion for
interlocutory judgment for partition.  As
the court stated in that order, “a party seeking an interlocutory judgment
directing partition must as least file a dispositive motion, such as a motion
for summary adjudication (see LEG Investments v. Boxler (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
484, 497-98 [summary adjudication on partition by sale cause of action]) or
judgment on the pleadings (see White v. White (1936) 11 Cal.App.2d 570, 570
[interlocutory judgment on the pleadings]).” 
(Minute Order, 3/15/24.)
