 Case Number:  23SMCV03839    Hearing Date:   June 28, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of CaliforniaCounty of Los Angeles – West DistrictBeverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205ELMIRA APREIAN, Plaintiffs, v. CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD, et al., Defendants. Case No.: 23SMCV03839 Hearing Date: June 28, 2024 ORDER RE: DEFENDANT LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY’S DEMURRER TO COMPLAINTBACKGROUNDThis is a slip and fall case. Plaintiff Elmira Apreian claims that Defendants Los Angeles County Development Authority (“LACDA”) and Rozana Doe are liable for injuries she sustained when she tripped and fell on a pine cone on the sidewalk adjacent to a multi-use residential property owned and managed by LACDA in the City of West Hollywood. Plaintiff alleges that LACDA and Rozana Doe failed to discover, locate, correct, warn and protect people from an alleged dangerous condition of the walkway and are therefore responsible for her injuries.The Court previously sustained a demurrer to Plaintiff’s negligence claim in the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). The First Amended Complaint was brought only against LACDA. The Court ruled that as a public entity, LACDA was immune from all common law torts including negligence. The Court also ruled LACDA could not be held vicariously liablebecause the FAC does not provide any facts regarding any employee of LACDA much less that an action by such an employee was negligent and was not the result of the exercise of discretion vested in them.Plaintiff then filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”) with two counts: (1) general negligence and (2) dangerous condition of public property. Plaintiff also added a new defendant, Rozana Doe, who she claims is the “manager.”This hearing is on LACDA’s demurrer to the SAC. LACDA argues that Plaintiff’s cause of action for common law negligence again fails because it is immune from all common law torts including negligence. LACDA also argues that while the SAC alleges vicarious liability against LACDA based on actions by its employees pursuant to Gov. Code § 815.2, it does not allege any facts to explain how any employee of LACDA acted negligently or that such actions did not fall within the purview of any applicable statutory immunity. Further, LACDA argues the claims against Rozana Doe should be dismissed since the SAC does not specify what acts by her were negligent, and she cannot be liable for a claim for dangerous condition to public property.MEET AND CONFERCode Civ. Proc. § 430.41 requires that before the filing of a demurrer the moving party “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone” with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(2).) Thereafter, the moving party shall file and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).) LACDA submits the Declaration of Caroline Park, which shows the parties met and conferred by telephone on May16, 2024, more than five days before LACDA filed this demurrer on May 28, 2024. This satisfies the meet and confer requirements of § 430.41.REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICELACDA requests judicial notice of (1) a March 6, 2024 minute order ruling on LACDA’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint; (2) Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint, and (3) LACDA’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint. It is unnecessary to ask the court to take judicial notice of materials previously filed in this case. “[A]ll that is necessary is to call the court's attention to such papers.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2021) ¶ 9.53.1a.) It is also unnecessary for the Court to take judicial notice of its own order issued in this case. Accordingly, the Court denies the request for judicial notice.LEGAL STANDARD“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 (in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their contents).) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 (court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”); Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 (“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”).) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)UNTIMELY OPPOSITIONPlaintiff’s opposition was due on June 14, 2024. Plaintiff filed her opposition on June 21, 2024. The opposition is untimely, and the Court exercises its discretion to decline to consider the opposition. (Cal. Rules of Court rule 3.1300(d).)DISCUSSIONLACDA argues that, as a public entity, it cannot be held liable for common law negligence. The Court agrees.It is well-settled that a public entity can only be held liable for damages pursuant to statute and is therefore immune from common law torts, such as negligence. Gov. Code § 815(a) provides that public entities are immune from liability unless such liability is expressly provided for by statute or by the constitution. Numerous decisions confirm that section 815 abolishes common law liability for public entities. (See Miklosy v. Regenets of Univ. of Calif. (2008) 44 Cal.4th 874, 899; Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1179; Zelig v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1127-1128.)To state a cause of action for government tort liability “every fact essential to the existence of a statutory liability must be pleaded with particularity, including the existence of a statutory duty. Since the duty of a governmental agency can only be created by statute or enactment, the statute or enactment claimed to establish the duty must at the very least be identified.” (Zuniga v. Housing Authority (1995( 41 Cal.App.4th 82, 96.) Here, the negligenceclaim against LACDA is based on common law and not statute. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s negligence claim is subject to demurrer without leave to amend.LACDA next argues that the SAC does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for vicarious liability against LACDA. The Court agrees.The FAC alleges that LACDA is liable to Plaintiff pursuant to Gov. Code § 815.2, which states in pertinent part: “A public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal representative.”“In other words, the general rule is that an employee of a public entity is liable for his torts to the same extent as a private person and the public entity is vicariously liable for any injury which its employee causes to the same extent as a private employer.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High Sch. Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 868.)Proper pleading of a claim pursuant to §815.2 requires two elements. First, the actions of the individual agent must be negligent for such liability to extend to the principal. (Munoz v. City of Union City (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1077, 1113.) “[U]nless the employee is identified, the trier of fact will not be able to determine if the elements needed to assert vicarious liability have been proved. Thus, the doctrine clearly contemplates that the negligent employee whose conduct is sought to be attributed to the employer at least be specifically identified, if not joined as a defendant.” (Id. (citations omitted).)Second, there must be facts sufficient to show the actions of the employee do not fall within the purview of any applicable statutory immunity. (City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2021) 62 Cal.App.5th 129, 148 (“[s]ince all California governmental tort liability flows from the California [Government] Claims Act, the plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to show his [orher] cause of action lies outside the breadth of any applicable statutory immunity.”) Such immunities include that of § 820.2 which provides “a public employee is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.”Here, Plaintiff fails to meet the second prong. While she identifies an employee of LACDA (Rozana Doe) and that she acted negligently, she fails to show that any acts or omissions of Doe were not immune under either §§ 815.2 and 820.2. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not stated a claim for vicarious liability.LACDA also demurrers to the claims against Rozana Doe. As Doe is not a moving defendant, the Court declines to consider these arguments. (See, e.g., Zang v. Jun (2021) 2021 Cal. Super. LEXIS 34834 *73 (refusing to consider demurrer by moving defendants to claim not asserted against them); Khobarian v. Jamalpanah (2023) 2023 Cal. Super. LEXIS 23771 *6 (moving defendant does not have standing to object that the pleading is uncertain as to a co-defendant).)CONCLUSIONFor the foregoing reasons, the Court sustains LACDA’s demurrer to the SAC without leave to amend.DATED: June 28, 2024 ___________________________Edward B.
