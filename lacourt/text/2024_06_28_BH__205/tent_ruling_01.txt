  Case Number:  23SMCV02781    Hearing Date:   June 28, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   3GEN NET LEASE, LP,   Plaintiff, v.  ROEM AUTOMOTIVE INC., et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV02781     Hearing Date:  June 28, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO COMPEL    PRODUCTION OF RECORDS FROM    CUSTODIAN OF RECORDS OF THE    JEROME H. AND FAITH PEARLMAN    TRUST NO. 2 AND FOR SANCTIONS     BACKGROUND   This case arises from a landlord tenant dispute.  Defendants Roem Automotive Inc., Jeffrey Atkins and Caren Atkins entered into a written commercial lease agreement (the “Lease”) with Jordan Geller, as the trustee of the Jerome H. and Faith Pearlman Trust No. 2 (the “Pearlman Trust”).  The Pearlman Trust agreed to lease to Defendants an industrial building located at 1101 Olympic Blvd, Santa Monica, California (the “Premises”).  Defendants ran an automobile repair shop at the Premises.    Plaintiff 3Gen acquired the Premises from the Pearlman Trust, which assigned to 3Gen all of its rights and benefits under the Initial Lease and amendments thereto.  After Plaintiff acquired the Premises, Defendants allegedly failed to pay to Plaintiff amounts due under the Initial Lease and its amendments (including real estate property taxes), and wrongfully vacated and abandoned the Premises during the term of the Lease.      The operative complaint alleges three claims for: (1) breach of contract, (2) common count, and (3) breach of contract on personal guaranty.    Defendants filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff and Jordan Geller individually and as successor trustee of the Pearlman Trust, alleging four claims for (1) fraud-concealment, (2) fraud-intentional misrepresentation, (3) fraud-negligent misrepresentation, and (4) rescission.  Defendants allege they were misled into entering the Lease and its amendments because Plaintiff allegedly failed to disclose that Defendants would be liable for a huge tax increase due to the death of Faith Pearlman, the original trustee of the Pearlman Trust.   On April 24, 2024, Defendants served a Notice of Taking Deposition of the Custodian of Records of the Jerome H. and Faith Pearlman Trust No. 2 (the “Trust”) and Notice to Produce Documents at Deposition.  The notice sought production of only one category of documents:  “All federal and state income tax forms and schedules filed by the Jerome H. and Faith Pearlman Trust No. 2 between 2014 to the present.”  (Ex. 1.)  Plaintiff served written objections to the production of the tax records, claiming they were privileged.  (Ex. 4.)    On May 16, 2024, the Court conducted an informal discovery conference (“IDC”).  After hearing from both parties, the Court concluded “that information in the tax returns regarding property value is discoverable, unless it can be attained elsewhere.”  (Ex. 5.) This hearing is on Defendants’ motion to compel production of documents.  Defendants argue the tax records are relevant to the issue of valuation of the Premises at and following the death of Faith Pearlman and Mr. Geller’s knowledge of same.  Defendants agree to allow the Trust to redact all other information from the tax records.  Defendants also seek sanctions because they maintain the Trust’s objections were without substantial justification.   LEGAL STANDARD To request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1);¿Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the responding party’s¿statement of compliance with the demand to produce is incomplete (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate or evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)),¿(c)¿the responding party’s objection is without merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3);¿Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)). A motion to compel further responses to requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.” (CCP § 2031.310(b)(1).) “To establish ‘good cause,’ the burden is on the moving party to show both: [¶] Relevance to the subject matter (e.g., how the information in the documents would tend to prove or disprove some issue in the case); and [¶] Specific facts justifying discovery (e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial.) [Citations.] [¶] The fact that there is no alternative source for the information sought is an important factor in establishing ‘good cause’ for inspection.  But it is not essential in every case.”  (Edmon & Karnow, California¿¿Practice Guide: Civ. Proc. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2020) ¶ 8:1495.6.).) “For discovery purposes, information is relevant if it ‘might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.’ [Citation.]¿Admissibility is not the test and information, unless privileged, is discoverable if it might reasonably lead to admissible evidence. [Citation.] These rules are applied liberally in favor of discovery.” (Gonzales v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.)  Doubts about¿relevance generally are resolved in favor of permitting discovery.  (SCC Acquisitions, Inc. v. Superior¿Court (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 741, 755-756.) “If ‘good cause’ is shown by the moving party, the burden is then on the responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure[.]” (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 8:1496.) MEET AND CONFER Defendants submit the Declaration of Glen R. Segal which shows the parties met and conferred by e-mails exchanged on June 3, 2024.  The parties also participated in an IDC on May 16, 2024, where the Court concluded that “Defendant has complied with the IDC requirement and may file their motion(s) to compel on issues addressed today, if needed.”  (Ex. 5.)  Based on the foregoing, Defendants have satisfied their meet and confer obligations.   DISCUSSION Motion to Compel Tax Returns Defendants argue that the tax returns they seek are relevant.  The Court agrees. In discovery, the scope of relevance is broad.  Information is relevant “if it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a settlement. [citations omitted] Admissibility is not the test and information, unless privileged, is discoverable if it might reasonably lead to admissible evidence.”  (Lipton v. Superior Court¿(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611-1612.)  Discovery rules are to be “construed liberally in favor of disclosure unless the request is clearly improper by virtue of well-established causes for denial.”  (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 541.)  This means that “disclosure is a matter of right unless statutory or public policy considerations clearly prohibit it.”  (Id.) Using this broad standard, tax returns reflecting the value of the Premises at and following the time of Mrs. Pearlman’s death and Mr. Geller’s knowledge of same are clearly relevant.  Defendants contend that when the Lease was negotiated in September 2016, the Trust, through its principal, Mr. Geller, represented the real property taxes for the Premises would be a “few hundred dollars” per month.  Defendants contend that Mr. Geller knew at the time that the trustee and owner of the Trust, his grandmother (“Mrs. Pearlman”), had died on April 26, 2015 and that this would cause the County Assessor to reassess the value of the Premises.  Defendants contend that Mr. Geller failed to disclose to Defendants that Mrs. Pearlman had died and that hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional property taxes would be sought from Defendants.  Given the foregoing, tax returns showing the value of the Premises on or after the death of Mrs. Pearlman may tend to show Mr. Geller’s knowledge relating to the appraised value of the Premises and the amount of taxes that would be due after the passing of Mrs. Pearlman, which is relevant to Defendants’ cross-complaint.     The Trust argues the tax returns are privileged and protected from disclosure.  But the tax return privilege is not absolute and will not be upheld when the nature of the underlying transactions is in dispute, and there is no¿alternative source for the information.  (Weststeyn Dairy 2 v. Eades Commodities Co. (E.D. Cal. 2003) 280 F. Supp. 2d 1044, 1083 (applying California law).)  The Trust does not dispute that the property value reflected in the tax returns is related to an issue in dispute.  It only argues there is an alternative source for the information.  The Trust argues the tax returns reflect the appraised value of the Premises, and the appraised value has already been disclosed by Plaintiff and the County Assessor.  But the Trust overlooks the fact that the tax returns will show Mr. Geller’s contemporaneous knowledge of the appraised value as the returns were available to him.  The Trust has not shown there is an alternative source for this information.             In sum, because the documents are relevant and there is no alternative source, the Court grants the motion to compel production of the redacted tax returns.   Motion for Sanctions Defendants seek sanctions in the amount of $13,455 because they argue Plaintiff has no substantial justification to oppose the motion to compel document production.  While Plaintiff’s position ultimately did not prevail, the Court cannot conclude Plaintiff opposed the motion in bad faith or without substantial justification.  Its argument that there was an alternative source for the information was not specious.  Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants’ request for sanctions. Plaintiff move for competing sanctions in the amount of $12,510, arguing Defendants misused the discovery process in continuing to seek the tax returns when information in the returns is available elsewhere.  As Defendants prevailed on this motion, there clearly was no misuse of the discovery process, and accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for sanctions.   CONCLUSION The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendants’ motion to compel production of documents and for sanctions.    DATED: June 28, 2024    ___________________________ 



Edward B. Moreton, Jr. Judge of the Superior Court 

Superior Court of California 

County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   3GEN NET LEASE, LP,   Plaintiff, v.  ROEM AUTOMOTIVE INC., et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV02781     Hearing Date:  June 27, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY    JUDGMENT, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,    SUMMARY ADJUDICATION OF    COMPLAINT AND CROSS-COMPLAINT      BACKGROUND   This case arises from a landlord tenant dispute.  On September 16, 2016, Defendants Roem Automotive Inc. (“Roem”), Jeffrey Atkins and Caren Atkins entered into a written commercial lease agreement (the “Initial Lease”) with Jordan Geller, as the trustee of the Jerome H. and Faith Pearlman Trust No. 2 (the “Pearlman Trust”).  (Undisputed Material Fact (“UMF”) No. 1.)  The Pearlman Trust agreed to lease to Defendants an industrial building located at 1101 Olympic Blvd, Santa Monica, California (the “Premises”).  (UMF No. 1.)  Defendants ran an automobile repair shop at the Premises.  (Defendants’ Additional Material Facts (“AMF”) No. 4.) The Initial Lease was modified by: (a) First Amendment dated April 12, 2017, (b) Second Amendment dated June 30, 2017, (c) Third Amendment dated July 2017 and (d) Fourth Amendment dated August 8, 2020 (“Amendments” and collectively with the Initial Lease, the “Lease”).  (UMF No. 2.)  Defendants Jeffrey Atkins and Caren Atkins entered into a written guaranty (“Guaranty”) with the Pearlman Trust pursuant to which each agreed to be personally liable for Roem’s obligations under the Lease.  (UMF No. 3.)   In August 2019, Plaintiff 3Gen acquired the Premises from the Pearlman Trust, which assigned to 3Gen all of its rights and benefits under the Lease.  (UMF Nos. 5, 6.)   Pursuant to the Lease, Defendants were required to do each of the following: Pay base rent (“Base Rent”) to 3Gen, as specified in the Fourth Amendment (UMF No. 13) Pay all real property taxes (“Real Property Taxes”) due for the Premises, including any additional taxes due to a change of ownership (UMF No. 14) Pay all operating costs associated with the operation of the Premises, including insurance premiums, maintenance costs, utilities and security (“Operating Expenses”) (UMF No. 15) Tender late charge amounts due and owed in an amount which is the greater of (a) ten percent of the overdue amount, or (b) $100.00 (“Late Charges”) (UMF No. 16) Pay interest at a rate of 10% per annum of any amounts due 3Gen and unpaid (“Interest”) (UMF No. 17) and Pay 3Gen’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs if 3Gen must employ attorneys to collect amounts due (UMF No. 18.) According to Plaintiff, Defendants breached the Lease and Guaranty by doing or failing to do each of the following: They abandoned the Premises in June 2022, in violation of the Lease which had a term through January 31, 2025 (UMF Nos. 4, 19, 20) They failed to pay Base Rent beginning July 1, 2022 and continuing thereafter (UMF Nos. 22-23)  They failed to pay Real Property Taxes (UMF Nos. 26-35) They failed to pay Interest and Late Charges (UMF Nos. 36-39)      Defendants dispute there was a contract formed.  Defendants attest they were misled into entering the Lease because Mr. Geller told Mr. Atkins property taxes would only be a “few hundred dollars a month”.  (AMF No. 7.)  Mr. Geller failed to disclose that Defendants would be liable for a huge tax increase due to the death of his grandmother, Faith Pearlman, the original trustee of the Pearlman Trust.  (AMF No. 14.)  Due to this alleged misrepresentation and failure to disclose, Defendants argue there was no mutual assent, and any contract is voided by fraud.   Plaintiff dispute there was fraud, relying on an email sent by Mr. Atkins to Mr. Geller.  On September 13, 2016, 3 days before the Initial Lease was signed, Mr. Atkins emailed Mr. Geller to discuss the Initial Lease.  (UMF No. 50.)  Mr. Atkins wrote to Mr. Geller that, “My broker noted the property owner has a ‘step up basis’ on the property due to the death of the original owner so the property value is reset at the time of death – let’s say it was reset to $1.3m – the tax basis on the property was approximately $325k – so the current 2nd generation owner would be the beneficiary of approximately $1m in tax free income from the sale.”  (UMF No. 52.)  According to Plaintiff, this email shows Mr. Atkins (1) knew the owner of the Premises had passed away, (2) the Property would be reassessed as a result of her death, (3) the assessed value was well below the current market value, and (4) the increase in taxes was likely to be significant as a result.      Defendants dispute the September 13, 2016 email proves they had knowledge of the huge tax increase that would result from Mrs. Pearlman’s death.  Mr. Geller had told Mr. Atkins that the property taxes would be “few hundred dollars”, so Mr. Atkins had no reason to critically analyze the information in the email.  (AMF No. 32.)  The email was taken verbatim from an email sent to Mr. Atkins by real estate agent and related to a possible purchase of the Premises.  (AMF Nos. 33-34.)  Mr. Geller said he was not interested in selling the Premises, and therefore, the email became irrelevant to Mr. Atkins.  (AMF No. 34.)  Further, Mr. Atkins did not understand the information in the email; he did not know what a “step up in basis” was, why it would cause a “reset” of property value, what a tax basis was, what a “2nd generation owner” was or why there would be “tax free income.”  (AMF No. 35.)  At that point, Mr. Atkins had never paid real property taxes except on his home.  (AMF No. 35.)  He did not understand that any of this information could impact the taxes Roem was going to pay on the Premises if Roem ended up leasing it.  (AMF No. 35.)            Plaintiff claims it suffered damages in the total amount of $1,255,504.08 which is comprised of the following (UMF Nos. 25, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 45): ITEM TOTAL BASE RENT  Base Rent Principal $273,956.90 Base Rent Interest (Through 6/28/24) $43,391.71 Base Rent Late Charge $27,395.69 Subtotal $344,744.30 REAL ESTATE PROPERTY TAXES  Real Property Taxes (Through 6/28/24) $284,641.10 Real Property Taxes Interest (Through 6/28/24) $59,828.67 Real Property Taxes Late Charge $28,444.11 Future Real Property Taxes (Through Term) $31,282.23 Subtotal $404,196.11 ADDITIONAL DAMAGES  Operational Expenses $15,578.42 Expenditures to Re-Let Premises $41,164.50 Attorneys’ Fees (Through 2/29/24) $176,298.73 Legal Costs $902.65 Shortfall $271,619.37 Subtotal $506,563.67 TOTAL $1,255,504.08 Defendants dispute these damages, arguing there was no contract and therefore no amounts due.  Further, Defendants argue Plaintiff has not provided documentary evidence of several of these amounts including out of pocket real property taxes, future real property taxes, operational expenses, expenditures to re-let the Premises and attorneys’ fees.   The operative complaint alleges three claims for: (1) breach of contract (Lease), (2) common count (account stated), and (3) breach of contract (Guaranty).    Defendants filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff and Jordan Geller individually and as successor trustee of the Pearlman Trust, alleging four claims for (1) fraud-concealment, (2) fraud-intentional misrepresentation, (3) fraud-negligent misrepresentation, and (4) rescission.   This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, for summary adjudication of the complaint and cross-complaint.  As to its complaint, Plaintiff argues it has proven all essential elements of its claims: it has shown the parties entered into a valid enforceable agreement (the Lease and Guaranty); it fully performed its obligations under the agreements except those excused by Defendants’ breach; Defendants breached the agreements by abandoning the Premises and failing to make their payment obligations, and Defendants’ breaches have caused Plaintiff to suffer damages.  As to the cross-complaint, Plaintiff argues Defendants cannot prove essential elements of their cross-claims because Plaintiff did not conceal any material facts with the intent to defraud Defendants; Defendants did not justifiably rely on any alleged misrepresentation; Defendants assumed the risk, and the Lease was not procured by fraud nor was it the result of mutual mistake.     LEGAL STANDARD¿¿  Summary Judgment as to Complaint  Code Civ. Proc. §437c(c) “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Minor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)¿ “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”¿ (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67).¿¿¿ A plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment if it has proven each element of the cause of action entitling it to judgment on that cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc. §437c, subd. (p)(1).)  This means that a plaintiff who bears the burden of proof at trial by a preponderance of the evidence must produce evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact to find any underlying material fact more likely than not.  (Lillian F. v. Superior Court (1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 314, 320.)  Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.”¿ (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)   Once the plaintiff has made its evidentiary showing, the burden shifts to the defendant who must “set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action.”  (West Coast Life Ins. Co. v. Ward (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 181, 188.)  To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence.¿ (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) The California Supreme Court has recognized that a plaintiff seeking summary judgment must only prove its cause of action and need not disprove any alleged affirmative defenses:  “Summary judgment law in this state no longer requires a plaintiff moving for summary judgment to disprove any defense asserted by the defendant as well as prove each element of his own cause of action … All that the plaintiff need do is to ‘prove[] each element of the cause of action.’”  (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Summary Judgment as to Cross-Complaint A defendant is entitled to summary judgment if it has shown that one or more elements of a cause of action cannot be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc. §437c(o), (p)(2); Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1107; Aguilar, 25 Cal.4th at 853; Fritelli Inc. v. 350 North Canon Drive LP (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 35, 40, 41.)  To prevail, the defendant need not “conclusively negate” a required element of the plaintiff's claim; “all that is required is a showing that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence.”  (Wall St. Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co.¿(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1176.)  Once the defendant meets its initial burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate, through admissible evidence, that a triable issue of material fact exists.  (Code Civ. Proc. §437c(p)(2).)  The plaintiff “may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but instead, shall set forth specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §437c(p)(2).) EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS The Court sustains Defendants’ Objection Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 20, 22, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42 and overrules Objection Nos. 2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 31, 41 to the Declaration of Jordan Geller.   DISCUSSION Complaint-Breach of Contract To prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.  (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)   Here, Plaintiff has shown (1) the existence of a contract (the Lease and the Guaranty) (UMF Nos. 1, 2, 3), (2) 3Gen fully performed its obligations under the contracts except those excused by Defendants’ breaches (UMF Nos. 46, 48); (3) Defendants breached the contracts by abandoning the Premises and failing to make their payment obligations (UMF Nos. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28, 30, 31, 34), and (4) Defendants’ breaches caused 3Gen to suffer damages in the amount of $1,255,504.08 (UMF Nos. 25, 32, 35-41, 43, 45).   Because Plaintiff has made its evidentiary showing, the burden shifts to Defendants to show there is a triable issue of fact on the cause of action or an affirmative defense.  Defendants argue there are triable issues on their affirmative defenses of intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, fraud based on concealment and mistake.  The Court agrees as to the first defense and declines to consider the other defenses. Fraud may be asserted as an affirmative defense to an action for breach of contract.  (Grady v. Easley (1941) 45 Cal.App.2d 632, 642.)  Defendants’ fraud defense is based on the following facts, on which the Court concludes there are triable issues:  (1) Mr. Geller represented that the property taxes under the Lease would be a “few hundred dollars” per month (Atkins Decl. ¶7); (2) the circumstantial evidence suggests Mr. Geller knew this representation was not true because he knew his grandmother, Faith Pearman, had passed; he knew the real property taxes would be adjusted based on the market value of the Premises at the time of death; he had a 75 page appraisal which valued the Property as of the time of Mrs. Pearlman’s death at $2,830,000 which was more than eight times the $328,117 assessed value before Mrs. Pearlman’s death, and he knew the property taxes would go up proportionately, i.e., they would increase 8-fold (Exs. 28, 30, 46); (3) Mr. Geller made the representation to persuade Defendants to agree to the Lease (Atkins Decl. ¶¶ 5-6), (4) Defendants reasonably relied on the representation (Id. ¶¶ 4-5), and (5) Defendants would not have entered into the Lease if they had known that the representation was not true (Atkins Decl. ¶ 20).  Plaintiff argues Defendants cannot show they reasonably relied based on a September 13, 2016 email sent by Mr. Atkins to Mr. Geller (Ex. 20).  Plaintiffs argue the fourth paragraph of the email proves Mr. Atkins knew that (1) the owner of the Property had passed away (“the property owner had a ‘step up basis’ on the property due to the death of the original owner”); (2) the Property would be reassessed as a result of her death (“the property value is reset at the time of death”); (3) the assessed value was well below current market value (“the tax basis on the property was approximately $325k”), and (4) the increase in taxes was likely to be significant because the value of the Premises had increased significantly (“the property value is reset at the time of death – let’s say it was reset to $1.3m”).   Defendants argue the email is inadmissible based on a lack of foundation, speculation, lack of personal knowledge and hearsay since it is entirely based on statements from a third party.  Without addressing Defendants’ evidentiary objections, the Court concludes the email does not conclusively resolve the issue of reasonable reliance.  The reasonableness of the party’s reliance is judged by reference to the party’s knowledge and experience.  (Gray & Don Miller & Associates, Inc. (1984) 35 Cal.3d 498, 503.)  Here, Mr. Atkins attests he did not understand what “step up basis” was, what a “reset” of property value was, what a “tax basis was,” what a “2nd generation was” and why there would be a “tax free income.”  (Atkins Decl. ¶19.4.)  The information in the email came from a real estate agent friend of Mr. Atkins, and Mr. Atkins did nothing to understand the information because it was ultimately irrelevant since it was related to a possible purchase of the Property, and Mr. Geller told Mr. Atkins he had no interest in selling the Property.  At that point, Mr. Atkins had never paid real property taxes except on his personal home.  (Id.)  In light of Mr. Atkins’ knowledge and experience and the alleged irrelevance of the information, it is a triable issue whether Mr. Atkins could have gleaned from the email that if he leased the Premises his taxes would be far more than a “few hundred dollars” a month that Mr. Geller represented they would be. Accordingly, because there is a triable issue on at least one of Defendants’ affirmative defenses, the Court denies the motion for summary adjudication of Plaintiff’s breach of contract claims.       Complaint-Account Stated Plaintiff argues it has established all essential elements of its second cause of action for account stated.  The Court disagrees. “The essential¿elements of an¿account stated are: (1) previous transactions between the parties establishing the relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement between the parties, express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to the creditor; and (3) a promise by the debtor, express or implied to pay the amount due.”  (Leighton v. Forster¿(2017) 8 Cal.App.4th 467, 491.) Plaintiff has not established all¿elements requisite to a claim for¿account stated.  Mr. Geller never states anywhere in the 63 paragraphs of his declaration that Defendants agreed to the $1,255,504.08 amount claimed to be due.  Moreover, in paragraph 23 of his declaration, Mr. Atkins specifically denied that he ever agreed that he owes Plaintiff the amount it is claiming, thus creating a triable issue of fact even if Plaintiffs had otherwise established a prima facie case.  In any event, a claim for account stated may be attacked by proof of fraud.  (Gleason v. Klamer (1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 782, 787.)  As discussed above, there is a triable issue on whether there is fraud.   Accordingly, the Court denies summary adjudication on Plaintiff’s common count.     Cross-Complaint Plaintiff argues Defendants cannot prove their claim for concealment because Defendants were aware that the original owner had died before they entered into the Lease and they knew the previously assessed value of the Premises was well below the current market value, which would necessarily result in a substantial increase in the real property taxes.  The Court disagrees. The elements of a cause of action for concealment are: (1) the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.  (Tenet Healthsystem Desert Inc. v. Blue Cross of California (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 821, 844.) Here, Plaintiff relies on the September 13, 2016 email from Mr. Atkins to Mr. Geller, discussed above, to argue no facts were concealed.  The Court cannot conclude the September 13, 2016 email conclusively establishes there was no fraudulent concealment.  Given Mr. Atkins’ experience and knowledge, it is at least a triable issue whether he properly understood the import of the email.  There is also circumstantial evidence to suggest Mr. Geller knew Mr. Atkins did not, because Mr. Geller never raised the issue of property taxes except for one innocuous email acknowledging that taxes were paid, and he never mentioned anything about a possible tax reassessment while negotiating the extension of the lease on August 11, 2020, nearly four years after the death of his grandmother and while he was waiting to receive a response back from the assessor’s office as to the value of the reassessment.  (Ex. 46.)  Mr. Atkins attests Mr. Geller rushed him into renewing the lease for another four years before Mr. Geller received notice from the County Assessor’s Office.  (Atkins Decl. ¶9.)             Plaintiff next argues that Defendants cannot prove their claims for intentional and negligent misrepresentation because Mr. Geller did not misrepresent the amount of real estate property taxes that would be due, and in any event, Defendants could not have reasonably relied on such a misrepresentation because they were receiving advice from their own broker and the Lease urged them to seek legal counsel on the legal and tax consequences of the Lease.  The Court disagrees. The essential elements of an intentional misrepresentation claim are: (1) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment or nondisclosure); (2) knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to defraud; (4) justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage.  (Molko, 46 Cal.3d at 1108.)  The tort of negligent misrepresentation is similar to intentional misrepresentation, except that it does not require scienter or an intent to defraud.  (Tenet, 245 Cal.App.4th at 845.) Defendants claim Mr. Geller represented that the real property taxes would only be a “couple hundred dollars” (Atkins Decl. ¶7).  Accordingly, there is a triable issue as to whether Mr. Geller made the misrepresentation.  As to whether Defendants can prove justifiable reliance, Plaintiffs again rely on the September 13, 2016 email which the Court has already concluded does not conclusively resolve the issue of reasonable reliance.   As to Defendants’ remaining claim for rescission, Plaintiff argues the claim fails because the Lease was not the product of fraud or a result of mutual mistake or a result of unilateral mistake induced by fraud.  For reasons set forth above, there is at least a triable issue of fraud.  Plaintiff also argues that a party in default (as Defendants are) cannot seek rescission.  (Bryan v. Baymiller (1928) 95 Cal.App. 481, 487 (“Rescission of a contract cannot be made by party who is in default.”).)  But this rule does not apply where a contract was arguably induced by fraud.  (Graham v. Los Angeles First Nat'l Trust & Sav. Bank (1935) 3 Cal.2d 37, 45.)   Accordingly, the Court denies summary judgment of the cross-complaint.   CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, for summary adjudication of the complaint and cross-complaint.    DATED: June 27, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
