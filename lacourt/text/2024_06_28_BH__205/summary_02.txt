And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling issued by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. relates to a slip and fall case filed by plaintiff Elmira Apreian against defendants City of West Hollywood, Los Angeles County Development Authority (LACDA), and Rozana Doe. The plaintiff claims that the defendants are liable for her injuries sustained when she tripped and fell on a pine cone on a sidewalk adjacent to a multi-use residential property owned and managed by LACDA. The defendants argue that LACDA is immune from common law negligence and that the plaintiff has not stated a claim for vicarious liability against LACDA.

The court has sustained LACDA's demurrer to the second amended complaint (SAC) without leave to amend. The court has ruled that LACDA is immune from common law negligence and that the plaintiff has not stated a claim for vicarious liability against LACDA. The court has also declined to consider the plaintiff's opposition to the demurrer, which was filed late. The defendants have also demurred to the claims against Rozana Doe, which the court has declined to consider.

The court's decision is based on the following grounds: (1) LACDA is immune from common law negligence, (2) the plaintiff has not stated a claim for vicarious liability against LACDA, and (3) the plaintiff's opposition to the demurrer was filed late. The court has ordered that LACDA's demurrer be sustained without leave to amend.
