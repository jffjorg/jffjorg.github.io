And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting plaintiff Brandon Powell's motion to enforce a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement was entered into on February 21, 2023, and required defendant Venice Development Inc. and Sris Sinnathamby to pay $25,000 to plaintiff in exchange for a release of all claims. However, defendant failed to make the payment, and plaintiff seeks an order for liquidated damages of $10,000. The court has found that plaintiff is owed both the $25,000 payment and the additional $10,000 in liquidated damages. The motion is granted, and the court will adopt this tentative as the final order unless a party submits opposition.
