And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is overruled. The plaintiff, Subrigo Communications Corporation and Subrigo Networks Corporation, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Turner Construction Company and Silverado Contractors, Inc., alleging negligence. The plaintiff amended the complaint to add new allegations, which the defendant argued did not relate back to the original complaint and were therefore barred by the statute of limitations.

The judge found that the plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to show that the relation-back doctrine applies, which allows the amended complaint to relate back to the original complaint. The judge also found that the plaintiff's claims against all defendants rely on the same facts, injury, and recovery sought in the original complaint.

The judge declined to find the defendant's argument frivolous or to set an order to show cause for sanctions, as requested by the plaintiff. The case will proceed with the amended complaint.
