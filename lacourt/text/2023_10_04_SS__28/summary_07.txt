## English Summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled to continue the trial date in this case from December 12, 2023, to July 29, 2024. 

The Defendant, County of Los Angeles, requested the continuance because the Plaintiff hasn't responded to their written discovery requests and because the Defendant couldn't schedule a hearing for a summary judgment motion until May 14, 2024, after the original trial date. The Judge found this was a good reason to continue the trial. 

However, the Judge denied the Defendant's request to continue or reopen discovery deadlines because the Defendant did not follow the proper procedure by not including a "meet and confer" declaration demonstrating they attempted to resolve the discovery issue with the Plaintiff.
