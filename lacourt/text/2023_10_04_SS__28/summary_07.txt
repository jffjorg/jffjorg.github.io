Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The trial is currently scheduled for December 12, 2023, but Defendant County of Los Angeles requests that the trial be continued to October 4, 2023, and all related dates. The Court finds good cause to grant this request and continues the trial to July 29, 2024. However, the Court denies the request to continue or reopen discovery without prejudice, as the declaration supporting the motion did not show a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issue.
