PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Phu Kin Chiu requests

Christine

DISCUSSION 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (a),
provides: 
“(a) (1) A party may move for summary judgment in an
action or proceeding if it is contended that the action has no merit or that
there is no defense to the action or proceeding. The motion may be made at any
time after 60 days have elapsed since the general appearance in the action or
proceeding of each party against whom the motion is directed or at any earlier
time after the general appearance that the court, with or without notice and
upon good cause shown, may direct. 
“(2) Notice of the motion and supporting papers shall
be served on all other parties to the action at least 75 days before the time
appointed for hearing. If the notice is served by mail, the required 75-day
period of notice shall be increased by 5 days if the place of address is within
the State of California, 10 days if the place of address is outside the State
of California but within the United States, and 20 days if the place of address
is outside the United States. If the notice is served by facsimile transmission,
express mail, or another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery,
the required 75-day period of notice shall be increased by two court days. 
“(3) The motion shall be heard no later than 30 days
before the date of trial, unless the court for good cause orders otherwise. The
filing of the motion shall not extend the time within which a party must
otherwise file a responsive pleading.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (a).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (a)(3), “requires that two court days be added to the notice period where [electronic service] is employed.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 10:77, p. 10-34.)  “The applicable notice period is computed by counting backwards from the hearing date, excluding the date of the hearing.”  (Id., ¶ 10:80, pp. 10-34 to 10-35.) The hearing on the summary judgment motion was scheduled for October 4, 2023.  Therefore, notice under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (a), was required in July of 2023.  Phu Kin Chiu’s proof of service shows electronic service of the notice on August 31, 2023.  The notice was untimely. 
          The Court denies the summary judgment motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant/Cross-Defendant Phu Kin Chiu’s motion for summary judgment. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
