And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant/Cross-Defendant Phu Kin Chiu's motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed on August 25, 2023, and was scheduled to be heard on October 4, 2023. However, the notice of the motion was served electronically on August 31, 2023, which was outside the 75-day notice period required by Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (a). The Judge concludes that the notice was untimely and therefore denies the motion for summary judgment.
