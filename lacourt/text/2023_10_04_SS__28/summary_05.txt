## English Summary 

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Phu Kin Chiu's motion for summary judgment. The reason for denial is that Phu Kin Chiu did not provide sufficient notice to the other parties involved in the case. 

The Judge found that the notice of the motion was served on August 31, 2023, which is later than the required date under California law. The law requires a minimum of 75 days' notice for a summary judgment motion, and Phu Kin Chiu's notice was served too close to the hearing date. 


As a result, the Judge denied the motion, meaning the case will proceed towards trial.
