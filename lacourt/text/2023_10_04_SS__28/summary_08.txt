## English Summary

The judge has reviewed the arguments made by both sides in the case and decided to overrule Uber's objection to the lawsuit.

Uber wanted the court to dismiss the lawsuit against them, arguing that they can't be held responsible for the actions of the driver, Lashane Philips, because he was an independent contractor, not an employee. They also argued that even if he was an employee, his actions went beyond the scope of his job.

The judge disagreed, stating that a jury could reasonably conclude Philips' actions were related to his employment, making Uber potentially responsible for his actions. The case will now proceed to trial.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Lilit Hakobyan and Khachatur Aspoyan vs. Uber Technologies, Inc. and Lashane Philips. The case involves allegations of negligence, negligent hiring, retention, supervision, and training, assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge has overruled the demurrer filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. to the first, third, and fourth causes of action, which alleged that Uber Technologies, Inc. is vicariously liable for the actions of Lashane Philips, who assaulted the plaintiffs. The judge found that a jury could infer from the facts pleaded in the complaint that Philips' assault was an outgrowth of his employment with Uber, exposing Uber to potential vicarious liability.

The judge also overruled the demurrer to the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, as plaintiffs have not asserted such a claim.

The case is set for trial on January 3, 2024.
