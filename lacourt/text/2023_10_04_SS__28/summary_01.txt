Coleman wants contact information for two former Parsec employees, Jovan Cebreros and Alberto Gonzalez. He believes this information is relevant to his case because it could shed light on Parsec's safety practices.  Parsec argues that releasing the employees' contact information would violate their privacy and that it is not relevant to the case. The Judge sided with Parsec, denying Coleman's request for the contact information. 

The Judge also ordered Coleman to pay $500 in sanctions to Parsec for filing the motion. The Judge found that Coleman had not shown sufficient justification for seeking the contact information.

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and a request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Morreco R. Coleman, filed a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set four, numbers 78 and 80, which request the contact information of two former employees of the defendant, Parsec, Inc. The defendant opposes the motion and requests $1,250 in sanctions.

The court finds that the privacy rights of the former employees, Jovan Cebreros and Alberto Gonzalez, outweigh the plaintiff's right to their contact information because they have stated they do not wish to be contacted about the case and the plaintiff has not shown that they have or are likely to have discoverable information.

The court grants the defendant's request for $500 in sanctions and denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The court orders the plaintiff to pay the defendant $500 in sanctions by November 3, 2023.
