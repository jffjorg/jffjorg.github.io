 Case Number:  22STCV05857    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
February 15, 2022, Plaintiff Jeffrey Volpei (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants County of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) and Does 1-50 for
dangerous condition of public property (Gov. Code, §§ 830.6, 835) and dangerous
condition of public property—failure to warn (Gov. Code, §§ 830.8, 835). 
On
April 21, 2022, Defendant/Cross-Complainant County of Los Angeles filed an
answer and a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Tomas Hernandez
(“Hernandez”) and Roes 1-50 for implied indemnity, contribution, and
declaratory relief. On June 29, 2022, Hernandez filed an answer. 
On
October 31, 2022, the Court granted Hernandez’s motion for a determination that
his settlement with Plaintiff was in good faith and denied the motion of
Defendant/Cross- Complainant County of Los Angeles for a finding that the
settlement was not in good faith. 
On
January 31, 2023, the Court dismissed Hernandez from the cross-complaint with
prejudice at the request of Defendant/Cross-Complainant County of Los Angeles. 
On
September 7, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to continue the trial and all related
dates to be heard on October 4, 2023. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for December 12, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Defendant
requests that the Court continue the trial and all related dates. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b), provides that “a party seeking a continuance of
the date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by
the parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an
ex parte application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with
supporting declarations. The party must make the motion or application as soon
as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered.” 
          Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c), the Court may grant a continuance
only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.
Circumstances that may indicate good cause include “a party's excused inability
to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite
diligent efforts,” or the unavailability of a party, counsel, or expert due to
death, illness or other excusable circumstance. The Court should consider all
facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as proximity of the
trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice are served.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 provides: 
“(a) On
motion of any party, the court may grant leave to complete discovery
proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery heard, closer to the
initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new trial date has been set.
This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040. 
“(b) In
exercising its discretion to grant or deny this motion, the court shall take
into consideration any matter relevant to the leave requested, including, but
not limited to, the following: 
“(1) The
necessity and the reasons for the discovery. 
“(2) The
diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery or the
hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that the discovery was not
completed or that the discovery motion was not heard earlier. 
“(3) Any
likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing the discovery motion will
prevent the case from going to trial on the date set, or otherwise interfere
with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any other party. 
“(4) The
length of time that has elapsed between any date previously set, and the date
presently set, for the trial of the action. 
“(c) The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to extend or to reopen discovery, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050.) 
DISCUSSION 
Defendant
requests that the Court continue the trial because Plaintiff has not responded
to Defendant’s written discovery and because Defendant could not reserve a date
for a hearing on a summary judgment motion until May 14, 2024, which is after
the currently-scheduled trial date. 
The
Court finds good cause to grant the request to continue the trial and continues
the trial to July 29, 2024. 
Defendant
also asks the Court to continue all related discovery and motion deadlines to trail the new trial date.  Although Defendant’s motion does not cite
Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, the statute governs the Court’s
consideration of requests to continue or reopen discovery.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (b)
[“Except as provided in Section 2024.050, a continuance or postponement of the
trial date does not operate to reopen discovery proceedings”].) 
A
motion to reopen discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 must
be “accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (a).)  “A meet and confer declaration in support of
a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
The
declaration that accompanies Defendant’s motion does not show that Defendant
has attempted to resolve the issue of continuing or reopening discovery with
Plaintiff or that Defendant has addressed this issue with Plaintiff.  Because Defendant’s motion does not comply
with the requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, subdivision
(a), to provide a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2016.040, the Court denies the request to continue or reopen discovery. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS the motion of Defendant County of Los
Angeles to continue the trial.  Trial is continued to July 29, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in
Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
The Final Status Conference is July 15, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department
28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
The
Court DENIES the request of Defendant County of Los Angeles to continue or reopen
discovery without prejudice. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
