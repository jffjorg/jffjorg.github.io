 Case Number:  21STCV04942    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
reviewed Defendant Adam Brett Goldberg’s unopposed motions to compel responses
to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of
documents, the Court rules as follows. 
On
May 8, 2023, Defendant Adam Brett Goldberg served form interrogatories, set one, special interrogatories, set one, and request for production of documents,
set one, on Plaintiff Matt Bilinsk. 
Responses
were due on July 16, 2023. Plaintiff Matt Bilinsk failed to provide timely,
verified responses. Defendant Adam Brett Goldberg now moves to compel
code-compliant responses. 
The
Court grants the motions to compel responses to the form and special
interrogatories under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b),
and orders Plaintiff Matt Bilinsk to provide verified responses to the
interrogatories compliant with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.210,
subdivision (a), and 2030.220 without objections by November 3, 2023. 
The

under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 and orders Plaintiff Matt
Bilinsk to provide verified responses compliant with Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.210 and to produce the documents, electronically stored
information, and/or other things requested without objections by November 3,
2023. 
Defendant
Adam Brett Goldberg requests monetary sanctions of $810.00 for each motion
based on 3 hours of attorney’s work at a rate of $250.00 per hour and 1 $60.00
filing fee.  Counsel spent 1 hour drafting each motion and anticipates spending 2 hours to attend the hearing.

heard together. The Court awards sanctions of $1,180.00 for all motions, based
on 4 hours of attorney’s work and 3 filing fees.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§
