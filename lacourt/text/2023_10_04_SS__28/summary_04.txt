The court also imposes sanctions on Maria Avila and her attorney in the amount of $561.65. The ruling orders Maria Avila to produce the requested documents by November 3, 2023. The court finds that Maria Avila's failure to produce the documents despite multiple requests is a misuse of the discovery process and warrants the imposition of sanctions.
