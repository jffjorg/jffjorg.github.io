In this case, Plaintiff Patricia Avila is suing Defendants Chris Brown and Black Pyramid, LLC for injuries she allegedly sustained after witnessing an incident involving her sister, Maria Avila (Third Party), and a dog at Defendants' property. Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Third Party's deposition and document production, arguing that the information is relevant to her case. Third Party objected to both requests, claiming she is unavailable for deposition due to a separate lawsuit and that her testimony would be detrimental to Plaintiff's case. The judge found that Third Party's separate lawsuit does not negate her obligation to comply with the subpoena and granted Plaintiff's motion to compel. The Court also awarded Plaintiff $561.65 in sanctions against Third Party for her failure to comply with the discovery requests.  Third Party is now ordered to produce the requested documents by November 3, 2023.
