And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to compel Defendant Charlesetta Grant to produce documents requested in a deposition notice and for sanctions. The motion is denied due to lack of proper service on Grant. The court finds that the proof of service attached to the motion does not show personal service or any service on Grant, and the plaintiff has not shown that Grant agreed to accept service at another address. The court also notes that Grant did not appear in the action and therefore did not have the opportunity to respond to the motion. The court denies the motion and orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service with the court within five days.
