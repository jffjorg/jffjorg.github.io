Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs, Motion to Tax Costs
The court considered the moving,
opposition, and reply papers and supporting declarations filed in connection
with these motions. 
Discussion
Plaintiff Augusto Barco-Robledo (“Plaintiff”)
moves the court for an order awarding attorney’s fees, costs and expenses in his
favor, to be paid by defendant General Motors, LLC (“Defendant”), in the total
amount of $95,255.36, consisting of (1) $89,267.25 in attorney’s fees after applying
a multiplier of 1.5 to base fees of $56,511.50, and (2) $5,988.11 in costs.  
First, the court finds that Plaintiff
is entitled to recover attorney’s fees from Defendant pursuant to the
Song-Beverly Act.  Civil Code section
1794, subdivision (d), provides:¿ “If the buyer prevails in an action under
this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s
fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been
reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.”¿¿¿ 
Plaintiff has presented evidence
showing, and Defendant does not dispute, that on March 5, 2024, the parties
arrived at a settlement agreement which stipulated that Plaintiff would be
deemed the prevailing party so that Plaintiff could seek attorney’s fees and
costs by motion. (Crandall Decl. ¶ 24.)  
Second, the court finds, as to the
attorney’s fees incurred by Plaintiff in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of this action and the preparation of this fee motion, that
Plaintiff has established a lodestar amount of $54,769.50.
“[T]he
fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. . . .¿ The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for
similar work.¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration
of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market
value for the legal services provided.”¿ (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (internal citations omitted); Reck v. FCA US LLC (2021)
64 Cal.App.5th 682, 691 [“To determine a reasonable attorney fee award, the
trial court applies the lodestar method”].)  
The prevailing party is entitled to “’compensation for
all the hours reasonably spent” in litigating the action to a successful
conclusion. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc.¿(2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 821.) ‘Reasonably spent’ means that time spent ‘in the
form of inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.’ (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 394.) 
“[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”¿ (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State Univ.
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)  However,
the court may rely on his or her own experience and is given broad discretion
in calculating reasonable attorney’s fees. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132 ["The experienced trial judge is the best judge of the
value of professional services rendered in his court...”].)
The lodestar may be augmented or diminished “by taking
various relevant factors into account including (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved and the skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys; and (3) the contingent nature of the¿¿fee award, based on the
uncertainty of prevailing on the merits and of establishing eligibility for the
award.” (Ibid.) The multiplier is a risk enhancement based on the probability
of loss. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc.¿(2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 785, 821 (Robertson).)
Plaintiff
requests that the court take judicial notice of thirteen orders in Superior
Court proceedings unrelated to this action, and excerpts of the United States
Consumer Law Attorney Fee Survey Report for 2017-2018.  Factual findings in prior judicial orders,
opinions, or decisions are not a proper subject of judicial notice. (Kilroy v.
State of Calif. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 140, 148.)  Nor does the court take judicial notice of matters
not relevant to the proceeding.  As a
result, the court denies Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice in its
entirety.
However, Plaintiff has submitted the
declaration of attorney Sean Crandall, in which he has attested to the
qualifications, skill, and experience of the attorneys that worked on this
action.  (Crandall Decl., ¶¶ 27, 47-50.)  The court finds that the hourly rates
requested are reasonable in light of counsel’s qualifications and
experience.  (Ibid.)
Defendant opposes the motion, contending that Plaintiff’s
counsel’s claimed fees are unreasonable because many of the claimed hours are
unnecessary, padded, and unsupported.  Defendant
also contends a multiplier is unwarranted because the case is not complex, the
case did not prevent Plaintiff’s counsel from taking on other clients, and
Plaintiff’s counsel’s rates already take the contingent risk of Song-Beverly
cases into account. Defendant also moved to tax $1,051.55 of Plaintiff’s expenses,
claiming they were unnecessary.  
The court finds that this case was a routine Song-Beverly
case that did not involve novel issues, extraordinary risk, or protracted
litigation, and therefore does not warrant a lodestar multiplier. Plaintiff’s
reliance upon Defendant’s discovery tactics and sanctions imposed against it to
justify application of a multiplier is not persuasive as those facts are not relevant
to the factors set forth in Robertson,
particularly where substantial monetary sanctions were already imposed against
Defendant.  Plaintiff’s request for a
1.5x multiplier is denied.
Upon the court’s review of counsel’s
declarations, the court finds that the following hourly rates are reasonable: $425.00
to $500.00 per hour for attorney Sean Crandall; $435 to $520 per hour for attorney
Carey Wood; $175 to $200 per hour for paralegal Clarence Serrano; and $200 to
210 per hour for paralegal Alexis Valdovinos. 
The court has reviewed each entry on the
billing statement submitted by Plaintiff’s counsel, Defendant’s opposition
papers, and its objections to specific billing entries. Based on the court’s
review of the billing statement and Defendant’s challenges thereto, the court
finds that:
(1) Of
the total 2 hours spent by Clarence Serrano on April 12 and 13, 2022 to make
calls to the court clerk to schedule IDC, 2 of those hours were secretarial and
not reasonably incurred at a rate of $175, for a reduction of $350.00;
(2) Of
the 1 hour spent by Alexis Valdovinos on November 29, 2023 to review emails and
update the case with respect to FSC and trial dates, 0.5 of those hours were
not reasonably incurred at a rate of $200, for a reduction of $100.00;
(3) Of
the 2.7 hours spent by Sean Crandall on January 19 and 20, 2022 to review
repair history and draft defect definitions, 1.2 of those hours were not
reasonably incurred at a rate of $425, for a reduction of $510.00;
(4) Of
the 1.1 total hours spent by Sean Crandall on October 12, 2023 to review the
repair chronology, 0.6 of those hours were not reasonably incurred at a rate of
$470, for a reduction of $282.00;
(5) Of
the 6 total additional hours anticipated to be spent by Sean Crandall on the
motion for attorney’s fees and motion to tax costs, 1 of those hours is not
reasonably incurred at a rate of $500, for a reduction of $500.00.
The court therefore finds that after reducing
the requested fees by a total of $1,742.00 as described above, Plaintiff has
established, as to the attorney’s fees incurred to commence and prosecute this
action and incurred in connection with this fee motion and the motion to tax
costs, a lodestar amount of $54,769.50. 
Plaintiff also seeks $5,988.11 in costs
and expenses. For purposes of the Song-Beverly statute, expenses encompass out-of-pocket
expenses beyond the costs identified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.  (Smalley v. Subaru of Am., Inc. (2022)
87 Cal.App.5th 450, 457, as modified.)  “In
ruling upon a motion to tax costs, the trial court's first determination is
whether the statute expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears
proper on its face. ‘If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show [the
costs] to be unnecessary or unreasonable.’ [Citation]. Where costs are not
expressly allowed by the statute, the burden is on the party claiming the costs
to show that the charges were reasonable and necessary. [Citation].” (Foothill-De
Anza Community College Dist. v. Emerich¿(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 29–30.)
Defendant
seeks to tax $152.50 for jury fees from the memorandum of costs, arguing that
the case never went to trial and that the cost of jury fees are therefore not
properly compensable. However, under Code of Civil Procedure section 631,
payment of a nonrefundable jury fee is required to avoid waiver of the right to
a jury trial. Posting jury fees was therefore a necessity for Plaintiff to
preserve his right to a jury trial prior to settlement. Defendant has therefore
failed to carry its burden to show that these costs were unreasonable and
unnecessary.
Defendant
seeks to tax $308.95 in costs associated with Plaintiff’s motions to compel.
Defendant argues that the motions were one-sided and unnecessary. However, the
motions were granted, which indicates that the motions and its associated costs
were reasonable and necessary. (Crandall Decl. Exs. 2-5.) Defendant argues that
once a party has properly objected to costs, the burden shifts to the party
presenting costs to show that the costs were reasonable and necessary. However,
“[i]f the items appearing in a cost bill pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5 (costs recoverable by prevailing party), appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that the costs
were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State Auto Ass’n
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 763.) Merely contending that costs were unreasonable
and unnecessary is insufficient to shift the burden to Plaintiff. Defendant has
therefore failed to carry its burden to show that these costs were unreasonable
and unnecessary.
Defendant
seeks to tax $108.00 in service of process costs and subpoenas related to
serving non-party deposition notices from the memorandum of costs. Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure § 1033.5(a)(4), service of process by a public officer,
registered process server is recoverable as costs. Defendant argues that
the non-parties deposed had their own counsel and were not associated with
Defendant, and that the work done did not advance Plaintiff’s case and
benefited only Plaintiff’s counsel. In opposition, Plaintiff contends that “the
two subpoenas that Defendant identifies as objectionable are deposition
subpoenas for the Person Most Qualified of Felix Chevrolet and Technician 4909
of Felix Chevrolet. Felix Chevrolet is the dealership where Plaintiff’s vehicle
was repaired and Technician 4909 was a technician who performed repairs on
Plaintiff’s vehicle.” (Opp. Strike Costs, p. 5.) Plaintiff argues that the
depositions were therefore reasonably incurred in connection with the
commencement and prosecution of the action. The Court finds that the costs were
reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.
Defendant
seeks to tax $482.80 for courtesy copy delivery and minute order retrieval,
arguing that courtesy copies are unnecessary, unreasonable, and excessive. Plaintiff
contends that these costs primarily arose from the lodging of sealed,
confidential documents directly with the court, as required by the parties’
protective order. Defendant has
not established that the expense of serving courtesy copies to the court is
unreasonable.
Based on the
foregoing, the court denies Defendant’s motion to tax costs and grants in part Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney’s fees as follows:
The court orders that Plaintiff Augusto
Barco-Robledo
shall recover from Defendant General Motors, LLC a total of $60,757.61,
consisting of $54,769.50 in attorney’s fees and $5,988.11 in costs and expenses,
pursuant to Civil Code § 1794, subdiv. (d). 
Plaintiff is ordered
to give notice. 
      IT IS SO ORDERED.
