And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to discovery requests, including Requests for Production, Form Interrogatories, and Requests for Admission. The Plaintiff had filed these motions on December 11, 2024, with a hearing set for January 7, 2025, just six days before the scheduled trial date. The Judge ruled that the hearing was set too close to the trial date, in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020, which requires that motions concerning discovery be heard at least 15 days before trial. The Judge also noted that the Defendant did not oppose the motions.
