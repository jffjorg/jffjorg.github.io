  None set
 



 
1.    
Background
This is a lemon law action. Plaintiff Pedro Mauricio
Mendoza (“Plaintiff”) alleges in the complaint that, on January 30, 2021,
Plaintiff purchased a 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 with Vehicle Identification
Number 3GCPWCET1LG439113 (the “Vehicle”), manufactured and/or distributed by
defendant General Motors LLC (“Defendant”). The complaint alleges that the
Vehicle contained or developed defects after Plaintiff took possession of the
Vehicle. The parties settled the matter on April 17, 2024.
2.    
Discussion
          On September
5, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to tax costs, contending that $917.85
out of the $1,542.74 requested in costs are not properly compensable and should
be struck from the memorandum of costs. Defendant argues that costs of $167.29
for jury fees, $61.65 in filing costs and $623.91 in “[o]ther…: Network
Deposition Services Court Reporter” costs, and $65.00 in “Notice of Name
Extension” are inappropriate.
          On December
23, 2024, Plaintiff opposed the motion, contending that the requested costs and
expenses are reasonable and properly compensable and that Defendant failed to
meet its burden to show that the requests costs and expenses were not reasonable
or necessary. Plaintiff additionally filed a declaration containing invoices
supporting the challenged costs and requested attorney’s fees in connection
with the instant motion.
“In ruling upon a motion to tax costs, the trial
court's first determination is whether the statute expressly allows the
particular item and whether it appears proper on its face. ‘If so, the burden
is on the objecting party to show [the costs] to be unnecessary or
unreasonable.’ [Citation]. Where costs are not expressly allowed by the
statute, the burden is on the party claiming the costs to show that the charges
were reasonable and necessary. [Citation].” (Foothill-De Anza Community
College Dist. v. Emerich¿(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 29–30.)
Defendant seeks to tax
$167.29 for jury fees from the memorandum of costs, arguing that the case never
went to trial and that the cost of jury fees are therefore not properly
compensable. However, under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, payment of a
nonrefundable jury fee is required to avoid waiver of the right to a jury
trial. Posting jury fees was therefore a necessity for Plaintiff to preserve
their right to a jury trial prior to settlement. Defendant has therefore failed
to carry their burden to show that these costs were unreasonable and
unnecessary.
 
Defendant
seeks to tax $61.65 in court filing fees and $623.91 in deposition court
reporter costs associated with Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses
to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. Defendant argues that the
motion practice was one-sided and unnecessary and was denied in part. However, the
court’s minute order filed on August 27, 2024 indicates that the motion was
granted as to all but one request and granted but narrowed as to the final
request, which indicates that the motion and its associated costs were
reasonable and necessary. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5,
subdivision (a)(3), transcribing necessary depositions is allowable as a cost. 
Defendant
argues that once a party has properly objected to costs, the burden shifts to
the party presenting costs to show that the costs were reasonable and
necessary. However, “[i]f the items appearing in a cost bill pursuant
to Code Civ. Proc. section 1033.5 (costs recoverable by prevailing
party), appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax
costs to show that the costs were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California
State Auto Ass’n (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 763.) Merely contending that
costs were unreasonable and unnecessary is insufficient to shift the burden to
Plaintiff. Defendant has therefore failed to carry their burden to show that
these costs were unreasonable and unnecessary.
Defendant
seeks to tax $65 in “Notice of Name Extension” costs, arguing that these are
considered business overhead costs and are unrelated to the present case, and
are therefore not properly compensable. However, these are court filing fees,
as indicated by the invoices that Plaintiff attached to the memorandum of
costs, and under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(1),
court filing fees are properly compensable as costs. Plaintiff also argues that
these costs were associated with Plaintiff’s previous motion to compel further
responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One. Defendant does not
address this argument. Defendant has therefore failed to carry their burden to
show that these costs were unreasonable and unnecessary.
Plaintiff
requests attorney’s fees necessary to respond to the instant motion in the
amount of $1,701, based on attorney Lara Rogers’ hourly rate of $415 and
attorney Carey Wood’s hourly rate of $525. Plaintiff is the prevailing party in
this Song-Beverly Act action and is therefore entitled to recover attorney’s
fees reasonably incurred in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
the action. (Civ. Code § 1794(d).) Plaintiff bases this request upon the 2.4
hours spent drafting the opposition to the instant motion and an expected $700
incurred to review Defendant’s reply and attend the hearing. Plaintiff provides
billing records showing that 2.3 hours were spent by Ms. Rogers and 0.1 hours
were spent by Mr. Wood. The court finds this amount unreasonable and reduces
the hours spent by Ms. Rogers by 0.4, totaling 1.9 hours spent by Ms. Rogers
and 0.1 hours spent by Mr. Wood and a subtotal of $841. It is unclear how
Plaintiff arrived at the expected $700 incurred to review Defendant’s reply and
attend the hearing. The court will therefore award 1 hour for these tasks at $415
per hour for a total of $1,256.00.
3.    
Conclusion

Based on the
foregoing, the court DENIES Defendant’s motion to tax costs. The court GRANTS
Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees in the amount of $1,256.00.

Defendant is ordered to give notice.
