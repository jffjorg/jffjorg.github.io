DATE:

TIME:

THIRD
  AMENDED COMPLAINT FILED: 03/12/2021
TRIAL:
  01/13/2025
 



 
This is a discrimination, harassment, and retaliation
action. Plaintiff Kareemah Mateen-Bradford (“Plaintiff”) alleges that defendant
City of Compton (“Defendant”) placed Plaintiff on involuntary administrative
leave in retaliation for a lawsuit that Plaintiff filed against Defendant on
August 6, 2012. 
The Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) alleges causes of
action for retaliation in violation of FEHA; discrimination in violation of
FEHA; failure to engage in a good faith interactive process; failure to
accommodate; harassment in violation of FEHA; failure to prevent
discrimination, harassment, or retaliation; and whistleblower retaliation.
Plaintiff has filed motions to compel Defendant to provide
further responses to written discovery, including Requests for Production (Set
Two), Requests for Admissions (Set Three) and Form Interrogatories (Set Four).  Plaintiff requested monetary sanctions in
connection with each motion.  Defendant
did not oppose the motions.  
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020,
subdivision (a), any party shall be entitled as a matter of right to have
motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day before
the trial for the action.  Here, Plaintiff
filed the instant motions on December 11, 2024, with a hearing set for January
7, 2025, the day after the scheduled Final Status Conference. Trial in this
action is set for January 13, 2025. As January 7, 2025 is only six days before
trial, rather than on or before the 15th day before trial, the
hearing is set impermissibly close to trial in violation of § 2024.020.
Based on the
foregoing, the court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to
Requests for Production, Set Two. The court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to compel
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set Four. The court DENIES
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Requests for Admission, Set
Three.
 

Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
