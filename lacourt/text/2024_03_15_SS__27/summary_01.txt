Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Community College. The plaintiff, Madison Castellanos, alleges that she was injured when a door was closed on her finger by a teacher, Yenifer Galicia, at the Child Center. The defendant argues that it is not liable for the injury because the teacher was not negligent and the door was not in a dangerous condition.

The court has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment on several grounds. First, the court found that the defendant failed to meet its burden of showing that the teacher was not negligent in closing the door. Second, the court found that the plaintiff's evidence raised a triable issue of fact about whether the door was in a dangerous condition. Finally, the court found that the plaintiff's evidence raised a triable issue of fact about whether the college was liable for the injury.

The court has granted the defendant's motion for summary adjudication on issues 4 and 5, which relate to the creation and maintenance of the door. The court found that the plaintiff failed to introduce any evidence demonstrating that the defendant or its employees created or negligently maintained the door that resulted in a physical feature of the property, like the door, to create a risk of harm.

The court has scheduled a hearing on the motion for summary judgment for March 15, 2024. Any party intending to submit to the tentative ruling must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
