And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Gilbert Perez. The motion was unopposed and was filed on the grounds of an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which rendered it unreasonably difficult for Perez to continue representing the plaintiff. The Court finds that a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is a proper ground for allowing an attorney to withdraw. The next hearing is a Final Status Conference set for January 23, 2025, which should provide sufficient time for the plaintiff to retain new counsel or be prepared to represent themselves.
