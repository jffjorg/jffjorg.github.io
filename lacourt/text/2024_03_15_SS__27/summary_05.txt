And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of JENSY ANGEL MOLINA vs MICHELLE MINON FRANCIS, et al. (Case No. 22STCV27978). The plaintiff's counsel, Daniel Sharpe, has moved to be relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and/or communication, which has made it impossible for him to continue representing the plaintiff. The motion is unopposed.

The judge has discretion to allow the attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court finds that a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw.

However, the judge notes that the requisite forms (MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053) have not been filed and properly served, and therefore the motion is denied without prejudice. The parties are advised to submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument on the hearing date.
