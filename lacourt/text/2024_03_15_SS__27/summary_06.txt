And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of JENSY ANGEL MOLINA vs MICHELLE MINON FRANCIS, et al. regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel by Plaintiff's Counsel, Daniel Sharpe. The motion is based on an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which makes it impossible for the counsel to continue representing the plaintiff. The judge has discretion to allow the attorney to withdraw, and in this case, the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, the judge has denied the motion because the required forms (MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053) have not been filed and properly served. The judge has given the parties the opportunity to submit to this tentative ruling by email or to appear remotely or in person at the hearing on March 15, 2024.
