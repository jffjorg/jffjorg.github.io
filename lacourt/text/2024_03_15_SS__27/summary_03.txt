And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to continue the trial. The case was filed on July 20, 2020, and the defendant's answers were filed in 2022. The trial was originally set for May 14, 2024, but the defendant requested a continuance after discovering new information about the plaintiff's third surgery and claim of a meniscus tear. The defendant argues that additional time is needed for discovery and to obtain an Independent Medical Examination (IME). The Court finds good cause and grants the motion to continue the trial to August 12, 2024. The parties are notified that if they intend to submit to this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court by the specified deadline.
