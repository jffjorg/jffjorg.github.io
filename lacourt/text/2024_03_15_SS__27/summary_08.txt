Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Marian Thompson, filed a complaint on September 12, 2022, and later discovered that the jury fees were not paid, resulting in a waiver of their right to a jury trial. The plaintiff moves the court to request relief from this waiver. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to pay the jury fees was an unintentional mistake and that the other parties would not be prejudiced by a jury trial. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motion and allows them to elect a jury trial.
