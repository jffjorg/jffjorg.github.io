And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to substitute successor in interest without prejudice. The plaintiff, TOMAS JESUS MARTINEZ, died on July 7, 2023, and the decedent's personal representative and executor, DOMITILA MARTINEZ, is seeking to continue the decedent's pending slip and fall case against TARGET CORPORATION. However, the plaintiff failed to comply with California Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32, which requires a declaration providing specific information for the continuation of an action after a decedent's death. The plaintiff also failed to provide a legible copy of the decedent's death certificate. As a result, the motion is denied, and the parties are advised to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
