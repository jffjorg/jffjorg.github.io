And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel supplemental interrogatories responses and the motion to compel deposition. The judge denied the defendant's motion to compel discovery responses, finding that the plaintiff had provided responses before the hearing date. The judge granted the plaintiff's motion to compel deposition in part, ordering the parties to further meet and confer and schedule a PMQ deposition within 30 days.

The judge also awarded sanctions to the defendant in the amount of $500, finding that the plaintiff's failure to serve timely initial discovery responses necessitated the filing of a motion.

The judge ordered the parties to continue their meet and confer efforts regarding the deposition and documents related thereto, and scheduled a hearing on May 1, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. The judge noted that if all parties submit to the tentative ruling, they may avoid appearing in person or remotely at the hearing.
