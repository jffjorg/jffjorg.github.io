[1] Defendant raised a number of objections
to Plaintiff’s evidence in opposition to the motion.  Objections 1 through 15 are to evidence the Court
did not rely upon in making its decision and, thus, the Court does not now
address those objections.  Objections 16
through 22 relate to the validity of Plaintiff’s declaration because it was not
signed.  As noted, the Court finds Defendant
has not meet its burden to make a prima facie showing regarding negligence.  The Court will hear argument on these
objections if Defendant maintains the objections despite that finding.
