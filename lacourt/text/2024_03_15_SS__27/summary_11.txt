And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial. The case was filed in July 2020, but the defendant did not file its answers until 2022. The trial was previously set for May 14, 2024. The defendant requested a continuance, citing that it had recently discovered the plaintiff's third surgery and claim of a meniscus tear. The defendant needs additional time to conduct discovery on this new information and obtain an Independent Medical Examination (IME). Since no opposition was filed, the court finds good cause to grant the continuance. The new trial date is set for August 12, 2024, and all pre-trial/discovery dates are continued accordingly.
