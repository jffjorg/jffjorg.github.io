Ruling:                     MOTION TO COMPEL IS CONTINUED
¿ 
 
Plaintiff filed the present motion
to compel Defendant’s responses to Plaintiff's Special Interrogatories, Set
One; Form Interrogatories, Set One; Request for Production of Documents, Set
One. On January 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Ex Parte Application to Continue
Trial and Related Dates, which was granted in part and denied in part. The
Court issued an order continuing the trial date from March 15, 2024, to
September 16, 2024. However, pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure, the Court
did not move pre-trial deadlines.  No
stipulation has been filed moving those deadlines.  A motion to extend the discovery cutoff was filed
but with a hearing set for May 6, 2024. Thus, the present motion is continued
to May 6, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. to be heard at the same time as the Court decides
on Plaintiff's motion to extend the discovery cutoff.
