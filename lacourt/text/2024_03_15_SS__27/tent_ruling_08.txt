Background
 
On September 12, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the auto accident case. Plaintiff filed a notice of posting
jury fees on January 4, 2023, but jury fees weren’t posted. On January 24,
2024, Plaintiff's counsel, Timothy D. McGonigle, first became aware that the
jury fees had inadvertently not been posted. Plaintiff now moves the court to
request relief from waiver of jury trial.
 
Legal Standard
 
“The
right to a trial by jury as declared by Section 16 of Article I of the
California Constitution shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 631(a).)  “In civil cases, a jury may only be waived
pursuant to subdivision (f).”  (Id.)  CCP section 631(f)
provides that a party waives trial by jury by (1) failing to appear at the
trial; (2) written consent filed with the clerk or judge; (3) oral consent, in
open court, entered in the minutes; (4) failing to announce that a jury is
required, at the time the cause is first set for trial, if it is set upon
notice of stipulation, or within five days after notice of setting if it is set
without notice or stipulation; (5) failing to timely pay the fee described in
subdivision (b), unless another party on the same side of the case has paid
that fee; or (6) failing to deposit with the clerk or judge, at the beginning
of the second and each succeeding day’s session, the sum provided in
subdivision (e).  (Id., § 631(f).)   
 
“The
court may, in its discretion upon just terms, allow a trial by jury although
there may have been a waiver of a trial by jury.”  (Id., §
631(g).)  “The trial court should grant a motion for relief of a jury
waiver ‘unless, and except, where granting such a motion would work serious
hardship to the objecting party.’”  (Mackovska v. Viewcrest Road
Properties LLC (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 1, 10 (quoting Boal v. Price
Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806, 809).)  “When there is
doubt about whether to grant relief from a jury trial waiver, the court must
resolve that doubt in favor of the party seeking a jury trial.”  (Id.) 
 
“In
a motion for relief from waiver of a jury trial, the crucial question is
whether the party opposing relief will suffer any prejudice if the court grants
relief.”  (Mackovska, supra, 40 Cal.App.5th at 10.)  “‘‘The
prejudice which must be shown from granting relief from the waiver is prejudice
from the granting of relief and not prejudice from the jury trial.’’”  (Id.
(quoting Massie v. AAR Western Skyways, Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 405,
411).)  “‘The mere fact that trial will be by jury is not prejudice per
se.’”  (Id. (quoting Johnson-Stovall v. Superior Court
(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 808, 811).)  “Denying relief where the party
opposing the motion for relief has not shown prejudice is an abuse of
discretion.”  (Id.) 
 
Analysis and Conclusion
 
The complaint was filed on September 12, 2022. Jury
fees must be paid no later than 365 calendar days after the filing of the
complaint, meaning that the jury fee must be paid by September 12, 2023. (Code
of Civil Procedure, section 631(c)(2).) Plaintiff believed they had paid the
jury fee in January 2023, but later discovered the fees were not paid, thus
waiving their right to a jury trial under CCP section 631(f)(5). No opposition
was filed and other parties do not contend that they would be prejudiced by the
election of a jury trial. Further, in the Court’s view, imposing a trial waiver
on the facts here is too punitive.  Therefore,
the motion is GRANTED.
