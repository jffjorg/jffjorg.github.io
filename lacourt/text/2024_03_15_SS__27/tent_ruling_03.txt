Ruling:                     MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS
GRANTED.
 
The case was
filed on July 20, 2020. However, Defendants’ answers were both filed in 2022.
Trial is currently set for May 14, 2024. A continuance was requested, and
granted, on September 21, 2023. On September 27, 2023, Defendant discovered
Plaintiff's third surgery and claim of a meniscus tear. Defendant argues that
it constitutes significant, unanticipated changes in the status of the case.
Defendant requests additional time to conduct discovery on the third surgery
and obtain an Independent Medical Examination (IME). No opposition was filed
and therefore other parties do not claim prejudice. Accordingly, Defendants
request that the Court continue the trial in this matter to August 12, 2024,
and continue pre-trial/discovery dates consistent with the new trial date. The
Court finds good cause and thus the present motion is GRANTED. 
 
The new trial date is set for August ____, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. and all pretrial dates are continued in
accordance with the new trial date.¿ The Final Status Conference is continued to August __, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.¿
