MOTION
 
This case arises from a dispute concerning an investment in a real
estate development in Dallas, Texas known as the “Centrum Tower.”  
 
On November 1, 2023, Plaintiff Robert Tantular (“Plaintiff”) filed
suit against Defendants First Foundation Bank as administrator of the Estate of
Andrew H. Tan (“Defendant”); Stephanie Karina as administratrix of the Estate
of Tan Ho Yung; VS Centrum, LLC; Burnaby Partners LLC; Fine Capital LLC; and
Princeton Partners LLC, alleging six causes of action for (1) fraud and deceit;
(2) conversion; (3) breach of fiduciary duty; (4) imposition of a constructive
trust; (5) accounting; and (6) quiet title. 
The sixth cause of action for quiet title has been voluntarily
dismissed. 
 
Defendant now moves to stay this action pending the resolution of a
related action Plaintiff filed in Singapore. 
The motion is unopposed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
The court has inherent power to stay proceedings in the interests of
justice and to promote judicial efficiency. (Freiberg v. City of Mission
Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.)  Trial judges have inherent powers to manage
and fashion procedures to control litigation to ensure the orderly
administration of justice. (Cottle v. Superior Court (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th
1367, 1376-79.)
 
Further, “If a party establishes that an appeal from a foreign-country
judgment is pending or will be taken in the foreign country, the court may stay
any proceedings with regard to the foreign-country judgment until the appeal is
concluded, the time for appeal expires, or the appellant has had sufficient
time to prosecute the appeal and has failed to do so.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1720.)
 
Here, in 2020, Plaintiff filed a substantially similar lawsuit against
the decedent, Andrew Tan, in Singapore, also arising from his investment in the
Centrum Tower.  Plaintiff was
unsuccessful in that action, but has now filed an appeal.  (Loh Decl. ¶¶ 2-10 and Exs. A-E
thereto.)  
 
Therefore, the Court finds that the interests of justice and judicial
efficiency warrant staying this action pending the resolution of the Singapore
case appeal. 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Therefore, the Court grants Defendant’s
unopposed motion to stay the action pending the completion of the Singapore
appeal.
 
            Further, based upon the stay of the
action, the Court vacates the Case Management Conference set on February 27,
2025, and sets a Status Conference re Appeal of Singapore Judgment on June 24,
2025 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.  All
parties shall file a Joint Status Report (limited to 5 pages excluding
attachments) no later than 5 court days before the scheduled status
conference.  The parties shall inform the
Court about the status, and the timeline for the completion, of the
appeal.  At the status conference, the
Court may determine whether the stay of the action should be vacated.   
 
            Defendant shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service.
