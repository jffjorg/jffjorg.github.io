And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering a request for a default judgment against the defendants, Jacob Chait and I.M. Chait Gallery/Auctioneers, Inc. The plaintiff, Barbara Byrnes, is seeking a default judgment in the amount of $218,168.53, which includes special damages, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys' fees.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to support the requested amount of special damages, which is $181,155.72. The judge also finds that the plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest in the amount of $32,706.17.

However, the judge determines that the plaintiff is not entitled to punitive damages, as the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence of the defendants' financial condition. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's request for a statement of damages under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11 is insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.

The judge grants the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees in the amount of $3,701.56 and costs in the amount of $605.08. The judge denies the plaintiff's request for punitive damages and grants the plaintiff's request for default judgment, less the claim for punitive damages.
