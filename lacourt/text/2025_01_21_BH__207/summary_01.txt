```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to stay the action pending the resolution of the appeal in the Singapore court. The plaintiff had filed a similar lawsuit in Singapore, which was unsuccessful, and has now filed an appeal. The judge has determined that staying the action is in the interests of justice and judicial efficiency, as it will allow the plaintiff's appeal in Singapore to be resolved before proceeding with the case in California. The judge has also vacated the Case Management Conference set for February 27, 2025, and set a Status Conference for June 24, 2025, to review the status of the appeal.
