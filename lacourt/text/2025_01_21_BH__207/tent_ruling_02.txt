MATTER


Request for Default Judgment



 
Plaintiff Barbara Byrnes on behalf
of Byrnes Children and Family Trusts (“Plaintiff”) requests for default
judgment against Defendants Jacob Chait and I.M. Chait
Gallery/Auctioneers, Inc. (“Defendants”) in the amount of $218,168.53, which is
composed of special damages in the amount of $181,155.72; prejudgment interest
in the amount of $32,706.17; costs in the amount of $605.08; and attorneys’
fees in the amount of $3,701.56.
 
            a.         Damages 
 
            Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges seven causes of action for
(1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of Implied Contract; (3) Negligence; (4)
Breach of Fiduciary Duty; (5) Fraud; (6) Violation of Civil Code section
1812.600 et seq.; and (7) violation of Business & Professions Code
section 17200 et seq.  
 
            Defendants were personally served with a copy of the
summons and complaint on March 5, 2024. Default was entered against Defendants
on April 15, 2024, and the Doe defendants were dismissed on June 4, 2024. 
 
            Plaintiff’s Complaint seeks $182,609.80
in damages. (See Compl.)  Therefore, Plaintiff
does not seek damages in excess of what is pled in the Complaint. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is
no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v.
Smith (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1131,
1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is
limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            In
support, Plaintiff provides the Declaration of Barbara Byrnes, attached to
which is an unsigned copy of the consignment agreement between Plaintiff and
Defendants, along with a representation that a signed copy was never returned
to Plaintiff, but that on or about May 20, 2022, after obtaining Plaintiff’s
signature, Defendants removed 243 items from Plaintiff’s parent’s home to be
sold for auction on consignment.  (Byrnes
Decl. ¶¶ 2-12 and Ex. 1.)
 
            Plaintiff
further declares that the proceeds from the sale of Plaintiff’s property total
$244,671.15, and the amount owed to Plaintiff, after the commission is
subtracted, totals $181,155.72.  (Byrnes
Decl. ¶¶ 31-32 and Ex. 9.)  Yet,
Defendants have not paid Plaintiff. 
(Byrnes Decl. ¶ 35.)
 
            Thus,
Plaintiff has provided evidence demonstrating her entitlement to the requested
$181,155.72 in damages.
 
b.         Punitive Damages
 
            Although not yet part of Plaintiff’s
formal default judgment request, in or about December 2024, Plaintiff served a Statement
of Damages showing punitive damages in the amount of $543,467.16 to the
individual defendant via publication and the entity via the California
Secretary of State.  
            
            “[D]ue process requires notice to
defendants, whether they default by inaction or by wilful obstruction, of the
potential consequences of a refusal to pursue their defense. Such notice
enables a defendant to exercise his right to choose—at any point before trial,
even after discovery has begun—between (1) giving up his right to defend in
exchange for the certainty that he cannot be held liable for more than a known
amount, and (2) exercising his right to defend at the cost of exposing himself
to greater liability. To this end, . . . , ‘The rules governing default
judgment provide the safeguards which ensure that defendant's choice is a fair
and informed one.’” (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 829.)
 
            To
that end, Code of Civil Procedure section 425.11 provides in pertinent part:
“When a complaint is filed in an action to recover damages for personal injury
or wrongful death, the defendant may at any time request a statement setting
forth the nature and amount of damages being sought. The request shall be
served upon the plaintiff, who shall serve a responsive statement as to the
damages within 15 days. In the event that a response is not served, the
defendant, on notice to the plaintiff, may petition the court in which the
action is pending to order the plaintiff to serve a responsive statement. If no
request is made for the statement referred to in subdivision (b), the plaintiff
shall serve the statement on the defendant before a default may be taken.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11, subds. (b)-(c), emphasis added.)
 
            And
“a plaintiff's . . . failure to give formal notice of the amount of money
damages it seeks constitutes a critical defect in the proceedings. The clerk or
judge has no authority to enter a default unless and until formal notice is
given. And failure to give formal notice may deprive a
defendant of due process. For these
reasons, a default entered without formal notice of the amount or other relief
or amount sought is invalid.” (Schwab v. Southern California Gas Co.
(2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1324-1325, citations omitted.) But “by its terms
section 425.11 requires that a plaintiff personally serve on defendant a
statement setting forth the nature and amount of damages being sought; it does
not require the statement to be filed with the court.” (Scognamillo v.
Herrick (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1147, disapproved of on other grounds
by Lewis v. Ukran (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 886.)
 
            Here, as a threshold matter, a Statement of Damages pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
425.11 may satisfy the due process requirements to put a defendant on notice of
the amount at issue before a default is taken in personal injury and wrongful
death cases only.  (See Sporn v. Home
Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1302 and Cal. Judges Benchbook,
Civ. Proc. Before Trial § 16.16, p. 1924 [noting].)  Because this case is not a personal injury or
wrongful death case, service of a statement of damages will not cure the due
process issue.
 
Equally
important, in determining how much
to award in punitive damages, Plaintiff needs to provide evidence of Defendants’
financial condition. (Adams v. Murakami (1991) 54 Cal.3d 105, 119.)
“[T]he purpose of punitive damages is not served by financially destroying a
defendant. The purpose is to deter, not to destroy.” (Id. at p. 112.)
“[A] punitive damages award is excessive if it is disproportionate to the
defendant’s ability to pay.” (Ibid., citations omitted.) For this
reason, the United States Supreme Court has explained that there are
constitutional limitations on punitive damages awards. (State Farm Mut.
Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell (2003) 538 U.S. 408, 416.) “It has been
recognized that punitive damages awards generally are not permitted to exceed
10 percent of the defendant’s net worth.” (Weeks v. Baker &McKenzie
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1166.) 
Plaintiff has advanced any evidence of Defendants net worth.  
 
Therefore, the Court finds that awarding
punitive damages (which are not yet formally part of Plaintiff’s default
judgment request in any event) is improper.
 
c.         Pre-Judgment Interest 
 
            The interest computation for the $32,706.17
requested is stated as follows:  
 
·       $181,155.72 principal
balance * 10% contractual interest rate ÷ 365 days/year = $49.63 daily interest
for the 659 days from August 10, 2022 to May 30, 2024.  
 
            Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to the
requested pre-judgment interest.

 
            d.         Attorneys’ Fees and Costs 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs
to a prevailing party under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the
recovery of attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021 provides “[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are specifically provided
for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and
counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties
[….]”  Similarly, Civil Code section 1717
provides “[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically
provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that
contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing
party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the
contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,
shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other
costs.”  (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
The Code of Civil Procedure defines
the “prevailing party” as follows: 
 
[T]he party with a net monetary
recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. If any
party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as
specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as determined by the court, and
under those circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not
and, if allowed, may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse
sides pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)  Section 14.8 of the agreement provides:
 
Attorney’s Fees: Should any party
institute any action or proceeding in court, including in any bankruptcy
proceeding, to enforce or seek an interpretation of any provision hereof or for
damages by reason of an alleged breach of any provision of this Agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing party such amount
as the court may adjudge to be reasonable attorneys' fees for services
rendered. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover the above
attorneys' fees even if the losing party or parties should become the subject
of an order for relief under Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or
any successor statute or any other applicable statute.       
 
(Ex. 1 to Byrnes Decl.)
 
            Local Rule
3.214 provides that reasonable attorneys’ fees in a contract case for amounts
over $100,000 are $2,890 plus 1% of the excess over $100,000.  Here, that amount is $3,701.56, the amount
Plaintiff requested.  Therefore,
Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees is granted.
 
            Plaintiff also requests $605.08 in costs composed of $437.25 in filing fees, $42.40 in process server fees, and $125.43
in FedEx mailings. (CIV-100.) Plaintiff’s request for costs is granted as
Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032,
subd. (a)(4).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment is granted, less the claim for punitive damages.
