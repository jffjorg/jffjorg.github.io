And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants, Real Time Staffing Services, LLC, et al. The plaintiff, Emilia Sanchez, was employed by the defendants from June 18, 2021, to February 10, 2022, and alleges wrongful termination following an on-the-job injury. The defendants moved to compel arbitration on the complaint filed by the plaintiff, arguing that the plaintiff executed an agreement to submit to binding arbitration and that the dispute is covered by the agreement. The court found that the defendants met their burden of proving the existence of the arbitration agreement and that the dispute is covered by the agreement. The court also found that the plaintiff did not present any grounds for denying the motion to compel arbitration. The court granted the motion to compel arbitration and stayed the action pending arbitration. The parties are to select an individual arbitrator to hear the dispute.
