Contract; 2) Fraud; 3) Conversion; 4) Breach Of Fiduciary Duty; 5) Constructive
Trust; 6) Unjust Enrichment; and 7) Accounting. 
 
RULING
Demurrer:
Sustained with Leave to Amend.
Defendants
Jin Soo Park and Elaine Kim submit a demurrer to the entire complaint for 1)
Breach Of Contract; 2) Fraud; 3) Conversion; 4) Breach Of Fiduciary Duty; 5)
Constructive Trust; 6) Unjust Enrichment; and 7) Accounting. The court
electronic filing system shows no opposition or reply on file at the time of
the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see
also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a
pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules,
where the complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently
apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for
uncertainty should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.] 
 
The court finds
the unopposed challenges to the complaint support the basis of the demurrer,
and therefore sustains the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend. Plaintiff may
NOT add any new causes of action. (Harris v. Wachovia Mortgage,
FSB (2010)
185 Cal.App.4th 1018, 1023.) Any such actions will be subject to a motion to
strike. 
 
The motion to strike is MOOT.
 
The court will concurrently conduct the OSC re: Sanctions,
et al.
 
Defendants to give notice.
