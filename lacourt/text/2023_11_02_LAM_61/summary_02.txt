And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Gergis Ghobrial, M.D.'s motion to compel further responses to requests for production from Defendant Lynette A. Scherer, M.D. The requests seek documents related to Plaintiff's termination and the management of the trauma center. Defendant's responses contained objections and incomplete statements of compliance, which are deemed insufficient. The Judge finds that the requests are supported by good cause and that Defendant has failed to justify their objections. As a result, the Judge orders Defendant to provide further responses to the requests for production.

Additionally, the Judge awards sanctions against Defendant and their counsel in the amount of $320, which represents a document editing service fee and a filing fee.
