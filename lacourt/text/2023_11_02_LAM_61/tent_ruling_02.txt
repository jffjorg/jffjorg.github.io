I.                  
MOTION TO
COMPEL FURTHER – PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
 
“A party may demand
that any other party produce . . . a document that is in the possession,
custody, or control of the party on whom the demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.010(b).) The demanding party may move for an order compelling further
response to the demand if the demanding party deems that (1) a statement of
compliance with the demand is incomplete, (2) a representation of inability to
comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or (3) an objection in the
response is without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(a).) “The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand,” and “[t]he motion shall be accompanied by a
meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(b).) 
 
A motion to compel
a further response to an inspection demand must set forth specific facts
showing “good cause” justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1); Kirkland
v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) Unless there is a
legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney work product, that burden is
met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance. (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th
443, 444.) Once the moving party demonstrates good cause for the discovery, the
burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully
respond to the inspection demand.  (Coy v Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d
210, 220.) 
 
Plaintiff Gergis
Ghobrial (Plaintiff) moves to compel further responses to Requests for
Production No. 1–67 from Defendant Lynette Scherer (Defendant). These requests
sought documents related to Plaintiff’s termination and the management of the
trauma center of which Plaintiff was a part.
 
Defendant’s
responses to these requests were of two types. Although all responses contained
objections, most responses contained purported statements of compliance, which
state as follows:
 
Subject to and
without waiving its objections, and to the extent responsive, this party refers
Plaintiff to code compliant documents produced in good faith including, without
limitation, Bates No. ACSMG00001-ACSMG0000247 and KOH 000001-000027. To the extent
any additional responsive, discoverable, non-privileged documents exist that
this responding party understands is responsive to this request, this
responding party will comply, in whole or in part, and, under the terms of an
appropriate and comprehensive protective order.
 
(Seprate Statement.) Only the
responses to Requests No. No. 32, 43, 45–51, 53, 54, 59, and 63 were limited to
objections.
Here, the requests at issue are
supported by good cause. The requests relate to Plaintiff’s termination and the
policies and management of the trauma center. Plaintiff’s claim is for wrongful
termination based on retaliation for patient safety complaints made regarding
the trauma center. This being the case, it becomes Defendant’s burden to
justify any objections offered in lieu of response. (See Coy, supra,
58 Cal.2d at p. 220.) Defendant has filed no opposition justifying the
objections, and further responses are therefore required.
The remaining responses are
likewise deficient. A response to a request for production may contain a
statement of compliance, inability to comply, or objections. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.210, subd. (a)(1)–(3).) Defendant here responded with an indeterminate
statement that it would in the future comply in whole or in part, which is of
little value to the propounding party. (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.220,
2031.230 [statutes governing statements of compliance and inability to
comply].)
The motion to compel further is
therefore GRANTED.
II.    SANCTIONS
 
Statute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon
a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response
to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for
admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
 
Plaintiff seeks $320 in sanctions, representing $260 for a
document editing service and a $60 filing fee. (Ghobrial Decl. ¶ 8.) Sanctions
are awarded against Defendant and her counsel in the amount of $320.
