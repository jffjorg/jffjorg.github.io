And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Jens Frederick Larsen's motion for summary judgment, which sought to resolve his claims for medical negligence and dependent adult abuse. The judge found that Plaintiff's motion was flawed because he failed to authenticate the medical records upon which his expert declarations rely. Under California law, hospital and medical records can be admitted as evidence if they are properly authenticated. Since Plaintiff did not provide proper authentication of the medical records, his expert declarations are without an authenticated evidentiary basis. As a result, the motion for summary judgment is denied, and Defendant Tender Home Health is required to provide notice.
