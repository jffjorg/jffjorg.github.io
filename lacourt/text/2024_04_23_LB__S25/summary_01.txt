And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a case involving a plaintiff who was allegedly assaulted and battered by a defendant employee. The plaintiff claims that the defendant employee punched him multiple times while acting within the scope of his employment as a car wash service. The court has overruled the defendant's demurrer to the first cause of action (assault and battery) and has ruled that the plaintiff has stated a cause of action. The court has also sustained the defendant's demurrer to the second cause of action (negligence) with leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient facts to establish the existence of a legal duty. The court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike, finding that the motion is moot in light of its ruling on the negligence claim.
