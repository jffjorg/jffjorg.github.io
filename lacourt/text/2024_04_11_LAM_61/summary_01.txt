And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The defendants, Los Angeles Unified School District and Harold Boger, moved for summary judgment or adjudication on the plaintiff's claims of sexual harassment and negligence. The plaintiff, Rashad Brooks, alleged that he was sexually harassed by Simone Young, a substitute teacher, at Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies (LACES) during the 2016-2017 school year. The defendants argued that they did not have knowledge of Young's relationship with the plaintiff or any complaints or notices regarding the same.

The court denied the defendants' motion, finding that there were triable issues of fact as to whether the defendants breached their duty of care to the plaintiff. The court also found that the defendants failed to provide adequate supervision and training to prevent the harm.

The court noted that the defendants' argument that they did not have knowledge of Young's relationship with the plaintiff or any complaints or notices regarding the same was not persuasive, as the plaintiff presented evidence that he and Young had a romantic relationship, which included kissing and hugging in public areas of the school.

The court also noted that the defendants' argument that they did not have a duty to supervise the plaintiff and Young, as they were not in a supervisory position, was not persuasive, as the plaintiff and Young had a relationship that involved romantic contact in public areas of the school.
