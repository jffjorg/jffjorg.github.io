And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for leave to file an amended cross-complaint. The defendants and cross-complainants, Faryan and Leila Afifi, seek to add a new claim for an equitable easement related to their access to a strip of land needed for their pool equipment. However, the motion has been unreasonably delayed, and the court finds that the Afifis could have discovered the issue earlier. The court also notes that the case has been ongoing for several years, with discovery closed for over a year, and trial is set for July 2024. The court finds that permitting the amendment at this stage would require yet another delay of an already-delayed trial.
