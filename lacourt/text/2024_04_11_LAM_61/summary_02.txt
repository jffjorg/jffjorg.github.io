And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Plaintiff Paula Bawden's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. The Plaintiff seeks to add allegations related to her departure from her position in July 2023 and to add a cause of action for failure to pay all wages due at discharge. The Defendant opposes the motion, citing delay and potential prejudice from the amendment. The court finds that no prejudice has been shown, and the delay is not prejudicial. The court grants the motion, allowing the Plaintiff to file an amended complaint.
