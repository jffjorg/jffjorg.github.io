**Significant Statements**

* The court concludes that relief under section 473(d) is not warranted because the judgment is not void on its face.
* Relief under section 473(b) is untimely because the motion was filed nearly three-and-a-half years after the judgment was entered.
* Relief under section 473.5 is unavailable because Defendant Cormier admits that he had notice of the action before the default judgment was entered.
* The court is mindful that the "law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits," but under the current circumstances, that policy must give way to the "public policy in favor of finality of judgments."
