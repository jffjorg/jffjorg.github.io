  - The litigation privilege is an "absolute" privilege, and it bars all tort causes of action except a claim of malicious prosecution.
  - The court is willing to entertain a request for continuance by Kim's counsel based upon a good faith offer of proof that a declaration from Kim could establish the fact that the credit card debt was used "primarily for personal, family, or household purposes."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Special Motion to Strike the Cross-Complaint filed by the Defendant, Walter Y. Kim. The Cross-Complaint alleges that the Plaintiff, Bank of America, N.A., violated the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by recording an Involuntary Lien against Kim in the Norwalk Action.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff's conduct was protected under the anti-SLAPP statute, as it was related to a judicial proceeding. However, the Court also finds that the Plaintiff failed to establish a probability of prevailing on the claim, as it did not provide sufficient evidence that the credit card debt was used "primarily for personal, family, or household purposes" as required by the Rosenthal Act.

The Court is willing to entertain a request for continuance by Kim's counsel based upon a good faith offer of proof that a declaration from Kim could establish the fact that the credit card debt was used "primarily for personal, family, or household purposes." If such a declaration is presented, the Court may reconsider its ruling and deny the Special Motion to Strike.

The Court also notes that if no continuance is requested or granted, the Defendant may file a motion for attorney's fees and costs.
