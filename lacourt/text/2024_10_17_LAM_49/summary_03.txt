And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to quash the deposition subpoena in part and denied it in part. The subpoena is modified to include only records pertaining to individual treatment that the plaintiff received from Integrity Counseling Group. The judge finds that the plaintiff's therapy records are directly relevant to the issues raised in the lawsuit and are therefore discoverable. However, the judge finds that the marital counseling records are less relevant and may invade the privacy of the plaintiff's wife. Therefore, the judge has limited the subpoena to only those records involving the plaintiff's individual treatment. The judge has declined to award expenses to either party as the motion was not made or opposed in bad faith. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the modified subpoena.
