HEARING:

TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Jehan Zeb
Mir’s motion for reconsideration is DENIED. 
 
 
 
Background
 
On
November 13, 2002, Judge Josh M. Fredricks formally declared Jehan Zeb Mir a
vexatious litigant in Los Angeles Superior Court, case number TC015566, Mir
v. Law Office of Rushfeld, Shelley & Drake, et al.  
 
On
February 24, 2003, Justice Roger W. Boren formally declared Mir a vexatious
litigant again in Court of Appeal case B148849 Mir v. Pomona Valley Hospital
Medical Center, et al. Justice Boren’s prefiling order stated the
following: “[w]e order that henceforth Jehan Zeb Mir may not file any
litigation in the courts of this state in propria persona or through an
attorney without first obtaining leave of the presiding judge of the court in
which the litigation is proposed to be filed.” (Mir v. Pomona Valley Hosp.
Medical Center (Cal. Ct. App., Feb. 24, 2003, No. B148849) 2003 WL
403301, at *23.) Thus, Mir must obtain prefiling permission for new litigation
filed in propria persona or through an attorney. (See also Mir v.
Mercury Insurance Group (Cal. Ct. App., July 23, 2020, No. B286741)
2020 WL 4218171, at *1.
 
On June 29, 2021, Mir
filed this action, 21NWCV00424, Mir v. State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company, through counsel. On January 25, 2022, Mir filed a
substitution of attorney noting he had become a self-represented litigant.
 
On
September 13, 2022, Department 1 dismissed 21NWCV00424 Mir v. State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, et al; 21STCV03643 Mir v.
McCoy-Thompson; 21STCV27787 Mir v. Goldman, et al; and 20STCV17339 Mir
v. Surati Cash & Carry, et al for not obtaining prefiling permission
from Department 1 in violation of the expanded prefiling order entered against Mir.

 
On May 1, 2023,
Defendants filed a Motions for Sanctions for Mir’s filing of a frivolous motion
for reconsideration.
 
On
June 1, 2023, Department 1 denied Mir’s motions for reconsideration of each of
these orders. In the September 13, 2022, and June 1, 2023, orders, the Court
rejected Mir’s contentions that the expanded prefiling orders no longer
applied. Mir remains subject to the expanded prefiling orders requiring Mir to
obtain permission for all new litigation, whether in propria persona or through
an attorney. 
 
On August 3, 2023, the
Court denied the motion for sanctions in part and granted it in part. 
 
Plaintiff moves for
reconsideration of the motion for sanctions. 
 
Legal
Standard
The
moving party must present new facts, circumstances, or law to grant a motion
for reconsideration. (See Code Civ. Pro., § 1008, subd. (a); see also Mink
v. Super. Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342.) The party must state what
application was made before, what order or decisions were made, and what new or
different facts or circumstances are claimed to be shown. (Code Civ. Pro., §
1008, subd. (a).) Further, the party must satisfactorily explain why he did not
produce that evidence before. (Glade v. Glade (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th
1441, 1457.) 
Discussion
Here, Plaintiff states that the different facts are that Defendant
did not inform the Court that on June 1, 2023, Judge Court had denied the
motion for reconsideration without prejudice, which allowed Plaintiff to refile
Application to Vacate Prefiling Order. But Plaintiff does not explain why he
did not produce that evidence before. Plaintiff further states the following:
“The different facts are that both Judge Cowan and Judge Lui had conceded that
Plaintiff submitted the motion for reconsideration timely on September 2, 2022,
but was not filed by clerk and yet ordered reassignment to a different judge to
reconsider the order denying the application to vacate prefiling order. Judge
Court also acknowledged that motion was submitted but not file-stamped by
Clerk.” (Mot., pg.3.) Similarly, Plaintiff does not explain why he did not
produce this evidence before. 
 
Plaintiff also states the following: “That the Plaintiff prevailed
in the motion for (re)consideration of the Judge Court’s January 25, 2023,
Order not obeying the Order of Judge Lui, ordering reassignment to a different
judge to reconsider the Judge Cowan’s order denying application to vacate
prefiling order. That the Court in tentative ruling was based on January 26,
2023, Order of Judge Court which was adopted as final ruling at the conclusion
of the hearing on August 3, 2023.”
But Plaintiff’s statements are unclear. (Mot., pg. 2.) “Contentions are waived when a party fails to support them with
reasoned argument.”  (Moulton Niguel Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003)
111 Cal. App. 4th 1210, 1215.)
In
addition, Plaintiff states that the different law is that he is entitled to
relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d) because the
September 2, 2022 order about the motion for reconsideration was not stamped. But
Plaintiff does not state how this law relates to the motion for sanctions. Further,
Plaintiff does not explain why he did not produce this evidence before. 
Plaintiff
also states that the different circumstances are that the Court erred and
awarded sanction of $3,300 for Defendants making two motions under Code of
Civil Procedure section 128.5 and 128.7. But Plaintiff does not cite law nor
does law exist that supports his point. 
Thus,
the motion is DENIED. 
Defendant to
give notice.
