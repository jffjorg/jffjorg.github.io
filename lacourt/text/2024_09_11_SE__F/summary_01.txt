And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Jehan Zeb Mir's motion for reconsideration of the motion for sanctions. The judge found that Mir's motion did not present any new facts, circumstances, or law to support his request for reconsideration. Mir's arguments were unclear and failed to provide a reasoned argument to support his claims. The judge also found that Mir did not explain why he did not produce certain evidence before the hearing. As a result, the judge denied Mir's motion for reconsideration and confirmed the original order denying Mir's motion for sanctions. The defendant is required to give notice of the ruling.
