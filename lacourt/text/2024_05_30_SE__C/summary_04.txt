And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing scheduled for May 30, 2024, to Thursday, July 11, 2024, at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. The defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint is continued, and the parties are ordered to comply with CCP ยง435.5(a), which requires a meet and confer process before filing a motion to strike. The moving party must submit a signed declaration indicating efforts to resolve the issues raised in the motion to strike by July 1, 2024. The court finds that the moving party has not satisfied the meet and confer requirements and therefore continues the hearing to allow the parties to comply with the mandatory meet and confer process.
