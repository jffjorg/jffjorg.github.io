The judge grants the ex parte motion to advance the motion to set aside default from January 30, 2025 to May 30, 2024. The judge also denies the motion to set aside the January 26, 2023, order awarding discovery and monetary sanctions. The judge finds that the motion to set aside the order is untimely and that the plaintiff has not established mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
