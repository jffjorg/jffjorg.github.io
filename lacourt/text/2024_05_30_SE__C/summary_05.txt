And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motions to compel the defendant's responses to form interrogatories (set one) and to deem matters admitted as to the defendant. The defendant, Sandy Cervantes, failed to respond to these discovery requests, and the court has ordered the defendant to provide verified responses without objection by a certain date. The court has also granted sanctions in the amount of $2,000.00 to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff and their counsel of record.
