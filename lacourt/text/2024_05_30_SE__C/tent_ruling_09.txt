Plaintiff moves for summary judgment. 
 
“[T]he basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of
rent contained in CCP §1161(2) are: (1) the tenant is in possession of the
premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in
default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a
written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day
notice period has elapsed.”  (Kruger
v. Reyes (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 16.) 
 
The following facts are undisputed: 
·       
On or about 10/01/18, Plaintiff leased the
property to Defendant for a period of time equaling 5 years and 1 month. (SS
No. 4.) 
·       
The base rent was $35,000 per month. (Lease,
Gabbai Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. 1.) 
·       
The fixed term of the Lease ended on 10/31/23
and Defendant failed to exercise their option to extend the Lease. The Lease
became a month-to-month term at the fair market rental value. Fair market rental
value beginning on 11/01/23 was $46,000.00 rent per month plus $1,112.00 CAM
charges per month plus utilities. (SS No. 5.) 
·       
In January 2024, Defendant became delinquent in
rent paying only $10,000.00 of the $46,000.00 base rent. (SS No. 6.) 
·       
An Estimated Notice was served on 02/21/24. (SS
No. 7.) 
·       
Prior to the expiration of the 3 days notice
period of the Estimated Notice, Defendant did not pay or attempt to pay the
full amount of rent due. (SS No. 8.) 
·       
Defendant is still in possession of the
property. (SS No. 14.) 
 
The unopposed Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
