Defendant VINCENT
MICHAEL MATAMOROZ’s Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiff’s Complaint is CONTINUED to Thursday, July 11, 2024
at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
Moving Party to give
notice. 
 
The parties are ORDERED
to comply with CCP § 435.5(a).
If, after complying with CCP § 435.5(a),
court intervention is needed, the parties may appear and argue the
merits on the continued hearing date. If the parties are unable to informally
resolve the issues raised in the instant motion to strike, then the Moving
Party must submit a signed declaration indicating such efforts pursuant to CCP §435.5(a). The declaration must be
filed no later than July 1, 2024.
 
CCP §435.5(a)
requires a moving party, before filing a motion to strike, to engage in a
specified meet and confer process with the party who filed the pleading at
issue for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached as to
the filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer and/or motion to strike. 

 
The Court finds that
the Moving Party has not satisfied the meet and confer requirements outlined
above where no meet and confer declaration is attached to the Moving Papers. The
provisions of CCP §435.5(a) are mandatory; compliance is not optional. This
matter is CONTINUED as indicated above.
