And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the defendants' motion to advance the demurrer, which is currently scheduled for February 13, 2025. The defendants argue that granting the demurrer will promote judicial economy. The court notes that the defendants have not submitted evidence of notice to all parties no later than 10 a.m. the court day before the ex parte appearance, as required by California Rules of Court. The court also finds that the defendants have not shown exceptional circumstances that justify a shorter time for notice. As a result, the court advances the demurrer to May 30, 2024, and continues it to Thursday, August 15, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
