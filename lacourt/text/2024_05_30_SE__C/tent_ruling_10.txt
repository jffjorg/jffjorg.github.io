 Case Number:  VC067392    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  C Zavala
v. Frias, et al., Case No. VC067392
 
This
is a breach of contract action. Plaintiff loaned defendants $45,000.00 to make
improvements to his home located at 6402 Eglise Avenue, Pico Rivera, California
90660. Defendants promised to repay the loan upon selling the property, but
then changed their mind about selling the property. They also have not
completed improvements on the subject property. Plaintiff moves ex parte to
shorten the time to hear the motion to set aside or vacate default, currently
set for hearing on January 30, 2025.  A bench trial is scheduled for June
3, 2024.  
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).) 
 
Counsel
for Plaintiff argues that the motion is currently scheduled after the bench
trial. 
 
Based
on the above, the Court grants the ex parte motion. The Court advances the
motion to set aside or vacate default from Thursday, January 30, 2025 to
Thursday, May 30, 2024. Based on its review of the motion to set aside the
January 26, 2023, order awarding discovery and monetary sanctions, the Court
DENIES the motion to set aside. First, it is untimely because it was filed on
April 25, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473 (b).) Second, Plaintiff has not
established mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473 (b).)
