#2
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainants’ unopposed Motion for Leave to
file a First Amended Cross-Complaint is GRANTED.

 
No Opposition(s) filed as of May 24, 2024. 
 
The Proposed First Amended Cross-Complaint attached as
Exhibit A to the Declaration of Thomas E. Dias is not deemed filed and served
as of the date of this hearing. The Moving Party is ORDERED to FILE and SERVE
the First Amended Cross-Complaint by no later than 5 court days from the
Court’s issuance of this Order. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This quiet tile action was filed on May 12, 2023. On July 7,
2020, A Cross-Complaint was filed on July 31, 2023. 
 
Defendants/Cross-Complainants now seek leave to file a First
Amended Cross-Complaint that “will add allegations to further support a claim
for an equitable lien in the event title is awarded to Plaintiff by including
monies paid by the Aguirres in the purchase of the Property that paid off
existing encumbrances against title….” (Notice 1:31-24.) 
 
California recognizes “a general rule of…liberal allowance
of amendments…” (Nestle v. City of Santa Monica (1972) 6 Cal.3d 920,
939.) It has also long been recognized that “even if the proposed legal theory
is a novel one, ‘the preferable practice would be to permit the amendment and
allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment
on the pleadings or other appropriate proceedings.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.) In light of great liberality
employed when ruling on a motion for leave to amend, the court will not
normally consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading since grounds
for demurrer or motion to strike are premature. Thus, absent prejudice to the
opposing party, courts are bound to apply a policy of great liberality in
permitting amendments to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up
to and including trial.” (emphasis added.) (Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) 
 
In light of the liberality associated with granting motions
for leave to amend up to and including the time of trial, the Court finds that
Cross-Complainants should be afforded the opportunity to make the proposed
amendments. Opposing parties maintain their right to compel discovery, demur,
move to strike, or move for summary judgment. 
 
The unopposed Motion is GRANTED.
 
There is an MSC scheduled for August 21, 2024, and Trial is
set for November 14, 2024.
