INDUSTRIAL CA REIT OWNER 1 LLC  v.
OVERSEAS FOOD DISTRIBUTION, LLC 
CASE NO.:  24NWCV00144
HEARING:  05/30/24
 
#1 
 
Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion to Enter Judgment against Defendant
OVERSEAS FOOD DISTRIBUTION, LLC is GRANTED.  
 
Moving Party to give Notice. 
 
No Opposition filed as of May 28, 2024. Due by May 25, 2024.
(See 05/22/24 Order.) 
 
On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff and Defendant executed a
Stipulation for Entry of Judgment. On April 26, 2024, Plaintiff and Defendant
executed an Amended Stipulation for Entry of Judgment.
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant defaulted on its
obligations under the Amended Stipulation and argues that Plaintiff is now
entitled to entry of Judgment in its favor in accordance to the terms of the
Amended Stipulation for Entry of Judgment. 
 
“If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (emphasis
added.) (CCP. §664.6.) 
 
A Notice of Settlement was filed on 02/02/24. To date, no
dismissal has been entered. Therefore, although the Stipulation for Entry of
Judgment and Amended Stipulation for Entry of Judgment do not expressly contain
a 664.6 clause, the Court never lost jurisdiction over this case and can
properly grant relief under CCP §664.6. 
 
The Amended Stipulation for Entry of Judgment indicates that
Defendant  agreed to make installment
payments according to a detailed time-table agreed upon by the parties. (See Lawrence
Decl., ¶3, Ex. 2.) 
 
Defendant is in default of the Amended Stipulation for Entry
of Judgment. (Osborn Decl., ¶ 9.) Defendant is in undisputedly in breach of the
written settlement agreement entered into by the parties. The unopposed Motion
to Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Judgment is entered against Defendant OVERSEAS
FOOD DISTRIBUTION, LLC. The Court will sign the Proposed Order submitted by the
Moving Party on May 21, 2024.
