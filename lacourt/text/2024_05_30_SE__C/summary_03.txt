And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The defendant's motion for a protective order is denied. The plaintiff, WILLIAM LUI, is seeking to inspect the church books and records of the FIRST EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY CHURCH, which he claims he has a right to do as a member of the church. The defendant is seeking to deny the inspection and impose a blanket protective order, but has not specified which specific documents would be affected or why. The court finds that the defendant has not justified the imposition of such an order and denies the motion. The case will proceed with discovery and the parties will be notified."
