v. Ionix Construction, Inc., et al., Case No. 24NWCV00574
 
This
is a breach of contract action about construction work. Defendants Saddleback
Square, LLC and 1800 Argyle, LLC move ex parte to advance the hearing on the
demurrer. Currently, it is scheduled for February 13, 2025. 
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Defendants
argue good cause based on judicial economy. Based on the above, the Court
grants the motion. 
 
The
Court notes that Defendants have not submitted evidence that they notified all
parties no later than 10 a.m. the court day before the ex parte appearance.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1203(a).) Defendants have not shown exceptional
circumstances that justify a shorter time for notice. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1203(a).) 
 
The
Court advances the demurrer to May 30, 2024, and continues it to Thursday,
August 15, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
