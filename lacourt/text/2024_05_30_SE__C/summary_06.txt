And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the unopposed motion for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint. The Defendant/Cross-Complainants seek to add allegations to support a claim for an equitable lien in the event the title is awarded to the Plaintiff. The court follows the law of California, which allows for liberal allowance of amendments. The court finds that the Cross-Complainants should be afforded the opportunity to make the proposed amendments, despite the lack of opposition from the Plaintiff. The motion is granted with the condition that the amended cross-complaint is filed and served within 5 court days from the court's issuance of this order.
