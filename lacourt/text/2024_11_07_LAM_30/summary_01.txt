Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Uponor's motion for summary judgment against Kennco Plumbing Inc. Uponor argued that Kennco's claims were released in 2017 and 2019, but the Judge found that the releases only covered specific events and did not extend to Kennco's current claims. The Judge noted that Kennco did not know about future leaks when signing the releases and that the releases did not release Uponor from Kennco's present claims. The Judge found that Uponor had not met its burden of demonstrating a complete defense to both causes of action and therefore denied the motion for summary judgment.
