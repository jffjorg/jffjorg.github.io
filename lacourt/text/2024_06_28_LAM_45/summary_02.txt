And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action against the defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, conversion, professional negligence, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and receiving stolen property. The Court finds that the complaint is uncertain and lacks sufficient facts to state a cause of action against the defendants, particularly Side, Inc. The Court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend the complaint. The Motion to Strike is moot because the demurrer has been sustained. The Court orders the plaintiff to file a first amended complaint within 20 days of the order.
