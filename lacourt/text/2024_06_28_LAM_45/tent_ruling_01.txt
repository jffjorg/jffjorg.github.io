Background On June 29,  2021, Plaintiff Hoi Ying Eugenie Lai (“Lai”) filed a Complaint against  Defendant Irene (“Chan”) Chan for two causes of action: (1) specific performance;  and (2) constructive trust and exemplary damages for fraud in the inducement.  Plaintiff alleges that on September 3, 2019, Plaintiff entered into an oral  agreement with Defendant Chan and her son to purchase a piece of real property  in Temple City, California, via quitclaim deed. Plaintiff alleges Defendant  breached the agreement and made false promises to induce Plaintiff’s  performance. On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint  (“FAC”), maintaining the second cause of action for specific performance and  removing the cause of action for constructive trust. In addition to maintaining  the second cause of action for (2) specific performance, Plaintiff’s FAC added  the following causes of action: (1) quiet title; (3) breach of contract; (4)  breach of quasi-contract/unjust enrichment; (5) promissory estoppel; (6)  intentional misrepresentation; (7) negligent misrepresentation; and (8)  declaratory relief.  On June 7, 2023,  Defendant Chan filed her Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff Lai and added  Cross-Defendant Global West Real Estate Corporation (“Global”) for (1) breach  of fiduciary duty; (2) intentional fraud; (3) negligent misrepresentation; (4)  elder abuse; (5) financial elder abuse; (6) intentional infliction of emotional  distress; (7) negligence; and (8) unfair competition.  On November 20,  2023, Cross Defendant Global filed its cross complaint against both Plaintiff  Lai and Defendant Chan for (1) indemnity; (2) contribution; (3) declaratory  relief; (4) attorney fees; and (5) breach of independent contractor agreement.  On April 15,  2024, Defendant Chan filed the instant motion for Protective Order, along with  the Declaration of Robert C. Hsu, and Exhibits A-E.  On June 20,  2024, Plaintiff Lai filed the Opposition. On June 24,  2024, Defendant Chan filed a Reply.  On March 7,  2024, Judge Treu issued an order addressing a number of the discovery issues  that are the subject of the instant motion for protective order.  Legal  Standard Motion  for Protective Order “Before, during, or after a deposition, any party, any deponent, or  any other affected natural person or organization may promptly move for a  protective order.” (CCP § 2025.420(a).) “The court, for good cause shown, may  make any order that justice requires to protect any party, deponent, or other  natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or  oppression, or undue burden and expense.” (CCP § 2025.420(b).) This protective  order may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following  directions set forth in CCP §§ 2025.420(b)(1)-(16). “Code of Civil Procedure  section 2025.420, subdivision (b), provides a nonexclusive list of permissible  directions that may be included in a protective order.” (Nativi v. Deutsche  Bank National Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 316.)  “If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part,  the court may order that the deponent provide or permit the discovery against  which protection was sought on those terms and conditions that are just.” (CCP  § 2025.420(g).) “ ‘[T]he issuance and formulation of protective orders are to a  large extent discretionary. [Citation.]’ ” (Nativi, supra, 223  Cal.App.4th at 316.)  “The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party,  person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion for a  protective order, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2025.420(h).)  Discussion             Defendant’s Requests Defendant Chan  requests the Court issue a Protective Order, protecting Defendant Chan from  Special Interrogatory No. 17, and Requests for Production of Documents Nos. 21,  24-27, as they relate to Defendant’s confidential financial affairs.        March 7, 2024  Order  On March 7,  2024, Judge Treu already made clear that a party’s real estate business  dealings with other clients are confidential financial affairs. (March 7, 2024  Minute Order, pg. 10.) Moreover, Judge Treu reasoned that financial affairs  from another matter demonstrating a "pattern and practice" are not  relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible  evidence in this case. Evid. Code § 1101(a) bars character evidence. (Id.  at pg. 12.) In light of the Honorable Rolf M. Treu’s ruling on March 7, 2024,  Plaintiff and Defendant are ordered to review and comply with the  determinations and orders contained therein.  Additionally,  any issues pertaining to Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23STCV17632 (Ho  v. Lai) are deemed irrelevant and, thus, not discoverable in the instant  action.  The parties  shall submit revised motions, excluding the aforementioned issues which are (1)  relevant to matters not before this Court; and (2) already addressed within  Judge Treu’s March 7, 2024 Order, therein.   The parties are encouraged to submit a joint  protective order or use the Court’s approved protective order.   Dated: June 28, 2024   _______________________ MEL RED RECANA Judge of the  Superior Court  Superior Court of

Ying Eugenie Lai’s Motion for Protective Order       The Court
considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply.            The
motion is DENIED. Sanctions are not to be awarded at this time. The parties are ordered to submit revised
motions in compliance with the March 7, 2024 order and excluding all matters
extraneous to the instant case.BackgroundOn June 29,
2021, Plaintiff Hoi Ying Eugenie Lai (“Lai”) filed a Complaint against
Defendant Irene (“Chan”) Chan for two causes of action: (1) specific performance;
and (2) constructive trust and exemplary damages for fraud in the inducement.
Plaintiff alleges that on September 3, 2019, Plaintiff entered into an oral
agreement with Defendant Chan and her son to purchase a piece of real property
in Temple City, California, via quitclaim deed. Plaintiff alleges Defendant
breached the agreement and made false promises to induce Plaintiff’s
performance. On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”), maintaining the second cause of action for specific performance and
removing the cause of action for constructive trust. In addition to maintaining
the second cause of action for (2) specific performance, Plaintiff’s FAC added
the following causes of action: (1) quiet title; (3) breach of contract; (4)
breach of quasi-contract/unjust enrichment; (5) promissory estoppel; (6)
intentional misrepresentation; (7) negligent misrepresentation; and (8)
declaratory relief. On June 7, 2023,
Defendant Chan filed her Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff Lai and added
Cross-Defendant Global West Real Estate Corporation (“Global”) for (1) breach
of fiduciary duty; (2) intentional fraud; (3) negligent misrepresentation; (4)
elder abuse; (5) financial elder abuse; (6) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; (7) negligence; and (8) unfair competition. On November 20,
2023, Cross Defendant Global filed its cross complaint against both Plaintiff
Lai and Defendant Chan for (1) indemnity; (2) contribution; (3) declaratory
relief; (4) attorney fees; and (5) breach of independent contractor agreement. On December 11,
2023, Plaintiff Lai filed the instant motion for Protective Order, along with
the Declarations of Eugenie Lai and Shirin Buckman, and Exhibits 1-13. On March 7,
2024, Judge Treu issued an order addressing a number of the discovery issues
that are the subject of the instant motion for protective order. On April 19,
2024, the Court granted an ex parte stipulation to continue the hearing
date for Plaintiff Lai’s instant Protective Order from April 26, 2024 to June
of 2024. On June 13,
2024, Defendant Chan filed her amended Opposition to Plaintiff Lai’s “Second
Amended Motion for Protective Order.”On June 17,
2024, Plaintiff Lai filed her Amended Notice of Motion for Protective Order,
along with the Declarations of Eugenie Lai and Shirin Buckman, and Exhibits
1-9. This was followed by the filing of a Proposed Order on June 20, 2024. The
Amended Motion was filed pursuant to the parties’ agreement during their
telephonic meet and confer on May 14, 2024. (Amended Motion for Protective
Order (“Mot.”), Buckman Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. 7.) During such meet and confer, Ms. Fu
and Plaintiff Lai’s attorney, Shirin Buckman discussed consolidating all the
issues disputed in Plaintiff Lai’s motion to quash, Defendant Chan’s deposition
subpoena for production of business records to Yong Kang Luo, as well as potential
motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for
production of documents into one Amended Protective Order. Thus, Plaintiff and
Defendant each agreed to consolidate their discovery disputes into one motion
for protective order each. (Mot., Buckman Dec., ¶¶ 8-9, Exs. 7-8.) The Court
finds such consolidation improper.On June 21,
2024, Plaintiff Lai filed her Reply. Legal
StandardMotion
for Protective Order“Before, during, or after a deposition, any party, any deponent, or
any other affected natural person or organization may promptly move for a
protective order.” (CCP § 2025.420(a).) “The court, for good cause shown, may
make any order that justice requires to protect any party, deponent, or other
natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or
oppression, or undue burden and expense.” (CCP § 2025.420(b).) This protective
order may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following
directions set forth in CCP §§ 2025.420(b)(1)-(16). “Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.420, subdivision (b), provides a nonexclusive list of permissible
directions that may be included in a protective order.” (Nativi v. Deutsche
Bank National Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 316.) “If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part,
the court may order that the deponent provide or permit the discovery against
which protection was sought on those terms and conditions that are just.” (CCP
§ 2025.420(g).) “ ‘[T]he issuance and formulation of protective orders are to a
large extent discretionary. [Citation.]’ ” (Nativi, supra, 223
Cal.App.4th at 316.) “The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion for a
protective order, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2025.420(h).) Discussion            Plaintiff’s

Order On March 7, 2024, Judge Treu issued the
following order: The court GRANTS Defendant's motion to
compel further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 1, 16-17,
19, 25, and 28. The court orders Plaintiff to serve further responses to
Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 1, 16-17, 19, 25, and 28, within 20 days
of the date of this ruling. The

serve further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 49 and 51-52,
subject to a protective order, as set forth below. The
court GRANTS Defendant's motion to compel further responses to Special
Interrogatories (Set Two) Nos. 1-9, 11-12, 23, 25-26, and 35. The court orders
Plaintiff to serve further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two) No.
1-9, 11-12, 23, 25-26, and 35, within 20 days of the date of this ruling. The
court GRANTS Defendant's motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories
(Set Two) Nos. 31-34, 38-44, and 45-49. The court orders Plaintiff to serve further
responses to Special Interrogatories (Set Two) Nos. 31-34, 38-44, and 45-49,

court DENIES Defendant's motion to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories
(Set Two) Nos. 10, 13-22, 24, 27-30, and 36-37. The
court GRANTS Defendant's request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and
her counsel of record in the reduced amount of $1,860 in attorney's fees and
costs. The court orders plaintiff Hoi Ying Eugenie Lai and her counsel of record,
jointly and severally, to pay $1,860 to defendant Irene Chan, through her
counsel of record, within 20 days of the days of the date of this ruling. As such, this
Court finds Judge Treu already made the foregoing rulings on Special
Interrogatories, Set Two. Additionally, Judge Treu made clear that Plaintiff's
real estate business dealings with her other clients are confidential financial
affairs. (March 7, 2024 Minute Order, pg. 10.) Financial affairs from another
matter demonstrating a "pattern and practice" are not relevant or
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in this
case. Evid. Code § 1101(a) bars character evidence. (Id. at pg. 12.) In
light of the Honorable Rolf M. Treu’s ruling on March 7, 2024, Plaintiff and
Defendant are ordered to review and comply with the determinations and orders
contained therein. Additionally,
any issues pertaining to Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 23STCV17632 (Ho
v. Lai) are deemed irrelevant and thus, not discoverable in the instant
action. The parties
shall submit revised motions, excluding the aforementioned issues which are (1)
relevant to matters not before this Court; and (2) already addressed within
Judge Treu’s March 7, 2024 Order, therein.  The parties are encouraged to submit a joint
protective order or use the court’s approved protective order. Dated: June 28, 2024 _______________________MEL RED RECANAJudge of the
