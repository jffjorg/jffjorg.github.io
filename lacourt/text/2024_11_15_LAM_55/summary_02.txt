And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' complaints. The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend to the first cause of action (alter ego), but with leave to amend to the fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action (fraud, intentional misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation). The demurrer was overruled as to all other causes of action.

The judge found that the plaintiffs' allegations of false representations and breach of contracts were sufficient to support a claim of unjust enrichment. However, the judge also found that the plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action for fraud or misrepresentation because the allegedly false representations were opinions or statements of future events, not actionable misrepresentations of fact.

The judge also found that the plaintiffs' allegations of intentional and negligent interference with economic advantage were sufficient to support their claims, and overruled the demurrer to those causes of action.

The judge gave the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their complaints to address the defects identified in the demurrer.
