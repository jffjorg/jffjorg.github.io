LEGAL STANDARD
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made at any
time either prior to the trial or at the trial itself.” Ion Equipment Corp.
v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877 (citation omitted). “A motion for
judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and
hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters
that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore
not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.” Cloud v. Northrop Grumman
Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999 (citations omitted). “‘The standard
for ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as
that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the
pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears
that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” Bezirdjian v. O’Reilly
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322 (quoting Schabarum v. California
Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216).
 
ANALYSIS
Defendants argue that the Requests for Admission (RFAs),
which the Court deemed admitted, negate essential elements of both Plaintiff’s causes
of action.
The elements of medical malpractice are: “(1) the duty of
the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of
his profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a
proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting
injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the professional’s
negligence.” Simmons v. West Covina Medical Clinic (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d
696, 701-02 (citations omitted). 
Civil Code § 3428 imposes upon health care service plans and
managed care entities a “duty of ordinary care to arrange for the provision of
medically necessary health care services to its subscribers and enrollees,
where the health care service is a benefit provided under the plan.…” Civ. Code
§ 3428(a).) “Civil Code section 3428 makes all health care service plans liable
for harm a subscriber suffers when the plan fails to exercise ordinary care and
denies, delays, or modifies health care services.” Martin v. PacifiCare of
California, 198 Cal. App. 4th 1390, 1406
“Any matter admitted in response to a request for admission
is conclusively established against the party making the admission in the
pending action ….” Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.410.
Here, the RFAs deemed admitted establish that Defendants
each complied with the standard of care, did not cause or contribute to Plaintiff’s
claimed injuries and damages, and were not negligent. RJN Tab 4, Tab 5, Tab 6. Consequently,
the essential elements of Plaintiff’s causes of action are negated by the
deemed admissions, and thus fail to state a claim against Defendants for these
reasons. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted.
The burden is on Plaintiff to show how she can amend the
complaint, and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.
Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742. In this case, Plaintiff does
not oppose the motion, nor has she moved to set aside the deemed admissions.
Accordingly, there is no possibility of amendment to state a claim against
Defendants. Therefore, Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings is
granted without leave to amend. 
 
CONCLUSION
Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is granted
without leave to amend.
