Summary in English text:

The Judge grants the Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings without leave to amend. The motion was made by the Defendants, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Southern California Permanente Medical Group, and Chuon Khac Do, M.D., against the Plaintiff, Angela Reyes. The Plaintiff filed this action alleging medical malpractice and managed care negligence against the Defendants, claiming that they failed to remove a surgical sponge, resulting in an infection.

The Judge granted the Defendants' request for judicial notice of various documents, including the Plaintiff's Complaint, the Defendants' Answer, and the Court's order deeming the Requests for Admission (RFAs) admitted.

The Judge analyzed the Plaintiff's causes of action and found that the RFAs deemed admitted established that the Defendants each complied with the standard of care and did not cause or contribute to the Plaintiff's claimed injuries and damages. Therefore, the essential elements of the Plaintiff's causes of action are negated, and the Plaintiff fails to state a claim against the Defendants.

As the Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion and did not move to set aside the deemed admissions, the Judge found that there is no possibility of amendment to state a claim against the Defendants. Therefore, the Judge granted the Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend.
