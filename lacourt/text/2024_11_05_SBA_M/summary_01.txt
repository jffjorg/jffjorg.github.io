And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to approve the settlement between Calsafe Research Center, Inc. (the plaintiff) and Giorgio Foods, Inc., et al. (the defendants). The plaintiff had alleged that the defendants manufactured, packaged, distributed, marketed, and/or sold consumer products containing lead, and failed to warn consumers of this exposure. The plaintiff had requested an injunction and civil penalties.

The settlement requires the defendants to provide a warning to consumers in California regarding the lead exposure. The court has reviewed the settlement agreement and has found that it complies with Proposition 65, a California law that requires warnings for exposure to certain chemicals. The court has also found that the award of attorneys' fees to the plaintiff is reasonable, and that the penalty amount is reasonable under the criteria set forth in the law.

The court has granted the motion to approve the settlement and has entered judgment in accordance with the terms of the consent judgment. The plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
