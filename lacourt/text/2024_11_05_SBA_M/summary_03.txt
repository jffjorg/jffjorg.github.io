And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer, motion to strike, and motion to file documents under seal. The demurrer has been sustained with 20 days leave to amend, meaning that the complaint does not adequately state a cause of action and the plaintiff may re-file the complaint with additional information. The motion to strike has been deemed moot because the demurrer has been sustained and the dispute has been resolved. The motion to file documents under seal has been granted, meaning that certain documents will be kept confidential to protect business proprietary information. The Judge has also denied various causes of action brought by the plaintiff, including claims for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, negligent interference with prospective economic relations, unfair competition, and unjust enrichment. The Judge has given the parties 20 days to file amended pleadings.
