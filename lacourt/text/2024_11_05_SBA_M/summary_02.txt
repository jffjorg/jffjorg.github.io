And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Robert Mills' motion to amend the judgment in the case against Thomas Wallin, et al. The Plaintiff had sought to add holdover damages, attorneys' fees, and costs to the judgment, citing California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 1169. However, the Judge finds that CCP § 1169 only applies to default judgments, and since the judgment was entered after a court trial, the motion to amend the judgment is denied. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
