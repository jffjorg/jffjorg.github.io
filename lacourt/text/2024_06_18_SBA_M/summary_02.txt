The Court has ruled on the motions to compel further responses to discovery items, specifically Form Interrogatories 13.1 and 13.2. The motions are granted in part, deemed moot in part, and denied in part. The motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories 13.1 and 13.2 is granted. The Court finds that the Defendant has not justified its objections to the discovery items, and therefore, the Defendant must produce the requested information. The Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions is denied.
