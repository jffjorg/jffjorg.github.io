General Motors,
LLC’s Demurrer to Complaint

General Motors,
LLC’s Motion to Strike Portions of Complaint    
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

General Motors, LLC’s Demurrer to Complaint is deemed
moot. 
 
General Motors, LLC’s Motion to Strike Portions of
Complaint is granted with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Background 
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on October 10, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff alleges that Plaintiff’s 2019
Chevrolet Colorado suffers from transmission defects, engine defects, and other
defects. Plaintiff set forth causes of action under the Song-Beverly Act,
Magnusson-Moss Warranty Act, and a cause of action for Fraudulent Inducement-
Concealment. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendant filed a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41 and CCP § 435.5. (Decl., Arash
Yaraghchian.)
 
Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Defendant demurs to the fifth cause of action for
Fraudulent Inducement-Concealment for failure to state sufficient facts to
state a cause of action. Defendant’s demurrer is moot because, on June 4, 2024,
Plaintiff dismissed the fifth cause of action. 
 
Motion to
Strike  
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. 
CCP § 436(a).  The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  CCP § 436(b). 
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant,
false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws.  CCP § 436. 
The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading
or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
Defendant moves to strike the prayer for punitive
damages on page 13, line 14. 
 
Civ. Code, § 3294 states, in relevant part:
“(a) In an action for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that
the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff,
in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example
and by way of punishing the defendant.
(b) An employer shall not be liable for damages
pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer,
unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and
employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are
awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect
to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization,
ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an
officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.”
 
Having now dismissed the fifth cause of action for
fraudulent inducement-concealment, Plaintiff has not alleged specific facts
that Defendant acted willfully, maliciously, intentionally, fraudulently,
and/or recklessly to support Plaintiff’s prayer for punitive damages.  
 
Defendant’s motion to strike is granted with 20 days
leave to amend.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
