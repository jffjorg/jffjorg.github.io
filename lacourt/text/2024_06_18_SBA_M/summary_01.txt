And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the action against the successor in interest without prejudice. The defendant, Sayo Sasaki, passed away on March 2, 2022, and the defendant's alleged successor in interest filed a motion to intervene in the action. However, the plaintiff failed to properly serve the alleged successor in interest with the motion to continue the action. The judge notes that the code allows for a pending action to be continued against the decedent's personal representative or successor in interest, but the plaintiff has failed to comply with the necessary procedural requirements. The motion to continue the action against the successor in interest is denied without prejudice, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
