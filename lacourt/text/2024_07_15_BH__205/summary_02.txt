And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nir Toledano v. Medinas Boat Service LLC, et al. regarding a request for entry of default judgment. The case arises from a breach of contract between the Plaintiff and the Defendants, where the Plaintiff agreed to refurbish and reinstall engines on his boat in exchange for $70,000. The Defendants failed to complete the repairs within 60 days, resulting in the Plaintiff incurring expenses of $3,640 and $1,100 per month in storage costs. The Plaintiff demanded the return of his engines and a refund of $70,000, but the Defendants did not comply.

The Plaintiff filed a complaint alleging three claims for breach of contract, conversion, and violations of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, seeking $90,530 in damages, interest, and attorney fees. The Plaintiff served the Defendants with the complaint and request for entry of default, but they did not respond. As a result, the Plaintiff successfully requested the entry of default, which was entered by the Clerk's Office on November 2, 2023.

The Judge has found that the Plaintiff has properly complied with the requirements for a default judgment, including providing a declaration of damages, interest computations, and a memorandum of costs. The Judge has also found that the Plaintiff has established their entitlement to the specific judgment requested. Therefore, the Judge has granted the Plaintiff's request for default judgment and has awarded a default judgment in the amount of $102,302.22 in favor of the Plaintiff.
