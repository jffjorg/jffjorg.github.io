The judgment is comprised of $130,044.55 in damages and $809.41 in costs. The defendants failed to respond to the plaintiff's request for entry of default and default judgment, and the plaintiff has complied with all the substantive and procedural requirements for a default judgment. The judge has found that the plaintiff's breach of contract claim is supported by evidence and that the relief requested is not complicated or requires an accounting. Therefore, the judge has granted the plaintiff's request for default judgment.
