And here is the English text summary:

The tentatively ruling states that the plaintiff, Orestes Lopez, may set aside the dismissal of his complaint due to the mistake of his counsel, who failed to attend a case management conference (CMC) due to head trauma from an accidental fall. The court finds that the mandatory relief provision of Code of Civil Procedure ยง473(b) is applicable, as the dismissal was not due to any of the exceptions listed in the statute. The court grants the motion to set aside the dismissal, reinstating the action, and sets a new case management conference for August 21, 2024. Additionally, the court sets an order to show cause why sanctions, including dismissal, should not be imposed for lack of proof of service on the defendant.
