And here is the summary in English:

The Court has granted Defendant Sammy Zablen's motion to quash service of summons. The Plaintiff, Alexander Khazai, filed the action against numerous Defendants, including Sammy's Warehouse, alleging 16 causes of action arising from a business transaction. However, the Court has found that the service of summons was not properly performed. Specifically, the Plaintiff's latest proof of service indicates that the summons and complaint were left with an individual, Jacob Toubi, who is Defendant's brother-in-law, at an address where Defendant does not reside. The Court has held that substitute service requires leaving the summons and complaint with a competent member of the household, and that the Plaintiff's attempts to complete substitute service by handing the documents to a member of Defendant's family at an address where Defendant does not reside is insufficient.
