And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

"The Defendant's motion to quash service of summons is DENIED. The Plaintiff has provided evidence demonstrating that the Defendant was properly served with the summons and complaint. The Defendant's denial of being served is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of valid service. The Court finds that the manner of service was reasonably calculated to give the Defendant actual notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard. Therefore, the Defendant's motion is denied."
