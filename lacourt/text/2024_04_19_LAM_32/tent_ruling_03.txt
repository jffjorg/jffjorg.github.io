            v.
 
WILLIAM ROGERS, 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV16188
  Hearing Date:  April 19, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to quash service of
  summons 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 11, 2023, Plaintiff Nydia
McFadden filed this action against Defendant William Rogers, asserting sixteen
causes of action arising from alleged habitability issues, harassment,
discrimination, and illegal rent increases.
            On February 26, 2024, Defendant
filed the instant motion to quash service of summons. Plaintiff filed her
opposition on April 8, 2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
“[T]he court in which an action is pending
has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served on him as
provided by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10).” (Code Civ. Proc, §
410.50(a).) “[A] court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of
process or by that party's general appearance.” (In re Jennifer O.
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 539, 547.) Actual notice of a lawsuit is not a
substitute for proper service of process. (Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 1199, 1206.) A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to
quash service of summons on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) 
DISCUSSION
            “A summons may be served by personal
delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be
served.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) Here, according to a proof of service
filed on August 25, 2023, a registered process server personally served
Defendant at the address 2252 Laurel Canyon Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90046. In
his motion, Defendant denies being served with the summons and complaint and
argues that he resides at a different address. However, the motion is
unaccompanied by Defendant’s declaration or any other evidence. Therefore,
Defendant has failed to rebut the presumption of valid service. (See Evid.
Code, § 647.) 
            Additionally, Plaintiff has evidence
demonstrating that personal service was properly effectuated. According to a
declaration of diligence, the process server spoke with Defendant while
Defendant stepped out onto the balcony, and Defendant responded to the name
William Rogers. (Wobbe Decl., Ex. C.) The server identified himself as a
process server and informed Defendant that he was being served. (Ibid.)
Because Defendant refused to come down, the server dropped the papers in
Defendant’s vicinity and left them visible. (Ibid.) 
            “[A] ‘defendant will not be
permitted to defeat service by rendering physical service impossible.’” (Bein
v. Brechtel-Jochim Group, Inc. (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1387, 1393.) The
service statutes are “more liberally construed to effectuate service if actual
notice has been received by the defendant.” (Stafford v. Mach (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 1174, 1183.) Here, Defendant is clearly aware of the lawsuit, and
there is no evidence to contradict the process server’s account. Service is not
rendered improper simply because Defendant avoided physical contact with the
documents. Although Defendant denies residing at the Laurel Canyon address, he
does not deny being there at the time of service. Personal service is not
limited to a defendant’s residence. 
Ultimately, the Court finds that the
manner of service in this case was “reasonably calculated to give an interested
party actual notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard.” (See
Stafford, supra, 64 Cal.App.4th at p. 1182.) Therefore, “the traditional
notions of fair play and substantial justice implicit in due process are
satisfied.” (Ibid.) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to quash is
DENIED.
