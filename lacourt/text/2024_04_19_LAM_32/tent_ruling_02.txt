  order RE:
defendants sammy zablen’s motion to
  quash service of summons  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 3, 2023, Plaintiff Alexander
Khazai filed this action against numerous Defendants, asserting 16 causes of
action arising from a business transaction. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
failed to properly compensate him for his services. 
            On November 20, 2023, Defendants
Sammy Zablen and Sammy’s Warehouse filed a motion to quash service of summons
for lack of proper service. The Court granted this motion on January 12,
2024.  
            On January 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a First Amended Complaint, with an accompanying proof of substitute service
filed on January 25, 2024. 
            On February 15, 2024, Defendant
Sammy Zablen filed another motion to quash service of summons on the grounds
that the FAC was not properly served. This motion concerned the proof of
service that Plaintiff filed on January 25, 2024, which Plaintiff conceded was
defective. Therefore, the Court granted the motion to quash on March 27, 2024. 
            On March 20, 2024, Defendant Zablen
filed the instant motion to quash service of summons based on a proof of
service Plaintiff filed on March 1, 2024. Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“[T]he court in which an action is pending
has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served on him as
provided by Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10).” (Code Civ. Proc, §
410.50(a).) “[A] court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of
process or by that party's general appearance.” (In re Jennifer O.
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 539, 547.) Actual notice of a lawsuit is not a
substitute for proper service of process. (Abers v. Rohrs (2013) 217
Cal.App.4th 1199, 1206.) A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to
quash service of summons on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).) 
DISCUSSION
            “A summons may be served by personal
delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be
served.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10.) Alternatively, a summons may be served by
leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s dwelling house,
usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address, in the
presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in
charge, at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents
thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint to the
same location. (Id., § 415.20.)
            In granting the first motion to quash,
the Court found that substitute service could not be effectuated by merely
leaving a copy of the summons and complaint on Defendant’s doorstep and then
mailing it to that address. (Jan. 12, 2024 Order re Mtn. to Quash 2:13-21.)
Rather, substitute service requires leaving the summons and complaint with a
competent member of the household. (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20.) The Court
granted the second motion to quash because the summons was taped to the door of
Defendant’s residence, which is as defective as leaving it on Defendant’s
doorstep. (March 27, 2024 Order re Mtn. to Quash 2:22-25.)
            Plaintiff’s latest proof of service,
filed March 1, 2024, finally indicates that the summons and complaint were left
with an individual. However, that individual was Jacob Toubi, Defendant’s
brother-in-law, and the location of service was 1521 Reeves St., Los Angeles,
CA 90035. By contrast, Defendant’s residence, as indicated on the January 25,
2024 proof of service, is 13906 Fiji Way, Marina del Rey, CA 90292. Defendant
denies residing at 1521 Reeves St., Los Angeles, CA 90035. (Zablen Decl. ¶ 2.)
Defendant denies receiving the summons or complaint at his residence. (Id.,
¶ 4.) Mr. Toubi also informed the process server that Defendant did not reside
at the Reeves Street address, but the server dropped the documents on the
doorstep anyway. (Toubi Decl. ¶ 3.)    
            Substitute service is performed by
leaving the summons and complaint at the “dwelling house, usual place of abode,
usual place of business, or usual mailing address” of “the person to be served.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20.) In this case, the person to be served is Defendant
Zablen. The Reeves Street address is not Defendant’s dwelling house, usual
place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address. Plaintiff
cannot complete substitute service by merely handing the documents to a member
of Defendant’s family at an address where Defendant does not reside.   
CONCLUSION
            The motion to quash filed by
Defendant Sammy Zablen is GRANTED.
