And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a sexual abuse case involving Plaintiff B.A. and Defendants Efren Martinez, Graciela Ortiz, and Billy Valdivia. The defendants are candidates in the November 2024 general election and argue that if their demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is not heard before the election, they will suffer irreparable harm to their political campaigns. The plaintiff argues that if her motion to compel further responses from the Huntington Park Police Department is not heard sooner, she will suffer irreparable harm to her causes of action. The judge has granted the ex parte application and advanced the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses, as well as the defendants' demurrer, to earlier dates. The plaintiff's motion will be heard on December 3, 2024, and the defendant's demurrer will be heard on October 10, 2024.
