And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Beatriz Camarillo's motion to strike Defendant Sunrun Inc.'s answer, which was filed more than 10 days after the court's ruling on a demurrer. The judge also found that the answer improperly asserts a general denial, as the complaint was verified. The judge did not strike the answer due to the Defendant's counsel's assertion that they did not receive notice of the demurrer or the court's ruling.

The judge has also ruled that Defendant Sunrun Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration is moot, as the court has sustained the demurrer to the answer and struck the amended answer. However, the Defendant is not foreclosed from renewing its motion to compel contractual arbitration in lieu of filing an amended answer.
