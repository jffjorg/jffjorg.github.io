TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Lakeside Plaza Anaheim, LP’s Motion for Summary
Judgment is GRANTED.
Moving Party to give notice.
This motion is unopposed as of August 13, 2024. 
 
Background
This is an unlawful detainer action over a commercial tenancy.
On May 14,
2024, Plaintiff Lakeside Plaza Anaheim, LP filed a complaint alleging one cause
of action for unlawful detainer. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant Hamid Rezaei owes plaintiff $19,332.00 in unpaid rent for the lease of 9532 Whittier Blvd., Pico Rivera,
California 90660 and $127.40 for each day Defendant has occupied the subject
premises beginning May 1, 2024. 
Plaintiff
moves for summary judgment. 
 
Legal Standard
“[A] motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the
papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact
and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” (Code
of Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) The moving party bears the initial burden of
production to make prima facie showing no triable material fact issues. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)  If the moving party meets this burden, the
burden shifts to the opposing party to make a converse prima facie showing that
a triable issue of material fact exists. (Ibid.)  
 
Plaintiffs may shift the burden of proof by submitting
evidence as to every element of the cause of action. (Code Civ. Pro., §437c,
subd. (p)(1); WRI Opportunity Loans II, LLC v. Cooper (2007) 154
Cal.App.4th 525, 532.) Unlike former law, it is not plaintiff’s burden to
disprove affirmative defenses asserted by the defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) 

Discussion

Plaintiff
moves for summary judgment on the basis that all the elements for unlawful
detainer have been met and the undisputed facts show that there is no triable
issue of material fact. 
 
The
elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent are the following: “(1)
the tenant is in possession of the premises; (2) that possession is without
permission; (3) the tenant is in default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant
has been properly served with a written three-day notice; and (5) the default
continues after the three-day notice period has elapsed.” (Kruger v. Reyes
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 16.) 
 
Here,
the first two elements are met because Defendant is in possession of the
premises, and Defendant has refused to relinquish possession of the premises,
despite Plaintiff’s termination of the lease after the Three-Day Notice Period
had run. (Decl. Bui, ¶ 6.) The third element is met because Defendant is in
default for failure to pay the full amount of rent from November 2023 and on. (Decl.
Bui, ¶ 5.) The fourth element is met because Plaintiff has provided proof that
it served Defendant with the required written three-day notice on April 30,
2024, and that the notice complied with the requirements under California law. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1161(2); Decl. Bui, ¶ 5, Ex. 2.) The fifth element is met because
Defendant’s nonpayment continued after the three-day notice period, as the $17,021.20
has not been paid. (Decl. Bui, ¶ 7.)
 
Plaintiff
has shown that there is no triable issue of material fact as to the unlawful
detainer cause of action. The burden then shifts to Defendant to prove a
triable issue of material fact exists, but the motion is unopposed. 
 
Thus, the motion is GRANTED.
