The judge grants Capital One, N.A.'s motion to deem the truth of the matters specified in their requests for admissions against Josue F. Bravo. The requests were propounded on November 10, 2023, but Bravo failed to respond. As a result, the court deems the truth of the matters specified in the requests admitted. However, the judge does not order any monetary sanctions against Bravo because the plaintiff did not request them. The moving party is required to give notice of the order.
