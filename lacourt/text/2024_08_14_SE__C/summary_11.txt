And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in an unlawful detainer action over a commercial tenancy. The plaintiff, Lakeside Plaza Anaheim, LP, alleged that the defendant, Hamid Rezaei, owes $19,332.00 in unpaid rent for the lease of 9532 Whittier Blvd. in Pico Rivera, California. The plaintiff showed that the defendant has occupied the premises since May 1, 2024, and has not paid the full amount of rent since November 2023. The judge found that the plaintiff has met all the elements of an unlawful detainer cause of action, including that the defendant is in possession of the premises, has refused to relinquish possession, and has been properly served with a written three-day notice. Since the motion is unopposed, the judge granted the motion and ordered the defendant to give notice.
