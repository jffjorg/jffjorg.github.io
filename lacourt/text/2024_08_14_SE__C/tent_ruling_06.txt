TENTATIVE ORDER
Petitioner
Capital One, N.A.’s Motion to Deem the Truth of the Matters Admitted as to Defendant
is GRANTED.  No monetary sanctions are
ordered.  
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
The motion is
unopposed as of August 12, 2024. 
 
This
is a collections action. Plaintiff Capital One, N.A. moves for an order that
the truth of all matters specified in Plaintiff’s first set of requests for
admission be deemed admitted against Defendant Josue F. Bravo. 
 
Requests
for Admissions
 
Where
a party fails to respond to requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The
court “shall” grant a motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the
requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests
for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion,
a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
On November 10, 2023, Plaintiff propounded the
first set of requests for admission on Defendant. (Decl. D’Anna, ¶ 2, Ex. 1.)
No responses have been provided. (Decl. D’Anna, ¶ 3.)  
 
The Court grants the motion. 
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
“It
is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under [Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, et seq.] on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  
 
No monetary sanctions are ordered because Plaintiff
does not request sanctions.
