And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's demurrer to the misrepresentation cause of action is denied. The plaintiff has adequately pleaded the elements of fraud, including misrepresentation, knowledge of falsity, intent to induce reliance, justifiable reliance, and damages. The defendant's allegations that the misrepresentation cause of action is duplicative, uncertain, and vague are unfounded. The plaintiff must give notice, and the defendant must answer within 10 days.
