TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Sean Antoine Dennis’s motion to compel further responses to Request
for Production of Documents, Set One is CONTINUED November 6, 2024 at 10:30
a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action about a 2019 Jaguar
F-Pace. Plaintiffs
move to compel further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One, request numbers 1 through 31.
 
Timeliness

 
Notice of the motion to compel further must be
provided within 45 days of service of the verified response or on or before any
specific later date to which the parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (c).) This 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is
served and is extended for service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) and 1013, subdivision (a). Failure
to timely move to compel within the specified period constitutes a waiver of
any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)

 
On December 19, 2023, Defendant
served responses to Plaintiff’s first set of requests for production of
documents. (Decl. Kohanoff, ¶ 18, 19, Ex. 4.) Responses consisted of both
factual responses and objections. (Decl. Kohanoff, ¶ 19, Ex. 4.) On August 1,
2024, Defendant served supplemental responses. (Decl. Cho, ¶ 3, Ex. A.) The
parties have not submitted evidence that Defendant served verifications. 
 
Thus, the clock has not run.  
 
Meet
and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion
shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
 
On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff sent
a detailed meet and confer letter outlining apparent deficiencies in
Defendants’ responses. (Kohanoff Decl., ¶¶ 22-23, Ex. 5.) On January 2, 2024,
Plaintiff sent a further meet and confer letter to address Defendants’
assertions that its discovery responses were code compliant. (Kohanoff Decl.,
¶¶ 24-27, Ex. 6.) Plaintiff filed the instant motion on January 25, 2024.  As of that date, Defendant had not responded
to either of Plaintiff’s meet and confer attempts. (Kohanoff Decl., ¶ 28.) On
August 1, 2024, Defendant filed a boilerplate opposition, specifically
addressing only one discovery request (No. 30) among the 31 at issue.  Also on August 1, 2024, Defendants served
supplemental discovery responses. (Cho Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) On August 7, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a (mostly) boilerplate reply, addressing none of the
supplemental responses Defendant served on August 1, 2024.  
 
The Court is not persuaded that
counsel have exhausted their meet and confer obligations pursuant to the Code.
Counsel are advised that their meet and confer efforts should go beyond merely
sending letters stating their respective positions. (See Townsend v. Superior
Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1439.) “A determination of whether an attempt
at informal resolution is adequate…involves the exercise of discretion. The
level of effort at an informal resolution which satisfies the ‘reasonable and
good faith attempt’ standard depends upon the circumstances. In a larger, more
complex discovery request, a greater effort at informal resolution may be
warranted. In a simpler, or more narrowly focused case, a more modest effort
may suffice. The history of the litigation, the nature of the interaction
between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type and scope of the discovery
requested, the prospects for success and other similar factors can be relevant.
Judges have broad powers and responsibilities to determine what measures and
procedures are appropriate in varying circumstances.” (Obregon v. Sup. Ct.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)
 
Given the amount of discovery at issue,
the Court believes that further meet and confer efforts will resolve many of
the issues before the Court.  Therefore,
Counsel are ORDERED to make further efforts to resolve the issues presented.
If, after exhausting those efforts, court intervention is needed, counsel may
appear and argue the merits on the continued hearing date. If counsel are
unable to informally resolve their discovery disputes, then counsel are
instructed to submit a REVISED JOINT SEPARATE STATEMENT with a detailed outline
of the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required. Counsel are
also strongly advised to review the standing CMC order issued in Department F
for guidance on the manner to handle disputed items. The revised joint separate
statement must be FILED on or before October 25, 2024.
