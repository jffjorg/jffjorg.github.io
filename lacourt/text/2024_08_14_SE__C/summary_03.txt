And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part the plaintiff's motion to compel further response to request for production of documents regarding pre-litigation release agreements and template letters. The judge determined that the requests are within the proper scope of discovery, subject to limitations. The motion to compel further response to request no. 28, regarding defendant's policies and procedures regarding requiring consumers to sign release agreements, is granted in part. The motion to compel further response to request no. 30, regarding defendant's rationale for its response to the pre-litigation repurchase request for the subject vehicle, is granted in part. The motion to compel further response to request nos. 34 and 35, regarding template letters, is granted in part. The judge denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the defendant acted with substantial justification in opposing the motion. The parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding what constitutes a "template" for purposes of this discovery request.
