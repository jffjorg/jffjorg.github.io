 Case Number:  23NWCV02035    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  C BIEL VS. LAW OFFICE OF CYNTHIA  QUINTERO, ET AL.  CASE NO.:  23NWCV02035 HEARING:   8/14/24 @ 10:30 A.M.   #6 TENTATIVE RULING   Defendant’s demurrer is OVERRULED.  Defendant to answer within 10 days.    Plaintiff to give NOTICE.     Background The operative First  Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleges that around September 2018, Plaintiff Teresina  Biel retained attorney Cynthia Quintero to provide legal services in connection  with her dissolution action with her then husband, Carl Biel. (FAC, 8.)  Plaintiff sues for the following: (1) legal malpractice; (2) breach of  fiduciary duty; and (3) misrepresentation.    Defendant demurs to the  misrepresentation cause of action on the grounds that it is duplicative,  uncertain, does not state facts sufficient to state a cause of action, and is  vague and ambiguous.    Legal Standard   The party against whom  a complaint has been filed may object to the pleading, by demurrer, on several  grounds, including that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to  constitute a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A party  may demur to an entire complaint, or to any causes of action stated therein. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 430.50, subd. (a).) The complaint must be construed liberally by drawing  reasonable inferences from the facts pleaded. (Flynn v. Higham  (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 677, 679.)   The burden is on the  complainant to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully, to  obtain an order allowing leave to amend.   (McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th  72, 78.) “Leave  to amend should be denied where  the facts are not in dispute and the nature of the claim is clear, but no  liability exists under substantive law.” (Lawrence  v. Bank of America (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 431, 436.)    Meet-and-Confer   The parties have  sufficiently met and conferred. (Decl. Goldstein, ¶ 3; Code Civ. Proc., §  430.41, subd. (a)(3).)       Third Cause of Action – Misrepresentation   The elements of fraud are the  following: (a) a misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or  nondisclosure); (b) scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c) intent to induce  reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Hinesley v.  Oakshade Town Ctr. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) The facts constituting  the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to every  element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the pleadings will  not ordinarily be invoked. (Lazar v. Super. Ct. (1996) 12 Cal.4th  631, 645.) This requires pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom,  and by what means the representations were made. (Ibid.)    As to the Third Cause of Action, Plaintiff  pleads the following: “Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference  each and every allegation contained in paragraphs I through 37.” (FAC, ¶ 38.) “During  Defendant Quintero’s legal representation of Plaintiff, Defendant Quintero, and  her paralegal Yesenia Elias, made several representations to Plaintiff  concerning certain matters, which representations were in fact false, and  Defendant Quintero and Elias also concealed facts from Plaintiff, all as set  forth below.” (FAC, ¶ 39.) More specifically, Plaintiff alleges that she  advised Quintero that she did not want a lien placed on the family residence,  Quintero represented that she would not place an attorney lien on the family  residence, but Quintero placed one anyway. (FAC, ¶¶ 17 and 18.)    Plaintiff adequately pleads  misrepresentation of the attorney lien (FAC, ¶¶ 17-18), knowledge of falsity  (FAC, ¶ 70), intent to induce reliance (FAC, ¶ 71), justifiable reliance (FAC,  ¶ 73), and damages (FAC, ¶ 74.)    The demurrer to the third cause of action  is OVERRULED.
