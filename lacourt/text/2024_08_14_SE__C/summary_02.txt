And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on an ex parte application from plaintiff Elizabeth Thomas, who is representing herself in a wrongful eviction action against BV Lakewood Carson SE LLC. Thomas is seeking an extension of time to pay jury fees, claiming that she is in the process of securing representation and needs additional time to arrange payment. The judge has granted the application in part, ordering that jury fees be paid by August 26, 2024, the day before a final status conference. The judge has also set a deadline of August 26, 2024, for Thomas to pay the jury fees, rather than granting her request to extend the deadline until September 5, 2024.
