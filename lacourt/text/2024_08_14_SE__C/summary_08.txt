As for the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC, regarding the plaintiff's complaint. The court grants the demurrer in part and sustains it in part. The court finds that the plaintiff has adequately alleged a violation of Civil Code section 2923.5, which requires a mortgage servicer to contact a borrower before issuing a notice of default.

The court sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges a violation of Civil Code section 2924, as the plaintiff does not allege a private right of action under this section. The court also sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges a violation of Civil Code section 2924.9, as the plaintiff does not allege how the failure to send a required notice is a material violation.

The court sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which alleges wrongful foreclosure, as the plaintiff does not allege tender or excuse for failure to tender. The court sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action, which alleges cancellation of written instruments, as the plaintiff lacks standing to cancel a deed or mortgage regarding the property.

The court overrules the demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges a violation of Civil Code section 2923.5. The court gives notice to the defendants to file a response to the plaintiff's complaint. The court sets a hearing date for August 14, 2024, at 9:30 a.m.
