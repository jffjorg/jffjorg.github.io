And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to be relieved as counsel of record for the plaintiffs, Dennis Martinez Salazar and Maria Martinez Salazar, by their attorney, Mitchell P. Beck. Beck is seeking to withdraw from the case due to a deterioration of the attorney-client relationship. The court has previously continued the hearing to allow Beck to file revised proposed orders, which he did on November 4, 2024. The court notes that the trial date has not been set and there will be no prejudice to the parties if Beck is relieved of his duties. Therefore, the motion is granted, and Beck is relieved as counsel of record effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the order on the plaintiffs and all parties who have appeared.
