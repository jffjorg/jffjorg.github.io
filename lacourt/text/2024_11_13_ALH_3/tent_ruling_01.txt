     CASE NO.:  22AHCV00437
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.

November
   13, 2024



 
Larry A.
 Rothstein seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for defendant
 Vision Construction Group, Inc. on grounds that there has
 been an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal
should be granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Trial in this matter is scheduled for
March 10, 2025, and no prejudice will result from granting this motion. However,
counsel’s motion does not comply with California Rules of Court rule 3.1362
because it does not include a proposed order on Form MC-053. 
Accordingly, the hearing on this
unopposed motion to be relieved is CONTINUED to December 4, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. so
that defense counsel may submit a proposed order. The proposed order must be
filed with the court no later than 5 court days before the date of the next
hearing. 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 13th
day of November, 2024
