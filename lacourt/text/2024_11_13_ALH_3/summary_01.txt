And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved filed by Larry A. Rothstein, counsel for the defendant Vision Construction Group, Inc. The motion is based on an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, and the judge finds that absent a showing of resulting prejudice, the motion should be granted. The trial in this matter is scheduled for March 10, 2025, and the judge does not anticipate that granting the motion will result in prejudice. However, the judge notes that the motion does not comply with California Rules of Court rule 3.1362 because it does not include a proposed order on Form MC-053. Therefore, the hearing on the motion is continued to December 4, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. so that defense counsel may submit a proposed order. The proposed order must be filed with the court no later than 5 court days before the date of the next hearing.
