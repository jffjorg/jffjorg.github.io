  Case Number:  22STCV02890    Hearing Date:   June 7, 2024    Dept:  57            
 
Pending before the Court is Defendant Sigal
Redfield’s motion for judgment on the pleadings (“the Motion”).  The operative pleading here is Plaintiff
George Luk’s First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). The FAC is on a California
Judicial Council Form that is captioned “Action for Recovery of COVID-19 Rental
Debt as Defined Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1179.02.” Luk alleges in
the FAC that Redfield agreed to pay $8,600 in rent per month, for the period
March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021, for property located at 201 21st
Street in Santa Monica, California (“the Property”).  
 Redfield asserts in the Motion that the Luk lacks
standing to sue Redfield for back rent under the lease for the Property, which
Redfield says was executed in 2010 (“the 2010 Lease”).  According to Redfield, Luk is not a party to,
or a beneficiary of, the 2010 Lease. 
 “A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs
the same function as a demurrer and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.”  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp.
(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)   The Court is denying the Motion because it is
based on evidence outside the four corners of the FAC.  The documents for which Redfield requests that
the Court take judicial notice do not alter that equation.
 The FAC is not, by its own terms, based on the  2010 Lease or any other written lease executed
on any particular date for that matter.  In
the FAC, Luk alleges Redfield agreed to pay him rent of $8,600.00 per month,
and $17,200.00 remains unpaid that accrued between March 1, 2020 and September
30, 2021.  Luk is suing on the alleged
agreement.  Luk does not specify the form
of the agreement, but he pleads its operative effect -- and that is sufficient
at the pleading stage in a breach of contract action.  (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v.
TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 199; Miles v. Deutsche
Bank National Trust Co. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 401-402.)
 To be sure, in
his initial complaint, Luk alleged Redfield’s rental obligation was based on a
written residential lease for the Property.  Redfield requests that the Court take judicial
notice of the 2010 Lease, which is attached to the declaration that she filed
in support of the motion.  Luk is not
mentioned as the owner of the Property in that document.  An entity named ACI International LLC (“ACI”)
is defined as the owner. 
 The initial complaint
did not, however, refer to any specific written lease and the year of its
inception.  And no such lease was
attached to the complaint.  The proposition
that the 2010 Lease is the operative lease is based on Redfield’s say-so in her
motion.  Even if the Court were to take
judicial notice of the 2010 Lease, the Court could not rely on it at the pleading
stage to grant Redfield’s motion. 
 Nor does Redfield
obtain traction for her motion through other documents that are the subject of
her request for judicial notice.  These
documents, she says, show that ACI is a suspended corporation and thus Luk cannot
 sue to collect rent on its behalf.  Whether ACI is a suspended corporation is
immaterial at the pleading stage because the FAC is not based on the 2010 Lease
that identifies ACI as the owner of the Property.  
 All told, at
the pleading stage, the parties dispute the form of the agreement related to
the Property.  Resolution of this  factual dispute cannot be accomplished based
on the pleadings.
