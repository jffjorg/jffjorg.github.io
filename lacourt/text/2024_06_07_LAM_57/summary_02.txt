And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrers and motions to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrers of the defendants (CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, Krikor Kalindjian, Nelson Owyoung, Joseph Nussbaum, and Khaldoun Sroujieh) are sustained without leave to amend. This means that the defendants' arguments against the plaintiff's claims have been accepted, and the plaintiff will not be able to re-file their claims.

The motion to strike filed by Nelson Owyoung, Joseph Nussbaum, and Khaldoun Sroujieh is denied as moot, meaning that it has become irrelevant due to the ruling on their demurrer. The same is true for Krikor Kalindjian's motion to strike, except for the extent that it relates to the general prayer in the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, which is denied.

The motion to strike filed by CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center is granted as to the plaintiff's claim for treble damages in paragraphs 85 and 106 of the Second Amended Complaint, and as to the plaintiff's claims for attorney's fees in paragraphs 106 and 114. This means that these specific claims will not be considered further. The motion to strike is denied in all other respects, meaning that the other claims will proceed to trial.
