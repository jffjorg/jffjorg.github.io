And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings brought by the defendant, Sigal Redfield. The plaintiff, George Luk, alleges that Redfield agreed to pay rent of $8,600 per month for the period from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021, and seeks judgment on the alleged agreement. Redfield argues that Luk lacks standing to sue Redfield for back rent under the lease for the property, which she claims was executed in 2010. However, the court finds that the motion is based on evidence outside the four corners of the plaintiff's amended complaint, and that the court cannot rely on the defendant's declaration and attachments to grant the motion. The court concludes that the parties dispute the form of the agreement related to the property, and that resolution of this factual dispute cannot be accomplished based on the pleadings.
