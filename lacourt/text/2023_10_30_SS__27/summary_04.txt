Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a first amended answer filed by the defendant, Sabrina Nicole Hicks. The motion seeks to add an affirmative defense based on breach of contract. The judge has identified procedural defects in the motion, including the lack of a proposed amended pleading and a declaration that complies with California Rules of Court. However, the judge is inclined to grant the motion because the proposed amended answer does not demonstrate prejudice to the plaintiffs. The judge has continued the hearing to November 13, 2023, and has ordered the defendant to file and serve an amended declaration with the proposed amended answer by November 6, 2023.
