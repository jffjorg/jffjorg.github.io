And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, Lee Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Daniel Azizi, counsel for plaintiff Guillermo Zertuche, seeking to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed, but it does not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Specifically, proof of service showing that the plaintiff was personally served with the motion has not been filed. The court will continue the hearing to allow counsel to correct this defect. The judge notes that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, but absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted. The hearing on the motion is continued to December 7, 2023, at 1:30 PM in Department 27 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
