MOTION
FOR AN ORDER NUNC PRO TUNC



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Fernando Dorian Ruiz
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
This is a consolidated action arising from a May 27, 2021 pedestrian
bicyclist versus motor vehicle accident. 
On May 24, 2023, Plaintiff Fernando Dorian Ruiz filed a complaint against
Defendant Maamar M. Susini for Loss of Consortium arising from the May 27, 2021
accident.  Due to a technical defect,
Plaintiff’s Complaint was rejected.  On June
5, 2023, Plaintiff successfully filed the Complaint.  
 
Plaintiff now moves for an order nunc pro tunc to correct
the Complaint’s filing date from June 5, 2023, to the filing date of May 24,
2023.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
            The Court
has inherent authority to enter retroactive orders.  (See Scalice v. Performance Cleaning
Systems¿(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 221, 238-239.)  A request for a retroactive order “is to be
granted or refused as justice may require in view of the circumstances of a
particular case.” (Young v. Gardner-Denver Co.¿(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d
915, 919.)  
  
            Here,
Plaintiff submits the declaration of Amir Kermani (“Kermani”), who is a legal
assistant at Plaintiff’s counsel law firm.  Kermani states he e-filed
Plaintiff’s Complaint, Summons, Statement of Location, and Civil Case Coversheet
with the Journal Technology Court Portal on May 24, 2023.  (Declaration of
Amir Kermani, ¶¿3.)  The filing was rejected on May 26, 2023 because the
Civil Case Coversheet did not go through. 
(Declaration of Amir Kermani, ¶¶¿3, 5; Exhibit 3.)  After an
additional attempt, the filing was finally accepted on June 5, 2023. (Declaration
of Amir Kermani, ¶ 7; Exhibit 4.)  Kermani contacted the E-Filing
Department Supervising Clerk, Christine Meeks, who, after reviewing the
accepted and rejected filings, concluded that the rejection was an error.  (Declaration of Amir Kermani, ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff thus argues correction of the
filing date from June 5, 2023, to May 24, 2023, is proper because Plaintiff
timely presented his Complaint to the Clerk of the Court for filing during
business hours on May 24, 2023.  Consequently,
Plaintiff’s action commenced on that date; i.e., within the statute of
limitations.  (See Carlson v. Department of Fish & Game (1998)
68 Cal.app.4th 1268, 1270-1274; United Farm Workers of America v.
Agricultural Labor Relations Board (1985) 37 Cal.3d 912, 918 [for purposes
of the statute of limitations, “filing” means delivery to the clerk during
business hours].)  As such, the rejection of a filing for a technical
defect is not relevant to the timeliness of the filing.  
 
            Based on
the foregoing, the Court grants the unopposed motion.  
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
