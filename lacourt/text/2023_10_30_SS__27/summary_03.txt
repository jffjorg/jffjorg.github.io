Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting the plaintiff's motion to correct the filing date of the complaint from June 5, 2023, to May 24, 2023. The plaintiff's complaint was initially rejected due to a technical defect, but it was later accepted on June 5, 2023. The plaintiff argues that the rejection was an error and that the complaint was timely presented to the clerk for filing on May 24, 2023. The judge agrees and finds that the rejection of a filing for a technical defect is not relevant to the timeliness of the filing. The judge cites relevant case law to support this decision, including Scalice v. Performance Cleaning Systems and Carlson v. Department of Fish & Game.
