And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the plaintiff, J.W., against Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier LLC, Raiser-CA LLC, and Michael Venagas. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants were negligent in allowing an unnamed individual to transport her without an accompanying adult, which led to her sexual assault. The defendants argue that they did not owe a duty to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff has not alleged facts that support the imposition of such a duty.

The judge has reviewed the parties' arguments and has determined that the plaintiff has not pleaded facts that support the imposition of a duty on the defendants. Specifically, the judge finds that the harm suffered by the plaintiff was not foreseeable, and that imposing a duty on the defendants would not further the policy of preventing future harm.

As a result, the judge sustains the demurrer filed by the defendants with leave to amend. This means that the defendants may re-file their demurrer after the plaintiff has had the opportunity to re-plead the complaint. The judge orders that the moving party give notice of this ruling and file proof of service with the court within five days.
