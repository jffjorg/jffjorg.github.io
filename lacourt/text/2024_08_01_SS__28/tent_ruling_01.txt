  Case Number:  23STCV01246    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
          On January 19, 2023, Plaintiff United Financial Casualty
Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Clemestine McRae (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 for motor
vehicle tort and for subrogation under Insurance Code section 11580.2, subdivision (g).  The complaint demanded $63,732.74. 
          Also on January 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a statement of
damages listing property damage of $13,732.74, uninsured motorist bodily injury
payments of $50,000.00, and total damages of $63,732.74. 
          On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing
service of the summons, complaint, and statement of damages on Defendant by
mail and acknowledgement of receipt of service on March 22, 2024. 
On
June 20, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant’s default.  On July 2, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe
defendants without prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
June 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for default judgment. 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant and award
Plaintiff $64,189.74, consisting of $63,732.74 as the demand of the complaint
and $457.00 in costs. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 On a request for default judgment, “[w]here a
cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff merely needs to introduce
evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal.
Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357,
361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the evidence standard].) 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff
has submitted a completed default judgment application with all required
information. The Court grants the application. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff United Financial Casualty Company’s application for
default judgment filed on June 28, 2024. 
The Court awards Plaintiff $64,189.74 against Defendant Clemestine McRae. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
