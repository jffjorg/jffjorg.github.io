A.   This motion 
On April
22, 2024, Amigo’s and Govea (“Moving Defendants”) filed and electronically
served a motion for summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication.  The motion was set for hearing on July 3, 2024.  On June 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition.  On June 28, 2024, Moving
Defendants filed a reply.  The Court continued
the hearing to August 1, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Moving
Defendants ask the Court to grant summary judgment or, in the alternative,
summary adjudication. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion.DISCUSSION 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (a), notice of a motion for
summary judgment and supporting papers “shall be served on all other parties to
the action at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing. If the
notice is served by mail, the required 75-day period of notice shall be
increased by 5 days if the place of address is within the State of California,
10 days if the place of address is outside the State of California but within
the United States, and 20 days if the place of address is outside the United
States. If the notice is served by facsimile transmission, express mail, or
another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery, the required
75-day period of notice shall be increased by two court days.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(2).) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (a)(3), requires that two court
days be added to the notice period when the moving party electronically serves
a summary judgment motion.  (L. Edmon
& C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter
2024) ¶ 10:77, p. 10-34 (Cal. Practice Guide); see Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B) [“Any
period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any response
within any period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which
time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be
extended after service by electronic means by two court days” with exceptions
that do not apply here].) 
Moving
Defendants’ motion was set for hearing on July 3, 2024.  75 days before July 3, 2024 was April 19, 2024.  Adding two Court days to the notice period
for electronic service made the last day for service April 17, 2024.  Moving Defendants’ proof of
service states that Moving Defendants electronically served the motion on April 22, 2024. 
“Where
the moving party notices the hearing in less than the required time, notice
must begin anew.  The court cannot cure
this defect by continuing the hearing for the missing number of days.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 10:80.6,
p. 10-35, emphasis omitted.)  Therefore, the Court's continuance of the hearing to August 1, 2024 did not cure the defective notice. 
The Court denies the motion because Moving
Defendants did not provide the statutorily mandated notice. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court DENIES the
motion for summary judgment or, alternatively, summary adjudication filed by Defendants
Amigo’s Building Materials & Hardware, Inc. and Joel Artega Govea. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
