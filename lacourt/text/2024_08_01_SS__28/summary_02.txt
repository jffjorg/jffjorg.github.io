And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by Amigo's Building Materials & Hardware, Inc. and Joel Artega Govea. The motion was filed on April 22, 2024, but the moving parties did not provide the statutorily mandated notice, which is 75 days before the hearing date. The Judge notes that the moving parties electronically served the motion, which requires an additional two court days to be added to the notice period. However, the moving parties did not provide sufficient notice, and the Judge cannot cure this defect by continuing the hearing. Therefore, the motion is denied.
