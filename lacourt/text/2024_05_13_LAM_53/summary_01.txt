Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Andres Manzo and Eva Mora v. Hyundai Motor America. The court has granted the Plaintiffs' motion to strike or, in the alternative, tax costs. The court finds that Defendant's Code of Civil Procedure section 998 Offer was made on January 10, 2019, and was not made in good faith. The court finds that the 998 Offer was not made in good faith because it was premature and did not give the Plaintiffs sufficient information to evaluate the offer. The court further finds that the 998 Offer was not made in good faith because Defendant knew that Plaintiffs did not have sufficient information to evaluate the offer. The court orders that the Memorandum of Costs filed by Defendant Hyundai Motor America on August 29, 2023, is stricken.
