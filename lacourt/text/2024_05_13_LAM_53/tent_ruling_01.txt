MOVING PARTIES:              Plaintiffs Andres Manzo and Eva

RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Hyundai Motor America
Motion to Strike or, in the Alternative, Tax Costs
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Andres Manzo and Eva Mora (“Plaintiffs”) move the court for
an order (1) striking, in its entirety, the memorandum of costs filed by
defendant Hyundai Motor America (“Defendant”), or (2) alternatively, taxing
$20,001.18 in costs claimed by Defendant.  
The court finds that Defendant is not entitled to recover costs from
Plaintiffs and therefore grants Plaintiffs’ motion to strike Defendant’s
memorandum of costs. 
“If an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff
fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award, the plaintiff shall not
recover his or her postoffer costs and shall pay the defendant’s costs from the
time of the offer.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 998, subd. (c)(1).)  “On a motion
to strike or tax costs, ‘[t]he burden is on the offering party to demonstrate
that the offer is valid under section 998.’ 
[Citation.]”  (Covert v. FCA
USA, LLC (2022) 73 Cal.App.5th 821, 832.) 
“Once the offeror shows the section 998 offer is valid, the burden
shifts to the offeree to show the offer was not made in good faith.”  (Id. at p. 833.) 
The court finds that (1) Defendant has met its burden to show that its
January 10, 2019 Code of Civil Procedure section 998 Offer to Compromise (the
“998 Offer”) was sufficiently specific so as not to render it invalid for lack
of specificity, and (2) Plaintiffs have met their burden to show that the 998
Offer was not made in good faith and therefore is invalid.  (Covert, supra, 73 Cal.App.5th
at pp. 832, 833.) 
First, the court agrees with Defendant that (1) although the 998 Offer
did not expressly state that it would allow judgment to be entered in favor of
Defendant and against Plaintiffs, section 998 provides that, upon acceptance of
the offer and the filing of the proof of acceptance, “the clerk or the judge
shall enter judgment accordingly[,]” thus providing Plaintiffs with judgment in
their favor, and (2) the absence of a provision identifying a specific date of
payment of the settlement funds does not render the 998 Offer impermissibly
uncertain and invalid, particularly because the 998 Offer states that payment
would be made within five business days of the surrender of the subject vehicle
with clear title and no liens to Defendant. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 998, subd. (b)(1); Cutler Decl., Ex. C, 998
Offer, ¶¶ 3 [provision requiring dismissal of the complaint with prejudice], 1
[provision stating that Defendant shall pay $34,000 to Plaintiffs on an
unspecified date but within five business days of date of surrender]; Covert,
supra, 73 Cal.App.5th at p. 840 [noting that “the Courts of Appeal have
repeatedly upheld the validity of section 998 offers without a payment date”
and finding that the plaintiff “cite[d] no authority for his contention that an
offer to pay money in exchange for a dismissal without a payment date renders
the offer invalid”].)
Thus, the court finds that Defendant has met its burden to show that
its 998 Offer was not invalid for the reasons asserted by Plaintiffs in their
moving papers.  (Mot., pp. 4:24-5:12; Covert,
supra, 73 Cal.App.5th at p. 832.)
Second, the court finds that Plaintiffs have shown that the otherwise
valid 998 Offer was not made in good faith because it was premature.  (Covert, supra, 73 Cal.App.5th
at p. 833; Licudine v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2019) 30 Cal.App.5th
918, 926 [“it is the 998 offeree who bears the burden of showing that an
otherwise valid 998 offer was not made in good faith”].) 
“A 998 offer is made in good faith only if the offer is ‘
“realistically reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case” ’
[citation]—that is, if the offer ‘carr[ies] with it some reasonable prospect of
acceptance’ [citation].”  (Licudine,
supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 924 [internal citations omitted].)  “Whether a section 998 offer has a reasonable
prospect of acceptance is a function of two considerations, both to be
evaluated in light of the circumstances ‘at the time of the offer’ and ‘not by
virtue of hindsight.’”  (Ibid.
[internal citations omitted].)  The first
consideration concerns whether the offer was within the range of reasonably
possible results at trial, considering all the information that the offeror
knew or reasonably should have known.  (Id.
at pp. 924-925.)  The second
consideration concerns whether the offeror know that the offeree had sufficient
information to assess whether the offer was a reasonable one, such that the
offeree had a fair opportunity to intelligently evaluate the offer.  (Id. at p. 925.)  As to the second consideration, courts assess
three circumstances: (1) how far into the litigation the offer was made; (2)
the information bearing on the reasonableness of the offer that was available to
the offeree prior to the offer’s expiration; and (3) whether the offeree
alerted the offeror that it lacked sufficient information to evaluate the offer
and, if so, how the offeror responded.  (Id.
at pp. 925, 926.) 
The court acknowledges that the 998 Offer was “within the ‘range of
reasonably possible results’ at trial” because (1) the 998 Offers a repurchase
price of the subject vehicle in the amount of $34,000, and (2) on August 14,
2023, judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant in the
amount of $23,276.13.  (Cutler Decl., Ex.
C, 998 Offer, ¶ 1; Aug. 14, 2023 Judgment, JUD-100, ¶ 6.)  However, the court finds that, under the
circumstances presented here, Defendant’s 998 Offer was not made in good faith
because Defendant knew that Plaintiffs did not have sufficient information to
“assess whether the offer ‘[was] a reasonable one,’ such that the [Plaintiffs]
[did not have] a ‘fair opportunity to intelligently evaluate the
offer’[.]”  (Licudine, supra,
30 Cal.App.5th at p. 925.) 
Plaintiffs filed this action on December 3, 2018.  (Pl. Compl.) 
Defendant served its 998 Offer on Plaintiffs a little over one month
later, on January 10, 2019.  (Cutler
Decl., Ex. C, 998 Offer.)  “Although
section 998 fixes no ‘minimum period that must elapse following
commencement of suit for service of a valid 998 offer [citation], a litigant
receiving a 998 offer at the time a lawsuit is filed or soon thereafter is, as
a general matter, less likely to have sufficient information upon which to
evaluate that offer.”  (Licudine, supra,
30 Cal.App.5th at p. 925 [emphasis in original] [internal citation and footnote
omitted].)  Here, because Defendant
served the 998 Offer on Plaintiffs only a month after they filed this action,
Plaintiffs were less likely to have sufficient information upon which to
evaluate Defendant’s offer.  Moreover,
Plaintiffs have presented evidence establishing that, at the time that the
offer was made, Plaintiffs had not obtained pertinent information regarding
their claims through post-complaint discovery. 
(Licudine, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 926 [noting that
information may be obtained through post-complaint discovery].)  Specifically, Plaintiffs’ counsel has stated
that Defendant “did not provide responses and document production to
Plaintiff’s discovery requests until June 12, 2019 and June 19, 2019[,]” i.e.,
six months after the date that the 998 Offer was served.  (Cutler Decl., ¶ 6; Cutler Decl., Ex. C,
998 Offer.)  Defendant has not disputed
this in its opposition.  Further, while
Plaintiffs did not address whether they alerted Defendant that they lacked
sufficient information to evaluate the 998 Offer, it appears that Plaintiffs
may have done so by requesting discovery since Plaintiffs have shown that they
received discovery responses from Defendant in June 2019.  (Cutler Decl., ¶ 6; Licudine, supra,
30 Cal.App.5th at p. 926 [“An offeree may alert the offeror by (1) requesting
discovery, either formally or informally . . . .”].) 
Thus, the court finds that Defendant’s 998 Offer was unreasonable, was
not made in good faith, and therefore is invalid and cannot support Defendant’s
request for costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 998, subdivision
(c)(1).  (Licudine, supra,
30 Cal.App.5th at p. 924 [“A 998 offer is valid only if it is made in ‘good
faith’”].)
