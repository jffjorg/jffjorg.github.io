And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nohaile et. al. v. HLI Holdings, LLC et al. The case involves a dispute over defects and failure to conform to construction plans in a single-family residence built by Titan Contracting Services, a company owned by Itzhaki. The defendant, Itzhaki, has filed a demurrer to the second amended complaint (SAC) and a motion to strike portions of the SAC.

The judge has ruled that the SAC does not adequately allege specific conduct by Itzhaki that could give rise to liability, and that the allegations of ultimate fact are sufficient at the pleading stage to show a unity of interest and ownership between Titan and Itzhaki. The judge has also ruled that merely participating in or directing construction work does not give rise to liability, and that the SAC does not adequately allege specific tortious conduct.

The judge has sustained the demurrer and has also ruled that the motion to strike is moot given the demurrer ruling.
