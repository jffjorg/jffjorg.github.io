```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the unopposed motions to compel and sanctions against the plaintiff for ignoring discovery. The plaintiff failed to respond to discovery despite being served, and there is no justification for this failure. The court finds that a simple phone call from counsel to the plaintiff might have resolved the issue informally, and therefore sanctions in the amount of $100.00 per motion plus filing fees are awarded. The plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to discovery, as well as documents and a privilege log (if any), within 30 days.
