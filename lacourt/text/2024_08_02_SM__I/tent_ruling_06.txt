 Case Number:  23SMCV06068    Hearing Date:   August 2, 2024    Dept:  I The court agrees that the ransomware attack was
unforeseeable.  What the court does not
understand is what it is that plaintiff could not add to the second amended
complaint (which is on file) that should be added to the third amended
complaint.  If there is more information,
plaintiff should proceed along normal lines to add it; the court does not see
the exigency.  Right now, the motion
cannot be granted because plaintiff has not indicated what the new allegations
would be.  Therefore, the application is
DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to a regularly noticed motion.  Of course, plaintiff should first reach out
to the defense and see if they will stipulate to the amended complaint.  If so, plaintiff should submit a stipulation
and order rather than a motion.
