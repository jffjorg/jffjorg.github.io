 Case Number:  23SMCV01463    Hearing Date:   August 2, 2024    Dept:  I This is essentially the same as the prior motion.  The court’s thinking is the same.  The responses that were provided are not code
compliant.  The objections are
boilerplate and as such are in bad faith. 
Objections must be thought through and not cut and pasted out of the
form book.  The court incorporates its
order of July 26, 2024.  Sanctions of
$4520 for the two motions combined are imposed on the opposing party but not
counsel, payable within 30 days.  (This
is reduced because the replies are essentially the same for all of the motions
and there are similarities in the moving papers as well.)  Further verified responses without objection
are due in 30 days.  If the opposing
parties believe that they have already fully complied with this order, they may
stand on their supplemental responses, but if plaintiff brings a successful
motion to compel further as to those responses it will be considered a
violation of the instant order for purposes of the scope of sanctions.
