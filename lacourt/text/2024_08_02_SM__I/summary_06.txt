And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to add new allegations to the third amended complaint. The court agrees that the ransomware attack was unforeseeable, but is unclear as to what additional information the plaintiff could have included in the second amended complaint that should be added to the third amended complaint. The judge denies the motion without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can re-file the motion with additional information at a later date. The court suggests that the plaintiff reach out to the defense to see if they will stipulate to the amended complaint, and if so, submit a stipulation and order rather than a motion.
