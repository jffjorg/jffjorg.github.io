And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to grant the defendant's motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff. The plaintiff has responded to some special interrogatories with a three-page chart, but the chart does not provide specific documentation to support the entries. The judge believes that the plaintiff must make a good faith effort to obtain the information and cannot simply claim lack of actual knowledge. The judge orders the plaintiff to provide supplemental verified responses to the interrogatories within 30 days and imposes sanctions in the amount of $2280. The judge also notes that the parties may consider deposing Wade, the contractor, to obtain the necessary information, but this would likely require two depositions and may be unnecessary.
