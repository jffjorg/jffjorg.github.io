And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a response to a motion that is essentially the same as a prior motion. The Judge has reviewed the responses provided by the opposing party and finds them to be non-compliant and in bad faith. The objections raised by the opposing party are boilerplate and lack thoughtful consideration. As a result, the Judge is imposing sanctions of $4520 on the opposing party, payable within 30 days. The Judge is also requiring further verified responses without objection within 30 days. If the opposing party believes they have already complied with the order, they may stand on their supplemental responses, but if the Plaintiff brings a successful motion to compel further responses, it will be considered a violation of the instant order and may result in additional sanctions.
