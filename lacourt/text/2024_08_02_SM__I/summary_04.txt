And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel production of records by the LAPD in response to a subpoena from the property owner. The LAPD claims that certain documents are protected by the official records privilege, citing Evidence Code section 1040 subdivision (b). The judge notes that the privilege is conditional and applies to information acquired in confidence by a public employee, but must be weighed against the public's interest in the litigation. The judge concludes that the public interest in the ongoing criminal investigation and apprehending the remaining perpetrator outweighs the moving party's rights and will allow an in camera review of the redacted documents to determine what can be produced, what can be produced under a protective order, or what should be withheld. The judge will discuss a hearing date with the LAPD's counsel and will either rule from chambers or set an additional hearing date to hear argument.
