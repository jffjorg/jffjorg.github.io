 Case Number:  SC124878    Hearing Date:   August 2, 2024    Dept:  I The
court has been in communication with the referee, Judge Horn.  Judge Horn
reminded the court that his wife served as an alternate juror in Illulian v.
Rav-Noy, Case No., SC123117.  In that case, by stipulation, alternates
were allowed to sit in the jury room (but not participate in
deliberations).  There is a motion for a new trial pending before the
court in that case and in papers recently submitted Judge Horn’s wife has
signed a declaration relevant thereto.  Although the court and Judge Horn
are confident that Judge Horn could be fair and impartial and unbiased, both
believe that in an abundance of caution and given these unusual circumstances
it is better to allow either party to request that a new referee be
appointed.  The court therefore requests the parties to file a JOINT
statement within 10 court days that says either “A new referee is requested” or
“Both parties waive any potential conflict.”  If the former is issued, the
parties are not to disclose who seeks a new referee.  Should that occur,
the court will vacate the current order of reference and the next referee on
the list will be next in order. 
The court also is concerned that defendants are now
unrepresented and that as a result Illulian has not done what is needed in the
reference.  If that continues with the
referee, the court will consider vacating the reference, holding Illulian in
default, and issuing a judgment consistent with Ziv’s request, or, in the
alternative, allowing Ziv to request monetary damages based on the diminution
of the value of his property.  The court
reminds Illulian that the Ziv’s are competent to testify as to the diminution
of the value of his own property, but Illulian will not be competent to rebut
that testimony without retaining an expert.
