And here is the summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of SC124878, pending a hearing on August 2, 2024. The case involves a motion for a new trial and concerns the reference hearing. Judge Horn, the referee, has a potential conflict of interest due to his wife's involvement as an alternate juror in a previous case, Illulian v. Rav-Noy (SC123117). To address this, the court requests a joint statement from the parties indicating whether they wish to request a new referee or waive any potential conflict. If a new referee is requested, the parties are to keep the request confidential. The court also expresses concern about the lack of representation for the defendants and warns that if this continues, they may be held in default and a judgment issued consistent with Ziv's request. Alternatively, Ziv may be able to request monetary damages based on the diminution of the value of his property.
