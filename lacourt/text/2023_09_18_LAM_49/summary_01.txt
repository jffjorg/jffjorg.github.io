CIC Inc. is ordered to file an Answer to the Complaint within 21 days. Prestige is responsible for providing notice of the ruling, unless waived.

English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:

Judge Randolph M. Hammock issued a tentative ruling OVERRULING the demurrer filed by Defendant Prestige Default Services, LLC.  The Plaintiff, CIC Inc. (acting as trustee for the Serra Trust), sued for specific performance after Prestige rejected their bid on a property following a trustee's sale, despite CIC Inc. being the only bidder and submitting the required funds. Prestige argued that CIC Inc. hadn't properly pleaded the statutory cause of action, lacked standing to sue for specific performance, and that there was a missing necessary party (the current property owner). The judge, after requesting and reviewing supplemental briefing, found that CIC Inc. *had* sufficiently alleged compliance with California Civil Code § 2924m (which governs post-sale bidding), *did* have standing to sue for specific performance (even though the statute mentions enforcement by public officials, it doesn't preclude private parties), and that the alleged missing party issue wasn't apparent on the face of the complaint. Therefore, the demurrer was overruled, and CIC Inc. was ordered to file an answer to the complaint within 21 days. The moving party (Prestige) is responsible for giving notice of the ruling.

* **Court's Ruling:** The Judge overruled Defendant's demurrer, finding that Plaintiff has standing to bring the specific performance claim and that the complaint adequately alleges a contractual obligation under § 2924m. The court also rejected the misjoinder argument, stating that there was no prejudice to Defendant.

**Case Number:** 23STCV03601

**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023

**Dept:** 49

**Parties:** CIC Inc. (Plaintiff), Prestige Default Services, LLC (Defendant)

---

**Facts & Events:**

- Plaintiff CIC Inc. placed a bid with Defendant Prestige Default Services, LLC for a residential home at a trustee's sale.
- Plaintiff was the only bidder and submitted a cashier's check sufficient to cover the bid.
- Defendant rejected Plaintiff's bid and returned the funds.
- Plaintiff alleges Defendant violated California Civil Code § 2924m and seeks specific performance.

**Legal Issues:**

- Defendant Prestige Default Services, LLC demurred to the sole cause of action in the Complaint, arguing it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.
- Defendant contends Plaintiff has failed to plead its statutory cause of action with particularity and has not alleged the elements of a cause of action for specific performance.
- Defendant raises two new arguments in reply regarding standing to bring a cause of action for specific performance and a defect or misjoinder of parties.

**Court's Ruling:**

- Defendant's Demurrer is OVERRULED.
- Plaintiff is ordered to file an Answer within 21 days of this ruling.

---

**Discussion:**

*Demurrer*

- The court has read and considered Plaintiff's supplemental brief of September 11, 2023.
- The court finds Defendant's Demurrer is overruled because the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action.

*Specific Performance*

- Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged its performance and compliance with the statutory requirements of section 2924m for purposes of a demurrer.
- The elements of a cause of action for specific performance are met.

*Standing to Bring a Cause of Action for Specific Performance*

- Plaintiff has standing to bring this claim, as section 2924m(j) does not limit the ability of a party to the agreement to bring such an action.

*Defect or Misjoinder of Parties*

- Defendant has not shown any prejudice or interests affected by the alleged misjoinder.
- Any alleged defect or misjoinder must appear on the face of the complaint, and there is no indication from the complaint suggesting someone other than Defendant holds title to the property.

---

**Significant Statements:**

- "The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action."
- "To obtain specific performance after a breach of contract, a plaintiff must generally show: (1) the inadequacy of his legal remedy; (2) an underlying contract that is both reasonable and supported by adequate consideration; (3) the existence of a mutuality of remedies; (4) contractual terms which are sufficiently definite to enable the court to know what it is to enforce; and (5) a substantial similarity of the requested performance to that promised in the contract."
- "When interpreting a statute [the court's] primary task is to determine the Legislature’s intent."
- "The authorities indicate that the defendant is entitled to a favorable ruling only when he can show some prejudice suffered or some interests affected by the misjoinder."
- "If you submit on the tentative you have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part."
