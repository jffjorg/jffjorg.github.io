And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of CIC Inc. v. Prestige Default Services, LLC, a demurrer to the Complaint. The Plaintiff, CIC Inc., as Trustee of the Serra Trust, alleges that it placed a bid on a residential home at a trustee's sale and submitted a cashier's check to cover the bid, but the Defendant, Prestige Default Services, LLC, rejected the bid in violation of California Civil Code § 2924m. The Defendant demurs to the Complaint, arguing that it fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The Court has overruled the demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged its performance and compliance with the statutory requirements of section 2924m, and has standing to bring the action. The Court has also rejected the Defendant's argument that there is a defect or misjoinder of parties. The Plaintiff is ordered to file an Answer within 21 days of this ruling, and the moving party is ordered to give notice.
