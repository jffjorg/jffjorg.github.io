And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants defendants' motion to stay proceedings in this case, pending the results of the arbitration of plaintiff Ramon Chavez's individual claims. The court finds that while there may be some dispute over whether the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and California law require a mandatory stay, the court has inherent power to stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote judicial efficiency. The court notes that arbitration of the individual claims will involve similar issues to the litigation of the non-individual claims, and a stay will avoid duplicative proceedings, preserve the authority of the arbitrator, and conserve the time and resources of the parties and the court. The court also notes that there is no evidence that plaintiff or the alleged aggrieved employees will be unduly prejudiced by the stay.
