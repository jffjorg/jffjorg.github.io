And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants defendants' motion to stay proceedings in this case, pending the results of the arbitration of plaintiff Ramon Chavez's individual claims. The court finds that while there may be some dispute over whether the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and California law require a mandatory stay, the court has inherent power to stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote judicial efficiency. The court notes that arbitration of the individual claims will involve similar issues to the litigation of the non-individual claims, and a stay will avoid duplicative proceedings, preserve the authority of the arbitrator, and conserve the time and resources of the parties and the court. The court also notes that there is no evidence that plaintiff or the alleged aggrieved employees will be unduly prejudiced by the stay.

**Summary in English Text:**

Judge Randolph M. Hammock granted the Defendants' (Arakelian Enterprises, Inc. and Athens Disposal Company) motion to stay the proceedings in the case brought by Plaintiff Ramon Chavez.  Chavez's lawsuit alleges various labor law violations under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA).  Because Chavez's *individual* PAGA claims are currently being arbitrated (a process he voluntarily entered), the Judge ruled to stay the *non-individual* (representative) PAGA claims in court until the arbitration concludes. The judge determined that a stay was not *mandatory* under either the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) or California law because the court did not *order* the arbitration. However, the judge found that a stay was appropriate for reasons of judicial economy, as it would prevent duplicate proceedings and conserve resources. There was no evidence that the stay would prejudice Chavez or other aggrieved employees. A status review hearing is scheduled for September 18, 2024, to reassess the stay.

The judge acknowledged that Chavez voluntarily agreed to have his individual claims arbitrated and found that pausing the entire lawsuit was in the best interest of the court and all parties involved, as it would prevent unnecessary repetition of issues and save time and resources.
