And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Motion to Deem Admitted Requests for Admission, Set One, is denied. The defendant, Ahmed Helmy, sought to deem the requests admitted and impose sanctions on the plaintiff, Normajean Yamashita, and her attorney. The defendant failed to serve timely responses to the requests, and the plaintiff ultimately submitted responses in September 2024. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's untimely responses were due to excusable neglect and that the defendant's failure to serve timely responses was not prejudicial. The Judge grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $520.00, which is less than the requested amount of $980.00. The Judge orders the plaintiff and her attorney to pay the sanctions within 20 days.
