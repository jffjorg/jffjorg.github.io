MOVING PARTY: Defendant Ahmed Helmy 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Normajean Yamashita
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to deem Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted, and to
impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney of record, in the
amount of $980.00.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is DENIED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from alleged injuries that Plaintiff
sustained in a vehicle accident on June 26, 2021.
 
On May 25, 2023, Plaintiff Normajean Yamashita (“Plaintiff”
or “Yamashita”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Ahmed Helmy (“Defendant” or “Helmy”) and Does 1 to 10, alleging one
cause of action for Motor Vehicle Liability. Subsequently, Defendant filed an
Answer to the Complaint on December 6, 2023.
 
On August 15, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Deem Admitted
Request for Admission, Set One (the “Motion”). Additionally, Defendant requests
monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney of record.  
 
Subsequently, Plaintiff filed a Declaration in response to
the Motion on September 3, 2024. No Opposition has been received by the Court.
Defendant filed a Reply on September 5, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by
a written request that any other party to the action admit the genuineness of specified
documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact,
or application of law to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter
that is in controversy between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.)¿
“Within 30 days after service of requests for admission, the party to whom the
requests are directed shall serve the original of the response to them on the
requesting party, and a copy of the response on all other parties who have
appeared ....”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).)¿
 
If a party to whom request for
admissions is served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for
monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) The court shall
issue this order unless the party to whom the request was made serves a
response in substantial compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿
 
A.   
Motion to Deem
Admitted Requests for Admission, Set One
 
Defendant’s counsel attests
that on December 21, 2023, Plaintiff was served with multiple sets of written
discovery, including the Requests for Admission, Set One, to which responses
were due on January 22, 2024. (Ahdoot Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. “A.”) Subsequently, on
multiple occasions in June and July of 2024, Defendant followed up with
Plaintiff in writing, and via telephone, requesting that Plaintiff provide
responses as soon as possible. (Id. ¶ 5.) Despite these efforts, no
responses had been received by the time of the filing of this Motion. (Id.
¶ 6.)
 
Based on the above records, the
Court determines that Defendant failed to serve a timely response. 
 
Nevertheless, under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), the court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has subsequently served a
response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220,
and 2033.230. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel attests that the responses to the
Requests for Admission, Set One, have been submitted to Defendant on September
2, 2024. (Sanders Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. “A.”) Plaintiff’s counsel explains that the
untimely responses were due to a series of unfortunate incidents, including the
long-term medical leave of his administrative assistant, the advanced age of
the real party Plaintiff, and some family issues of the counsel himself. (Id.
¶¶ 4-8.) 
 
In the Reply, Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff’s
responses, albeit untimely, were in substantial compliance with relevant Code
of Civil Procedure sections.
 
Additionally,
the Court observes that the provision
in section 2033.300 regarding relief based on mistake, inadvertence and
excusable neglect is identical in most respects to the language and spirit of
section 473, subdivision (b). Both statutes serve similar purposes – to allow
relief where it serves the interests of substantial justice. The Court’s
discretion in granting such relief is not unlimited and must be exercised in conformity with the spirit of
relief intended by the statute so that substantial justice is served, not
defeated. Because the law favors that cases be tried and decided on their
merits, if there are any doubts whether relief should be granted, they must be
resolved in favor of the person seeking relief. (New Albertsons, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1419.)
 
Based on the declaration submitted by Plaintiff’s counsel
and the application of relevant legal principles, the Court, in its discretion,
finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated excusable neglect, thereby
justifying relief from the waiver that would preclude her from asserting any
objections to the requests. The Court perceives no prejudice to Defendant resulting
from the delay, other than the need to pursue his case on the merits.
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion to Deem Admitted.
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or
both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission
necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Although Plaintiff is relieved from waiver,
the Court finds that the mandatory sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.280, subdivision (c) are still applicable in this case. 
 
Accordingly, the Court determines the
total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the Motion to be $520.00, calculated based on a
reasonable hourly rate of $230.00 for 2 hours reasonably spent, in addition to
a $60.00 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS
IN PART Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Ahmed
Helmy’s Motion to Deem Admitted Requests for Admission,
Set One, is DENIED.
 
Defendant
Ahmed Helmy’s Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
 
Plaintiff
Normajean Yamashita and her attorney of record are ordered to jointly and
severally pay $520.00 to Defendant’s attorney of record within 20 days.
