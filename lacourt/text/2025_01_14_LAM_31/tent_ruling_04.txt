[1] According to the notice of motion,
ATC seeks only to maintain the AEO designation of its tax returns from
2018-2022.  However, given that the
parties also spar over the AEO designation as to the pricing schedule and other
financial documents, the court addresses the propriety of the AEO designation
to those documents as well.


[2] The parties do not explain who or
what AmericanStar Tours is.


[3] Plaintiff also argues there is no
proof ATC was in negotiations to acquire AmericanStar Tours at the time
Plaintiff acquired it.  This tends to cut
against an AEO designation based on Plaintiff’s alleged status as ATC’s
competitor.
