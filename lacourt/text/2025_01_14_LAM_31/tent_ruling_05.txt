MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Emerson
J. Tabone, Law Offices of Tabone, APC 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On November 15, 2024, Emerson J. Tabone, counsel for Defendant,
Fama Deme dba African Hair Braiding by Fama, filed this Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel.  
 
The motion is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
Emerson J. Tabone seeks to be relieved as counsel of record
for Defendant for the following reason: “Client is not communicating and
cooperating with counsel to get the discovery completed.  Counsel has made several attempts to get the
client to respond but is no being ignored. 
Counsel is unable to properly and effectibly (sic) represent a client
who does not cooperate or respond.”  (Form
MC-052.)   
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)
 
Upon review, the court finds the Motion complies with California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            The
unopposed Motion is granted and effective upon the filing of the proof of
service of this signed order upon Plaintiff. 
            Counsel to
give notice.
 
Dated:   January 14, 2025
