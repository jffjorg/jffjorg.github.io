And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has considered the motion for leave to intervene and the objections to the supplemental declaration. The intervenors, CFBD and NRDC, are seeking to defend the facial validity of the Ordinance, while the petitioners, Bridgeland and others, are seeking just compensation and to defend the Ordinance. The Court has discretion to limit intervention to "discrete phases of the litigation" and may place reasonable conditions on permitting discretionary intervention. The Court notes that the intervenors disclaim any interest in how the Ordinance is applied and that the petitioners may not be heard to complain that the intervenors should not be able to be heard. The Court also notes that there may be an issue as to whether a discretionary lease would exempt a well from the Ordinance and that an idle well may be subject to the Ordinance, even if deserted.
