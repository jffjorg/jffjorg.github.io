And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion by Ming-Chao Huang and Mei Jung Lin (Contestants) to exclude certain documents from use in a will contest trial. The Contestants claim that these documents were not produced until recently and that Respondent, Michael Velcherean, had them in his possession but did not disclose them. The Respondent argues that he only recently received the documents from the Administrator and that some of them were not ordered produced. The judge finds that the Contestants have not shown that the Respondent violated a discovery order or intentionally withheld documents, and that the late production of the documents does not cause material prejudice to the Contestants. The judge notes that the trial will be a bench trial, and that the Contestants will have ample time to address the implications of the use of these exhibits before trial. The judge also expresses concern about the level of activity by counsel in the case and the resulting expense to the clients and the estate.
