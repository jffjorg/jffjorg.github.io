And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to intervene filed by Black Women for Wellness et al. The motion seeks to allow the Intervenors to participate in the case as parties, arguing that they have a significant interest in the outcome.

The Judge found that the Intervenors have a significant protectible interest in the case, but that they do not meet the requirements for mandatory intervention under California Code of Civil Procedure section 387(d)(1)(b). The Judge rejected the Intervenors' argument that the County's representation of their interests is inadequate, finding that the County has a legitimate interest in defending the ordinance and that the Intervenors' interests are largely cumulative.

The Judge also found that the Intervenors have a direct and immediate interest in the action and that their intervention would not enlarge the issues in the litigation. The Judge granted the County's request for judicial notice of a County summary of the Ordinance and noted that the Intervenors will not be allowed to intervene in the case as a matter of right.

The Judge's ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and oral argument, and the parties may request a final ruling on the motion for leave to intervene.
