CASE:                         Barkat Ahmed v. Z&R Oil Corporation,
et al. 
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV18335            
 
MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

 
MOVING PARTY:               Attorney Paul T. Cullen, counsel for Plaintiff.
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 12/9/24
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a wage and hour and discrimination action that was filed on
August 2, 2023. Plaintiff alleges that he was consistently underpaid during his
employment as a gas station cashier, that the individual Defendant physically
attacked him when Plaintiff demanded his wages, and that the mistreatment was
based on Plaintiff’s race, ancestry, and national origin. 
 
Attorney Paul T. Cullen moves to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Paul T. Cullen moves to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. Although Moving Counsel served and filed a
motion (form MC-051) and supporting declaration (form MC-052), Moving Counsel
has not provided the Court with a proposed order (form MC-053). Moving
Counsel’s motion is therefore defective.
 
Accordingly, Attorney Paul T.
Cullen’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED. This ruling is without
prejudice to a procedurally proper motion. 
 
This ruling is conditioned on
Moving Counsel giving notice to all parties and filing proof of service with
the Court.

IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
