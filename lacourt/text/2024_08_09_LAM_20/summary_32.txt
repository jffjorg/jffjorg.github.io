And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default/Default Judgment. The Defendant, Stassia Stakis, is seeking to set aside the default and default judgment entered against her by the Court. The default was entered on May 10, 2024, and the default judgment was entered on July 3, 2024, in the amount of $60,067.61. The Defendant claims that she believed she did not need to file an answer and could instead appear at a July 2024 hearing, and that she only discovered the default judgment when her counsel, COUNTS LAW FIRM, PC, informed her on June 2024. The Judge has denied the Motion, finding that the Defendant's mistake was not excusable or reasonable. The Judge noted that the Defendant was aware of the default judgment as early as May 13, 2024, when her agent left a voicemail for Plaintiff's counsel, and that she was not diligent in filing the motion. The Judge also cited California case law that requires the moving party to demonstrate a satisfactory excuse for their default and diligence in seeking relief after discovery of the default.
