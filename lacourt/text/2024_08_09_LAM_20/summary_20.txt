```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for failure to state sufficient facts is sustained. The defendant, LA Gateway Partners, LLC, argued that the plaintiff's stop payment notice was invalid because it was directed at a public entity and a private developer, and that the remedy is governed exclusively by Civil Code section 9350, et. seq. The Court finds that the plaintiff has failed to clarify the basis for and propriety of the private stop notice, and that the FAC creates uncertainty as to how both a private and public stop notice can be issued for the same amount and for the same work. The Court grants the demurrer and gives the plaintiff 20 days leave to amend.
