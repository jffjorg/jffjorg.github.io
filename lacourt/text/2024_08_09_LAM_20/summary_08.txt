The judge has ruled that the defendants' condominium unit must be inspected again to determine the cause of the water leak and subsequent property damage. The initial inspection was incomplete, and the judge has ordered a second inspection to be conducted within 30 days. The judge has also declined to award sanctions to any party. The inspection will be the final one, and the judge has encouraged counsel to submit on the tentative ruling or appear remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
