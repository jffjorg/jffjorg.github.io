And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit between Plaintiff Aleksander Pkaksin and Defendants Joseph Grech, Charles Page, Alta Loma Homeowners Association (HOA), and Ross Morgan & Company, Inc. (RM). The dispute centers around a water leak that caused property damage and mold, as well as a loss of rental income. The defendants are seeking to compel an inspection of the condominium unit of the defendants, arguing that the first inspection was incomplete and that they have privacy concerns. The plaintiff and the HOA have illegally entered the unit numerous times, and one of the defendants has medical conditions that make it difficult for him to participate in the inspection.

The judge has decided to compel another property inspection within 30 days, as the first inspection was not completed and it is not apparent that any subsequent entries involved the expert, Gidon Vardi. This will be the final inspection. The judge declines to award sanctions and instructs the moving party to give notice. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, counsel are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person.
