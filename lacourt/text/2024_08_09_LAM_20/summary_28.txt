And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons, alleging that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant, Dana Roessler, claims that she does not have sufficient contacts with California to justify the court's exercise of jurisdiction. However, the plaintiff, Sable Connor, argues that there is specific jurisdiction due to Roessler's communications with Connor, who resides and works in California, and the fact that the alleged defamatory statements pertained to Connor's actions within California and resulted in a termination taking place in California. The judge finds that the plaintiff has met its burden of demonstrating facts by a preponderance of evidence justifying the exercise of jurisdiction in California, and that the court's exercise of specific jurisdiction is proper due to Roessler's purposeful availment of forum benefits and the controversy being related to her contacts with the forum.
