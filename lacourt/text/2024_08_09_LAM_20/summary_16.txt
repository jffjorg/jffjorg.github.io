And here is the English summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Stassia Stakis' Motion to Set Aside Default/Default Judgment. Stakis alleged that she mistakenly believed she did not need to file an answer and only retained counsel in June 2024, after a default judgment was entered. However, the court finds that Stakis' mistake was inexcusable, as she had an obligation to file a responsive pleading. Furthermore, Stakis' agent left a voicemail in May 2024, indicating that she was aware of the possibility of a default judgment, which raises questions about her credibility and diligence in filing the motion. The court concludes that the motion is denied, and Stakis must give notice.
