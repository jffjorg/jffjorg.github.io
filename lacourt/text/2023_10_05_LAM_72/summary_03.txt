And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses National Merchants Association, Inc.'s (NMA) motion to return jurisdiction to the Superior Court and stay proceedings regarding costs and fees. NMA argues that the judicial referee is no longer the appropriate forum for hearing and deciding issues in this dispute, as the factual and legal bases of the substantive dispute have shifted to the related case, Heather Altepeter v. Ash Patel, et al. However, the court finds that NMA provides no authority for such an assertion and that the issue of fees and costs appears to be encompassed within the Agreement and thus a subject for the judicial referee. The court notes that the referee would be the best person to resolve the issue of fees and costs as they are the most familiar with the issues of this case. As such, NMA's motion is denied, and the motion for attorney's fees and the motion to strike costs are taken off calendar as they are properly before the judicial referee and not this court.
