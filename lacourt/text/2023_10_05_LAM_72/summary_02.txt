The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for assignment order and restraining order is denied because the creditors did not identify the property they seek to assign, and a "blanket" assignment order is not permitted under California Code of Civil Procedure section 708.510. The judge also noted that the creditors did not state why they need a restraining order and failed to provide justification for it.
