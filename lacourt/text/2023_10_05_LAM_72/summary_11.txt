Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by Defendant Mirna Martinez to Plaintiff Alejandro Torres's unlawful detainer complaint. The demurrer was made on three grounds: (1) the complaint is not verified, (2) Plaintiff failed to comply with proper legal procedure to open an unlawful detainer case due to a failure to comply with the amended Covid-19 Tenant Protections Resolution, and (3) Plaintiff failed to comply with proper legal procedure to open an unlawful detainer case due to a failure to file a copy of the notice terminating tenancy with the Los Angeles Housing Department.

The judge finds that Defendant has failed to provide reasoned argument with citations to authority to support two of the grounds, and therefore those grounds are waived. The third ground, regarding the Los Angeles Municipal Code, is a valid argument that Plaintiff failed to address in their opposition.

The judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend, and orders Defendant to give notice.
