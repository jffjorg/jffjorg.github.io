```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for an order compelling the plaintiff to submit to an independent medical examination and their request for sanctions in the amount of $4,515.00. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff's mental and emotional health was at issue in the case, and therefore they were entitled to conduct an independent medical examination. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had specifically stated that no claim for mental and emotional distress was being made, and that no expert testimony would be presented at trial in support of a claim for damages. Additionally, the judge saw no showing of exceptional circumstances that would justify ordering the examination. As a result, the defendants' motion was denied, and they are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
