And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel Diana Paz to comply with a deposition subpoena. The defendants argue that Paz possesses valuable information that could determine material issues in the case and that she failed to comply with the subpoena. The plaintiff argues that the defendants failed to follow proper procedure and that the motion was filed too late. The judge agrees with the plaintiff and finds that the motion was filed untimely, citing CCP § 2025.480(b), which requires a motion to compel deposition attendance and document production to be filed no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition. The judge also finds that the defendants failed to provide any justification for waiting until July 21, 2023 to file the motion, and that the motion was filed after Paz had already failed to comply with the subpoena. The judge orders the defendants to give notice of the ruling.
