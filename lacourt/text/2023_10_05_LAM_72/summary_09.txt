```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the first and second causes of action in the Amended Cross-Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The judge found that the Amended Cross-Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because it does not allege that the landlord had any duty to negotiate an early termination of the lease or to assist the tenant in securing a replacement tenant. The judge also found that the Amended Cross-Complaint fails to address the conditions precedent for the landlord to have any obligation to consider a proposed subtenant or assignee. The judge granted the demurrer but gave the plaintiff 20 days to amend the pleading.
