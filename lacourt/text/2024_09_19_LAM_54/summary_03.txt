And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to strike. The defendants, Robert J. Barbera, Barbera Family Limited Partnership, Barbera Management, Inc., and Barbera Enterprises, LLC, have filed a demurrer to the complaint and a motion to strike certain causes of action. The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the fourth and fifth causes of action for conversion and trespass to chattels is OVERRULED. The judge has also ruled that the demurrer to the sixth and ninth causes of action for fraud and intentional misrepresentation is OVERRULED. Finally, the judge has ruled that the demurrer to the tenth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is OVERRULED.

The judge has also denied the motion to strike the prayers for punitive damages. The defendants have requested that the judge strike certain causes of action, but the judge has determined that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, thus allowing them to seek punitive damages.

The parties are ordered to file and serve answers to the complaint within 30 days of the ruling. The judge has also ordered the defendants to notice the plaintiffs of the ruling and the next steps in the case.
