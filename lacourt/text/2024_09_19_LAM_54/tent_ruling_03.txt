BACKGROUND
 
On June 27, 2024, Plaintiffs Joaquim
Teixeira and Sahar Moheize sued Defendants Robert J. Barbera, Barbera Family
Limited Partnership, Barbera Management, Inc., and Barbera Enterprises, LLC,
asserting causes of action for (1) breach of Civil Code § 1950.5; (2) breach of
the warranty of quiet enjoyment; (3) constructive eviction; (4) conversion; (5)
trespass to chattel; (6) fraud; (7) UCL violations; (8) breach of the covenant
of good faith and fair dealing; (9) intentional misrepresentation; (10)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; (11) negligence; (12) negligent
infliction of emotional distress; (13) breach of contract; (14) declaratory
relief; and (15) injunctive relief.
 
Plaintiffs, former tenants of a unit
owned by Defendants, allege the tenants in the neighboring unit shot at
Plaintiffs through their shared wall. Plaintiffs allege they immediately
vacated the unit, living in hotels and with friends for two months. Plaintiffs
allege that Defendants wrongfully withheld their security deposit, deducting
various “fees” for maintenance that was either not needed or not caused by
Plaintiffs. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A demurrer to a complaint may be taken to the whole complaint or to any
of the causes of action in it.  (CCP §
430.50(a).)  A demurrer challenges only
the legal sufficiency of the complaint, not the truth of its factual
allegations or the plaintiff's ability to prove those allegations.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High Sch. Dist. (1996)
50 Cal. App. 4th 726, 732.)  The court
must treat as true the complaint's material factual allegations, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.  (Id. at 732-33.)  The complaint is to be construed liberally to
determine whether a cause of action has been stated.  (Id. at 733.)
 
A. Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action for Conversion and
Trespass to Chattels
To plead a cause of action for conversion, one must allege (1) the
plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of personal property; (2)
defendant’s disposition of the property inconsistent with plaintiff’s rights;
and (3) resulting damages. (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.) “[T]respass to chattels ‘lies where an
intentional interference with the possession of personal property has
proximately caused injury.’” (Intel Corp. v. Hamidi (2003) 30 Cal.4th
1342, 1350-51 (quoting Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bezenek (1996) 46
Cal.App.4th 1559, 1566).)
 
Defendants assert the fourth and fifth causes of action fail because
real property cannot be converted and because the lease allows for deduction of
expenses from the security deposit to return the unit to the same condition as
when Plaintiffs moved into the unit. As stated, Plaintiffs allege Defendants
wrongfully deducted expenses for repairs of conditions that were present at the
time Plaintiffs moved in. This is sufficient to allege conversion of
Plaintiffs’ security deposit. 
 
The demurrer to the fourth and fifth causes of action is OVERRULED.
 
C. Sixth and Ninth Causes of Action for Fraud and
Intentional Misrepresentation
The elements of fraud are: “(a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) In California, fraud, including
negligent misrepresentation, must be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz
Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) “The particularity demands
that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)
Defendants demur to the sixth and ninth
causes of action on the ground Plaintiffs have failed to allege fraud with the
requisite specificity. Plaintiffs allege Defendants represented that an illegal
$300.00 “maintenance fee” would be the only fee deducted from their security
deposit. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants deducted additional fees and the
deducted fees were not used for the purposes stated by Defendants. This is
sufficient to allege intentional misrepresentation.
The demurrer to the sixth and ninth causes of
action is OVERRULED.
D. Tenth Cause of Action for Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress
The elements of an intentional
infliction of emotional distress cause of action are: (1) extreme and
outrageous conduct by the defendant; (2) intention to cause or reckless
disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress; (3) severe
emotional suffering; and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional
distress. (See Moncada v. West Coast Quartz Corp. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th
768, 780; Wilson v. Hynek (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 999, 1009.) To satisfy
the element of extreme and outrageous conduct, defendant’s conduct “‘must be so
extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized
society.’” (Moncada, supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at 780 (quoting Trerice
v. Blue Cross of California (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 878, 883).)
 
Defendants assert the tenth cause of
action fails because Plaintiffs have not alleged extreme and outrageous
conduct. Plaintiffs allege Defendants did not properly respond to their
complaints about the tenant who shot at them through the shared wall, required
Plaintiffs to pay rent despite having to move out over fear of their safety
from the other tenant, and misrepresented the nature of the deductions of their
security deposit. This is sufficient to allege intentional infliction of
emotional distress.
 
The demurrer to the tenth cause of
action is OVERRULED.
 
E. Motion to Strike
Any party, within the time allowed to
response to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part" of that pleading. (CCP § 435(b)(1).) “The Court may,
upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion,
and upon terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false or
improper matter asserted in any pleading; (b) Strike out all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the Court." (CCP § 436.)
Defendants move to strike Plaintiffs’ prayers
for punitive damages. As Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged fraud and
intentional infliction of emotional distress, Plaintiffs have sufficiently
alleged grounds for punitive damages.
The motion to strike is DENIED.
