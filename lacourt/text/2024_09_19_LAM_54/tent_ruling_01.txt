Hearing Date: September 19, 2024
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Stay Action
Moving Party: Defendants Joya Food Enterprises,
Inc., et al. 
Responding Party: Plaintiff Karina Lepe Tenorio
 
T/R:     DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY IS DENIED.
 
DEFENDANTS TO NOTICE. 
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please email the
courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply. 
 
“Trial courts generally have the inherent power to stay proceedings in
the interests of justice and to promote judicial efficiency.”  (Freiberg
v. City of Mission Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.) 
 
Defendants move to stay this action pending the California Supreme
Court’s review of Hohenshelt v.
Superior Court (2024) 99
Cal.App.5th 1319. Defendants assert the Supreme Court will determine if the FAA
preempts the CAA provisions allowing an employee to withdraw from arbitration
upon the employer’s failure to timely pay arbitration fees under CCP §§ 1281.97, 1281.98. 
 
On June 26, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to withdraw from
arbitration for Defendant’s failure to timely pay arbitration fees. Defendants
assert that a stay is now necessary to promote judicial efficiency and because participation
in litigation may waive Defendants’ right to arbitrate. 
 
The Court declines to impose a stay. A stay will delay discovery and
resolution of the disputes in this action, causing prejudice to Plaintiff. 
 
Defendants’ motion is DENIED.
