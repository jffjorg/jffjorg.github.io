And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrers filed by the defendants, Mellarius Medical LLC and Patrick J. Moraites, to the complaint filed by Success Import USA, Inc. The defendants argued that the plaintiff, a foreign corporation, cannot maintain an action in California because it has failed to comply with California law. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff has conducted substantial business in California, including registering with the California State Franchise Board, and has failed to pay state taxes and comply with state law. However, the court found that the plaintiff's sales of medical devices to the defendants in Florida were interstate commerce and did not constitute intrastate business in California. Therefore, the demurrers were overruled and the defendants are required to file and serve answers to the complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
