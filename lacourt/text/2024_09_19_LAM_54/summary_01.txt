And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to stay the action pending the California Supreme Court's review of Hohenshelt v. Superior Court (2024) 99 Cal.App.5th 1319. The defendants argued that a stay is necessary to promote judicial efficiency and to preserve their right to arbitrate, as participation in litigation may waive their right to arbitrate. However, the judge declined to impose a stay, finding that it would delay discovery and resolution of the disputes in the action, causing prejudice to the plaintiff. The judge also noted that the California Supreme Court's review of Hohenshelt v. Superior Court may take time, and a stay would only delay the resolution of the action.
