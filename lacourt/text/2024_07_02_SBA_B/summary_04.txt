And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a complaint filed by Rafael Ortega, individually and as successor in interest for Nadia Monique Ortega, against Del Amo Behavioral Health System. The complaint alleges medical malpractice and wrongful death, but the defendant argues that the cause of action is uncertain and fails to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 2.112. The court has sustained the demurrer, giving the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to separately allege each cause of action. The court notes that the plaintiff has not taken advantage of the demurrer to prepare a first amended complaint, and instead should have done so to clarify the claims being asserted. The court's decision will allow the parties to properly research the claims, conduct discovery, and propose jury instructions.
