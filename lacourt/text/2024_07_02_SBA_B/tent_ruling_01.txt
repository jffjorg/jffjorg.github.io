  Case Number:  21TRCV00786    Hearing Date:   July 2, 2024    Dept:  B MILESTONE EQUIPMENT COMPANY LLC, et al. vs NEXXGEN
ENTERPRISES, INC., et al.
Case No. 21TRCV00786
This matter is before the Court on an Order to Show Cause re
Entry of Default Judgment.  Plaintiff has
submitted materials to support the default judgment against the two remaining
defendants, Nexgen Enterprises, Inc (“Nexgen”) and 3 Ocelots, Incorporated (“3 Ocelots”).  The Court shall enter judgment as to
Defendant Nexgen and 3 Ocelots with certain additional corrections to the
proposed Judgment.
1.  The proposed judgment
needs to be revised to add the language from JUD-100:
Defendants were properly served
with a copy of the summons and complaint.
Defendants failed to answer the
complaint or appear and defend the action within the time allowed by law.
Defendants' defaults were entered
by the clerk upon plaintiff's application.
Assuming that the above is added to the Proposed judgment,
the Court shall enter judgment against Nexgen in all other respects as
requested in the Proposed Judgment lodged March 22, 2024.
The Court also finds that the attorneys fees requested,
while substantial, are reasonable given the totality of the facts surrounding
this case.
 
Plaintiff ordered to modify the Proposed Judgment as noted
and resubmit it within 10 days.
