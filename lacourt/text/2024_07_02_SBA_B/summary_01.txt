The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff, Milestone Equipment Company LLC, is seeking a default judgment against two remaining defendants, Nexgen Enterprises, Inc. and 3 Ocelots, Incorporated. The court has reviewed the materials submitted by the plaintiff and finds that the defendants failed to answer the complaint or appear and defend the action, resulting in their defaults being entered by the clerk. The court will enter a default judgment against Nexgen and 3 Ocelots, with certain corrections to the proposed judgment. The court also finds the attorneys fees requested by the plaintiff to be reasonable. The plaintiff is ordered to modify the proposed judgment as noted and resubmit it within 10 days.
