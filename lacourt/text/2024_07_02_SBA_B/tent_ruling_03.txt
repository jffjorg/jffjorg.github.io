BACKGROUND
On June 13, 2023, Lonnie Lee Gipson
and Betty Gipson, ind. and as guardian ad litem of Lonnie Lee Gipson, filed a
complaint against Torrance Care Center West, Inc. for (1) statutory elder
abuse/neglect, (2) violation of Patient’s Bill of Rights and Health and Safety
Codes, (3) negligence, and (4) unfair business practices.
On March 18, 2024, the court
sustained defendant’s demurrer to the first, second, and fourth causes of
action with lave to amend.  To date,
plaintiffs have not filed a FAC.  The court
granted plaintiffs’ counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            Pursuant to CCP § 2033.280(b), a
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  “Failure to timely respond to RFA does not
result in automatic admissions.  Rather,
the propounder of the RFA must ‘move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction’ under § 2023.010 et seq.”  Weil & Brown, Civ. Proc. Before Trial, ¶ 8:1370, citing CCP § 2033.280(b).  The court “shall” grant the motion to deem
RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  CCP §
2033.280(c).
DISCUSSION
            Defendant
Torrance Care Center West, Inc. requests that the Court deem admitted the truth
of the matters in defendant’s Requests for Admission, Set One, as against
plaintiffs.
            Defendant asserts that on December
11, 2023, defendant served plaintiffs with written discovery.  Responses were due by January 15, 2024.  Subsequent thereto, defendant extended the
time for plaintiffs to provide responses on three separate occasions, with the
last extension granted on January 30, 2024, with a due date of April 15,
2024.  On May 14, 2024, defense counsel
attempted to contact Betty Gipson by phone and sent a meet and confer letter by
email and registered letter, offering to provide an extension to May 22,
2024.  After receiving no response,
defense counsel attempted to meet and confer and left a voice mail
message.  To date, defense counsel has
not received responses.
            There is no opposition. 
            The Court finds that defendant
properly served written discovery and plaintiffs failed to timely serve
responses.
            Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
            Sanctions
Under CCP
§ 2023.030(a), “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is
authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose that sanction
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  Under CCP § 2023.010, an
example of the misuse of the discovery process is “(d) Failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction on the party or attorney
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
a motion to deem them admitted. CCP § 2033.280(c). 
Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a) states: 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a
party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the
motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”
            Defendant
requests $1,060 in sanctions against plaintiffs.  The Court finds that $490 ($215/hr. x 2 hrs.,
filing fee) is a reasonable amount to be imposed against plaintiffs.
ORDER
The motion is GRANTED.
The Court orders that the truth of
any matters specified in defendant’s requests for admission be deemed admitted.
The Court orders that plaintiffs
pay a monetary sanction to defendant in the amount of $490 within 30 days.
Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
