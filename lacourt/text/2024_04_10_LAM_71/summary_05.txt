And here is the English-text summary:

The Court notes that the Plaintiff owes the Court $660.00 in fees. Each motion to compel requires a separate filing and fee, which is $60.00 per motion. The Plaintiff has already paid one $60.00 filing fee, but owes 11 additional filing fees for the instant motion. The Court's ruling on the motion to compel will not be effective until the Plaintiff pays the outstanding fees. Additionally, the Court points out that the Plaintiff cited the wrong statute in support of their motion, and notes that the proper statute for a motion to compel is C.C.P. §2030.290.
