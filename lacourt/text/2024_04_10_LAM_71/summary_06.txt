And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the case and has made a tentative ruling. The Plaintiff, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK N.A., has obtained a default against the Defendant, EWANDA JACKSON. However, the Court has denied the Plaintiff's request for a default judgment. The Court has also denied the Plaintiff's default judgment packet. The Court has set a hearing on May 14, 2024, to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the Plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned $250 for failing to enter a default judgment. The Court has made these decisions because the Plaintiff failed to submit a Proposed Judgment Form (JUD-100) and a Request for Court Judgment on the mandatory Judicial Council form CIV-100, and also failed to submit a declaration signed under penalty of perjury to support the damages claimed.
