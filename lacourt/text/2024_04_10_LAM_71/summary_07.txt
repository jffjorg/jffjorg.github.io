This tentative ruling by the Judge addresses the demurrer to the Complaint and the motion to strike the Complaint filed by the Defendant, Elias Khoury. The Plaintiff, Don Barden, had filed an initial Complaint on February 5, 2024, and then an operative First Amended Complaint on March 14, 2024. Since the operative First Amended Complaint was filed more than nine court days before the hearing, the Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint is overruled as moot, and the motion to strike the Complaint is denied as moot. The Judge orders the Defendant to give notice.
