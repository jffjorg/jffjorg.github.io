          Plaintiff 15907
Valley Vista LLC (“15907”) (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel Defendants Home Run
Builders Inc. (“HRB”), Valley Vista 18 Project LLC (“Valley Vista 18”), Shachar
Shabtay (“Shabtay”), Anette Sharvit (“Anette”), Shachar Sharvit (“Shachar”),
and Asaf Asi Azami (“Azami”) (collectively, “Defendants”) to provide responses to Interrogatories (“IROG”)
and Requests for Production (“RFP”) as required by the Case Management Order
(“CMO”) entered on or about July 28, 2023. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 2.) 
Plaintiff also requests an award of sanctions against Defendants in the
amount of $4,200.00.  (Notice of Motion,
pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2030.300, 2031.300.)[1], [2]
 
1.    
Motion to Compel- IROG
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses from Defendants
to Plaintiff’s IROG, the Court rules as follows.
          On July 20, 2023, the
initial Case Management Conference (“CMC”) in this action took place, wherein
Plaintiff submitted a CMO, which was approved by this Court and entered as an
order on July 28, 2023.  (Decl. of Lord
¶4, Exh. A.)  Section IV (D) of the CMO
requires the Defendants to respond to IROG within thirty-five days of the date
of service of the CMO.  (Decl. of Lord
¶7, Exh. A at Exh. C.)  Plaintiff argues
Defendants have failed to respond.  Plaintiff
now moves to compel responses.  
          Plaintiff’s motion to
compel responses is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2030.290(b) as to all
Defendants except Valley Vista 18, as Valley Vista provided responses to
Plaintiff’s interrogatories, and any such motion to compel against it is denied
as moot.  (See Decl. of Windisch ¶5,
Exh. B.)  Defendants HRB, Shabtay, Anette,
Shachar, and Azami are ordered to provide verified
responses to Plaintiff’s IROG compliant with C.C.P. §§2030.210(a) and 2030.220 without
objections within 20 days.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions totaling $4,200.00 against Defendants. 
          The
Court denies Plaintiff’s request
for sanctions on the basis sanctions have not been properly noticed in
Plaintiff’s notice of motion as to each Defendant.

Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling. 
 

2.     Motion to
Compel- RFP
Having reviewed Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to RFPs, the
Court rules as follows.
          On July 20, 2023, the
initial Case Management Conference (“CMC”) in this action took place, wherein
Plaintiff submitted a CMO, which was approved by this Court and entered as an
order on July 28, 2023.  (Decl. of Lord
¶4, Exh. A.)  Section IV of the CMO
requires each party to respond to a request for production of documents.  Section IV(C) requires the “Contractor and
Seller/Contractor-Related Individuals” to produce documents listed in Exhibit A
of the CMO (Page 15) within thirty-five days of service of the CMO.  Documents include, inter alia, insurance
policies, sales documents, contracts, drawings and specifications, photographs
and videos, purchase orders, invoices, costs reports including internal cost reports,
receipts, accounting records, and inspection records. At the time of documents
production, Defendants were required by the CMO to issue a verified notice of
compliance, a privilege list, and a “Notice of Plans and Specifications”
identifying each different set of plans or specifications in its possession. Plaintiff
argues that to date Defendants have failed to supply any response to the
document production requirements of Section IV (C) of the CMO.  Plaintiff now moves to compel responses.
          Plaintiff’s motion to
compel RFPs is granted pursuant to C.C.P. §2031.300 as to all Defendants except
Valley Vista 18, as Valley Vista provided responses to Plaintiff’s
interrogatories, and any such motion to compel against it is denied as
moot.  (See Decl. of Windisch ¶6,
Exh. C.)  Defendants HRB, Shabtay, Anette,
Shachar, and Azami are ordered to provide verified
responses to Plaintiff’s RFP pursuant
to C.C.P. §2031.210 and to produce the documents, electronically stored
information, and/or other things requested without objections within 20 days of
this ruling.
Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions totaling $4,200.00 against Defendants. 
          The Court denies
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions on the basis sanctions have not been properly
noticed in Plaintiff’s notice of motion as to each Defendant.
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
