 Case No.:

 Hearing Date:  April 10, 2024



 
Defendant
Florentino C. Apeles’ motion for
attorneys’ fees is granted in the total amount of $31,210.00.
 
Defendant Florentino C. Apeles (“Apeles”)
(“Defendant”) moves for an order awarding him attorneys’ fees in the amount of
$31,210.00 against Plaintiff
National Robertson Carwash Care, Inc. (“Carwash Care”) (“Plaintiff”) as the
prevailing party in the instant case.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; Civ.
Code §1717.)
 
Background
On May 13, 2022, Plaintiff
filed its complaint against Defendant in the instant action.  On August 30, 2022, Plaintiff filed its first
amended complaint (“FAC”).  On March 15,
2023, this Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st through 8th
causes of action in its FAC with 20 days leave to amend.  (3/15/23 Minute Order.)
On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff its
second amended complaint (“SAC”).  On
October 5, 2023, this Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to all causes of
action with 20 days leave to amend.
On October 25, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint (“TAC”), alleging eight causes of
action: (1) intentional interference with contractual relationship, (2) intentional
interference with prospective economic advantage, (3) negligent interference
with prospective economic advantage, (4) breach of contract, (5) breach of good
faith and fair dealing, (6) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, (7)
constructive eviction, and (8) declaratory relief arising from alleged
Defendant landlord and Plaintiff tenant’s car wash lease agreement for the car
wash portion of real property at 3071 S. Robertson Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90034
(“Subject Property”).   (See TAC.)   
On January 30, 2024, this
Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s TAC without leave to amend.  On February 15, 2024, this Court entered Judgment
in favor of Defendant.
On
February 20, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  Plaintiff filed its opposition on March 28,
2024.  Defendant filed his reply on April
4, 2024.
Plaintiff’s
argument that this Court should delay ruling on the instant motion until after
its motion for reconsideration is heard is unavailing and unsupported by case
law.
 
Discussion
Civil Code §1717(a) provides, in part:
In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce the contract, shall be
awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party
who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she
is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.
 
(Civ. Code §1717(a).)
A party who obtains an “unqualified
victory” on a contract dispute is considered the prevailing party for purposes
of Civil Code §1717 as a matter of law.  (Hsu v. Abbara (1995) 9 Cal.4th 863,
876-877.)  Additionally, the phrase
“prevailing party” is understood to include “[t]he party with a net monetary
recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where
neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against
those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.”  (C.C.P. §1032(a)(4).)
To determine whether an action is “on a
contract,” as that phrase is used in California’s statute providing for an
award of prevailing party attorney fees “[i]n an action on a contract,” courts
look to the complaint and focus on the basis of the causes of action alleged therein;
any cause of action that is based on a contract is an action on that contract,
regardless of the relief sought.  (See
Yoon v. Cam IX Trust (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th 388, 392-393.)
Here, Paragraph 15 of the Lease
Agreement provides, “In the event a party to this agreement incurs legal fees
and/or costs associated with the enforcement of this Lease, whether by lawsuit
or by arbitration, the prevailing party shall be entitled to a recovery of such
fees and costs.”  (Decl. of Nussbaum ¶3, Exh.1.)
Plaintiff’s TAC is allegedly based on
an oral contract.  Plaintiff intended to
embrace the terms of the Lease Agreement and sought to enforce its terms as to Defendant
in connection with Plaintiff’ allegation that Defendant had failed to comply
with the terms contained therein, permitting Plaintiff to recover those
monetary damages Plaintiff claimed resulted from Defendant’s alleged breach of
the terms of the Lease Agreement. This necessarily brings Plaintiff’s
allegations within the scope of an action based upon a contract and permits Defendant
to recover those attorneys’ fees necessarily incurred in defending this action.  (See Brown Bark III, L.P. v. Haver
(2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 809, 819 [“Section 1717 allows a party who defeats a
contract claim by showing the contract did not apply or was unenforceable to
nonetheless recover attorney fees under that contract if the opposing party
would have been entitled to attorney fees had it prevailed.”].)
This Court sustained Defendant’s
demurrer to the TAC without leave to amend.  Therefore, Defendant is the undisputed
prevailing party in this action and is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees.
 
Reasonable
Fees
To calculate
a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by Defendant’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California has
concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for
private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1133, emphasis added.)
Defendant’s
Counsel declares the following hourly rates for attorneys who worked on this
case: (1) Lane M. Nussbaum ($450.00/hour); (2) Wayne M. Abb ($450.00/hour); (3)
Jason Stillman ($450.00/hour); (4) Richard J. Uss ($450.00/hour); and (5) Caroline
Gill ($350.00/hour).  (Decl. of Nussbaum
¶17, Exh. 4; Decl. of Abb ¶6; Decl. of Stillman ¶7; Decl. of Uss ¶9.)  Defendant has sufficiently demonstrated his
counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of practice in their
specialized area of law.  (Decl. of Nussbaum
¶17, Exh. 4; Decl. of Abb ¶6; Decl. of Stillman ¶7; Decl. of Uss ¶9.)
Plaintiff challenges
Defendant’s counsel’s hourly rates as grossly inflated and unreasonable.  However, Plaintiff failed to meet its burden
to challenge Defendant’s counsel’s fees because it failed to point to the
specific items challenged with a sufficient argument and citations to the
evidence.  (Premier Medical
Management Systems, Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association (2008) 163
Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)  General arguments
that fees are “excessive, duplicative, or unrelated” are insufficient.  (Id.)
 
Billed
Hours
The party
seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were
allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
In this
case, the declarations and billing records provided by Defendant’s counsel are
sufficient to meet the burden of proving the reasonableness of the claimed fees
in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy this burden, evidence and
descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling
the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys
spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
Defendant’s
fee recovery is based on 69.6 hours Defendant’s counsel spent to defend
Defendant in this matter over the course of two years.  (Decl. of Nussbaum ¶¶24.)  The fees incurred are reasonable, as captured
in the billing records submitted to this Court. 
(Decl. of Nussbaum ¶22, Exhs. 4-8.) 
Defendant’s counsel’s billing records reflect the actual time and clear
descriptions of services performed in connection with litigating this
case.  (Decl. of Nussbaum ¶22, Exhs. 4-8.)  Although the submission of such detailed time
records is not necessary under California law, if submitted, such records “are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”  (Horsford v. Board of
Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)
Plaintiff
argues Defendant’s counsel’s work was duplicative and prepared by three senior
attorneys, and Defendant’s counsel attempts to recover fees for work that was
never done.  (Opposition, pg. 6.)  Defendant specifically objects to 12.1 hours
billed in September 2022 to prepare motions to compel discovery that were
ultimately withdrawn because responses were ultimately provided (Plaintiff argues
that the responses were “timely served,” but the motions were made because
responses had not been timely served). 
(Opposition, pg. 6; Decl. of Zadeh ¶10, Exh. 16; and see, e.g., Apelles’
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted, Declaration
of Richard J. Uss, ¶ 4 filed November 9, 2022, and Motion to Compel Responses
to Form Interrogatories, Declaration of Richard J. Uss, ¶ 5 filed November 9,
2022.)  Plaintiff does not cite to
authority stating Defendant is not entitled to recover these fees.  (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 410-411; see
also Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch., 8F-7 [8:1136], Motion to
Compel Answers [“The motion to compel may be heard even if tardy responses are
served after the motion is filed. Unless the propounding party takes the matter
off calendar, the court may determine whether the responses are legally
sufficient and award sanctions for the failure to respond on time.”].)
Accordingly,
Defendant’s billed hours were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation and were reasonable in amount.
 
Conclusion
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion
for attorneys’ fees is granted in the total amount of $31,210.00.  
Moving Party to give notice.
