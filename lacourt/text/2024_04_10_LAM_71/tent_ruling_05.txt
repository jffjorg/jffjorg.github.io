[1] The Court notes Plaintiff owes this Court $660.00 in
fees. Each motion to compel must be separately filed for each defendant and
each type of document Plaintiff seeks to compel from the individual defendant.
Here, there are six defendants and two discovery documents (IROGS, RFP) that
Plaintiff seeks to compel. The filing fee for each motion is $60.00 per motion.
Plaintiff has already paid one $60.00 filing fee for the instant motion. As
such, Plaintiff owes 11 additional filing fees. (6 filing fees for IROGS + 5
filing fees for RFPs = 11 filings.) 11 filing fees x $60 = $660.00.  The Court’s ruling on the instant motions is
not effective until the filing fees Plaintiff owes to this Court are paid.
 


[2] The Court notes Plaintiff’s motion is for a motion to
compel, yet one of the statutes cited in support of Plaintiff’s motion is for a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories. (C.C.P. §2030.300.) The
proper statute for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories is C.C.P. §2030.290.
