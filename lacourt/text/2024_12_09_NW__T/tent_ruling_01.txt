  Case Number:  21STCV30186    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  T 21STCV30186 McLellan v Temple City
The plaintiff filed a motion to bifurcate which is, in reality, a motion to sever the cross-complaints from the complaint so that plaintiff’s case can proceed to trial and not be held up by discovery pending between others for indemnity and contribution.
The court grants the motion.  The complaint has been pending since August 2021.  But for the fact that it had been in the PI Hub, this case would have gone to trial over 2 years ago had the case initially been assigned to an I/C court.
In fairness to plaintiff, the trial should be allowed to go forward.  The interests of justice compel allowing separate trials.
In furtherance of this, the court would grant the motion to continue the trial as to the severed cross-complaints and will discuss this at the hearing at which time a new trial date and FSC date will be assigned.
