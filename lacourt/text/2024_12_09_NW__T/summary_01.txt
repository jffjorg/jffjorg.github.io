And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion to bifurcate, which is a request to separate the cross-complaints from the main complaint, allowing the main case to move forward to trial without being delayed by pending discovery issues between other parties. The case has been pending since August 2021 and would have gone to trial 2 years ago if it had been initially assigned to an I/C court. The judge believes that it is fair to allow the main case to proceed to trial, and that the interests of justice require separate trials. The judge will discuss the new trial date and FSC date at the upcoming hearing.
