SUMMARY OF ACTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiffs Setareh Radbod and
David Mat’s (Plaintiffs) purchase of a new 2021 Honda Odyssey (the
Vehicle).  On 5/26/23, Plaintiffs filed
this action against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Defendant) for:
(1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty and (2)
Fraudulent Inducement - Concealment.  
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the issues
Defendant had with the complaint, on 7/5/23, Defendant filed and served the
instant demurrer to the 2nd cause of action for fraudulent
inducement - concealment and motion to strike seeking an order striking
Plaintiffs’ prayer for punitive damages at page 27, line 10 of the
complaint.  (See Lacour
Decl.).  Plaintiffs have opposed the
demurrer and motion to strike and Defendant has filed replies to the
oppositions.
 
ANALYSIS 

 
Plaintiffs’ Request for Judicial Notice is granted.
 
A demurrer may be based on the ground that the complaint
fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  CCP 430.10(e).  A demurrer admits the truth of all properly
pleaded facts regardless of how unlikely or improbable they may be.  See Aubry (1992) 2 C4th 962,
966-967; Del E. Webb Corp. (1981) 123 CA3d 593, 604.  Allegations in a complaint must be liberally
construed with a view toward substantial justice between the parties.  CCP 452. 

Plaintiffs’ fraudulent inducement – concealment cause of
action is based on the claim that Defendant “and its agents concealed the
existence and nature of the Honda Sensing Defect from Plaintiff at the time of
purchase, repair and thereafter.” 
(Complaint ¶71; See also Complaint ¶¶109-111).
 
The elements of a fraudulent concealment cause of action
are: (1) concealment or suppression of a material fact, (2) a duty to disclose
the fact to the plaintiff, (3) intentional concealment or suppression of the
fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) that the plaintiff was
unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he/she did if he/she had known
of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or
suppression of the fact, the plaintiffs sustained damage.  Boschma (2011) 198 CA4th 230, 248; See
also Civil Code 1709, 1710. 
Additionally, every element of a fraud cause of action must be alleged
with factual specificity.  Stansfield
(1990) 220 CA3d 59, 73-74.  When pleading
fraud against a corporation, a plaintiff must allege the names of the persons
who made the misrepresentations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke,
what they said or wrote and when it was said or written.  Tarmann (1991) 2 CA4th 153, 157.
 
Here, Plaintiffs have not alleged facts showing that Defendant definitively knew about the purportedly
concealed information such that Defendant could have intentionally concealed or
suppressed it.  (See Complaint
¶¶23, 44 whereat Plaintiff alleges that Defendant “knew or should have known”
about defect and hazard posed thereby and Defendant “undoubtedly review[s]
NHTSA consumer complaints” which would have purportedly made Defendant aware of
the defect).

 
An omission is only actionable if the omitted fact is:
(1) contrary to a material representation made by the defendant or (2) a fact
the defendant was obligated to disclose. 
Gutierrez (2018) 19 CA5th 1234; Daugherty (2006) 144 CA4th
824, 835.  The complaint fails to
establish that Defendant omitted a material fact regarding the alleged defect,
the Honda Sensing Defect, that was contrary to a material representation made
to Plaintiffs, by Defendant or a dealership. 
(See Complaint ¶¶86-88).
  
A duty/obligation to disclose arises in four
circumstances: (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts.  LiMandri (1997) 52 CA4th 326, 336; Heliotis
(1986) 181 CA3d 646, 651.  
 
A transaction giving rise to a duty to disclose must
arise from direct dealings between the plaintiff and the defendant not between
the defendant and the public at large.  Bigler-Engler
(2017) 7 CA5th 276, 312.  Therefore, any
claim that Defendant had a duty to disclose based on its marketing brochures
and general advertising fails.  
 
With regard to the first circumstance, the complaint does
not allege that a fiduciary relationship existed between Plaintiffs and
Defendant, nor could it, based on the relationship between the parties.  See De Spirito (1957) 151 CA2d
126, 130 (Generally, a vendor that is not in a confidential relationship to the
buyer is not under a duty to make full disclosure regarding the object it would
sell.).
 
With regard to the second, third and fourth circumstances,
the complaint fails to allege facts to support a finding that Defendant had
exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to Plaintiffs, that Defendant actively
concealed a material fact or that Defendant made partial representations to
Plaintiffs while suppressing material facts. 

 
With regard to Defendant’s exclusive knowledge, Plaintiff
has alleged facts indicating that information regarding the alleged defect were
publicly available through a National Transportation Safety Board report, news
stories, complaints to the National Highway Transportation Safety Association
(NHTSA), and Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) before Plaintiffs’ purchase of
the Vehicle.  (See Complaint ¶¶29-64).  Additionally, the sources which Plaintiffs
contend gave Defendant “exclusive knowledge” of a defect do not include
complaints to NHTSA or a TSB referencing a 2021 Honda Odyssey.  Even if a TSB had been issued regarding the
purported defect at issue in this case, such cannot automatically be construed
as an admission of a design or other defect. 
See American Honda Motor Co. (2011) 199 CA4th 1367,
1378.  
 
Plaintiffs’ reliance on Falk (N.D. Cal. 2007) 496
F.Supp.2d 1088, 1096-97 for the proposition Defendant had exclusive knowledge
of the alleged defect is misplaced for several reasons.  First, Falk was a federal putative Consumer
Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) class action dealing with defective speedometers.  Second, the decision predates the public availability
of the NHTSA database for TSBs as required by law in 2012.  Third, multiple federal cases have declined
to follow Falk.  See Grodzitsky
2013 WL 690822, at *7; Eisen 2012 WL 841019, at *3; Cheng 2013 WL
12133886, at *4 (finding that Falk pre-dates the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Wilson
(9th Cir. 2012) 668 F.3d 1136, 1147 which discussed and declined to follow Falk);
Morgan 2009 WL 2031765, at *5; Williams (C.D. Cal. 2015) 106
F.Supp.3d 1101, 1114.  Similarly, Plaintiffs’
reliance on In re Toyota Motor Corp. Unintended Acceleration Marketing,
Sales Practices, & Products Liability Litigation (C.D. Cal. 2010) 754
F.Supp.2d 1145, 1174, 1192, is misplaced as it is another class action with
CLRA claims.   
 
With regard to active concealment and partial
representations while suppressing material facts, as noted above, Plaintiffs have
failed to establish that Defendant definitively knew about the purportedly
concealed information such that Defendant could have actively/intentionally
concealed or suppressed it.  (See
Complaint ¶¶23, 44).  
 
Plaintiffs have also failed to allege sufficient facts to
establish that their fraudulent inducement – concealment claim is not barred by
the “economic loss rule.”  “[T]he
economic loss rule allows a plaintiff to recover in strict products liability
in tort when a product defect causes damage to ‘other property,’ that is,
property other than the product itself. 
The law of contractual warranty governs damage to the product
itself.”  Robinson Helicopter Co.,
Inc. (2004) 34 C4th 979, 989 citing Jimenez (2002) 29 C4th 473, 482-483.  A narrow exception to the “economic loss
rule” exists where “a defendant’s affirmative misrepresentations on which a
plaintiff relies and which expose a plaintiff to liability for personal damages
independent of the Plaintiffs’ economic loss.” 
Robinson Helicopter, supra at 993; In re Ford Motor Co.
(C.D. Cal. 2020) 483 F.Supp.3d 838, 848. 
Here, the fraud claim is based on purported concealment, not affirmative
misrepresentations and seeks recovery for economic loss associated only with
the Vehicle.  Therefore, the claim is
barred by the “economic loss rule.”  See
Mosqueda (C.D. Cal. 2020) 443 F.Supp.3d 1115, 1134.
 
Plaintiffs have failed to cite adequate binding authority
to support their position.  Plaintiffs
rely heavily on Dhital (2022) 84 CA5th 828 which is not binding as a
petition for review has been granted.  See
CRC 8.1115(e)(1).
 
The opposition to the motion to strike concedes that the
punitive damage claim is based on the fraudulent inducement – concealment cause
of action.  Since that cause of action
fails, so does the related prayer for punitive damages.   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained and the motion to strike is
granted, both with 30 days leave to amend. 
Due to the liberal policy of allowing leave to amend and since this is
only the original complaint, Plaintiffs are given the opportunity to try to
cure the defects in their pleading.
