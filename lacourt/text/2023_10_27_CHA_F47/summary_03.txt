Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. against Plaintiffs Setareh Radbod and David Mat. The demurrer is to the 2nd cause of action, fraudulent inducement - concealment, and the motion to strike seeks to strike the prayer for punitive damages. The Judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the complaint fails to plead fraud with sufficient specificity and that the Defendant did not have a duty to disclose information about the Honda Sensing Defect. The Judge has also granted the motion to strike, finding that the punitive damage claim is based on the fraudulent inducement - concealment cause of action, which fails. The Judge has given the Plaintiffs 30 days leave to amend their complaint.
