 Case Number:  21STCV09808    Hearing Date:   March 19, 2024    Dept:  31 SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA  FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES - CENTRAL DISTRICT  DWAYNE FLOWERS, Plaintiff(s),¿¿ vs.¿ ¿JASMINE WEBB, ET AL.,¿  Defendant(s). ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )       CASE NO: 21STCV09808  [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING UNOPPOSED MOTION TO COMPEL  Dept. 31 1:30 p.m.  March 19, 2024  I.  MOTION TO COMPEL Defendant Jasmine Webb ("Defendant”) form interrogatories, set one, on plaintiff Dwayne Flowers (“Plaintiff”) on May 2, 2023. After receiving no response, defense counsel sent a meet and confer correspondence to Plaintiff’s counsel requesting responses on or before August 15, 2023. To date, Plaintiff has failed to serve responses. Defendant therefore seeks an order compelling Plaintiff to respond, without objections, to the outstanding discovery and to pay sanctions.  Any opposition was due on or before March 6, 2024; the motion is unopposed. For a motion to compel initial discovery responses, all a propounding party must show is that it properly served its discovery requests, that the time to respond has expired, and that the party to whom the requests were directed failed to provide a timely response. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 906.) Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290; 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); § 2031.300, subd. (a).)    Therefore, because the evidence shows Plaintiff was properly served with discovery and failed to timely respond, any objections have been waived. Defendant’s unopposed motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendant’s form interrogatories, set one, without objections, within twenty (20) days. (CCP § 2030.290(a),(b).)  II. SANCTIONS Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response, unless a court makes certain findings.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).)¿ Plaintiff did not file any opposition. However, sanctions may be awarded, even though no opposition was filed, pursuant to CRC 3.1348(a). Defendant seeks $810 in sanctions per motion against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel. The Court notes that it granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel on March 14, 2024, which will be final upon proof of service of the final order. Because there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship between Plaintiff and his counsel, the Court will not grant sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel. Sanctions will be imposed against Plaintiff only.  A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.)  Defendant is awarded $250 for the motion and one motion filing fee of $60 as costs.      Sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff. Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $310, within twenty (20) days.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 18th day of March 2024      Hon.
