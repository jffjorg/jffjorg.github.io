And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to strike and withdraw the Answer filed by defendants Susana Sampedro and Roberto Gomez is GRANTED. This is because the Answer was filed by Counsel, Peter J. Gates, without the authority of Sampedro and Gomez. Counsel had inadvertently filed the Answer on their behalf. The judge is unclear whether Counsel seeks to strike only the incorrect names on the Answer or to strike the Answer in its entirety and file a new Answer on behalf of only the correct defendants. The judge has ordered Counsel to clarify this at the hearing. If Counsel seeks to strike only the incorrect names, the names of Sampedro and Gomez will be stricken from the Answer. If Counsel seeks to withdraw the Answer as a whole, the judge will strike the Answer and order Counsel to file a new Answer on behalf of the defendants they represent within 10 days.
