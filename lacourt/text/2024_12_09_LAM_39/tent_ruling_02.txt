MOTION
Plaintiff Brendan
Schultz (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel further responses from Defendant Pitzer
College (“Defendant”) to Requests for Production of Documents, set two (“RPD”).  Plaintiff failed to file proof of service of
the motion on Defendant.  As Defendant
has not opposed the motion, the Court cannot determine if Defendant received
notice.  Accordingly, the motion is
denied.  
On October 24,
2024, Plaintiff was served with a notice of ruling in which the Court indicated
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s first amended complaint was sustained with
leave to amend, and Plaintiff was given 10 days to do so.  Plaintiff has not filed and served a further
amended complaint.  Therefore, pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2), the Court sets an
order to show cause for hearing on January 27, 2025 why the Court should not
dismiss this action for Plaintiff’s failure to amend the operative first
amended complaint.
