And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses from Pitzer College, the Defendant. The motion was filed by Brendan Schultz, the Plaintiff, on October 24, 2024, but the Plaintiff failed to file proof of service of the motion on the Defendant. Since the Defendant did not oppose the motion, the Judge cannot determine if the Defendant received notice. Therefore, the motion is denied. Additionally, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff has not filed and served a further amended complaint, despite being given the opportunity to do so after the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's first amended complaint was sustained with leave to amend. As a result, the Judge sets an order to show cause for a hearing on January 27, 2025, to determine why the action should not be dismissed for the Plaintiff's failure to amend the operative first amended complaint.
