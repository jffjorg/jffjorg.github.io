And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion to quash a subpoena served by the defendant on the Kohan International Foundation. The subpoena seeks medical and psychotherapy records from 2014 to present related to the physical, mental, and emotional injuries sustained by the plaintiff, Ivet Eliasi, during her tenancy. The judge has determined that the subpoena is proper and that the foundation can ascertain which documents satisfy the categories of documents sought. However, the judge has clarified that the defendant is only entitled to records related to the injuries sustained by Eliasi. The judge has also rejected the plaintiff's arguments that the spousal privilege applies to the documents sought and that the subpoena violates the privacy rights of third parties. The motion to quash is therefore denied.
