Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for a writ of attachment in the amount of $269,610.04. The Judge found that the Plaintiff has not established the probable validity of its claim, and the amount that the Plaintiff may recover is not readily ascertainable due to Defendant Carbon Fit's cross-complaint alleging that the Plaintiff also breached the lease. Additionally, the Judge ruled that no writ of attachment may be issued for individual Defendants Brittany Walsh and Matthew Walsh, as the claim is not based on the conduct of a trade, business, or profession. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff's claim is not supported by the declarations provided, and that the lease agreement does not meet the legal requirements for a writ of attachment.
