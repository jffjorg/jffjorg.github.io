And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further discovery responses filed by the plaintiff, Sherry Goldsmith. The plaintiff is seeking further discovery responses from the defendants, including Electropath, Valentine Goelz, Mark Goelz, Roy & Val Tool Grinding, Inc., and Jan Mason. The defendants have opposed the plaintiff's motions, claiming that the plaintiff's meet and confer letter was inadequate and that the plaintiff is seeking to have the defendants change their answers to ones more favorable to the plaintiff.

The judge has ordered the parties to conduct a meaningful meet and confer prior to an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC). The parties are required to file a joint statement of remaining issues prior to the IDC, which should briefly describe the matters in dispute, followed by the plaintiff's arguments and then the defendants' arguments.

The judge has also ordered the parties to conduct a meaningful meet and confer at least 10 court days prior to the IDC and to submit a joint statement of remaining issues at least 3 court days prior to the IDC. The format for the joint statement is specified in the ruling. The date for the IDC will be set at the hearing on these motions.
