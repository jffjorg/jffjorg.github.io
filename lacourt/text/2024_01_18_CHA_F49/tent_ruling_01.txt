SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On September 15, 2019, Plaintiff Mukhdir, LLC
(Plaintiff) entered into a commercial lease with Defendant Carbon Fit Lab, LLC
(Carbon Fit). Individual Defendants Matthew Walsh and Brittany Walsh
(collectively Defendants) served as guarantors of Carbon Fit’s obligations
under the lease. 
 
Subject
to the lease and corresponding guaranty, Defendants agreed to pay base rent
subject to annual increases, plus common area operating expenses, for a term of
five years. Shortly after the term of the lease began, Defendants stopped
paying rent, common area operating expenses, or any other rental obligations,
and left the Premises in an unleasable condition. Plaintiff was forced to make
extensive repairs and employ a broker to re-let the Premises.
 
Defendants
agreed to a starting rent of $1,597.05 subject to annual increases. On March 1,
2021, the rent was to increase to $1,715.35; $1,833.65 on March 1, 2022;
$1,951.95 on March 1, 2023; and $2,070.25 on March 1, 2014. The Common Area
Maintenance (CAM) fees were $414.05 per month. Late payments included a
one-time late charge equal to 10% of each overdue amount of $100, or whichever
is greater.
 
Defendants
were supposed begin operating out of the Premises on March 1, 2020. Defendants
failed to pay their monthly rental obligation or CAM fees beginning May 2020. Defendants
also failed to get their Minor Use Permit (MUP) in a timely manner, as required
by the lease.
 
The
total amount of damages that Plaintiff alleges that Defendants owe for unpaid
rent, CAM fees, late charges, and interest is $155,989.05. (Pasha Decl., ¶ 16.)
At the time of filing of the writ of attachment, Plaintiff had incurred
$47,325.91 in attorney fees, and Plaintiff expects to incur an additional
$66,295.00 in future litigation expenses. (Pasha Decl., ¶ 18.) In total,
Plaintiff seek an attachment of $269,610.04, inclusive of damages, interest,
and incurred and future litigation expenses.
 
On
November 4, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint for breach of lease and breach of
guaranty. Defendant Carbon Fit filed a cross-complaint on February 17, 2022,
alleging breach of lease, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealings, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, and
fraud.
 
RULING: Denied for all Defendants 
 
Plaintiff
moves for a writ of attachment for $269,610.64, due to Defendants’ failure to
pay rent and other expenses.
 
Defendants
oppose Plaintiff’s writ. Defendants filed their opposition on January 11, 2024.
CCP § 484.060 requires that the opposition to a writ of attachment be filed 5
court days before the hearing. Because Monday, January 15 is a court holiday, 5
court days before the hearing would have been January 10. However, Defendants
may not have been aware of this when they filed their opposition, so the Court
will consider their opposition.
 
Defendants
argue in their opposition that Plaintiff has not established probable validity
of its claim because none of the declarations in support of Plaintiff’s writ address
whether the legal requirements for the writ have been met. Defendants also
argue that Plaintiff’s claim is not readily ascertainable because of the cross-claims
that Defendant Carbon Fit has filed and the damages that Defendant seeks from
Plaintiff based on Plaintiff’s alleged breaches of the lease. Defendant Carbon
Fit has alleged in its cross-complaint that Plaintiff failed to deliver the
Premises to Carbon Fit in the condition required under the lease. Defendant
also argues that the lease gave it the ability to terminate the lease early.
Finally, Defendants argue that writs cannot be issued against natural persons,
such as Defendants Matthew and Brittany Walsh, if the claim is based on the
lease of property.

ANALYSIS
 
CCP § 483.010
subdivision (a) states: “Except as otherwise provided by statute, an attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five
hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney’s fees.” The
court may issue a right to attach order if it finds all of the following:
(1)  
The claim the attachment is based on is a claim in
which an attachment may be issued.
(2)  
Plaintiff has established the probable validity of its
claim.
(3)  
The attachment is not sought for a purpose other than
the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based.
(4)  
The amount to be secured by the attachment is greater
than zero.
 
(CCP
§ 484.090(a).)
 
“The
general requirements for prejudgment attachments include the following: The
action must seek money, be based on a contract, where the total claim is fixed
or readily ascertainable and not less than $500 [citation]; that the claim be
unsecured [citation]; and that the plaintiffs make a showing that they ‘on the
facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.’ [Citation.]”  (Hobbs v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76,
80.) “‘A claim has “probable validity” where it is more likely than not that
the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.’
[Citation.]” (Goldstein v. Barak
Construction (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 845, 852.) The contract must also be
commercial in nature. (Ibid.)
“Although damages need not be liquidated, they must be measurable by reference
to the contract sued upon, and their basis must be reasonable and certain.” (Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan
Electric Corp. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1481, fn. 5.; citing CIT Group/Equipment Financing, Inc. v. Super
DVD, Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540.)
 
CCP
§ 483.015(a) states that the total sum of the attachment includes: “(1) The
amount of the defendant’s indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff. (2) Any
additional amount included by the court under Section 482.110.” “The plaintiff’s application for a
right to attach order and a writ of attachment pursuant to this title may
include an estimate of the costs and allowable attorney's fees.” (CCP §
482.110(a).) 
 
If
the defendant is a corporation, “all corporate property” is subject to
attachment under CCP § 487.010(a) and a description referencing “all corporate
property which is subject to attachment” pursuant to § 487.010 is sufficient to
satisfy § 484.020.  “Corporations and
partnerships generally have no exempt property.” (Bank of America v. Salinas Nissan, Inc. (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260,
268.) There is no argument that Defendant operates as anything other than a
corporate entity.
 
Plaintiff
moves for attachment based on the parties’ lease agreement. The claimed unpaid
sums exceed $500, and the agreement for payment is not secured by any personal
property. Plaintiff establishes that Defendants failed to make any rent
payments or other payments required under the lease in May 2020, or any payment
thereafter. However, none of the declarations supporting Plaintiff’s
application for writ address whether the application meets the legal
requirements of a writ of attachment.
 
Additionally,
because of Defendant Carbon Fit’s cross-complaint alleging that Plaintiff also
breached the lease by failing to deliver the Premises in the required
condition, the amount that Plaintiff may recover is not readily ascertainable,
as there may be mitigating circumstances. Additionally, the probable validity
of Plaintiff’s claim is also called into question by Defendant’s cross-claims
because it is not “more likely than not” that Plaintiff will obtain a judgment
against Defendants on its claims.
 
Further,
“[i]f the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment
may be issued only on a claim which arises out of the conduct by the defendant
of a trade, business, or profession. An Attachment may not be issued on a claim
against a defendant who is a natural person if the claim is based on the sale
or lease of property…” (CCP § 483.010(c).) Based on that code section, no writ
of attachment may be issued for Defendants Matthew Walsh and Brittany Walsh.
 
Because
Plaintiff has not established the probable validity of its claim against
Defendant Carbon Fit and because no writ may be issued against the individual
Defendants, Plaintiff’s writ of attachment is denied for all Defendants.
