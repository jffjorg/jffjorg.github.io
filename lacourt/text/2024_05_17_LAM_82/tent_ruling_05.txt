Technology, Inc. v.
Louis F. Mascola, DDS, Inc.
Case No. 24STCV02065
[Tentative] Order Granting Application for
Writ of Attachment
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
            Plaintiff
Align Technology, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves for writs of attachment in the
amount of $174,447.61 against Defendants Louis F. Mascola, DDS, Inc. and Louis
F. Mascola, DDS, an individual (“Defendants”). 
Defendants were defaulted on March 28 and April 2, 2024.  The writ is issued.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD 

 
“Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply
pursuant to this article for a right to attach order and a writ of attachment
by filing an application for the order and writ with the court in which the
action is brought.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
484.010.)  The
court shall issue a right to attach order if the court finds all of the
following: 
 
(1)            
The claim upon which
the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be issued. 
 
(2)            
The plaintiff has
established the probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is
based.
 
(3)            
The attachment is not
sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the
attachment is based. 
 
(4)            
The amount to be secured by
the attachment is greater than zero.  
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 484.090.)  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than
not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that
claim.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 481.190.)    “In contested applications, the court must consider the
relative merits of the positions of the respective parties and make a
determination of¿the probable outcome of the litigation.”¿  (Hobbs v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th
76, 80.)  
 
“The
application shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on
the facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.”¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 484.030.)  Section 482.040 states in pertinent part: “The facts stated in each affidavit
filed pursuant to this title shall be set forth with particularity. Except
where matters are specifically permitted by this title to be shown by
information and belief, each affidavit shall show affirmatively that the affiant,
if sworn as a witness, can testify competently to the facts stated therein. As
to matters shown by information and belief, the affidavit shall state the facts
on which the affiant's belief is based, showing the nature of his information
and the reliability of his informant. The affiant may be any person, whether or
not a party to the action, who has knowledge of the facts.”  “The Attachment Law statutes are subject
to strict construction.”  (Epstein
v. Abrams (1997) 57
Cal.App.4th 1159, 1168.)  
DISCUSSION
 
A.        Probably Validity of the Claim   
 
The complaint
alleges causes of action against Defendants for open book account, account
stated, and quantum meruit.  Plaintiff is
a “leading provider of ‘Invisalign’ products which are provided to dentists as
part of their orthodontic practice.” 
(Henry Decl. ¶ 1.)  Defendants Louis F. Mascola, DDS, Inc. and Louis F. Mascola, DDS, an
individual (“Defendants”) purchased products from Plaintiff but have not made
payments for the products totaling $171,447.61. 
(Id. ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff’s collection
manager, declarant Kent Alleyne Henry, authenticates a statement of accounts
that summarizes the invoices issued to Defendants, the due dates, sale order
numbers, days in arrears, payments made, and balances due.  (Id. ¶¶ 5-6, Exh. A-1 to A-13.)  The statement of accounts shows a total
balance due of $171,447.61.  (Ibid.)  Henry declares that the statement of accounts
was “kept in the ordinary course of business by the accounting department
(receivables) of Align by individuals whose obligation is to maintain such
accounting records” and “[i]nvoices are posted at or near the transaction
thereof in the ordinary course of business of Align.”  (Id. ¶ 6.) 
Henry also authenticates Plaintiff’s “Pricing Terms and Conditions,”
which state, among other things, that Plaintiff’s “customer” includes both the
doctor and corporate body whose name is on the invoices, and that both the
doctor and corporate body are jointly and severally responsible for the payment
obligations.  (Id. ¶ 11.)  Defendants have defaulted on the complaint,
have not filed an opposition to this application for writ of attachment, and
have not rebutted the foregoing evidence.
 
Based upon the foregoing, Plaintiff has shown a probably valid claim in
the amount of $171,447.61 based on an open book account and Defendants’ failure
to pay for goods delivered pursuant to Plaintiff’s invoices.  (See e.g. Costerisan v. DeLong (1967)
251 Cal.App.2d 768, 770-771 [defining a book account].)  Plaintiff’s sworn application on form AT-105
also provides a reasonable estimate of costs in the amount of $3,000.  Accordingly, Plaintiff shows a probably valid
claim in the total amount of $174,447.61.   

 
            B.        Basis
of Attachment 
 
“[A]n attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five
hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney's fees.”  (CCP § 483.010(a).)  “An
attachment may not be issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in
real property arising from agreement ….” 
(CCP § 483.010(b).)  “If the
action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be
issued only on a claim which arises out of the conduct by the defendant of a
trade, business, or profession.  (§ 483.010(c); see Advance Transformer co. v. Sup.Ct. (1974)
44 Cal.App.3d 127, 143-144.)
 
Here, Plaintiff’s
application for writ of attachment is based on an implied agreement, under
which Defendants impliedly agreed to pay for products supplied by Plaintiff pursuant
written invoices, and where the total amount allegedly due is in excess of
$500.  The agreement is not secured by
real property.  The claim against
Defendant Louis Mascola, DDS, arises from his conduct of a trade, business, or
profession.  (See Henry Decl. ¶¶ 5-11.)  Plaintiff’s damages are fixed and readily
ascertainable from the terms of the implied agreement, the statement of
accounts and invoices summarized therein, and Henry’s declaration.  
 
            C.        Purpose
and Amount of Attachment 
            
Code of Civil
Procedure section 484.090 states that the Court shall issue a right to attach
order if “the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on
the claim upon which the attachment is based . . . [and] the amount to be
secured by the attachment is greater than zero.”  Plaintiff declares, and the court finds, that
attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on Plaintiff’s
contract claim.  (Appl. ¶ 4.)  The amount to be secured is greater than
zero.  Defendants
do not argue, or show, that the amounts of attachment should be reduced
pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 483.015(b).   
 
            D.        Subject Property
 
Defendant Louis F. Mascola, DDS,
Inc. is a corporation and not a natural person. 
Accordingly, “all corporate property for which a method of levy is provided
by Article 2 (commencing with Section 488.300) of Chapter 8” may be
attached.  (Code Civ. Proc. §
487.010(a).)  Plaintiff’s request for
attachment of all of Defendant’s property is proper.  (Appl. ¶ 9a.)
 
Plaintiff requests attachment
against Defendant Louis. F. Mascola, DDS, a natural person, of items listed in Code
of Civil Procedure section 487.010(c) and (d). 
(Application ¶ 9c.)  That request
is proper.  Plaintiff is not required by
section 484.020(e) to describe the property sought for attachment with further
specificity.  (See Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc. (1989) 207 Cal. App. 3d 260, 267-268 [“all-inclusive”
application satisfies CCP section 484.020(e)].) 
 
However, Plaintiff’s Attachment A
appears to seek attachment against Defendant Louis. F. Mascola, DDS, an
individual, of items not listed in Code of Civil Procedure section
487.010(c) and (d), such as “decedents’ estates,” “defendants’ interests in
personal property,” and “personal property in defendant’s possession or
control.”  (See Attach. A at 2-3, citing Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 488.485, 488.335.) 
Plaintiff does not show that prejudgment against an individual is
authorized for items not listed in section 487.010(c) and (d).  (Cf. Code Civ. Proc. § 487.010(a)
[authorizing attachment against a corporation of “all corporate property for
which a method of levy is provided by Article 2 (commencing with Section
488.300) of Chapter 8.”].)  Accordingly,
the court limits the attachment against Defendant Louis. F. Mascola, DDS, an
individual, to the items specifically listed in section 487.010(c) and (d).
 
E.         Undertaking

 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 489.210 requires the plaintiff to file an undertaking before
issuance of a writ of attachment.  Code
of Civil Procedure section 489.220 provides, with exceptions, for an
undertaking in the amount of $10,000. 
The court concludes that the statutory undertaking of $10,000 is
appropriate.  
 
F.         Turnover Order  
 
Plaintiff seeks a
turnover order.  (See Proposed Order ¶
3.d.)  “If a writ of attachment is
issued, the court may also issue an order directing the defendant to transfer
to the levying officer either or both of the following: [¶] (1) Possession of
the property to be attached if the property is sought to be attached by taking
it into custody. [¶] (2) Possession of documentary evidence of title to
property of or a debt owed to the defendant that is sought to be
attached.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 482.080
[emphasis added].)  Plaintiff has not
shown the applicability of this section to its attachment request or briefed
the necessity of this additional remedy.  The request for a turnover order is denied.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The application for writ of attachment against Defendants Louis F. Mascola, DDS, Inc. and Louis F. Mascola,
DDS, an individual is GRANTED in the amount request of $174,447.61.
 
            2.         The court limits the attachment against Defendant
Louis. F. Mascola, DDS, an individual, to the items specifically listed in Code
of Civil Procedure section 487.010(c) and (d). 

 
3.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall submit a
revised, proposed writ of attachment and right to attach order in conformance
with this ruling.  
 
4.         Plaintiff shall post an undertaking of $10,000 for each defendant, i.e., $20,000. 
 
5.         Plaintiff’s
request for a turnover order is denied.
 
6.         The
court’s clerk shall serve this order upon Plaintiff’s counsel.  Further notice is not required, as Defendants
are in default.
