And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the respondent's motion to dismiss the petition for writ of mandate filed by Grigor Ter Oganesyan and Cypress S.B. Car Spa, Inc. The petitioners had failed to post a bond with the Labor Commissioner's Office, which was required by Labor Code section 1197.1. The court finds that the bond requirement is "mandatory and jurisdictional" and that the petitioners' failure to post a bond is a fatal defect that warrants dismissal of the petition. The court also finds that the petitioners did not file a timely request to waive the bond requirement and that they did not establish to the court's satisfaction that they lacked the ability to pay the bond.
