And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling states that the court has not located a dismissal at pages 359-360 of the administrative record, as cited by the Petitioner. Despite this, the Respondents have not disputed that all counts related to the Property were dismissed and that Barton was not prosecuted or convicted of those counts. The court finds that the public agency's action was arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, and therefore invalid. If governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, the September 2022 Decision was also arbitrary, capricious, and entirely lacking in evidentiary support.
