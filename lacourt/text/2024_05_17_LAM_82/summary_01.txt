And here is a summary in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in the case between John Doe, the plaintiff, and the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that the LAUSD was negligent in investigating and reporting suspected child abuse, which led to his molestation by a school employee, Clara Moreno-Santos. The judge has granted the defendant's motion, ruling that the LAUSD is immune from liability under Penal Code section 11172, which provides absolute immunity to mandatory reporters of child abuse. The judge also found that there was no causation between any negligence by the LAUSD and the plaintiff's damages.
