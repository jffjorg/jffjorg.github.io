[1] The court has not
located a dismissal at pages of 359-360 of the administrative record, cited by
Petitioner.  Nonetheless, Respondents
have not disputed that all counts related to the Property were dismissed and
that Barton was not prosecuted or convicted of those counts.  (See e.g. AR 4169 [County letter
acknowledging that “the counts against Ms. Barton specifically as to the
subject property were dismissed pursuant to a plea negotiation”].)  


[2] For this same
reason, the court reaches the same result on the petition even if it is
governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 1085.  (See OB 13:6-14; see County of Los Angeles v.
City of Los Angeles (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 643, 654 [Under section
1085, “[a] court must ask whether the public agency's action was arbitrary,
capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, or whether the agency
failed to follow the procedure and give the notices the law requires.”].)  


[3] In the
alternative, to the extent this action is governed by Code of Civil Procedure
section 1085, the September 2022 Decision “was arbitrary,
capricious, [and] entirely lacking in evidentiary support.”  (County
of Los Angeles v. City of Los Angeles (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 643,
654.)
