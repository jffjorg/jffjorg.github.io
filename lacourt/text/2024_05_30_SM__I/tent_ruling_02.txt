 Case Number:  22SMCV01644    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  I This is an ex parte application to enforce a
settlement agreement.  The court will
hear from the defense as to whether there is some reason why the application
ought not be granted.  The court believes
that plaintiff has made out a prima facie case.  However, the court is not convinced that
prejudgment interest runs from the date of the breach of the underlying
contracts.  Those contracts may have been
superseded by the settlement agreement, which appears to be in the nature of a
novation, rather than an accord and satisfaction.   
 
If the defense wishes to be heard, the court will continue
the matter to a date in the very near future to allow defendant to file papers
and plaintiff to respond.
