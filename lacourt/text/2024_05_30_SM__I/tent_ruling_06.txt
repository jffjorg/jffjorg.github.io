 Case Number:  SC124878    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  I The court is in receipt of the parties joint filing of six
nominees for referee.  As requested, they
are listed in alphabetical order without any indication as to which party
nominated which candidate.  The court is
also in receipt of plaintiff’s errata correcting a few errors in the list.  The court selects the referee as follows:
 
Judge Horn, Judge Zeltzer, Mr. Gross, Mr. Cohen, Mr.
Mofetta, Judge Bacigalupo. 
 
The court has listed the candidates in the order selected by
the court.  That means that if Judge Horn
is unable or unwilling to take the assignment, then the parties should attempt
to retain Judge Zeltzer, and so forth.
 
The maximum number of hours the referee is authorized to
spend on this matter is 40 at the hourly rate charged.  If more than 40 hours are necessary, the
court may (on request) so order.
 
Defendant is to prepare the order of appointment using the
Judicial Council form.  Defendant should
give it to plaintiff for review before submitting it to the court.
