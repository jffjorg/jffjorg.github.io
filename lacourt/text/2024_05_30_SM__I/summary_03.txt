And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to be relieved as counsel. The court directed the client to be present at the last hearing, as a trial is set for June 10, 2024, and the court will likely be busy with another trial. The court wants to verify that the client was informed of this problem in late 2023 and is aware of the trial date. As counsel has given up their law license, the court must grant the motion. The motion is granted effective immediately, and the client will be aware of the withdrawal at the court hearing on May 30, 2024.
