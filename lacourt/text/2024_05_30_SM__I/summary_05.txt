And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is inclined to grant the motion and enforce the settlement. The parties signed a stipulation for entry of judgment, which provides that the defendant will pay a sum certain to the plaintiff. However, the defendant failed to do so, and the settlement provides that a judgment will be entered for the full amount owing at the time of default, plus attorneys' fees and liquidated damages. Therefore, the court will enter a judgment in the amount of $151,376.91, plus $5500 in attorneys' fees, plus $8803.68 for March rent. The court notes that there is no proof of service, so the motion will be denied without prejudice to being renewed upon proper service. The plaintiff is to provide a form of judgment to the court within 10 court days, and should run the proposed judgment by the defendant for approval as to form only before submitting it to the court.
