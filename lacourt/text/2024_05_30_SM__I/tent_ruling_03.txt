 Case Number:  22SMCV02357    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion to be relieved as counsel.  The motion is GRANTED.  At the last hearing, the court directed the
client to be present.  That is because
there is a trial set for June 10, 2024.  The
court is likely to be otherwise engaged on that date because it is currently in
trial, but the trial is coming very, very soon. 
The court needs to know that counsel’s representation that the client
was informed of this problem in late 2023 is accurate.  The court also wants the client to be aware
that if the client wants to obtain counsel, time is of the essence.  Because counsel has given up the law license,
however, the court must grant the motion, and it is granted.  It is effective immediately because the
client will be here today and therefore will be aware of the withdrawal.
