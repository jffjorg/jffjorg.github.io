And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the parties. The agreement required the defendant to complete certain work by April 30, 2024. The plaintiff claims that the work was not completed on time and not done properly. The defendant, on the other hand, claims that the work is now done and disputes the plaintiff's claims. The court finds that the defendant was obligated to pay over the money to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of signing the agreement. The court also notes that the work is supposed to be completed by April 30, 2024, and that the defendant has not completed the work on time. The court rules that the motion to enforce the settlement agreement is moot and is denied on that basis. The court concludes that if the plaintiff signs off on the work, the money ought to be released forthwith.
