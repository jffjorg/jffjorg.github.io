  Case Number:  23CHCV01719    Hearing Date:   September 13, 2024    Dept:  F51  SEPTEMBER 12, 2024    MOTIONS TO COMPEL  DISCOVERY RESPONSES  (Form Interrogatories, Special  Interrogatories, Requests for Admission, and Requests for Production of  Documents, Set One) Los Angeles Superior Court Case  # 23CHCV01719     Motions Filed: 5/2/24, 5/6/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Frank Rosas, Jr.  (“Plaintiff”) RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant FCA US, LLC (“Defendant”) NOTICE: OK   RELIEF REQUESTED: Orders compelling Defendant’s verified,  objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Requests for  Production of Documents (“RFPs”), Special Interrogatories, and Requests for  Admission (“RFAs”), Set One. Plaintiff further requests that the Court order  monetary sanctions against Defendant and/or its counsel in the combined amount of  $11,040.00.   TENTATIVE RULING: The motions are granted. Defendant  is ordered to provide objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of  discovery requests within 30 days. The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant  in the amount of $510.00, payable within 45 days.   BACKGROUND   Plaintiff brings this action under  the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Civil Code § 1790 et seq.) for a  vehicle he purchased on or around 2/16/22, for which Defendant issued the  manufacturer’s express warranty. (Compl. ¶¶ 7, 9.) Plaintiff alleges that the  subject vehicle exhibited “defects, nonconformities, maladjustments or  malfunctions relating to, inter alia, screen glitches in and out when in use,  center of cluster displays water spots behind screen, cover of instrument panel  is deformed from factory, and harsh clunk felt from drivetrain,” and Defendant  “were unable or unwilling to make the SUBJECT VEHICLE conform to the applicable  warranties.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 13–16.)   On 6/14/23, Plaintiff filed her  complaint, alleging against the Defendant and the dealership the following  causes of action: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express  Warranty; (2) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; (3)  Violation of Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2; and (4) Negligent Repair (against  the dealership defendant). On 7/18/23, Defendants filed their answers.   On 12/13/23, Plaintiff served her  first set of Form Interrogatories, RFPs, Special Interrogatories, and RFAs on  Defendant. (Decl. of Laura R. Schwartz ¶ 2.) On 5/2/24, Plaintiff filed the  instant motions to compel Defendant’s responses thereto. On 8/12/24 and  8/14/24, Defendant filed its oppositions thereto. On 9/6/24, Plaintiff filed his  replies.   ANALYSIS   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to interrogatories if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, subd.  (b); 2030.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings  under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order compelling a response to a request for production of documents if the  responding party fails to serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ.  Proc. §§ 2031.300, subd. (b); 2031.260, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding  party who fails to serve a timely response “waives any objection to the demand,  including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product” unless  the Court grants it relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd.  (a).)   A propounding party may move for an  order deeming the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters  specified in the requests be deemed admitted if the responding party fails to  serve a timely response within 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.280, subd.  (b); 2033.250, subd. (a).) Furthermore, the responding party who fails to serve  a timely response “waives any objection to the requests, including one based on  privilege or on the protection for work product” unless the Court grants it  relief upon motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall  make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for  admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a  proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial  compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Id. at subd. (c).)   Here, as Plaintiff electronically served  his first set of discovery requests on Defendant on 12/13/23, the last day for Defendant  to respond was 1/15/24. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6.) Defendant argues that the instant motions  are moot because on 8/12/24 and 8/13/24, Defendant served verified responses to  Plaintiff’s discovery requests. (Decl. of Gregory G. Brezovec ¶ 5.) Plaintiff argues in  reply that because Defendant has included objections in its discovery  responses, the responses are therefore not code-compliant, and the Court should  grant the instant motions. (Pl.’s Reply 6:1–3.)   The Court agrees, and reiterates  its above finding that Defendant failed to timely respond to Plaintiff’s  validly-served discovery requests. The Court therefore finds that by 1/15/24,  Defendant had waived any objections to the discovery requests.   Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motions to  compel Defendant’s objection-free discovery responses are granted.   However, based on the “substantial  compliance” in responding to the Requests for Admissions, the request to deem  them admitted is denied.       Sanctions    “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ.  Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).)   “The court shall impose a monetary  sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,  testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction  acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the  imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).)   “It is mandatory that the court  impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)  on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests  for admission necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd.  (c).) Additionally, “the court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that  conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred  by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd.  (a).)   Here, Plaintiff requests $2,760.00  in monetary sanctions to be imposed on Defendant and/or its attorneys per  motion, totaling $11,040.00. This amount encompasses: (1) 2 hours of  Plaintiff’s attorney’s time spent drafting each motion; and (2) 4 hours spent  reviewing each of Defendant’s oppositions, drafting replies, and appearing for  each hearing, at counsel’s hourly rate of $450.00 per hours. (Schwartz Decl. ¶ 12.) Plaintiff also  seeks to recover $60.00 in filing fees per motion. (Ibid.)   Defendant argues in opposition that  sanctions should not be awarded, as “there is simply no justification for  sanctions in this case against FCA US given good faith efforts to address its  mistake by counsel.” (Def.’s Opp. 5:15–16.) Plaintiff disagrees, arguing that  Defendant “failed to timely respond to an authorized method of discovery,  failed to respond to the repeated attempts by Plaintiff to obtain responses  without the need for a discovery motion, and failed to respond to the numerous  offers by Plaintiff to withdraw the motions in return for obtaining the  responses.” (Pl.’s Reply 5:26–6:1.)   In granting the instant motions, the  Court finds it reasonable to award Plaintiff sanctions against Defendant in the  amount of $510.00.    CONCLUSION  The motions are granted. Defendant is ordered to provide  objection-free responses to Plaintiff’s first set of discovery requests within  30 days. The Court imposes sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $510.00  within 45 days.
