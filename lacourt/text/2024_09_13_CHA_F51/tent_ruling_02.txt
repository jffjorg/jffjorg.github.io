(Requests for
Production of Documents, Set One)
Los Angeles Superior Court
Case # 23CHCV02619

 
Motion
filed: 5/22/24
 
MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiffs
Anne Hawley and William Hawley, individually and as Successors in Interest to
Decedent, Christopher Hawley (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendant
Magic Mountain LLC (“Defendant”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order compelling Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiffs’
Requests for Production of Documents (“RFPs”), Set One, Nos. 1, 3, 16–18, 20–21,
26–27, 29–37,
41, 45–46, 48–50,
and 52–55.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The motion is granted in part. Defendant ordered to provide
further code-compliant responses and a privilege log, as set forth below, to RFP
Nos. Nos. 1, 3, 16–18, 20–21, 26–27, 29–37, 45–46, 48–50, and 52–55 within 30 days. The Court imposes monetary sanctions against Defendant in
the amount of $500.00, payable within 45 days.
 
Defendant is reminded that all documents “must be text
searchable when technologically feasible without impairment of the document’s
image.” (CRC 2.256(b)(3).) Failure to comply with these requirements in the
future may result in papers being rejected, matters being placed off calendar,
matters being continued so documents can be resubmitted in compliance with
these requirements, documents not being considered and/or the imposition of
sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a wrongful death action wherein Plaintiffs are the
parents of decedent Christopher Hawley (“Decedent”). Plaintiffs allege that on
6/23/22, Decedent visited Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park, located at
26101 Magic Mountain Parkway in Valencia, California, and rode the X2 roller coaster,
after which he sustained a brain injury resulting in his death. (FAC ¶¶ 1,
24–32.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendant “owns, operates, manages, and/or
controls Six Flags Magic Mountain.” (Id. at ¶ 9.) 
 
On 8/30/23, Plaintiffs filed their complaint, alleging
against seven named defendants the following causes of action: (1) Strict
Liability – Design Defect; (2) Strict Liability – Failure to Warn; (3)
Negligent Product Design; (4) Negligent Failure to Warn; (5) Negligence; and
(6) Premises Liability. On 3/14/24, Plaintiffs filed their first amended
complaint (“FAC”), alleging the same causes of action.
 
On 9/19/23, Plaintiffs served Defendant with their RFPs, Set
One. (Ex. A to Decl. of Brian Priestley.) On 11/27/23, Defendant served its
responses thereto. (Ex. E to Priestley Decl.) On 3/11/24, Defendant served
further responses to the subject RFPs. (Exs. O, P to Priestley Decl.)
 
On 5/22/24, Plaintiffs filed the instant motions to compel
Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiffs’ RFPs, Set One, Nos. 1, 3, 16–18, 20–21, 26–27, 29–37, 41, 45–46, 48–50, and 52–55. On 8/30/24, Defendant filed its
opposition thereto. On 9/6/24, Plaintiffs filed their reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
California law requires a responding party to respond to
each request for production of documents with either a statement of compliance,
a representation that the party lacks the ability to comply, or an objection to
the demand. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.210, subd. (a).) If the response includes
an objection to the demand in part, it must (1) identify the particular
document that falls within the category of the request to which the objection
is being made, and (2) expressly set forth the extent of, and specific ground for,
the objection. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240, subd. (b).)¿
 
A propounding party may move for an order compelling
further response to a request for production if it decides that: “(1) A
statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete; (2) A representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) An objection
in the response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310,
subd. (a).) The demanding party must take the initiative to obtain a judicial
determination of the validity of any objection by moving to compel a further
response, but the objecting party has the burden of justifying the objection. (See,
e.g., Coy v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d
210, 220.)
 
A.   
Meet and Confer 
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel declares
that beginning on 12/21/23, counsel for the parties met and conferred on
several occasions regarding Defendant’s responses to Plaintiffs’ RFPs and a stipulated
protective order but were unable to informally resolve the issues. (Priestley
Decl. ¶¶ 9–29.) Therefore, the Court finds that counsel
has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer requirement under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2031.310, subdivision (b)(2).
 
B.    
Timeliness
 
“A motion to compel further
response … [must] be made within 45 days of the service of the response.” (Standon
Co. v Superior Court (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 898, 902.) “Unless notice of
this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or
any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date
to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
demand.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (c) [emphasis added].)
 
Here, as a preliminary
matter, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs have waived their right to bring the
instant motion because the agreed-upon deadline to file the motion was 5/2/24,
and the motion was filed on 5/22/24. (Def.’s Opp. 2:14–17, citing Ex. W to
Priestley Decl.) 
 
Plaintiffs assert in reply
that “months-worth of meet and confer efforts between counsel for Plaintiffs
and counsel for Magic Mountain, Mary Bevins, culminated in an April 11, 2024
express written agreement in which Ms. Bevins agreed to extend Plaintiffs’
deadline to file this Motion until 30 days after Magic Mountain produced
certain additional documents that had already been promised in prior
supplemental discovery responses. (Pls.’ Reply 4:12–16, citing Ex. X to
Priestley Decl.)
 
Defendant argues that “Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(c) requires a specific date certain so that
there is no ambiguity in whether the court has jurisdiction to rule upon the
merits of a motion to compel further responses.” (Id. at 5:5–7.)
Defendant further contends that “Plaintiffs’ position, if followed, it would
lead to an absurd result, in that Plaintiffs would have been able to file a
motion to compel whenever Magic Mountain produced documents (as opposed to
supplemental responses).” (Id. at 5:10–12.)
 
Plaintiffs argue in reply
that “it would be absurd to allow a party who agreed in-writing to an extension
to renege on that agreement without merit or legal support.” (Pls.’ Reply 6:11–13.)
“The law was designed to foster agreement between the parties, not restrict the
means by which parties could reach such agreements. Indeed, the terms of the
agreement reached in this case between counsel for Plaintiffs and Ms. Bevins
were as specific as the circumstances permitted, given that the parties were
making progress and moving towards a further production.” (Id. at 6:1–5.)
 
The Court agrees with
Plaintiffs, and finds that Defendant’s counsel expressly agreed, in writing, to
a reciprocal extension allowing Plaintiffs to file the instant motion to compel
30 days after Defendant produced additional documents. (Ex. X to Priestley
Decl.) Here, counsel for the parties continued to meet and confer regarding the
merits of the instant motion even after it was filed. (Priestley Reply Decl. ¶¶
3–6.) Accordingly, the Court finds that the instant motion is not untimely.

C.   
Defendant’s Responses
 
Plaintiffs seek to compel Defendant’s further
responses to Plaintiffs’ RFPs, Set One, Nos. 1, 3, 16–18, 20–21, 26–27, 29–37,
41, 45–46, 48–50, and 52–55.
 
1.     
RFP Nos. 1, 3, and
50
 
“RFP Nos. 1, 3, and 50 ask for all documents regarding the
incident, Christopher Hawley, and Magic Mountain’s investigations of the
incident, respectively.” (Pls.’ Mot. 11:9–10.) Here, Defendant’s responses
raise both the attorney-client and attorney work product privileges. (Pls.’
Sep. Stmt.) However, Plaintiffs assert that Defendant has refused to produce a privilege
log relating to these requests. (Pls.’ Mot. 11:20–23.)
 
“If an objection is based on a claim of privilege or a
claim that the information sought is protected work product, the response shall
provide sufficient factual information for other parties to evaluate the merits
of that claim, including, if necessary, a privilege log.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.240, subd. (c)(1).) “The purpose of a ‘privilege log’ is to provide a
specific factual description of documents in aid of substantiating a claim of
privilege in connection with a request for document production. … The purpose
of providing a specific factual description of documents is to permit a
judicial evaluation of the claim of privilege.” (Hernandez v. Superior Court
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 285, 292.)
 
In its opposition, Defendant asserts that “documents
related to attorney-client communications, attorney work-product, and
consulting expert documents were the only items withheld from production” in
response to the subject RFPs. (Def.’s Opp. 6:17–18.) However, as Plaintiffs
note, “Plaintiffs have never suggested that Magic Mountain must produce
privileged materials. Rather, Plaintiffs have steadfastly requested a privilege
log so that they and the Court have enough information to evaluate the merits
of Magic Mountain’s withholdings.” (Pls.’ Reply 6:27–7:1.)
 
The Court notes, as Plaintiffs also observe, that “instead
of addressing the specific issues laid out by Plaintiffs in their moving
papers, Magic Mountain spends the bulk of its Opposition describing the various
documents that it has produced, while failing to offer any believable
justification for its refusal to produce other relevant, responsive documents.”
(Id. at 3:16–19.) As Defendant offers no explanation nor justification
for its refusal to produce a privilege log, despite conceding that they withheld
purportedly privileged documents from production, the Court finds that further
responses to Plaintiffs’ RFP Nos. 1, 3, and 50 are warranted.
 
2.     
RFP Nos. 20 and 37
 
“Request No. 20 asked Magic Mountain to produce documents
reflecting its insurance policies that may cover the damages sought by
Plaintiffs.” (Pls.’ Mot. 11:27–12:3.) “Request No. 37 asked Magic Mountain to
produce documents pertaining to injuries that occurred on X2 from the date it
opened to the public, May 24, 2008, to present.” (Id. at 12:4–6.)
Plaintiffs argue that here, “for both requests, Magic Mountain improperly
attempts to unilaterally limit scope without justification.” (Id. at 12:9–10.)
 
In response to RFP No. 20, Defendant limited its production
to “the relevant declaration page in effect at the time of the
incident.” (Pls.’ Sep Stmt. p. 19.) In response to RFP No. 37, Defendant “agreed
to produce responsive documents only insofar as they concerned ‘complaints
limited to head injury’ for X2 ‘from June 22, 2019 to June 23, 2022.’” (Pls.’
Mot. 12:6–8.) As Plaintiffs note, Defendant does not address this issue in its
opposition. Accordingly, the Court finds that further responses to Plaintiffs’ RFP Nos. 20 and 37 are warranted.
 
3.     
RFP Nos. 48–50
 
RFP Nos. 48–50 seek “documents regarding testing,
inspections, and investigations of X2 and Christopher Hawley’s death conducted
by or on behalf of Magic Mountain since June 23, 2022.” (Pls.’ Mot. 13:19–21.)
Defendant objected to each subject RFP on the basis “that this request calls
for the discovery of post-remedial measures.” (Pls.’ Sep. Stmt.)
 
“When,
after the occurrence of an event, remedial or precautionary measures are taken,
which, if taken previously, would have tended to make the event less likely to
occur, evidence of such subsequent measures is inadmissible to prove negligence
or culpable conduct in connection with the event.” (Evid. Code § 1151.) Here,
Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s Evidence Code section 1151 objections are
inapplicable in this case, where strict liability and punitive damages are
alleged. (Pls.’ Mot. 13:22–28, citing Ault v. International Harvester Co.
(1974) 13 Cal.3d 113, 117; Hilliard v. A.H. Robbins (1983) 148
Cal.App.3d 374, 400–401.)
 
Here, as
Plaintiffs observe, the “Opposition offers no substantive rebuttal to
Plaintiffs’ Motion on this issue.” (Pls.’ Reply 9:1.) Accordingly, the Court agrees
with Plaintiffs and finds that here, where strict liability and punitive
damages are alleged against Defendant, Defendant’s Evidence Code section 1151
objections are without merit. Accordingly, further responses to Plaintiffs’ RFP Nos. 48–50 are warranted.
 
4.     
RFP Nos. 16, 18,
and 21
 
RFP Nos. 16 and 18 … seek documents concerning policies and
procedures in place at the park, and RFP No. 21 … seeks documents concerning
the design of X2.” (Pls.’ Mot. 14:10–12.) Here, Plaintiffs argue that
Defendant’s responses to the subject RFPs are deficient because the statements
of compliance therein are incomplete and fail to state whether Defendant is in
possession of all responsive documents. (Id. at 14:13–24; Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.220.) “Specifically, Magic Mountain does not indicate
whether its purported compliance for each request is complete, nor does it
attest to the sufficiency of its search for responsive documents.” (Id.
at 14:13–14.)
 
While Defendant argues in reply that “based on Magic
Mountain’s reasonable and diligent search, no other responsive documents exist
in Magic Mountain’s possession, custody, or control,” the Court finds no such
representation stated in either Defendant’s initial or supplemental responses
to the subject RFPs. (Def.’s Opp. 7:11–13.) Accordingly, the Court finds
that further code-compliant responses to Plaintiffs’
RFP Nos. 16, 18, and 21 are warranted.
 
5.     
RFP Nos. 30–32, 41,
45–46, 48–49, 52, and 55
 
Plaintiffs further argue that Defendant’s boilerplate
objections made in response to RFP Nos. 30–32, 41, 45–46, 48–49, 52, and 55 are
without merit. “The requests at issue seek the following documents that are plainly
relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims in this case … : testing operational
modifications made to X2 [RFP No. 30]; complaints Magic Mountain received or
was otherwise made aware of regarding the operation and safety of X2 [RFP Nos.
31-32]; documents identifying employees responsible for advertising/promoting
the park [RFP No. 41]; documents relating to spine, neck, head, or brain
injuries sustained by passengers of Fourth Dimension roller coasters, including
X2 [RFP Nos. 45-46]; testing and inspections of X2 undertaken by or on behalf
of Magic Mountain since the date of the incident [RFP Nos. 48-49]; social media
posts regarding X2 posted by or on behalf of Magic Mountain since the date of
the incident [RFP No. 52]; and downloads or print-outs from the programmable
logic controller of X2 on the day of the incident [RFP No. 55].” (Pls.’ Mot. 15:6–15.)
 
Plaintiffs assert that the subject RFPs are relevant
because “Plaintiffs in this case claim Christopher Hawley died as a
result of riding the X2 roller coaster, a ride that is defectively designed and
that failed to warn potential passengers of the severe risks it posed, risks
which were known to and not acted upon by Magic Mountain.” (Pls.’ Mot.
16:14–17.)
 
In
opposition, Defendant argues that RFP Nos. 30–32, as drafted, are overbroad
because they “seek any complaints regarding the X2, in any manner, over a 16
year time period. The requests are not tailored [to] the complaints related to
guests claiming head or brain injuries, after riding. As drafted, the requests
seek discovery regarding all customer guest relations complaint[s], any incidents related to guests in the queue lines who
never rode the ride, and any litigation complaints.” (Def.’s Opp. 13:25–14:4.)
However, upon review of RFP Nos. 31 and 32, the Court finds that the requests
seek only those complaints regarding either the operation or safety
of X2 from 12/2/07 to present. Accordingly, the Court finds that RFP Nos. 30–32
are sufficiently tailored to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
 
Defendant further argues that RFP No. 49 is overbroad as
written, seeking “all DOCUMENTS concerning inspections, if any,
undertaken by YOU or on YOUR behalf since the INCIDENT.” (Pls.’ Sep. Stmt. p.
56.) As Defendant observes, “Plaintiffs’ request is not limited to the X2
roller coaster, or any claims raised by Plaintiffs in this case.” (Def.’s Opp.
14:7–8.) Accordingly, the Court finds that RFP No. 49 is overbroad, and narrows
the scope of the request to the X2 roller coaster.
 
Finally,
Defendant argues that RFP Nos. 41 and 52 seek irrelevant documents because
“there is no evidence that any advertisements, social media posts, or marketing
influenced Christopher Hawley’s decision to ride the X2, in any manner.” (Id.
at 15:2–3.) “Moreover, the names and contact information for employees may
be obtain[ed] through interrogatories. Yet, Plaintiffs’ request, as drafted,
seeks the entire employees’ personnel file.” (Id. at 15:7–16:8.) The
Court agrees with Defendant to the extent that the identities of employees
responsible for advertising and promotion of the amusement park may be obtained
through interrogatories. Accordingly, the Court finds that further responses to
RFP No. 41 are not warranted. While the Court notes that Plaintiffs do not
address Defendant’s scope/relevance objections on reply, the Court finds that
RFP No. 52 seeks documents relating to post-remedial measures, which, as
earlier discussed, are relevant and permissible in the instant action.
Accordingly, the Court finds that further responses to RFP No. 52 are
warranted.
6.      RFP Nos. 26–27, 33–36, and 53–54
 
Plaintiffs
assert that “in response to requests (a) seeking documents concerning the
operational approval of X2 and its predecessor, X (RFP Nos. 26-27), (b) notices
of violation and/or citations received from any governmental entity regarding
the operation or safety of X2 (RFP Nos. 33-36), and (c) communications between
Magic Mountain and Cal-OSHA regarding Mr. Hawley’s incident and prior related
injuries sustained by passengers of X2 (RFP Nos. 53-54), Magic Mountain refuses
to comply, claiming the documents are ‘public records and are equally
available’ to Plaintiffs.” (Pls.’ Mot. 18:1–7.) Plaintiffs argue that “this is
not an appropriate objection nor basis for Magic Mountain’s refusal to comply.
Just because a document may or may not be available by way of a FOIA request
does not make it ‘equally available’ for purposes of discovery, nor does it
shield Magic Mountain from complying with its duty to produce responsive
documents within its own possession, custody, or control.” (Id. at 18:9–13.)
 
The Court
notes that Defendant does not address this issue in its opposition. Instead, Defendant contends that it produced all
responsive documents in its possession, custody and control in response to the
subject RFPs. However, as stated above, the Court finds no such
representation stated in either Defendant’s initial or supplemental responses
to the subject RFPs. Accordingly, the Court finds that further responses to RFP
Nos. 26–27, 33–36, and 53–54 are warranted.
7.     
Email
Communications
 
Finally, Plaintiffs argue that “the most pervasive issue in
Magic Mountain’s responses is that it has not produced a single email or other
communication between its employees, between it and Six Flags, or between it
and third-parties, in response to any of the Requests identified in this
Motion.” (Pls.’ Mot. 19:1–4.) “Magic Mountain’s failure to produce a single
email—despite Plaintiffs’ ability to prove responsive emails exist—renders its
responses incomplete, and calls into question Magic Mountain’s representation
that it conducted a diligent search and reasonable inquiry.” (Id. at 19:20–22.)
 
In opposition, Defendant argues that it “has produced all
emails, other than emails containing work product or attorney
client-communications.” (Def.’s Opp. 11:13–14.) “Plaintiffs’ speculation that
additional emails should exist are negated by Magic Mountain’s responses that
indicate Defendant Responding Party has produced all known responsive documents
other than privileged attorney-client communications, attorney work-product,
and consulting expert work-product documents.” (Def.’s Opp. 11:19–22.) However,
the Court observes that this representation is made only in Defendant’s
responses to RFP Nos. 1, 3, and 50. Furthermore, as set forth above, the Court
finds that Defendant has failed to provide a privilege log setting forth the
basis of the privileges asserted by Defendant with respect to the withheld
emails. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that to the extent that
Defendant intends to withhold any responsive documents on the basis of any
privilege, Defendant is ordered to produce a privilege log providing further
details.
 
D.   
Sanctions 
 
“The court shall impose a
monetary sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand, unless it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (h).) Additionally, “the court may impose a
monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
 
Here, in granting the
instant motions, the Court finds it reasonable to impose $500.00 in monetary
sanctions against Defendant. The Court notes Plaintiffs’ contention that Defendant
produced additional documents on 6/20/24, but that the additional document
production remains insufficient to resolve the issues raised in the instant
motion. (Pls.’ Reply 10:12–13.)
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted in part.
Defendant ordered to provide further code-compliant responses and a privilege
log, as set forth above, to RFP Nos. Nos. 1, 3, 16–18,
20–21, 26–27, 29–37, 45–46, 48–50, and 52–55 within 30 days. The Court imposes monetary sanctions against Defendant in
the amount of $500.00, payable within 45 days.
