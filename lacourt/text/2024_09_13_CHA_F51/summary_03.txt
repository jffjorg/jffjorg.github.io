And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Alfredo Ayala and Elizabeth Grijalva, to the entire complaint filed by the plaintiff, Crystal Arellano. The demurrer is based on the argument that the complaint is not verified as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure section 1166. However, the Judge finds that the complaint is verified and has been signed by the plaintiff on page 4 of the complaint. Therefore, the Judge overrules the demurrer and orders the defendants to file their answer to the complaint within 5 days. The Judge notes that the defendants did not attempt to meet and confer with the plaintiff to resolve the issues raised in the demurrer, but this is not a ground to sustain the demurrer.
