And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel the defendant's timely responses to discovery requests. The defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests, despite being served with the requests on December 13, 2023. The court finds that the defendant waived any objections to the discovery requests by failing to timely respond. The court orders the defendant to provide objection-free responses to the discovery requests within 30 days.

The court also imposes sanctions on the defendant in the amount of $510.00, payable within 45 days. The court finds that the defendant's failure to timely respond to the discovery requests was unreasonable and requires sanctions. The court declines to award the full amount of sanctions requested by the plaintiff, citing the defendant's "good faith efforts to address its mistake by counsel."
