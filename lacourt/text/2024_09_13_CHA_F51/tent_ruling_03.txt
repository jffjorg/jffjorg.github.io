TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed demurrer is  overruled. Defendants to file their answer to Plaintiff’s complaint within 5  days.   BACKGROUND    This is an unlawful  detainer action in which Plaintiff alleges that in January 2020, she entered  into a written lease agreement with Defendants, whereby Defendant agreed to pay  Plaintiff $2,500.00 in monthly rent for the leased premises located at 13739  Louvre Street, Pacoima, CA 91331. (Compl. ¶¶ 3a, 6.) On 5/6/24, Plaintiff  served Defendants with a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit, at which time  Defendants allegedly owed Plaintiff $45,375.00 in unpaid rent. (Id. at  ¶¶ 9a, 12.)   On 6/4/24,  Plaintiff filed her complaint. On 8/16/24, Defendants filed the instant  demurrer. No opposition has been filed to date.   ANALYSIS   As a general matter, a party may respond to a pleading  against it by demurrer on the basis of any single or combination of eight  enumerated grounds, including that “the pleading does not state facts  sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.  (e).) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the  pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.  (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)   “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence  or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153  Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the  complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The  only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,  states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,  747.)   Here, Defendants  demur to the entire complaint on the basis that it is not verified as required  under Code of Civil Procedure section 1166, subdivision (a)(1).   A.    Meet-and-Confer   Before filing its demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet  and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that  is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can  be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41, subd. (a).) The demurring party must file and  serve a meet and confer declaration stating either: “(A) The means by which the  demurring party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading subject  to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving the  objections raised in the demurrer;” or “(B) That the party who filed the  pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and confer request  of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.” (Id.  at subd. (a)(3).)   Here, Defendants make no showing that they attempted to  meet and confer with Plaintiff to informally resolve the issues raised in the  demurrer. However, “a determination by the court that the meet and confer  process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a  demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).)   B.      Verification   Here,  Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not verified her complaint, in violation of  Code of Civil Procedure section 1166, subdivision (a)(1). (Dem. 5:13.) A  complaint for unlawful detainer must “be verified and include the typed or  printed name of the person verifying the complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1166,  subd. (a)(1).)   While  Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the instant motion, the Court notes,  upon review of the complaint, that Plaintiff has signed a verification on page  4 of the complaint. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied  the verification requirement set forth by Code of Civil Procedure section 1166,  subdivision (a)(1). Accordingly, and as Defendants do not raise any other issue  on demurrer, the unopposed demurrer is overruled.   CONCLUSION    The unopposed demurrer is overruled. Defendants to file their  answer to Plaintiff’s complaint within 5 days.
