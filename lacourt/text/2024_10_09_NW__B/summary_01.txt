And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant Tyrei Lacy's motion to strike portions of Plaintiff Kai Smith's complaint, including allegations for punitive damages, attorney's fees, and personal liability. The motion was filed late, and the court finds that Lacy failed to provide a sufficient explanation for the untimeliness. The court also notes that the complaint alleges that Lacy was involved in the altercation with Kai Smith, and that the allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice are not conclusory. As a result, the motion is denied, and Lacy is ordered to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 20 days.
