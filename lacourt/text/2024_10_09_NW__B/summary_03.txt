And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the request for default judgment by the Developers Surety and Indemnity Company against Cyndy's Cleaning Services. This is because Cyndy's failed to timely respond or appear in court, and the plaintiff's default packet meets all the statutory requirements for a default judgment. The plaintiff is seeking declaratory relief from its duty to defend and indemnify Cyndy's against all defendants in the underlying action, which arose from the stabbing and death of an employee of Cyndy's. The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice and prepare a proposed judgment for the court's signature.
