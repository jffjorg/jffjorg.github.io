Defendant Tyrei
Lacy’s Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiff Kai Smith’s Complaint is DENIED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendant Tyrei Lacy (“Lacy”) moves to
strike portions of plaintiff Kai Smith (“Plaintiff’)’s Complaint in connection
to its allegations for punitive damages (Compl., Prayer, Lines 11-12),
attorney’s fees (Compl., Prayer, Lines 12-13), and any allegations of personal
liability as to Lacy.
 
The Complaint alleges that, on or about
October 6, 2018, Plaintiff attended a birthday party at Game Sports Bar and
Grill. (Compl. ¶ 6.) Later that night, as the bar was closing, Plaintiff made
his way to the restroom while holding a bottle of champagne that he purchased.
(Ibid. at ¶ 7.) Plaintiff alleges that, at this time, a bouncer
confronted him, shouting that he couldn’t take the champagne bottle out of the
bar. (Ibid.) Plaintiff explained that he just needed to use the restroom
and began to walk away. (Ibid.) Plaintiff alleges that another bar
employee took the bottle from Plaintiff, and then two to three more bouncers
assaulted Plaintiff, punching his head, face, and upper body. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff claims serious injuries as a result. (Ibid. at ¶ 8.) 
 
On October 5, 2020, Plaintiff filed the
Complaint against Defendants Game Sports Bar and Grill, LLC (“Game Sports”) and
DOES 1 to 10 alleging four causes of action: (1) negligent hiring, retention,
and supervision; (2) assault; (3) battery; and (4) intentional infliction of
emotional distress. The Complaint seeks punitive damages. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“In order to survive a motion to strike an
allegation of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to
such relief must be pled by a plaintiff.” (Clauson v. Superior
Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255; accord Cyrus v. Haveson
(1976) 65 Cal. App. 3d 306, 316-17.) Conclusory allegations, devoid of any
factual assertions, are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted
with oppression, fraud or malice. (Smith v. Sup. Ct. (1992) 10 Cal.
App. 4th 1033, 1042.)
 
CCP § 3294(a), governing punitive damages,
provides: “In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from
contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the
defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in
addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and
by way of punishing the defendant.” 
 
Malice is defined as “conduct which is
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (CCP § 3294(c)(1).) “Oppression”
means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in
conscious disregard of that person's rights.” (Ibid., § 3294(c)(2).)
“Fraud” is “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a
material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the
defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or
otherwise causing injury.” (Ibid., § 3294(c)(3).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Lacy moves the Court to grant an order striking the Complaint’s
matter in support of punitive damages. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 436.)
 
Pursuant to CCP § 1005, all responsive
pleadings must be filed within 30 days of proof of service. Here, Lacy
attempted multiple times to quash service of summons, with the Court’s last denial
on June 26, 2024. (June 26, 2024, Minute Order.) At this time, the Court
instructed Lacy to file all responsive pleadings within 30 days. 
 
Lacy filed the instant motion on
September 16, 2024, well past the 30 day deadline. Additionally, the motion
provides no explanation as to its untimeliness. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant Tyrei Lacy’s
Motion to Strike is DENIED. Defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint within 20 days.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
