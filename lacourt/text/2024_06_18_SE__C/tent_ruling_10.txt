Further Discovery Responses is MOOT. 
   
II.

Defendant to give notice. 
 
Plaintiff Orlando Beasley (“Plaintiff”) filed this personal
injury lawsuit on October 25, 2023, alleging he was struck on his bicycle by a
negligent motorist who was driving a vehicle owned by Defendant CR&R Inc.
(“Defendant”). (Complaint, ¶¶ 2, 12.) 
On December 7, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories (set one), Special Interrogatories (set one), and Request for
Production of Documents (set one). (McLean Decl., ¶4.) On January 4, 2024,
Defendant agreed to a 30-day extension for Plaintiff to respond. (Id., ¶
6.) On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff served responses to Defendant’s discovery
requests. (Id., ¶ 7.) Defendant believed the responses were inadequate
and offered an extension to February 5, 2024. (Id., ¶ 8.) Not having
received further responses, Defendant filed the instant motions March 25, 2024.
On April 17, 2024, Plaintiff served further discovery responses. (Gill Decl., ¶
4.)
On April 30, 2024, the Court found that the parties had not
sufficiently met and conferred and ordered the parties to make further efforts
to resolve the issues. The parties were instructed to submit a joint statement.

In their Joint Statement filed on June 11, 2024, the
parties indicate they have resolved the substantive deficiencies in Plaintiff’s
responses. (Joint Statement of Interrogatories and Request for Production of
Documents and Responses in Dispute, Set One, p. 3:3-4.) Accordingly, the Court
finds the instant motions are MOOT.
The parties request the Court to rule as to the issue of
sanctions. 
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction…against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §2031.310(h).)
Defendant requests sanctions in the amount of $2,435.00 for
each of the three discovery motions, consisting of 9.5 hours at $250 per hour
plus $60 in costs.  Plaintiff’s counsel argues
that the failure to provide timely discovery responses was caused by client
communication problems and that the discovery at issue has been resolved. 
The Court considers Defendant’s efforts to meet and confer
before filing the instant motion, the representation by Plaintiff’s Counsel
that the failure to provide timely discovery responses was caused by client
communication problems, and the parties’ efforts since then to resolve the
substantive issues.  The Court imposes
sanctions in the reasonable sum of $2000.00 against Plaintiff payable in 90
days.
