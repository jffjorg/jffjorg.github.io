Case No.: 23NWCV03158

#8 
Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiffs Novi Sohn and Rhiekyu Sohn’s Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set One) is
MOOT. 
Plaintiffs to give notice. 
 
This action alleges that Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc.
(“Defendant”) violated California’s Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act by
failing to repair Plaintiffs Novi Sohn and Rhiekyu Sohn’s (“Plaintiffs”) 2022
Kia Telluride vehicle (“Subject Vehicle”). During the warranty period, the
Subject Vehicle contained or developed numerous defects that Defendant’s
authorized repair facility was unable to conform to warranty.
On November 23, 2023, Plaintiffs propounded Request for
Production of Documents, Set One. (Beck Decl., ¶ 17, Ex. 5.) 
On May 7, 2024, the Court continued the motion until this
date because it was unpersuaded that the parties had sufficiently met and
conferred. At issue were Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set
One Nos. 7, 10, 16-19, 21-22, 27, 40-43, and 56.  The Court ordered the parties to further meet
and confer and submit a Joint Statement. 

Upon review of the Joint Statement filed by the parties on
June 4, 2024, the Court finds that the parties have come to a reasonable
resolution of the outstanding requests for production.
Accordingly, the motion is MOOT.
