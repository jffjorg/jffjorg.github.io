And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge issues a tentative ruling on the motions before the Court. The Defendant's motion to compel further discovery responses is moot, as the parties have resolved the substantive deficiencies in the Plaintiff's responses. The Judge imposes sanctions against the Plaintiff in the amount of $2,000.00 payable within 90 days. The Plaintiff failed to provide timely discovery responses, and the Judge considers the Defendant's efforts to meet and confer before filing the motion, as well as the Plaintiff's counsel's representation that the failure to provide timely discovery responses was caused by client communication problems.
