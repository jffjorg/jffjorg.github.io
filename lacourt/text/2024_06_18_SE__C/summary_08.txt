```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer to the complaint and has made the following findings:

* The revival of lapsed claims against the state is not a gift of public funds, as argued by the defendant.
* The purpose of AB 218 is to provide a forum for victims of childhood sexual abuse to seek compensation from public and private entities.
* The court finds that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligence against LAUSD.
* LAUSD is liable for the sexual abuse alleged by the plaintiff, as it had a duty to supervise and train its employees to prevent such abuse.
* The court overrules the demurrer to the first cause of action for negligence and the second cause of action for negligent supervision and retention.

The court has denied the defendant's demurrer and has allowed the plaintiff's claims to proceed.
