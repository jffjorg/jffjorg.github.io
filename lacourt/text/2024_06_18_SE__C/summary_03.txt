```

And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

"The court grants the motion to deem requests for admission admitted, as the plaintiff failed to serve verified responses to the requests. Sanctions are awarded against the plaintiff in the amount of $1,061.65, payable within 60 days. The defendant's motion is granted because the plaintiff did not serve a timely response to the requests for admissions, and the court finds that the plaintiff's responses were unverified and therefore not substantial compliance with Section 2033.220 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The court orders the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorney fees and filing fees in the amount of $1,061.65."
