And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The plaintiff, Adam L. Greenfield, filed a lawsuit against defendants Armando Gaytan and Reyes Valenzuela, alleging intentional interference with contractual relationship, negligent misrepresentation, fraud-misrepresentation, and violation of penal code section 496(a). The case was dismissed on November 22, 2023, after the plaintiff failed to appear at a case management conference. The plaintiff has now moved to set aside the dismissal, citing his inability to find an attorney and his mistake about the date of the case management conference. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's motion is timely and unopposed, and has granted the motion. The case will continue.
