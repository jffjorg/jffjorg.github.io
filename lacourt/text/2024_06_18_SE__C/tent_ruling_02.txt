RULING
 
Cross-Complainant City
of South Gate’s motion for attorney fees and costs against Cross-Defendant
South Gate Investment Group, Inc. is DENIED without prejudice in part and
GRANTED in part. The Court denies attorney fees and grants $2,577.26 in costs. 
 
Moving Party to give
NOTICE.
 
 
Cross-Complainant City of South Gate (the “City”) moves for $128,954.10 in attorney fees and $2,577.26 in costs. 
 
Prevailing Party
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10) generally provides that
attorneys’ fees as authorized by statute are recoverable as costs to a
prevailing party. Courts have interpreted the term “statute” to include
“municipal ordinances.” (See, City of L.A. v. Belridge Oil. Co. (1954)
42 Cal.2d 823, 833-834.) South Gate Municipal Code Ordinance 11.51.100 permits
the recovery of attorney fees by a prevailing party in a public nuisance
abatement action. 
 
In
the present case, there is no dispute that the City is the prevailing party in
the action and is entitled to reasonable attorney fees. 
 
Statutory Interpretation 
 
Cross-Defendant South Gate Investment Group,
Inc. (“SGIG”) argues that according to the ordinance, Cross-Complainant had to
elect in writing that it would seek attorney’s fees at the beginning of the
proceeding. Cross-Defendant further argues that not doing so bars Cross-Complainant
from obtaining attorney fees. Cross-Defendant cites South Gate Municipal Code
Ordinance 11.51.100 section (B)(1). 
 
The ordinance states, “Attorney’s fees are
not recoverable by any person as a prevailing party unless the city manager, or
a designee thereof, or an attorney for and on behalf of the city, elects in
writing to seek recovery of the city attorney’s fees at the initiation of that
individual action or proceeding. Failure to make such an election precludes any
entitlement to, or award of, attorney’s fees in favor of any person or the
city.” (South Gate Mun. Code Ordinance, § 11.51.100 (B)(1).) But the City of
South Gate is not a person.  In the definition
section of the ordinance, “‘person’ shall mean and
include any individual, partnership of any kind, corporation, limited liability
company, association, joint venture or other organization, however formed, as
well as trustees, heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, or any
combination of such persons. ‘Person’ also includes any public entity or agency
that acts as an owner in the city.” (South Gate Mun. Code Ordinance, § 11.60.190.) “City” means city of South Gate,
California. (South Gate Mun. Code Ordinance, § 11.60.060.) 
 
Moreover, as the City points out, the First
Amended Cross-Complaint requests reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for all
causes of action.  SGIG was sufficiently
placed on notice of the instant motion.  
 
Thus, the attorney’s fee provision applies. 
 
Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees
 
A party prevailing in a public
nuisance abatement act may recover “reasonable” attorney fees. (South Gate Mun.
Code Ordinance, §
11.51.100(B).) The attorney claiming fees has the burden of producing evidence to
support the fee claim. (Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S.
424, 433.)
 
To
assess the fees and costs, the trial court begins with a touchstone or lodestar
figure based on the compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly
compensation of each attorney who worked on the case. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131–1132.)
The court tabulates the attorney fee touchstone by multiplying the number of
hours reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the
community for similar work. (Id. at p. 1134; Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.) The court may increase or
decrease the lodestar figure depending on a variety of factors, including (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award. (Ketchum, at p. 1132.) The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair
market value for the particular action. (Id.) 
 
For
that purpose, the court may require a party to produce records to provide a
proper basis for determining how much time was spent on claims. The court also
may reduce compensation because the attorney did not maintain appropriate time
records. (ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th
993, 1020.) The party that seeks payment must “keep records in
sufficient detail that a neutral judge can make a fair evaluation of the time
expended, the nature and need for the service, and the reasonable fees to be
allowed.”  (Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S. 424, 441 (conc.
opn. of Burger, C.J.).)  The evidence should allow the court to consider
whether the case was overstaffed, how much time the attorneys spent on claims,
and whether the hours were reasonably expended. (ComputerXpress, supra,
93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020.)
 
Contemporaneous
time records in support of an attorney fee motion are often the most useful evidence
but are not indispensable.  A detailed
declaration describing the legal work done is acceptable.  (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095, n. 4 [fee claim based on detailed
reconstructed records upheld; noting that contemporaneous records facilitate
accuracy]; Taylor v. County of Los Angeles (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th
205, 207 [contemporaneous time records are the best evidence of lawyer’s hourly
work; they are “not indispensable”]; People v. Kelly (2020) 59 Cal.App.5th
1172, 1182 [“no legal requirement that an attorney supply billing statements to
support a claim for attorney fees”; attorney declarations acceptable].)  
 
Block
billing is not impermissible per se. (Christian Research, supra, 165
Cal.App.4th at p. 1325.) Trial courts retain discretion to penalize block
billing when the practice prevents them from discerning which tasks are
compensable and which are not. (Heritage Pac. Fin., LLC v. Monroy (2013)
215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1011.) 
 
“Padding”
in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to
compensation. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) 
 
In challenging attorney
fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, the opposing
party must point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument
and citations to the evidence. (Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. Cal. Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550,
564 [“General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or
unrelated do not suffice”].)
 
The City submits the
declaration of attorney Rick D. Navarrette, who states that the firm’s
attorneys recorded their time on daily time sheets and that he has reviewed
them. (Decl. Navarrette, ¶ 9.) He further states that they are accurate. (Decl.
Navarrette, ¶ 9.) He also states the legal work the firm’s attorney performed.
(Decl. Navarrette, ¶ 10.) But he does not provide information about who
performed the tasks and how long they took to perform the tasks. Navarrette’s
statements are conclusory, and without further information, the Court cannot
determine whether the fees are reasonable. 
 
Thus, the motion for
attorney fees is DENIED without prejudice.  Because the Court denies the motion on this
ground, the Court will not adjudicate whether the hourly rates are reasonable. 
 
Costs
 
Cross-complainant filed a
memorandum of costs on December 8, 2023 and included it as part of its motion. A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs in any action. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1032.) 
 
Cross-Defendant has not filed a
motion to tax costs or opposed the costs in the instant motion. 
 
Thus, costs in the amount of
$2,577.26 is GRANTED.
