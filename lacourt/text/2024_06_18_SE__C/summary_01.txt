And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Uber Technologies, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Malik Azhar, sued Uber alleging various causes of action related to his claim that he was wrongfully fired as an Uber driver. Uber moved for summary judgment, arguing that the breach of contract cause of action is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, that Azhar cannot establish that Uber breached any term of the O'Connor Settlement Agreement by failing to properly report all applicable on-trip miles or pay a set amount per mile driven, and that Azhar's claim for punitive damages fails because he cannot obtain punitive damages in a breach of contract action. The court finds that Uber has made a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material fact with respect to the breach of contract cause of action, and the burden shifts to Azhar to raise a triable issue of material fact. Azhar fails to submit evidence to meet his burden, and the court grants summary judgment to Uber.
