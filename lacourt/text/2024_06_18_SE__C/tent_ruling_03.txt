Tentative Ruling 
Defendants Zev Brooks and the Law Offices of
Zev Brooks’ Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted is GRANTED. 
Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in the
amount of $1,061.65, payable within 60 days. 

Defendants to give notice. 
 
This is an action for legal malpractice brought Plaintiff
Jane Hodges (“Plaintiff") in her capacity as Trustee and Special
Administrator of the estate of her mother, Rose Mary Ollison (“Decedent”), who
died on or about December 20, 2020. 
Defendants Zev Brooks and the Law Offices of Zev Brooks
(“Defendants”) move for an order deeming Requests for Admissions admitted.  On January 8, 2024, Defendants served Requests
for Admissions upon Plaintiff’s counsel. (Strid Decl., February 13, 2024, ¶ 2.)
No responses were received as of the date the motion was filed. (Id., ¶
4.)  
Where
there has been no timely response to requests for admissions, a “requesting
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with section 2023.010).” 
The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for admission admitted
“unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) If a party to whom
requests for admissions are directed fails to serve a timely response, then
that party waives the right to object, including objections based on privilege
or work product. (C.C.P. § 2033.280(a).)
 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that responses have been
provided to Defendants and therefore the motion is moot. Plaintiff also
contends that the error occurred because Matthew Newbold, an associate of
Plaintiff’s law firm, was not copied on the email for the RFAs and Mr. Newbold
handles the firm’s procedure for processing of documents. 
In reply, Defendants assert that the responses were
unverified and therefore the instant motion is not moot.  Defendants received responses on May 14,
2024, but the email accompanying the responses stated, “Verification for RFA’s
to follow in coming days.” (Strid Decl., June 7, 2024, ¶ 2, Ex. 1.) To date, no
verification has been received despite repeated requests for the same. (Id.,
¶ 3.)
While C.C.P. sec. 2033.280 does offer the non-responding
party to the Requests for Admissions a way to avoid having the Requests be
deemed admitted by court order, the non-responding party must serve a proposed
response that is in "substantial compliance" with C.C.P. sec.
2033.280(a). Unsworn and unverified responses are tantamount to no responses at
all.  (Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)
Because Plaintiff has not served verified
responses before the hearing date, Defendants’ motion is GRANTED. The
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in
Defendant’s motion are admitted.   
Sanctions 
 
Here, sanctions are required. 
“It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (CCP 2033.280, subd. (c).) Defense Counsel requests sanctions in the amount of
$1,061.65 (2.5 hours preparing the motion and appearing at the hearing, at a
rate of $400.00 per hour, plus $61.65 for the filing fee). The amount requested
is reasonable.  
 
Accordingly, sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff in the amount
of $1,061.65, payable within 60 days.
