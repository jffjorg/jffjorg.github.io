Tentative Ruling 
I.            
Defendant East Whitter City School
District’s Demurrer is OVERRULED as to the First Cause of Action and SUSTAINED without
leave to amend as to the Second Cause of Action. 
II.           
Defendant East Whitter City School
District’s Motion to Strike is GRANTED in part without leave to amend and MOOT
in part as set forth below.
Defendant to give notice. 
 
In the operative First Amended Complaint filed on March 15,
2024, Plaintiff A.R.D., a minor, by and through her Guardian ad Litem, Richard
R. (“Plaintiff”), alleges that “[w]hile attending LEFFINGWELL ELEMENTARY
between October 2021 and November 2023, Plaintiff, A.R.D. was bullied,
tormented, and verbally and physically assaulted and abused by students of
LEFFINGWELL ELEMENTARY, while on school premises at LEFFINGWELL ELEMENTARY,
during school hours.” (FAC ¶ 8.) Defendants “ignored the bullying of Plaintiff,
A.R.D., and they each failed to supervise students and failed to follow the
applicable policies and procedures on handling bullying and disciplining
bullies, thereby breaching their mandatory duties …” (FAC ¶ 9.) Based thereon,
Plaintiff brings causes of action for 1) Negligence and 2) Sexual Harassment.
Defendant East Whitter City School District demurs to the
First Amended Complaint on the following grounds: (1) Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint improperly alleges claims not included in Plaintiff’s claim form
submitted in accordance with the California Tort Claims Act; (2) Plaintiff’s
claims dating from October 2021 to January 2023 are untimely because Plaintiff
failed to file a government claim with the District within six months of the
accrual of the these claims pursuant to Gov. Code § 911.2; and (3) Plaintiff’s
First Amended Complaint is uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible and fails
to state facts sufficient for the District to know what causes of action are
stated.
Defendant also moves to strike all references to attorney’s
fees and Paragraphs 5, 8, 11, 12, 13, 18 and 19 of the FAC.  
Demurrer 
Legal Standard 
A demurrer can be used
only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack;
or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  No other extrinsic evidence can
be considered (i.e., no “speaking demurrers”).  
 
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City
of Los Angeles Dep’t of Water & Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216,
1228.)  In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face
of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury
Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.  Therefore, it lies
only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.”  (SKF Farms v. Superior Ct. (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902,
905.)  “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action.”  (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
 
Plaintiff does not oppose Defendant’s demurrer to the
Second Cause of Action for Sexual Harassment. 
Therefore, the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action is SUSTAINED
without leave to amend.  
The demurrer to the First Cause of Action for Negligence is
OVERRULED.  A demurrer must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained. (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97.  Here, Defendant challenges portions of the
FAC relating to events which before January 2023 and after July 2023, but not
those which occurred in between. 
Motion to Strike
Upon motion, or at any time in its own discretion, a court
may grant a motion to strike any of the following material: (1) irrelevant,
false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) all or any part of
any pleading not drawn in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule,
or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. §436.) These provisions also
authorize “the striking of a pleading due to improprieties in its form or in
the procedures pursuant to which it was filed.” (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi,
(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 509, 528.)
Attorney Fees 
Plaintiff agrees that paragraph 3 of the prayer for relief
should be stricken: “For reasonable attorneys’ fees allowed by applicable
California Law”.  Therefore, the motion
to strike paragraph 3 of the prayer for attorneys’ fees is GRANTED without
leave to amend.  
Paragraphs 5, 8,
11, 12 and 13 of the First Amended Complaint

Defendant moves to strike these paragraphs in so far as
they allege claims dating from October 2021 to January 2023.  Defendant argues they are untimely because
Plaintiff failed to file a government claim within six months of the accrual of
these claims pursuant to Government Code § 911.2.
The California Tort Claims Act (Act) (Gov.Code, § 810 et
seq.) governs actions against public entities and public employees. The
timeliness of such actions is governed by the specific statute of limitations
set forth in the Government Code, not the statute of limitations applicable to
private defendants. (County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2005) 127
Cal.App.4th 1263, 1267.) Under the Act, no person may sue a public entity or
public employee for “money or damages” unless a timely written claim has been
presented to and denied by the public entity. (Gov.Code, § 945.4.) A claim
pertaining to a cause of action for personal injury must be filed within six
months after the cause of action accrues. (County of Los Angeles, supra, 127
Cal.App.4th at 1267.) “The general rule for defining the accrual of a cause of
action sets the date as the time ‘when, under the substantive law, the wrongful
act is done,’ or the wrongful result occurs, and the consequent ‘liability
arises.’ [Citation.] In other words, it sets the date as the time when the
cause of action is complete with all of its elements.” (Norgart v. Upjohn
Co. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 397.)
Here, Plaintiff does not dispute that the claims dating
from October 2021 to January 2023 are untimely. 
Therefore, Defendant’s motion to strike paragraphs 5, 8, 11, 12 and 13
of the FAC is GRANTED without leave to amend in so far as they allege claims
from October 2021 to January 2023.  
Paragraphs 18 and 19 of the First Amended
Complaint
Plaintiff explains that in October 2023, another peer,
Abraham, verbally bullied Plaintiff on the basis of her race calling her the
“N” word. (FAC ¶18.) In November 2023, another peer, Tatiana, pulled
Plaintiff’s hair and pushed her to the ground. (FAC ¶19.) Plaintiff filed a second
claim form on April 17, 2024, alleging the bullying incidents in October 2023 and
November 2023.  The October 2023 and
November 2023 incidents appear to be within six-months of the April 2024 claim
form.  Defendant does not argue
otherwise.
Therefore, Defendant’s motion to strike paragraphs 18 and
19 of the FAC is MOOT.
