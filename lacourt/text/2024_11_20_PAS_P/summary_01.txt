Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Victor Manuel Perraza Guevara's motion to enter judgment or dismiss the case. Guevara had accepted an offer to compromise with the plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, and submitted payment. However, the plaintiff had dismissed Guevara with prejudice, which means that Guevara no longer has any rights or claims in the case. The court ruled that Guevara lacks standing to bring motions or assert arguments, and that his attempt to submit arguments on behalf of the defaulted defendant, Jerson Arrana, is procedurally improper. The court concluded that Guevara's motion is denied in its entirety.
