 Case Number:  23AHCV00004    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER OVERRULING DEFENDANTS' DEMURRER
TO THE SACI.         INTRODUCTION
            This action
arises from a landlord-tenant dispute concerning premises located at 594 East
Palm Street, Altadena, California. Plaintiff Victoria Lynet (“Plaintiff”)
alleges that she entered into a written lease agreement with Defendants Jamie
Lynn Raymond and Paul Raymond (“Defendants”) in 2011, under which she rented
the property from them. Plaintiff contends that over the course of her tenancy,
spanning more than a decade, Defendants failed to address numerous habitability
and maintenance issues at the property despite her repeated requests.
On August 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) alleging seven causes of action for (1)
Unlawful Actions by Landlord to Influence Tenant to Vacate [Civ. Code §
1940.2]; (2) Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; (3) Unfair Business
Practices [Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200]; (4) Breach of Implied Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (5) Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability;
(6) General Negligence; and (7) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
On September 13, 2024, Defendants
filed a demurrer to the SAC. Plaintiff filed an opposition on November 6, 2024,
and Defendants filed a reply on November 12, 2024.
 Meet and Confer
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and
confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the
responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video
conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.
Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing
the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to
meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer
or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.
(a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).)
In this instance, on August 16,
2024, Defendant’s counsel, Christina Hahn, telephoned Plaintiff’s counsel, Zak
Fisher, to meet and confer before filing the demurrer. (Hahn Decl., ¶ 2)
Following this discussion, on August 21, 2024, Mr. Fisher sent an email
indicating that he would not be amending the complaint. (Hahn Decl., ¶ 3)¿ The
Court finds that the meet and confer requirement has been satisfied.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations
must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”
they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be
accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.) 
Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.)
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10,
subdivision (f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. Demurrers
for uncertainty are disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible
a defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) 
III.      ANALYSIS
A.   
Special Demurrer – Uncertainty
A defendant may demur to a
complaint on the grounds that the pleading is “uncertain.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (f).) Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f), provides
that a pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible. (Ibid.)
A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed because ambiguities can be
clarified through modern discovery procedures. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal.,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrer for uncertainty will be
sustained only where the complaint is so vague that the defendant cannot
reasonably respond—that is, they cannot reasonably determine what issues must
be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against
them. 
Additionally, the objection of
uncertainty does not pertain to a failure to allege sufficient facts. (Brea
v. McGlashan (1934) 3 Cal.App.2d 454, 459.) It pertains instead to doubt
about what the pleader means by the facts alleged. (Ibid.) A demurrer
should not be sustained where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently
clear to apprise the defendant of the issues they must meet. (People v. Lim
(1941) 18 Cal.2d 872, 882.)
Defendant contends that
Plaintiff’s SAC is impermissibly vague and lacks specific details, with each
cause of action relying on generalized, conclusory events without clear timing
or context. Defendant also demurs to the seventh cause of action for IIED,
arguing that Plaintiff has not alleged any specific outrageous actions by
Defendants.
Plaintiff, in opposition, argues
that her claims are adequately pleaded, and the Defendant’s demurrer lacks
merit. 
The Court has reviewed the SAC
and finds the following:
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
failed to repair severe leaks in the laundry room, reported as early as 2012,
which persisted and worsened over a decade, causing significant interior damage
and potential health hazards. Plaintiff claims that, despite contacting
Defendant Paul Raymond, who assured her someone would investigate and fix the
issue, Defendants did not address the leak until after serving a notice to quit
in 2022 (SAC ¶¶ 18–19)
Plaintiff further alleges that
the garage door hinge became non-operational around June 2018. She states she
reported this issue to Defendants in November 2017 after the hinge
malfunctioned and injured her, again in November 2019, but Defendants only sent
a repairman once, failing to resolve the issue. The garage allegedly remained
unusable from 2017 through her tenancy (SAC ¶ 20)¿
Additionally, Plaintiff describes
a persistent rodent infestation, reporting that she had to pay for exterminator
services out-of-pocket without reimbursement from Defendants. She claims
Defendants dismissed her concerns, saying, “Thanks for taking care of it,” and
took no action to address the infestation themselves (SAC ¶ 22)
Plaintiff also alleges that
Defendants refused to change filters for the air conditioning, heating, and
furnace, forcing her to hire professionals for maintenance. She notes that
Defendants only addressed an urgent repair in January 2022, when a fallen tree
damaged the property and a neighboring premises, after pressure from a neighbor
(SAC ¶¶ 23-24)
Plaintiff alleges further
harassment, including Defendants serving her a 60-day notice to quit despite
COVID-19 protections, sending harassing text messages, and insisting she apply
for rent-relief programs despite stating she would still be evicted. Plaintiff
claims Defendants also engaged in other intimidating actions, such as falsely
reporting her dogs to animal control and Defendant Paul Raymond staring
ominously at her residence, prompting her to call the Sheriff (SAC ¶¶ 25,
27–29)
Plaintiff contends that these
actions collectively aimed to pressure her into vacating the premises, causing
her significant emotional distress, including anxiety, depression, and fear of
homelessness (SAC ¶¶ 31–32)¿
The Court finds that these
allegations are sufficiently clear and specific to provide Defendants with
notice of the claims and the timeline of events. A demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and should only be sustained when the complaint is so ambiguous or
unintelligible that the defendant cannot reasonably respond (Khoury v.
Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616). Here, Plaintiff
has presented adequate detail regarding the alleged incidents and their
progression over more than a decade, effectively explaining what occurred. 
Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES
Defendant’s demurrer as to uncertainty.
 B.   
General Demurrer – seventh cause of action
– Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff
has failed to state facts sufficient to support the seventh cause of action for
IIED. A cause of action for IIED requires: “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct
by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the
probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering
severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of
the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct.” (Hughes v.
Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050-51.) Conduct is “outrageous” when it
exceeds all bounds tolerated in a civilized community (Id.).
Additionally, IIED requires intentional or reckless conduct—behavior intended
to inflict injury or engaged in with realization that injury will result (Davidson
v. City of Westminster (1982) 32 Cal.3d 197, 210).
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
allegations fail to establish “outrageous” conduct or an intent to cause
emotional distress and do not demonstrate that Plaintiff suffered severe
distress. Defendant claims the conduct alleged does not meet the high threshold
for IIED.
Here, the Court finds that
Plaintiff’s allegations support the elements required for an IIED claim at this
stage. Plaintiff describes a series of actions by Defendants that, if proven,
could be interpreted as “outrageous” and intentionally distressing. The SAC
alleges a prolonged pattern of neglect and harassment, including failures to
perform necessary repairs, refusal to address infestations, and intimidating
actions meant to force Plaintiff out, such as issuing a notice to quit despite
COVID-19 protections, filing false animal control reports, and Defendant Paul
Raymond’s ominous stares, which led Plaintiff to contact the Sheriff (SAC ¶¶
18-29)
Plaintiff further alleges that
these actions caused her substantial emotional distress, including anxiety,
depression, and fear of becoming homeless (SAC ¶¶ 31-32)¿. While Defendant
contends Plaintiff’s claims lack specificity regarding the IIED elements, the
cumulative nature of the alleged conduct could reasonably be deemed extreme and
intolerable in a civilized society. At this stage, the Court finds the pleading
sufficient and OVERRULES Defendant’s demurrer as to the IIED claim.
The Court OVERRULES Defendant’s
demurrer as to the IIED claim.
IV.       ORDER
            The Court OVERRULES
the demurrer to SAC in its entirety.
Defendants are to respond within 10
days of this order.
 Plaintiff to give notice.
