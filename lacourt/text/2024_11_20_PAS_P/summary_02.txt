The defendants filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that it was unclear and failed to state a cause of action. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations are sufficiently clear and specific to provide notice to the defendants. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has stated a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) and has overruled the defendants' demurrer to that claim. The defendants are ordered to respond to the complaint within 10 days.
