  Case Number:  22BBCV00879    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING VICTOR
MANUEL PERRAZA GUEVARA’S MOTION TO ENTER JUDGMENT OR DISMISSI.         INTRODUCTION
This case arises from a motor
vehicle accident involving Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
Company ("Plaintiff"), Defendant Victor Manuel Perraza Guevara
("Guevara"), and Defendant Jerson Arrana ("Arrana"). Plaintiff
alleges negligence against Arrana as the driver and liability against Guevara
as the vehicle's registered owner under permissive use statutes.
On April 6, 2024, Plaintiff served
Guevara with an offer to compromise pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure section 998, offering to settle for $4,874.56 in satisfaction of all
claims for damages. Guevara accepted the offer on May 3, 2024, and submitted
payment on May 28, 2024.
Plaintiff subsequently dismissed
Guevara with prejudice but continued the action against Arrana, who had
defaulted on May 7, 2024. Guevara now moves to enter judgment in accordance
with the CCP §998 offer or, alternatively, to dismiss the case in its entirety,
arguing that Plaintiff's dismissal of him alone does not reflect the intended
scope of the settlement.
Plaintiff opposes the motion,
asserting that Guevara lacks standing because he was dismissed with prejudice
and is no longer a party to the case. Plaintiff also contends that Guevara paid
before judgment was entered, thereby circumventing the CCP §998 process.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
            The clerk
or Judge shall enter judgment according to a C.C.P. 998 offer to allow judgment
if the following occur:
i) A written offer by one party to
allow judgment to be taken against themselves under certain terms and conditions
is served upon any other party, not less than 10 days prior to commencement of
trial.
ii) Party receiving the offer
accepts it.
iii) Offer and Proof of Acceptance
are filed.
C.C.P. 998(b), (b)(1)
 
III.      ANALYSIS
Guevara argues that the CCP §998
settlement required dismissal of all claims, including those against Arrana.
However, as a party dismissed from this action with prejudice, Guevara lacks
standing to bring forth these arguments. A dismissal with prejudice operates as
a final adjudication, terminating the court's jurisdiction over the matter and
barring any future litigation on the same cause of action between the same
parties (Estate of Redfield (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1526, 1532;
Manning v. Wymer (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 519, 521).
As a result, Guevara has no
standing to bring motions or assert arguments on behalf of himself or any other
party in this case. Furthermore, Guevara’s attempt to submit arguments on
behalf of the defaulted defendant, Arrana, is procedurally improper.
Accordingly, the Court denies
Guevara’s motion in its entirety.
            
IV.       CONCLUSION
            The Court
DENIES Guevara’s motion in its entirety.
            Plaintiff
is to give notice.
