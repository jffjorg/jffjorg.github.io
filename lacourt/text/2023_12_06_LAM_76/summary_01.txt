And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by Ilan N. Rosen Janfaza and Ron A. Rosen Janfaza, who are the defendants in an unlawful detainer action. The defendants have demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer. The judge has found that the demurrers are meritless and have overruled them. The judge notes that the meet and confer requirement does not apply in this case, as it is an unlawful detainer action. The judge also finds that the defendants' arguments rely on extrinsic facts and evidence that are not properly before the court. The judge orders the defendants to answer the complaint within 5 days.
