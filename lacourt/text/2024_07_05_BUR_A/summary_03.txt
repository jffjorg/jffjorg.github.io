And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge F.M. Tavelman in a case involving a plaintiff, Melise Vartanians, who was attacked by a dog owned by Artur Nersisyan. The defendant, 428 E. Santa Anita Homeowners Association, has demurred to each of the plaintiff's causes of action and moved to strike punitive damages. The Court has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for strict liability without leave to amend, sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for negligence with 20 days' leave to amend, and sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress without leave to amend. The Court has also granted the motion to strike punitive damages as moot. The Court has provided the plaintiff with an opportunity to amend her negligence claim, and has warned that any subsequent amendment would require specific allegations as to the conduct of individual HOA leaders.
