And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion for summary judgment brought by Jivan Melikian, M.D. and has concluded that the motion is granted. The Court finds that Melikian's actions were within the standard of care as demonstrated by the expert testimony of Subbarao Mylavarapu, M.D. The Court notes that neither the plaintiffs nor the cross-complainants have produced expert testimony in contravention of Mylavarapu's statements.

The Court finds that the plaintiffs' claims for medical negligence against Melikian are based on the failure to ensure that Decedent received the prescribed medication Plavix, but that Melikian's actions were within the standard of care. The Court also finds that the plaintiffs' survival action must fail as they are unable to establish any triable issues of material fact regarding the breach element of the wrongful death cause of action.

The Court notes that the failure to file an opposition to the motion indicates the other parties' acquiescence that the motion is meritorious. The Court concludes that Melikian's motion for summary judgment is granted.
