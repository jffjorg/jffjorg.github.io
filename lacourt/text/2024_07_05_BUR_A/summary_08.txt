**Summary**
The judge has denied the motion to set aside default and stay writ brought by Summit Medical Supply Corp. The court finds that Summit Medical Supply Corp. has not produced sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it did not receive actual notice of the litigation. The court notes that the declarations and documentary evidence submitted by Summit Medical Supply Corp. appear to concern only the previous unlawful detainer action and do not address the instant case.
