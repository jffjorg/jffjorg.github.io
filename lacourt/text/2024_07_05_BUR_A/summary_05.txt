And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend the complaint filed by Plaintiff Gagan H. Palrecha. The Plaintiff originally brought an action for unlawful detainer against Defendants Loyalty Creative Enterprise, LLC, Nicholas S. Larsen, and Peter Munzo, alleging that they were improperly in possession of the property known as 4248 Vanetta Drive, Studio City, CA 91604. However, since the Defendants have quit the premises, the Plaintiff now seeks to remove the cause of action for unlawful detainer and add causes of action for breach of contract, conversion, property damage, and unfair competition.

The Plaintiff's motion is granted, and the Plaintiff has 20 days to file a first amended complaint. The Court finds that the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rules 3.1324(a) and (b) are satisfied, and that allowing the Plaintiff to file the amended complaint will increase the likelihood of the case being resolved efficiently on the merits. The trial in this case has not yet been set, so there would be no prejudice to the Defendants if the Plaintiff is allowed to amend its complaint at this time.
