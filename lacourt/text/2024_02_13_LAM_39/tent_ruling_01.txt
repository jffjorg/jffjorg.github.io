  Case Number:  BC655251    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  39 Carmen Fuentes, et
al. v. Jonathan Betuel, et al.
Case No. BC655251
Motions for
Attorneys’ Fees
 
            Plaintiff
Carmen Fuentes (“Fuentes”) and her two catering companies (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Jonathan Betuel and Rhea Espino
(collectively, “Defendants”) stemming from Defendants’ contemplated purchase of
businesses from Fuentes and her husband. 
The court (Feffer, J.) granted summary judgment and awarded attorneys’
fees to Defendants under Civil Code section 1717.  The District Court of Appeal affirmed that
decision but remanded for this court to resolve certain discrepancies.  Defendants also filed a motion for their
attorneys’ fees on appeal.
 
            A.        Attorneys’ Fees Following Remand 
 
            Judge
Feffer awarded Defendants attorneys’ fees in the amount of $113,745.  The District Court of Appeal noted two
discrepancies.  First, the Court noted
that the award should have been $112,420, based upon the additions and
subtractions contained in Judge Feffer’s orders.  Second, the Court noted: “[T]he settled
statement does appear to support plaintiffs’ view of the trial court’s
calculations,” specifically, that there was a double recovery of attorneys’
fees for two discovery motions.  The Court
held: “Because the settled statement suggests the attorney fee award is
inconsistent with the trial court’s stated rationale for the award—by at least
$10,200, not an insignificant amount—remand will permit the trial court to make
any warranted modification to the award and to support its calculation with
adequate clarity.”  The Court agrees that
the record does not support Judge Feffer’s award of attorneys’ fees, and the
Court finds no good cause to increase the amount for “time and/or rate for any
of the work done,” which the Court of Appeal contemplated may explain the
discrepancy.  Therefore, the Court corrects
the award of attorneys’ fees from $113,745 to $102,220.  
 
            B.        Motion for Attorneys’ Fees on Appeal 
 
            Defendants
seek additional attorneys’ fees in the amount of $18,210 for the appeal in this
case.  The determination of reasonable
amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial courts. (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins
v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79
Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.) “The determination of what constitutes a
reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In setting the hourly rate for an attorney
fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees customarily
charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar work.’”  (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems,
Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour],
overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993)
6 Cal. 4th 644, 664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to
prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center
for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App.
4th 603, 615.)  The Court has broad
discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which
will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error
of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.”  (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008)
167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.)  The Court need not explain its
calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the
factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM
Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)  
 
The Court finds that the requested
hours (60.7 hours) is reasonable and commensurate with what the Court would
expect for an appeal.  The Court finds
that the requested billing rate ($300) is reasonable under the circumstances.  The Court notes that this motion is not
opposed.  Therefore, the Court grants the
motion and orders Plaintiffs to pay additional attorneys’ fees in the amount of
$18,210 to Defendants.  
 
            C.        Conclusion and Order 
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the Court orders Plaintiffs to pay Defendants, by and through
counsel, a total of $120,430 in attorneys’ fees within ninety (90) days.  Defendants shall provide notice and file
proof of such with the Court.
