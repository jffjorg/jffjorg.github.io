Significant Statements:
  - "Because the settled statement suggests the attorney fee award is inconsistent with the trial court's stated rationale for the award—by at least $10,200, not an insignificant amount—remand will permit the trial court to make any warranted modification to the award and to support its calculation with adequate clarity."
  - "The determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally 'begins with the 'lodestar,' i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….'"
  - "The Court has broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which will not be overturned absent a 'manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.'"

On appeal, the District Court of Appeal noted discrepancies in the award and remanded the case for correction.
