And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made some observations regarding the recent filings from the defendants. Specifically, the court notes that the defendants filed two demurrers on the same day, but failed to file a notice of errata to correct the duplicate filings. The court also notes that the plaintiff's oppositions were labeled incorrectly on the docket, which wasted judicial resources. Additionally, the court points out errors in the citations used in the defendants' demurrer. The court encourages the defendants' counsel to proofread their papers more carefully before filing them with the court. The judge intends to address these issues in the upcoming court hearing.
