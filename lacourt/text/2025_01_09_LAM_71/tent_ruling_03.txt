 Hearing Date:  January 9, 2025



 
Plaintiff
Eileen Vines’ motion for attorneys’
fees, costs, and expenses is denied.

 
Plaintiff Eileen Vines (“Vines”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves for an order awarding her a total of $187,624.62  in attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses against
Defendant American
Honda Motor Co. (“AHM”) (“Defendant”), consisting of (1) $127,759.50 in
attorney fees for Strategic Legal Practices, APC (“SLP”); (2) a 1.35 multiplier
enhancement on the attorney fees (or $44,715.83); (3) $10,149.29 in costs and
expenses for SLP; and (4) an additional $5,000.00 for Plaintiff’s counsel to
review Defendant’s Opposition, draft the Reply, and attend the hearing on this
Motion (though counsel expects to incur over $5,000.00 in fees on these tasks).
(Notice of Motion, pg. i; Civ.
Code §§1794(d), 998.)  
 
Request for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff’s 10/1/24 request for
judicial notice of Exhibits 1-22 is denied as irrelevant.
 
Background
This is a lemon law action
brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”).  Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s C.C.P. §998
offer of compromise (“998 Offer”) on February 28, 2024,
in the amount of $90,000.00 plus attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses by
motion.  (Decl. of Baker ¶85, Exh. 9 at
pg. 2.)  
On
October 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  On December 26, 2024, Defendant filed its
opposition.  On January 2, 2025,
Plaintiff filed her reply.
On
October 24, 2024, this Court denied the parties’ joint stipulation to set aside
this Court’s dismissal of Plaintiff’s Complaint without prejudice on August 15,
2024, pursuant to C.C.P. §583.410 and CRC, Rule 3.1385(b).
 
Discussion
This Court dismissed this matter, pursuant to C.C.P. §583.410
and CRC, Rule 3.1385(b).  This Court did
not dismiss this matter pursuant to C.C.P. §664.6 and did not retain
jurisdiction over the parties to enforce their settlement.  Therefore, this Court does not have
jurisdiction over this matter and cannot rule on the instant motion.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion is denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for
attorneys’ fees, costs, and expenses is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
