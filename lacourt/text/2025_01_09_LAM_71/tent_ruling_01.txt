JOSE MACHUCA,  
 
  
         vs.
 
TURNER FIBERFILL INC., et al.


 Case No.: 
  18STCV05654 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  January 10, 2025



 
Plaintiff
Jose Machuca’s unopposed motion to amend the judgment in this matter is
granted.
 
          Plaintiff
Jose Machuca (“Machuca”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed for this Court to
amend the judgment in this matter entered against Defendants Turner Fiberfill
Inc. (“Turner Fiberfill”) and Baron HR Inc. (“Baron HR”) (collectively,
“Defendants”).  (Notice of Motion, pg.
2.)[1]  Plaintiff moves pursuant to C.C.P. §§128, 177,
187, 410.50, and this Court’s inherent equitable powers to do justice and carry
its jurisdiction into effect.  (Notice of
Motion, pg. 2.)  Plaintiff moves on the grounds
that the original judgment entered in this matter does not reflect the
additional $34,080.27 owed pursuant to the escalator clause in the Parties’
settlement agreement.  (Notice of Motion,
pg. 2.)  Plaintiff argues that although
Turner Fiberfill paid its portion of the settlement, including its percentage
share of the escalator amount, Baron HR has failed to make any payment of the
judgment, thereby requiring Plaintiff to move to enforce the judgment.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)  Plaintiff argues that prior to enforcing the
judgment, the judgment must be amended to reflect the payments already made by
Turner Fiberfill and also the increased escalator amount.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2.)
 
Background
On or about August 8, 2018, Plaintiff filed
a letter with the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (“LWDA”) and provided
a copy to Defendants via certified mail alleging (1) overtime violations; (2)
minimum wage violations; (3) meal period violations; (4) rest period
violations; (5) timing of payment during employment violations; (6) pay check
stub violations; (7) record keeping violations; and (8) timing of final payment
upon termination violations. (Decl. of Payne ¶2.) 
On or about November 20, 2018, Plaintiff
filed the operative Complaint alleging ten causes of action: (1) Retaliation;
(2) Wrongful Termination; (3) Failure to Pay Overtime Wages; (4) Failure to Pay
Minimum Wages; (5) Failure to Provide Rest Periods; (6) Failure to Provide Meal
Periods; (7) Failure to Provide Accurate and Itemized Wage Statements; (8)
Failure to Timely Pay All Wages Due Upon Separation of Employment; (9) Unfair
Business Practices Pursuant to Business and Professions Code §17200 et seq.;
and (10) Private Attorney General Act, Labor Code § 2698 et seq. (“PAGA”).
On or about March 30, 2022, the Parties
attended a mediation with Jeffrey Krivis, Esq. and agreed to resolve the matter
for a Gross Settlement Amount of Two Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars
($240,000.00).  (Decl. of Payne ¶4.)  On or about July 12, 2022, the Parties
finalized and fully executed the settlement, the material terms of which are
encompassed in the Settlement Agreement and Release (“Settlement Agreement”).  (Decl. of Payne ¶5.)  At the time the Parties entered into the
Settlement, Defendants represented there were 8,845 pay periods at issue. (Decl.
of Payne ¶5.)  The Settlement
Agreement provided that if the actual number of pay periods by the Effective
Date exceeds 8,845 by more than 10%, Defendants agreed to increase the total
Settlement Payment proportionally.  (Decl.
of Payne ¶5.) 
On September 9, 2022, the Parties filed a
Joint Stipulation for Order Approving PAGA Settlement.  (Decl. of Payne ¶6.)  On November 3, 2022, the Court sign the Order
Approving PAGA Settlement.  (Decl. of Payne
¶6, Exh. A.)
Following the approval, the Settlement
Administrator received data from Defendants and determined that there were six
hundred thirteen (613) Aggrieved Employees who worked eleven thousand eight
hundred seventy-three (11,873) Pay Periods during the Covered Period from
November 20, 2017, to November 2, 2022.  (Decl. of Payne ¶7, Exh. B.)  Based on this evaluation, the Settlement
Administrator determined that the Escalator Clause was triggered, increasing
the Gross Settlement Amount from $240,000.00 to $274,080.27.  (Decl. of Payne ¶7, Exh. B.)  On November 9, 2022, the Settlement
Administrator received a payment of $115,000.00 from Turner Fiberfill.  (Decl. of Payne ¶7, Exh. B.)  On September 8, 2023, the Settlement
Administrator received a check from Turner Fiberfill to Plaintiff for his
individual settlement and enhancement, for a total of $140,000.00 paid by
Turner Fiberfill.  (Decl. of Payne ¶7, Exh.
B.) However, Baron HR has not made any payments to the Settlement
Administrator.  (Decl. of Payne ¶7, Exh.
B.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on
September 30, 2024.  As of the date of
this hearing no opposition has been filed.
 
Motion to Amend Judgment
Legal Standard
“Section 187 grants every court the power
and authority to carry its jurisdiction into effect. [Citation.] This includes
the authority to amend a judgment to add an alter ego of an original judgment
debtor, and thereby make the additional judgment debtor liable on the judgment.
[Citation.]”  (Highland Springs
Conference & Training Center v. City of Banning (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th
267, 280, internal citations omitted.)
“Section 187 contemplates amending a
judgment by noticed motion. [Citations.] 
The court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion to
amend a judgment, but may rule on the motion based solely on declarations and
other written evidence. [Citation.]”  (Id.,
internal citations omitted.)
          
          Discussion
           Plaintiff’s
motion is granted.  Here, the Court has
jurisdiction over the matter, since the matter remains pending and has not yet
been dismissed.  It does not appear that
other statutes address the situation.  Indeed,
although C.C.P. §473 does have a provision for amending judgments, it appears
to only apply to judgments that are “against” the moving party.  (See C.C.P. §473(b).)  Because the judgment was against Defendants
Turner Fiberfill and Baron HR, the statute does not apply to Plaintiff, the
moving party.  
Similarly, C.C.P. §663 only applies where
there is an incorrect legal or factual basis underlying the judgment, which are
not present here.
Defendant Baron HR’s conduct makes clear
that it has no intent of paying the funds owed on the judgment absent an
enforcement of the judgment.  The
judgment must be amended to reflect the total amounts owed on the Settlement
Agreement.  Therefore, pursuant to C.C.P.
§187, an amended judgment must be filed to account for the additional Escalator
funds before it can enforce the judgment against Baron HR.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is granted.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s unopposed motion to amend the judgment to account for the additional Escalator
funds is granted.
Moving Party to give notice.
