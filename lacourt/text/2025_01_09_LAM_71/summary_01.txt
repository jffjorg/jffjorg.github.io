As for the summary in English text, here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules that the plaintiff's unopposed motion to amend the judgment is granted. The original judgment did not reflect the additional $34,080.27 owed due to the escalator clause in the settlement agreement. The defendant, Turner Fiberfill Inc., has paid its portion of the settlement, including the escalator amount, but the other defendant, Baron HR Inc., has failed to make any payments. The judge finds that Baron HR has no intention of paying the funds owed on the judgment absent an enforcement of the judgment. Therefore, the judgment must be amended to reflect the total amounts owed on the settlement agreement before it can be enforced against Baron HR.
