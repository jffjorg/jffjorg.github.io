 Hearing
  Date:  January 9, 2025



 
Defendants HG Law, APC’s and Hyka A. Karapetian’s
demurrer to Plaintiffs Lilit Keshishyan’s and Levon Ehtibaryan’s third amended
complaint is sustained without leave to amend in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,
and 5th causes of action. 
Defendants HG Law, APC’s and
Hyka A. Karapetian’s motion to strike is denied as moot. 
 
Defendants HG Law, APC (“HG Law”) and Hyka H. Karapetian (“Karapetian”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) demur to Plaintiffs Lilit Keshishyan’s (“Keshishyan”) and Levon
Ehtibaryan’s (“Ehtibaryan”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) third amended
complaint (“TAC”).  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§430.10
et seq.)  Defendants also move to strike
portions of the TAC.  (Notice of MTS, pgs.
1-2; C.C.P. §§435, 436.)
 
Background
Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint on August 22, 2023.  On November 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their
first amended complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants.  On March 19, 2024, this Court sustained
Defendants’ demurrer to each cause of action in the FAC with 20 days leave to
amend.  (3/19/24 Minute Order.)
Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint (“SAC”) against
Defendants on April 11, 2024.  This Court
sustained Defendants’ demurrer to each cause of action in the SAC with 20 days
leave to amend.  (9/17/24 Minute Order.) 
Plaintiffs filed the operative TAC on October 7, 2024, alleging
five causes of action: (1) legal malpractice; (2) breach of fiduciary duty; (3)
fraud and deceit; (4) breach of contract; and (5) violation of Penal Code §496.
This action arises out of Plaintiffs retaining HG Law on June 28,
2017, to represent them regarding a June 27, 2017, auto collision that occurred
in Glendale, California, for a personal injury action against Commercial Waste
Services Inc. and its driver, Ramon Alcantara.  (TAC ¶¶19-20.)  
Plaintiffs allege they each executed separate Client Services
Agreements for the retention of Defendants in the personal injury action.  (TAC ¶21.) 
 Plaintiffs allege the Client
Services Agreements for Plaintiffs were contingency fee agreements and provided
that the attorney’s fees for Defendants were as follows: 33 1/3% if a recovery
was made before filing suit, 40% if any recovery was made after suit, 50% in
the event of an appeal, and 0% if no recovery was obtained.  (TAC ¶21.)  
Plaintiffs allege the scope of the Client Services Agreements executed
by Plaintiffs are specifically limited to the personal injury action.  (TAC ¶21.)
Plaintiffs allege that in or about 2016, Defendants represented
Plaintiff Ehtibaryan in a criminal case filed in Los Angeles Superior Court,
Case Number 6MN08323.  (TAC ¶18.)  Plaintiffs allege Defendants failed to enter
in a written fee agreement for their services with Ehtibaryan, and instead
orally agreed that Ehtibaryan would pay a total sum of $8,000 for their
services, which included full representation including through trial.  (TAC ¶18.) 
Plaintiffs allege Ehtibaryan paid Defendants $3,000 as a retainer for
their services, with a balance due of $5,000.  (TAC ¶18.) 
Plaintiffs allege Defendants never attempted to collect the $5,000
balance from Ehtibaryan within the statute of limitations period.  (TAC ¶18.) 
Plaintiffs allege the oral fee agreement for $8,000 is voidable by
Ehtibaryan as a result of Defendants’ failure to comply with Business and Professions
Code §6148, et seq., which requires fee agreements to be in writing for fees
over $1,000.  (TAC ¶18.)
Plaintiffs allege Ehtibaryan’s Client Services Agreement with Defendants
for the personal injury action did not provide that the $5,000 balance due from
his separate criminal case would be taken out of his recovery in the personal
injury action.  (TAC ¶22.)
Plaintiffs allege Defendants did not disclose or advise Plaintiffs
of any potential conflict(s) of interest with respect to the firm’s
representation of multiple parties in the same action, and Defendants did not
present or obtain Plaintiffs’ informed written consent to joint representation
despite the potential for conflict(s) of interest arising from such joint
representation.  (TAC ¶23.)
On November 8, 2024, Defendants filed the notice of the instant
demurrer.  On December 12, 2024,
Defendants filed the instant demurrer and motion to strike.[1]  On December 26, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed their oppositions.[2]  Defendants filed their
combined reply on January 2, 2025.
 
A.  
Demurrer
Summary of Demurrer
Defendants demur to Plaintiffs’ 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes
of action.  Defendants demur on the basis
that all of Plaintiffs’ causes of action are barred by the applicable statute
of limitations.  (Demurrer, pgs. 2-4;
C.C.P. §430.10(e).)  Defendants demur on
the basis that all of Plaintiffs’ causes of action fail to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendants.  (Demurrer, pgs. 2-4; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)  Defendants demur on the basis all of
Plaintiffs’ causes of action are uncertain. 
(Demurrer, pgs. 2-4; C.C.P. §430.10(f).) 
Finally, Defendants demur on the basis the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes
of action are duplicative.  (Demurrer,
pgs. 2-4; Kracht v. Perrin, Gartland & Doyle (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d
1019, 1022-1023; Loube v. Loube (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 421, 429-431; Award
Metals, Inc. v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1135.)[3]
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
(C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) 
A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the
meet and confer process.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
Defendants’ counsel declares that on December 5, 2024, she called
Plaintiffs’ counsel and left a voicemail, which went ignored.  (Decl. of Koshkaryan ¶8.)  Defendants’ counsel’s declaration is
sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a). 
Accordingly, the Court will consider the instant demurrer.
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Uncertainty & Statute of Limitations
A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the
complaint is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., he or she
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what
counts or claims are directed against him or her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
If the complaint contains enough facts to apprise defendant of the
issues it is being asked to meet, failure to label each cause of action is not
ground for demurrer: “Although inconvenient, annoying and inconsiderate, the
lack of labels . . . does not substantially impair [defendant’s] ability to
understand the complaint.” (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986)
185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 n.2.)
C.C.P. §340.6 provides in part, “[a]n action against an attorney
for a wrongful act or omission, other than for actual fraud, arising in the
performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year
after the plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence
should have discovered, the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,
whichever occurs first.”  (C.C.P.
§340.6(a), emphasis added.)
Plaintiffs allege that on June 28, 2017, they retained Defendants
to represent them regarding the auto collision in a personal injury action
against Commercial Waste Services Inc. and its driver, Ramon Alcantara.  (TAC ¶20.) 
Plaintiffs allege on or about June 26, 2019, Defendants, on behalf of
Plaintiffs, filed a personal injury action in Los Angeles Superior Court, which
was assigned Case Number 19STCV22401, Lilit Keshishyan, et al. v. Ramon
Alcantara, et al. (“Personal Injury Action”).  (TAC ¶24.)
Plaintiffs allege on August 15, 2022, Plaintiff Keshishyan saw
that the Court’s Register of Actions reflected a Request for Dismissal had been
filed in June 2022.  (TAC ¶33.)  Plaintiffs allege Plaintiff Keshishyan did
not understand what it meant that a Request for Dismissal had been filed in the
case, and immediately texted Defendant Karapetian and referenced the dismissal
and asked for an update on the case.  (TAC
¶33.)  Plaintiffs allege Defendant Karapetian
replied, indicating disbursement is not finalized, that she had arrived back in
the country on August 9, 2022, that she had caught Covid, and explained she
would call Plaintiffs “as soon as everything is finalized,” although Defendant
Karapetian did not explain the status or what she meant by “everything” or what
was actually being “finalized.”  (TAC
¶33.)  Plaintiffs allege she also did not
explain what it meant that a Request for Dismissal had been filed.  (TAC ¶33.)
Plaintiffs allege during the meeting at Defendants’ office on
August 23, 2022, Defendant Karapetian finally disclosed that she had settled
Plaintiffs’ personal injury action for $80,000.00 on or around June 15, 2022.  (TAC ¶36.) 
Plaintiffs allege she also informed Plaintiffs that she had signed the
written release agreement memorializing the terms of the settlement on behalf
of Plaintiffs and confirmed that the Request for Dismissal filed in June 2022
had been filed “with prejudice” and therefore had fully and completely disposed
of the Personal Injury Action.  (TAC
¶36.)
The one-year limitations period for professional negligence, at a
minimum, was triggered on August 15, 2022, by Plaintiffs’ discovery of the
facts constituting the alleged act or omission, i.e., the filing of the request
for dismissal without their knowledge or consent. The one-year limitations
period is triggered by Plaintiffs’ discovery of the facts constituting the
alleged act or omission, not “by his discovery that such facts constitute
professional negligence, i.e. by discovery that a particular legal theory is
applicable based on the known facts.”  (Peregrine
Funding, Inc. v. Sheppard Mullin (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 658, 684; see
Laird v. Blacker (1992) 2 Cal.4th 606, 609 [holding C.C.P. §340.6(a)’s
one-year-from-discovery limitation period commences when he or she suffers an
adverse judgment or dismissal in the underlying action].)  Defendants filed their original complaint on
August 22, 2023, after the one-year statute had expired on August 15, 2023.  
Plaintiffs’ 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th causes of action are also
subject to a one-year statute of limitations. 
(Stoll v. Superior Court (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1362, 1363 [“…we
hold that the statute of limitations within which a client must commence an
action against an attorney on a claim for legal malpractice or breach of a
fiduciary duty is identical”]; Austin v. Medicis (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th
577, 587 [stating breach of contract and constructive fraud claims are governed
by statute of limitations for attorney malpractice]; Foxen v. Carpenter (2016)
6 Cal.App.5th 284.)
The Court views the SAC as alleging at least two distinct wrongful
acts by Defendants: (1) causing Plaintiffs’ suit against Commercial Waste
Services Inc. and its driver, Ramon Alcantara, to be dismissed without Plaintiffs’
consent; and (2) not dispersing the settlement pursuant to the settlement
terms. 
The Court agrees that the one-year statute of limitations as to
the first act ran on August 15, 2023, when Plaintiffs discovered that the
matter had been dismissed. As to the second act, however, the Court finds that
the statute for that did not run until August 23, 2023, such that Plaintiffs’
present action would be timely filed.
The Court finds that the SAC does not adequately distinguish between
these two acts, rendering it uncertain. 
The defect identified in the instant demurrer is the same as presented
in the last demurrer to the SAC.   However,
“a general demurrer does not lie to only part of a cause of action. If there
are sufficient allegations to entitle plaintiff to relief, other allegations
cannot be challenged by general demurrer.”  (Daniels v. Select Portfolio Servicing,
Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1167, disapproved on other
grounds by Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th
905, 948 n.12).)  It is not necessary
that the cause of action be the one intended by plaintiff. The test is whether
the complaint states any valid claim entitling plaintiff to relief.  Thus, plaintiff may be mistaken as to the
nature of the case, or the legal theory on which plaintiff can prevail. But if
the essential facts of some valid cause of action are alleged, the complaint is
good against a general demurrer.  (Quelimane
Co., Inc. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38-39; New
Livable California v. Association of Bay Area Governments (2020) 59 Cal.App.5th
709, 714-715; Adelman v. Associated International Insurance Co. (2001)
90 Cal.App.4th 352, 359; see Sheehan v. San Francisco 49ers, Ltd. (2009)
45 Cal.4th 992, 998 [stating general demurrer may be upheld “only if the
complaint fails to state a cause of action under any possible legal theory”
(emphasis added)].) 
Because Plaintiff alleges sufficient causes of action pertaining
to Defendants not dispersing the settlement pursuant to the settlement terms, a
demurrer is not the proper mechanism to attack the pleadings; rather, a motion
to strike is more appropriate.
Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer on the basis of uncertainty is overruled. 
 
          Failure to State
a Cause of Action
          Legal
Malpractice (1st COA)
“The elements of a cause of action in tort for professional
negligence are (1) the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence,
and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise;
(2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the
negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage
resulting from the professional’s negligence.”  (Budd v. Nixen (1971) 6 Cal.3d 195,
200.)
          “In addressing
breach of duty, ‘the crucial inquiry is whether [the attorney’s] advice was so
legally deficient when it was given that he [or she] may be found to have
failed to use “such skill, prudence, and diligence as lawyers of ordinary skill
and capacity commonly possess and exercise in the performance of the tasks
which they undertake.”’”  (Blanks v.
Seyfarth Shaw LLP (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 336, 357, internal citations
omitted.)
          The plaintiff must
prove that but for the attorney’s negligent acts or omissions, the
plaintiff would have obtained a more favorable result.  (Viner v. Sweet (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1232,
1244.)
“‘[T]he requirement that the plaintiff prove causation should not
be confused with the method or means of doing so. Phrases such as “trial within
a trial,” “case within a case,” . . . and “better deal” scenario describe
methods of proving causation, not the causation requirement itself or the test
for determining whether causation has been established.’”  (Knutson v. Foster (2018) 25
Cal.App.5th 1075, 1091, internal citations omitted.)
“The measure of damages in a [breach of fiduciary duty] case
predicated on
legal malpractice ‘is the difference between what was recovered
and what would have been recovered, but for the attorney’s wrongful act or
omission.’”  (Mosier v. Southern
California Physicians Insurance Exchange (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1022,
1049-1050.)
          Plaintiffs allege
that on June 28, 2017, Plaintiffs, and each of them, retained Defendants as their
attorney and legal counsel in connection with the preserving and prosecuting of
Plaintiffs’ claims for money damages and other relief in a personal injury
action which was ultimately filed on June 26, 2019.  (TAC ¶47.) 

Plaintiffs allege Defendants owed Plaintiffs a duty of care
including the duty to employ at least such skill, prudence, and diligence that
attorneys of ordinary skill and capacity need, commonly possess, and exercise
in the performance of the tasks which they undertake, and to represent and
protect their client’s interests in the conduct of such representation.  (TAC ¶48.)
Plaintiffs allege Defendants breached their applicable standards
of care and failed to exercise ordinary and reasonable skill, prudence, zeal,
care and diligence in undertaking to perform such legal services for
Plaintiffs, and negligently and carelessly breached their duties which Defendants
owed to Plaintiffs by, inter-alia: (a) Engaging in self-dealing and charging
illegal and/or unconscionable fees; (b) Breaching the ethical duties of good
faith, loyalty and fidelity; (c) Misappropriation of Plaintiff’s settlement
funds; (d) Acquiring a pecuniary interest adverse to Plaintiffs without
satisfying the requirements of Cal. R. Prof. Conduct 1.8.1; (e) Failing to
communicate including but not limited to failure to communicate all (or any)
settlement offers to Plaintiffs, and each of them; (f) Failing to obtain
Plaintiffs’ agreement to settlement amounts and terms negotiated on behalf of
Plaintiffs, and each of them; (g) Signing the settlement agreement(s) and
release on behalf of, and without authorization of Plaintiffs, and each of
them;  (h) Wrongfully withholding
settlement funds that should have been distributed to Plaintiffs, all as
further pled hereafter; and (i) Forging a promissory note.  (TAC ¶51.)
Plaintiffs allege as a proximate result of Defendants’
acts and omissions and malpractice, as aforesaid, Plaintiffs suffered injuries
and damages in amount(s) subject to proof at trial, for inter-alia being
compelled to enter into an unauthorized settlement of the underlying personal
injury action and unauthorized manner of, commingling of, and disbursement of
settlement funds.  (TAC ¶52.)
Plaintiffs allege their economic damages in amount(s) subject to
proof at trial, are calculated as follows: (1) For Plaintiff Keshishyan, her
total recovery was $45,000, from which attorney’s fees of 40% were $18,000,
litigation costs and associated liens were resolved with a balance due of
$2,000; therefore, Plaintiff Keshishyan should have received $25,000. After the
payment $15,000 and Plaintiff Keshishyan’s request that the remaining disputed
amounts be held in trust, she is currently owed a total of $10,000 by
Defendants for the settlement in her personal injury case; (2) for Plaintiff
Ehtibaryan, his total recovery was $35,000, from which attorney’s fees of 40%
were $14,000, litigation costs and associated liens were resolved with a
balance due of $1,600; therefore, Plaintiff Ehtibaryan should have received
$19,400. Plaintiff Ehtibaryan was paid $0 from the settlement proceeds, so
Defendants owe him a total of $19,400 for the settlement of his personal injury
case.  (TAC ¶53.)
Plaintiffs fail to sufficiently allege a cause of action for legal
malpractice arising from Defendants’ failure to disburse settlement funds.  Plaintiffs fail to allege
a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting
injury.  (See Viner
v. Sweet (2003) 30 Cal.4th pg. 1244 [“The plaintiff must prove that but for
the attorney’s negligent acts or omissions, the plaintiff would have
obtained a more favorable result.”], emphasis added.)
Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the 1st cause of action is
sustained without leave to amend.
 
Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Fraud and Deceit, Breach of Contract,
& Violation of Penal Code 496 (2nd, 3rd, 4th, & 5th COAs)
          Any attempt to
clone a legal malpractice claim in order to multiply remedies is rejected.
Rather, such a claim sets forth a single cause of action for professional
malpractice.  (Kracht v. Perrin,
Gartland & Doyle (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1019, 1022-1023; Loube v.
Loube (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 421, 429-431; Award Metals, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1135.) 
In Loube v. Loube, the legal malpractice claim was stated
in four purportedly separate causes of action for “professional negligence,
constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.”  (Loube, 64 Cal.App.4th at pg. 425.)  Despite the multiple causes of action alleged,
the Loube Court held that there existed a single cause of action
sounding in professional malpractice.  (Id.
at pg. 430 [“Here, although the parties had a contractual relationship, and
appellant’s claim for legal negligence arose from the relationship between
them, which relationship was founded on a contract, the cause of action sounded
in tort and was no more ‘on the contract’ than a claim for breach of fiduciary
duty or for fraud involving a contract.”].)
Here, Plaintiffs’ causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,
fraud and deceit, breach of contract, and violation of Penal Code §496 are
duplicative of the cause of action for legal malpractice.  (Award Metals, Inc., 228 Cal.App.3d at
pg. 1135.)  Therefore, Defendants’
demurrer to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action are sustained without
leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ TAC is sustained without
leave to amend in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
B.   
Motion to Strike
In
light of the Court’s ruling on the demurrer, Defendants’ motion to strike is
denied as moot.
