[1] The Court notes Defendants filed two demurrers on December
12, 2024: the first at 4:24 PM and the second at 4:33 PM. The Court notes
Defendants did not file a notice of errata concerning the duplicative filings.


[2] The Court notes Plaintiff’s oppositions are labeled on
the docket as “Memorandum of Points & Authorities” rather than indicating
they are oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike, respectively.  In the future, both parties must properly
identify the nature of the filings on the docket to avoid wasting this Court’s
judicial resources.


[3] The Court notes Defendants’ demurrer includes
multiple citation errors, such as leaving out the partial name of a case or
omitting a portion of the reporter issue. 
 (See, e.g., Demurrer, pg.
9 at line 15; page 15 at line 8.) 
Defendants’ counsel is strongly encouraged to proofread their papers
before filing with this Court.
