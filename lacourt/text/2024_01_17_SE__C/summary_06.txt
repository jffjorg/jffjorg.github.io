(Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC)

Summary:

The tentative ruling is that Defendant Morado's Demurrer to the First Cause of Action for Elder Abuse is sustained with leave to amend. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for elder abuse, as required by California law. Specifically, the Plaintiff has not alleged that he was in a caretaking or custodial relationship with Morado, and the allegations of neglect and abuse are vague and lack specificity. The Court grants leave to amend, allowing the Plaintiff to resubmit the complaint with more detailed and specific allegations.
