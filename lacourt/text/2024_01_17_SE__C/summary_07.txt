And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled to overrule the defendant's demurrer, which was filed on the grounds that the plaintiff's complaint is uncertain. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to state the exact amount of rent due on its notice to quit. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's complaint is not uncertain because it provided a reasonable estimate of the rent due and stated that it was an estimate. The judge relied on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1161(a) and (e), which state that a plaintiff can provide a reasonable estimate of the rent due in a commercial notice to quit. The judge also cited McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 78-79, which holds that a demurrer based on an affirmative defense will only be sustained if the face of the complaint discloses that the action is necessarily barred by the defense. The judge ordered the defendant to give notice and set the case for a hearing on January 17, 2024.
