Choi, to the Second Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff C Kim. The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff will not be allowed to revise their complaint. The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff has failed to properly allege a contract between themselves and the Moving Defendants, and that the alleged contract is not between the Plaintiff and the Moving Defendants. The Judge has also cited a California law, Smith v. San Francisco (1990), which states that a contractual relationship is required for an action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
