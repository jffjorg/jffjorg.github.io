And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the Toyota Defendants' demurrer is overruled. The Plaintiffs have adequately alleged their respondeat superior theory of liability, which is outside the scope of the Graves Amendment. The Plaintiffs have alleged that the Toyota Defendants and Uber Defendants created a joint venture to lease or rent vehicles, and that Ortiz was acting within the course and scope of his agency or employment with the joint venture at the time of the accident. The judge has found that the Plaintiffs have stated a cause of action at this stage, and the Toyota Defendants' demurrer is therefore denied.
