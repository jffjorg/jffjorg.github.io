Defendant’s Demurrer is OVERRULED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant Now or Never Express, Corporation
(Defendant) demurs to the Complaint on the grounds that it is uncertain.
Background
This
is a commercial unlawful detainer action filed by Plaintiff MVP Bell Garden
Suva, LLC (Plaintiff) against Defendant regarding the non-payment of rent for
the real property commonly known as 6801 Suva Street, Bell Gardens, CA 90201.
Legal
Standard
The
party against whom a complaint has been filed may object to the pleading, by
demurrer, on several grounds, including the ground that the pleading does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A
party may demur to an entire complaint, or to any causes of action stated
therein. (CCP § 430.50(a).) “‘[A] demurrer based on an affirmative defense will
be sustained only where the face of the complaint discloses that the action is
necessarily barred by the defense.’” (McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co.
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 78-79.)
Discussion

Defendant demurs to the Complaint on the
grounds that it is uncertain because Plaintiff failed to state the exact amount
of rent due on its notice to quit. However, plaintiffs can provide a reasonable
estimate in a commercial notice to quit. (CCP § 1161.(a) and (e).) Here,
Plaintiff provided a reasonable estimate and stated it was an estimate. Thus,
Plaintiff’s Complaint is not uncertain. Therefore, Defendant’s Demurrer is
overruled.
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
Demurrer is OVERRULED.
