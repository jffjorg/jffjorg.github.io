And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses from the defendant, General Motors, LLC. The plaintiff, Juan Sanchez Zamora, had requested that the defendant provide additional documents in response to certain discovery requests. The defendant had initially objected to the requests and failed to produce any documents. After the parties met and conferred, the defendant produced some responsive documents.

The court found that some of the discovery requests were overbroad and ordered the defendant to limit its responses accordingly. Specifically, the court ordered the defendant to provide documents related to its lemon law policies and procedures from the date of purchase to the filing of the lawsuit, as well as codes related to repairs made to the plaintiff's vehicle.

The court also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions against the defendant, finding that the defendant had acted with substantial justification in opposing the plaintiff's overbroad requests. The court ordered the defendant to serve its responses within 30 days of the order.
