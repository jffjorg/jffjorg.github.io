HEARING:   1/17/24 @ 9:30 AM
#3
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED with the limitations set forth below.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is DENIED.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff Carolina Ruiz (Plaintiff) moves to
compel further responses from Defendant General Motors, LLC (Defendant) to her Requests
for Production (set one).
Background
On
September 21, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendant for alleged
violations of the Song-Beverly Act for failure to repair or repurchase
Plaintiff’s vehicle.
Legal
Standard
CCP
§ 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion compelling further answers to
document requests if it finds that the response is inadequate, incomplete, or
evasive, or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  The motion shall be accompanied with a meet
and confer declaration.  (CCP §
2031.310(b).)  
Meet
and Confer
The
Court finds that the parties adequately met and conferred.
Discussion

Plaintiff
seeks to compel further responses to Requests Nos. 16, 19-32, 37-41, 45, and
46. Defendant objected to each Request and initially did not produce any
documents. Defendant has produced some documents during the meet and confer
process.
Requests
Nos. 16 and 19-32 seek Defendant’s lemon law policies and procedures. The Requests are
overbroad as to time. However, Defendant’s lemon law policies and procedures
from the date of purchase to the filing of Plaintiff’s lawsuit are within the
scope of discovery because they are relevant to proving whether Defendant
followed its policies and procedures as to Plaintiff’s vehicle. Therefore,
Defendant is ordered to provide further responses to Requests Nos. 16 and 19-32
with the limitation that it shall produce responsive documents published from
the date of purchase to the date of filing.
Requests
Nos. 37-41 seek codes related to similar vehicles and customer complaints and
labor operations codes from 2017 to present. These requests are overbroad
because they seek information not related to Plaintiff’s vehicle. Therefore,
these requests will be limited to codes related to repairs made to Plaintiff’s
vehicle. Defendant is ordered to provide further responses to Requests Nos.
37-41 with the codes applicable to repairs made to Plaintiff’s vehicle.  
Requests
Nos. 45-46 seek documents related to similar vehicles and customer complaints.
These requests are overbroad because they seek documents related to vehicles
worldwide. Therefore, these requests will be limited repairs and customer
complaints concerning 2017 Chevrolet Silverados sold in California. Defendant
is ordered to provide further responses to Requests Nos. 45-46 as to 2017
Chevrolet Silverados sold in California. 
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories or demand for production of documents
unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.300(d), 2031.310(h),
2033.290(d).) 
Defendant acted with substantial justification
in opposing Plaintiff’s numerous overbroad requests and has provided some
responsive documents prior to Plaintiff filing her Motion.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED
with the limitations set forth above. Defendant is ordered to serve its
responses within 30 days of this Order. Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
DENIED.
