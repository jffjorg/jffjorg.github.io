Plaintiffs’
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production is GRANTED in part.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff Jovanny Teran Rios (Plaintiff) move
to compel Defendant American Honda Motor Co.’s (Defendant) further response to
Request for Production (set one) pursuant to CCP § 2031.310.
Background
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendant for violations of the Song-Beverly Act for failure
to repair or repurchase Plaintiff’s vehicle.
Legal Standard
CCP § 2031.310 allows a party to file a motion
compelling further answers to document requests if it finds that the response
is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection in the response is
without merit or too general.  The motion
shall be accompanied with a meet and confer declaration.  (CCP § 2031.310(b).)  
Meet and Confer
The Court finds that the parties adequately met
and conferred.
Discussion
Plaintiff
seeks to compel further responses to Requests Nos. 19-23, 31-35, 39, 52-54, and
98.
Defendant
has produced documents as to Requests Nos. 19-23, 31-35, 39, and 98. Thus,
Plaintiff’s request to compel further responses as to Requests Nos. 19-23,
31-35, 39, and 98 is denied as moot.
Requests
Nos. 52-53 seek documents related to similar vehicles and customer complaints. 
Request
No. 52: All DOCUMENTS evidencing complaints by owners of 2021 Honda Accord
vehicles regarding any of the complaints that the SUBJECT VEHICLE was presented
to YOUR or YOUR authorized repair facilities for repair during the warranty
period.
Request
No. 53: All DOCUMENTS evidencing warranty repairs to 2021 Honda Accord vehicles
regarding any of the components that YOU or YOUR authorized repair facilities
performed repairs on under warranty.
These
requests are overbroad because they seek documents related to vehicles
worldwide. Therefore, these requests will be limited repairs and customer
complaints concerning 2021 Honda Accords sold in California. Defendant is
ordered to provide further responses to Requests Nos. 52 and 53 as to 2021
Honda Accords sold in California. 
Request
No. 54: All DOCUMENTS produced by YOU in discovery in the matter of Kathleen
Cadena, et al., v. American Honda Motor Company, Inc., et al, United States
District Court, Central District of California Case No. 2:18-cv-04007-MWF-PJW.
Request
No. 54 is overly broad as it seeks all documents produced in a separate class
action lawsuit and cannot easily be limited. This type of request is not
tailored at all to this case. While some documents may be relevant, there are
undoubtedly many documents which are in no way relevant to this action. The
court has no obligation to modify discovery requests to make them entirely
proper. (Deaile v. Gen. Tele. Co. of Cal. (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 841,
850-53.) Thus, Plaintiff’s request for a further response to Request No. 54 is
denied.
Sanctions
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories or demand for production of documents
unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
Here,
Defendant failed to act with substantial justification. Defendant has failed to
provide sufficient justification for it providing discovery responses four
months after Plaintiff filed his Motion. Plaintiff seeks $2,035.00 in sanctions
against Defendant and its counsel of record, consisting of two hours drafting
the motion, two hours reviewing the opposition and drafting a reply, and one
hour preparing for and attending the hearing at a rate of $395.00 per hour and
the $60.00 filing fee. Because Plaintiff has filed a boilerplate motion, the
Court awards sanctions in the reasonable amount of $850.00 for two hours of
attorney’s fees and costs.  
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is GRANTED in part with the
limitations set forth above and DENIED in part. Plaintiff’s request for
sanctions is GRANTED and imposed against Defendant and its counsel of record,
jointly and severally, in the amount of $850.00. This sanction is to be paid
within thirty days of this Order.
