And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by Jovanny Teran Rios, the plaintiff, against American Honda Motor Co., the defendant. The motion was filed in a lawsuit filed on January 18, 2023, alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act for failure to repair or repurchase a vehicle.

The Judge grants the motion in part, ordering the defendant to provide further responses to certain discovery requests (Requests Nos. 52-53) related to similar vehicles and customer complaints sold in California. However, the Judge denies the motion in part, refusing to compel the defendant to provide further responses to other discovery requests (Requests Nos. 19-23, 31-35, 39, and 98) because they are already satisfied.

The Judge also awards sanctions against the defendant and its counsel of record in the amount of $850.00 for failing to provide sufficient justification for their discovery responses.
