And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to bifurcate trial filed by Kelly Walsh Sweeney, the plaintiff. The motion seeks to separate the trial into two parts: determining the validity of a lien asserted by defendant Richard M. Foster, and determining the reasonable value of his services. The judge has granted the motion, citing the need to promote convenience, avoid prejudice, and ensure the efficient handling of the litigation. The judge notes that the threshold issue is whether the lien exists, and that determining this issue is necessary before proceeding to the second inquiry. The judge has also denied the defendant's argument that the motion is time-barred, as the trial is scheduled for September 3, 2024, more than 30 days from the hearing. The judge's ruling will become final unless a party requests oral argument or a signed order.
