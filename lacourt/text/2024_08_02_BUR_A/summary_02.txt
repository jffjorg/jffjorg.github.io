And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge F.M. Tavelman in a case involving Crossroads Equipment Lease and Finance, LLC (Plaintiff) and Shane Weber dba Weber Enterprise (Defendant). The case centers around a breach of written agreement, with the Plaintiff alleging that the Defendant failed to make payments on a Master Equipment Finance Agreement for a 2021 Peterbilt 389 tractor truck. The Plaintiff recovered the truck and sold it for $114,500.00, which was credited to the amounts owing under the agreement. The Defendant has not filed a response to the Plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, which argues that there is no triable issue of fact as to the first cause of action. The Judge grants the motion, finding that the evidence presented shows that the Defendant breached the agreement and that the Plaintiff was harmed as a result.
