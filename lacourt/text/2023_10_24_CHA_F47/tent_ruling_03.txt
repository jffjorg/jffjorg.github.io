SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a landlord-tenant dispute.  Plaintiffs Hillary Nicole Duran and Raffi
Khodagulyan (Plaintiffs), representing themselves, allege that Defendant Rick
Mayelian (Defendant), at all relevant times, was an owner and manager of the
real property located at 24107 Del Monte Drive, Unit 27, Valencia, California
91355 which Plaintiffs were/are renting. 
(Complaint ¶¶2, 6).  Plaintiffs
allege that they fell behind in rent due to COVID-19 and gave notice of same to
Defendant.  (Id. ¶6).  Plaintiffs allege their rent was improperly
increased while COVID-19 protections were in place and that they were
improperly served with a 3 Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit.  (Id. ¶¶8-10).  
 
On 5/31/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendant for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing, (3) Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment of the Premises, (4)
Trespass, (5) Nuisance (Civil Code 3479), (6) Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress, (7) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, (8)
Negligence, (9) Wrongful Eviction (Civil Code 789.3), (10) Constructive
Eviction and (11) Conversion.  On
8/16/23, Defendant filed his answer to the complaint asserting 48 affirmative
defenses.  
 
On 8/22/23, Plaintiffs filed a form declaration, signed
by Hillary Nicole Duran, only, indicating that they met and conferred with
Defendant by telephone and were unable resolve the issues they have with
Defendant’s answer.  On 8/22/23,
Plaintiffs filed and served the instant demurrer to the answer.  Defendant has opposed the demurrer.        
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiffs have demurred to each of the 48 affirmative
defenses in Defendant’s answer on the ground that they fail to allege
sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and they are uncertain because
they do not include factual support.  CCP
430.20(a), (b).
 
 
The main function of a pleading is to give the other
party notice so that it may prepare its case. 
Harris (2013) 56 C4th 203, 240. 
A defect in a pleading that otherwise properly puts the other party on
notice does not affect that party’s substantial rights and is not subject to
demurrer.  Id.   Citation
to a statute in an affirmative defense is sufficient to put a plaintiff on
notice of a defense.  Hata (1995)
31 CA4th 1791, 1805-1806 (disapproved on other grounds in Quigley (2019)
7 C5th 798, 815, fn. 8).
 
An affirmative defense must only comply with general
notice pleading requirements and must be liberally construed.  Jessen (2008) 158 CA4th 1480, 1483
fn.3; CCP 452.  When ruling on a demurrer
to an answer, the Court must also examine the complaint because the sufficiency
of the answer depends, in part, on the complaint to which it responds.  See South Shore Land Co. (1964)
226 CA2d 725, 733.
 
The Court finds that when Defendant’s affirmative
defenses are liberally construed and considered with the allegations in the
complaint, they are sufficient to put Plaintiffs on notice of each defense
alleged.  Plaintiffs have failed to
establish that Defendant will be unable to rely on each of the affirmative defenses
set forth in the answer.  Any
uncertainties regarding the affirmative defenses can be resolved through
discovery.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is overruled.
