And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a demurrer filed by the plaintiffs, Hillary Nicole Duran and Raffi Khodagulyan, against the defendant, Rick Mayelian's, original answer. The demurrer is to the entire answer and each of the 48 affirmative defenses asserted therein. The court finds that the affirmative defenses, when liberally construed and considered with the allegations in the complaint, are sufficient to put the plaintiffs on notice of each defense alleged. The court also notes that any uncertainties regarding the affirmative defenses can be resolved through discovery. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled.
