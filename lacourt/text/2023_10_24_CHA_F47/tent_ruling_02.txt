SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of foreclosure proceedings against
property located at 9251 Notre Dame Avenue in Chatsworth, California (the
Property).  In or about July 2017,
Kenneth T. Perez (Borrower) took out a mortgage loan from Skyline Home Loans in
the amount of $501,215.00.  (Complaint
¶16).  In or around August 2018, Borrower
executed a Power of Attorney in favor of Plaintiff Kyle A. Perez, Executor of
the Estate of Kyle T. Perez (Plaintiff). 
(Id. ¶17).  On 5/26/19,
Borrower died.  (Id. ¶18).  By Last Will and Testament of Kenneth T.
Perez, Plaintiff,   was appointed
executor of the Estate of Kenneth T. Perez. 
Id.  In or around December
2021, Plaintiff alleges that he received a loan modification agreement (2021
Loan Modification Agreement) from Defendant Loancare, LLC (Loancare) executed
by Defendant Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC (Lakeview) stating the first
modification payment would be due on 3/1/22 in the amount of $2,514.84 with an
interest rate of 3.625%.  (Id.
¶19).  Plaintiff alleges that he signed
and notarized the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement and returned it to
Loancare.  (Id. ¶20). 
 
Plaintiff alleges that on or around 1/21/22, he contacted
Loancare and spoke to supervisor, Lashea, who stated Loancare did not receive
the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement.  (Id.
¶21).  Plaintiff alleges that he re-sent
the executed 2021 Loan Modification Agreement to Loancare two more times.  (Id. ¶22).  In or around April 2022, Plaintiff alleges
that Loancare rejected the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement due to signatures
not matching.  (Id. ¶23).  On or around 4/15/22, Plaintiff re-sent the
2021 Loan Modification Agreement to Loancare with notarized signatures along
with two checks for March and April 2022. 
(Id. ¶¶24-25).
 
Plaintiff alleges that instead of applying the two
payments to the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement, Loancare applied them to the
original loan terms.  (Id.
¶26).  Plaintiff contacted Loancare to
inquire why the payments were not being applied to the 2021 Loan Modification
Agreement and requested that if the payments were not going to be applied to
the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement, that they be returned.  (Id. ¶27).  Loancare returned the payments to
Plaintiff.  (Id. ¶28).  Between April 2022 and October 2022,
Plaintiff alleges that he contacted Loancare regarding the status of the
executed 2021 Loan Modification Agreement. 
(Id. ¶29).  On or about
10/17/22, Defendant National Default Servicing Corporation (National Default),
on behalf of Loancare, recorded a Notice of Default (NOD) against the Property.  (Id. ¶30).  Thereafter, from November 2022 through
February 2023, Plaintiff alleges that he spoke to various Loancare agents
regarding the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement. 
(Id. ¶¶31-36).  
 
On or around 2/9/23, National Default, on behalf of
Loancare, recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale (NOS) against the Property
indicating that Loancare intends to sell the Property.  (Id. ¶¶37-38).  
 
On 4/26/23, Plaintiff filed this action against Loancare,
Lakeview and National Default for: (1)   Negligent Misrepresentation; (2) Intentional
Misrepresentation; (3) Declaratory Relief; (4)   Promissory Estoppel and (5) Violation of
Business & Professions Code 17200. 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the issues Loancare and
Lakeview had with the complaint, on 7/23/23, Loancare and Lakeview filed
(served on 6/30/23) the instant demurrer to the entire complaint on the ground
that each cause of action fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause
of action.  CCP 430.10(e); (Klein Decl.).  Plaintiff has opposed the demurrer.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
1st Cause of Action – Negligent
Misrepresentation & 2nd Cause of Action – Intentional
Misrepresentation
 
The elements of a negligent misrepresentation cause
action are: (1) the defendant made a false representation as to a past or
existing material fact; (2) the defendant made the representation without
reasonable ground for believing it to be true; (3) in making the
representation, the defendant intended to deceive the plaintiff; (4) the
plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and (5) the plaintiff
suffered resulting damages.  Majd
(2015) 243 CA4th 1293, 1307.  The
elements of a fraud/intentional misrepresentation cause of action are: (1) a
material representation or deceit that is false; (2) knowledge of falsity; (3)
intent to defraud; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damages.  Philipson & Simon (2007) 154 CA4th
347, 363.      
 
Fraud-based claims must be pled with specific facts
showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made.  Lazar (1996) 12 C4th 631, 645.  When fraud is pled against a corporation, a
plaintiff must allege: (1) the names of the persons who made the allegedly
fraudulent statements or omissions, (2) their authority to speak, (3) to whom
they spoke, (4) what they said or wrote and (5) when it was said or
written.  Tarmann (1991) 2 CA4th
153, 157; Lazar, supra.
 
Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead the alleged
misrepresentations made by Loancare and/or Lakeview.  In the opposition, Plaintiff, citing
paragraphs 40, 54, 55, 56 and 57 of the complaint, contends he has specifically
pled that Defendants represented to him that he is approved for a loan
modification and that such representation was not true.  (See Opposition, p.7:1-3).  However, paragraph 40 of the complaint
alleges that Plaintiff received the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement from
Loancare executed by Lakeview. 
(Complaint ¶40).  Plaintiff
alleges that he then signed and notarized the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement
and sent it back; in January 2022, Loancare said the 2021 Loan Modification
Agreement was never received; and when Plaintiff re-sent the 2021 Loan
Modification Agreement it was rejected in April 2022.  (See Complaint ¶¶40-44).  Paragraphs 54-57 in the complaint merely
allege that Plaintiff spoke to various Loancare agents and informed them that he
had accepted the terms of the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement.  Contrary to Plaintiff’s assertion, the
complaint does not specifically allege that Loancare and/or Lakeview
represented that Plaintiff had been approved for a loan modification.  (See Complaint, generally)
 
Additionally, based on the allegations in the negligent
misrepresentation and intentional misrepresentation causes of action, they
appear to be veiled breach of contract claims as Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants failed to abide by the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement; if
Defendants had complied with the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement, Plaintiff
would have been current on the loan; Defendants breached their duty to
Plaintiff, presumably under the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement; Defendants
failed to abide by the terms of the 2021 Loan Modification; Defendants’ breach,
again, presumably of the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement, deprived Plaintiff
of a meaningful opportunity to prevent foreclosure and cure the default  (See Complaint ¶¶61, 63, 91-93).  Plaintiff has failed to adequately plead a
breach of contract claim and, in fact, argues that he is not making such a
claim.  (See Opposition, p.6:7-8).  
 
Even if Plaintiff had sufficiently alleged the
misrepresentations which form the basis of the 1st and 2nd
causes of action, Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to establish
that those misrepresentations and his reliance thereon caused the claimed
damages.  Plaintiff does not dispute that
the loan secured by the property was in default which provides a basis to
foreclose on the Property.  Without
pleading any facts to support the conclusion, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants’ “breach” deprived Plaintiff of a meaningful opportunity to prevent
foreclosure and cure the default.  (See
Complaint ¶65).  Plaintiff gives no
indication as to how he would/could have otherwise cured the default and
prevented the foreclosure had he not relied on Loancare and Lakeview’s
unidentified misrepresentations.  Further
confusing matters, within the negligent misrepresentation cause of action which
is incorporated into the other causes of action, Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants’ violations of unidentified statutes caused his injuries.  (Complaint ¶¶66, 70, 97, 101, 110).
 
3rd Cause of Action – Declaratory Relief
 
The basis for declaratory relief is the existence of an actual,
present controversy over a proper subject. 
See City of Cotati (2002) 29 C4th 69, 79; CCP 1060; Jolley
(2013) 213 CA4th 872, 909.  The purpose
of such a claim is to provide a new form of relief where needed and not to give
a litigant a second cause of action for the determination of identical issues.  California Insurance Guarantee Association
(1991) 231 CA3d 1617, 1624.  Declaratory
relief operates prospectively to declare future rights not to redress past
wrongs.  See  Chang 2011 WL 902108, *5; Canova
(2007) 150 CA4th 1487, 1497 .
 
Plaintiff alleges: 
 
“An actual controversy now exists
between PLAINTIFF and Defendants concerning their rights, duties and
obligations to the PROPERTY, and specifically that Defendants was [sic] not
entitled to take steps toward foreclosure against the PROPERTY by Defendants
failing to comply with the 2021 LOAN MOD that LOANCARE offered to PLAINTIFF.”
(emphasis added)
 
(Complaint ¶98).
 
Again, Plaintiff seems to be making a disguised breach of
contract claim based on the 2021 Loan Modification Agreement.  If it is determined that there was a valid
contract between the parties which Defendants breached, there would be no need
for the declaratory relief cause of action. 
On the other hand, if there is no valid contract and/or Defendants did
not breach same, Defendants would seemingly be entitled to foreclose on the
Property as Plaintiff  is admittedly in
default under the prior loan agreement.  
 
4th Cause of Action – Promissory Estoppel
 
The elements of a promissory estoppel cause of action
are: (1) a clear and unambiguous promise by defendant, (2) plaintiff’s reasonable
and foreseeable reliance, (3) plaintiff’s substantial detriment or injury
caused by the reliance on the promise, and (4) damages measured by the extent
of the obligation assumed and not performed.  US Ecology, Inc. (2005) 129 CA4th 887,
901; Toscano (2004) 124 CA4th 685, 692; Garcia (2010) 183 CA4th
1031, 1037.  A plaintiff must also allege
facts showing defendants’ failure to fulfill the promise was a substantial
factor in causing the plaintiff’s damages.  US Ecology Inc., supra at 902–05.
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants and their authorized
employees, made him the following promise(s): (1) the 2021 Loan Modification
Agreement would take effect once Loancare received the executed documents; (2)
payments would begin March 2021 (presumably, Plaintiff meant March 2022); and
(3) no foreclosure proceedings would take place as long as Plaintiff made his
monthly mortgage payments on the loan by making the payments described in the
2021 Loan Modification Agreement. 
(Complaint ¶104).  The promise is
not unambiguous as Plaintiffs allege that the promise was made by Defendants,
collectively, and their unidentified, authorized employees.  Additionally, as with the negligent and
intentional misrepresentation causes of action the alleged
promise/misrepresentation is not clearly/sufficiently alleged.  Similarly, Plaintiff has failed to allege
facts to establish that his alleged damages were caused by the unperformed
promise rather than the default on the loan. 

 
5th Cause of Action – Violation of
California Business & Professions Code 17200
 
Plaintiff concedes that his 5th cause of
action is based on his prior causes of action and claims that since those
causes of action are sufficiently pled, the cause of action for violation of
Business & Professions Code 17200 is also sufficiently pled.  (See Opposition, p.11:5-18).  As noted above, Plaintiff has not
sufficiently pled the preceding causes of action.  Therefore, his reliance on those claims to
establish the sufficiency of his 5th cause of action fails.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer is sustained.  Due to the liberal policy of allowing leave
to amend and because this is only the original complaint, Plaintiff is given
the opportunity to amend his pleading.  A
First Amended Complaint is due within 30 days.
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff has failed to
electronically bookmark the exhibits attached to the declaration submitted in
support of the opposition in violation of CRC 3.1110(f)(4).  The parties are warned that failure to comply
with this requirement in the future may result in papers not being considered,
matters being continued to allow the papers to be resubmitted in compliance
with the rule and/or the imposition of sanctions.
 
The  Court further
notes that on 7/5/23, defense counsel was sent notice that Defendant Lakeview
Loan Servicing, LLC was required to pay $435.00 for the instant demurrer by
7/19/23.  (See Clerk’s Notice of
Full Payment of Fees Required filed 7/5/23). 
eCourt does not show that such fees have been paid.  If the fees have been paid, Lakeview must
present evidence of such payment.  If
they have not been paid, Lakeview must pay the required fees forthwith.
