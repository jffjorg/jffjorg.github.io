And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is dismissing the petition without prejudice due to the petitioner's failure to set forth a cognizable claim, reserve a hearing date, and serve the petition on the respondent. The petition appears to be seeking a density bonus waiver and monetary compensation for legal fees, but the petitioner has not provided sufficient information to support their claim. The judge is unclear what authority the petitioner is relying on for their petition, and the petitioner has failed to cite the relevant body of law. The judge is also concerned that the petitioner has not followed the proper procedures for filing a petition and has not provided proof of service on the respondent. As a result, the judge is dismissing the petition without prejudice, allowing the petitioner to refile with a more complete and proper petition.
