And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to strike a complaint filed by Lauren Hogan and Armando Hogan against Amir Nayebdadash and Danielle Nayebdadash. The complaint alleges that the defendants were responsible for the death of the plaintiffs' pet dog, Skye, while she was in their care at a dog daycare facility. The defendants filed a demurrer and motion to strike, arguing that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support a cause of action. The judge agrees with the defendants and sustains the demurrer and grants the motion to strike. The judge finds that the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to support a cause of action under California Civil Code §3342, which holds dog owners liable for injuries caused by their dogs, and that the complaint fails to state a claim for negligence. The judge also finds that the complaint fails to state a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The judge denies the plaintiffs' request to amend the complaint and dismisses the case.
