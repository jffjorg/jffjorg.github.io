And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by Defendant Sarah R. Barnard against Plaintiff Katherine L. Smith. The motion is based on CCP § 428.50(c), which allows a party to obtain leave to file a cross-complaint at any time during the course of the action in the interest of justice. The judge finds that Defendant has demonstrated that leave should be granted in the interest of justice. The proposed cross-complaint seeks to file a cross-complaint for breach of oral agreement and constructive fraud against Plaintiff.

The judge reminds Defendant that the service issue regarding the proposed cross-complaint must be addressed at the hearing. If Defendant sufficiently addresses the service issue, the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint is granted. Defendant is ordered to file her Cross-Complaint within 10 days.
