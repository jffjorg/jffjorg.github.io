  - Defendant: All American Healthcare Services, Inc.
Significant Statements:
  - The Court finds that the first cause of action (Violation of California Government Code § 12940(j) (Unlawful Harassment)) is excluded from arbitration because the arbitration agreement explicitly excludes sexual harassment claims from arbitration.
  - The Court is inclined to deny Defendant's motion to compel arbitration as to the second cause of action (Violation of California Business & Professions Code §§ 17200, et seq.) because Plaintiff's UCL claim appears to be substantially related to Plaintiff's sexual harassment claim and its resolution intertwined with the resolution of the sexual harassment claim.
