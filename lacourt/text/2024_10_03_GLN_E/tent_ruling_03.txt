BACKGROUND
On 1/23/2024, Plaintiff,
Felicidad Honkala, by and through her Guardian ad Litem, Rowena Anonas, filed
the instant Complaint against three Defendants – (1) LAC Verdugo Operations LLC
dba Glendale Post Acute Center; (2) LAC SNF, LLC; and (3) Cambridge Healthcare
Services, LLC.
The
Complaint alleges three causes of action for (1) Elder Abuse and Neglect
(Welfare and Institutions Code § 15600 et seq.), (2) Violation of Residents’
Bill of Rights (Health & Safety Code § 1430(b), and (3) Negligence.
On
8/8/2024, this Court denied Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration.
PROCEDURAL
Meet
and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  “The
parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive
pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five
days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party
shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a
responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a
demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a
good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why
the parties could not meet and confer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).) 
Failure
to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer. (CCP §430.41(a)(4).)
The
parties dispute whether the alleged meet and confer by Defendants’ counsel was
sufficient. Here, the Court will hear this demurrer.
 
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) 
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. 
(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30,
430.70.)  The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)
ANALYSIS
First
Cause of Action – Elder Abuse and Neglect (Welfare and Institutions Code §
15600 et seq.)
The case of Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC
helps explains a cause of action for elder abuse and neglect:
The Elder Abuse Act makes certain enhanced remedies available to a
plaintiff who proves abuse of an elder, i.e., a “person residing in this state,
65 years of age or older.” (Welf. & Inst.Code, § 15610.27.) In particular,
a plaintiff who proves “by clear and convincing evidence” both that a defendant
is liable for physical abuse, neglect or financial abuse (as these terms are
defined in the Act) and that the defendant is guilty of “recklessness,
oppression, fraud, or malice” in the commission of such abuse may recover
attorney fees and costs. (Id., § 15657, subd. (a).) On the same
proof, a plaintiff who sues as the personal representative or successor in
interest of a deceased elder is partially relieved of the limitation on damages
imposed by Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34 and may recover
damages for the decedent's predeath pain and suffering. (Welf. & Inst.Code,
§ 15657, subd. (b).)
The Elder Abuse Act defines abuse as “[p]hysical abuse, neglect, financial
abuse, abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other treatment with resulting
physical harm or pain or mental suffering” (Welf. & Inst.Code, § 15610.07,
subd. (a), italics added); or “[t]he deprivation by a care custodian of goods
or services that are necessary to avoid physical harm or mental suffering” (id., §
15610.07, subd. (b)). The Act defines neglect as “[t]he negligent failure of
any person having the care or custody of an elder or a dependent adult to
exercise that degree of care that a reasonable person in a like position would
exercise.” (Id., § 15610.57, subd.
(a)(1).) **902 “Neglect includes, but is not limited to, all of the
following: [¶] (1) Failure to assist in personal hygiene, or in the provision
of food, clothing, or shelter. [¶] (2) Failure to provide medical care for
physical and mental health needs.... [¶] (3) Failure to protect from health and
safety hazards. [¶] (4) Failure to prevent malnutrition or dehydration.” (Id., §
15610.57, subd. (b).) In short, neglect as a form of abuse under the Elder
Abuse Act refers “to the failure of those responsible for attending to the
basic needs and comforts of elderly or dependent adults, regardless of their
professional standing, to carry out their custodial obligations.” (Delaney
v. Baker (1999) 20 Cal.4th 23, 34, 82 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d
986 (Delaney ).) Thus, when the medical care of an elder is at
issue, “the statutory definition of ‘neglect’ speaks not of the *405 undertaking of
medical services, but of the failure to provide medical care.”
(Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th 771, 783,
11 Cal.Rptr.3d 222, 86 P.3d 290 (Covenant Care ); see
also id. at p. 786, 11 Cal.Rptr.3d 222, 86 P.3d
290 [“statutory elder abuse may include the egregious withholding of
medical care for physical and mental health needs”].)
(Carter v. Prime
Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 404-405.)
Defendants
argue that Plaintiff did not plead sufficient facts to state a cause of action.
Defendants
argue that Plaintiff did not plead facts of who, what, when, where, why, and
how.
Defendants’
argument as to who, what, when, where, why, and how is unavailing. Defendants
do not provide legal authority that those things must be alleged.
While
Defendants note that this cause of action must be pled with strict
particularity, Plaintiff’s Complaint does in fact allege sufficient elements to
allege a claim of elder abuse and neglect as explained above in Carter v.
Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC. 
Defendants
also cite to case law about how conclusions of law or fact alleged are not
considered in judging sufficiency. Defendants appear to be arguing that
Plaintiff only makes conclusory allegations.
This
argument is unavailing in light of reading the allegations in the Complaint as
a whole. While there do appear to be conclusions of law in the Complaint, there
are extensive amounts of factual allegations as well. (See ¶¶ 1-56 of the first
cause of action.)
Defendants
also argue that Plaintiff does not allege causation; however, causation is
alleged in ¶¶ 20-21 of the Complaint.
Plaintiff
sufficiently alleged the first cause of action.
As stated in Dino, Inc. v.
Boreta Enterprises, Inc. :
 
It is, of course, the rule that
ultimate facts must be pleaded, rather than legal conclusions, yet the
distinction between ultimate facts and conclusions of law is not always clear
or easy to state. In Burks v. Poppy Construction Co., 57
Cal.2d 463, 473-474 [20 Cal.Rptr. 609, 370 P.2d 313], the court said:
“The distinction between conclusions of law and ultimate facts is not at all
clear and involves at most a matter of degree. (Estate of Bixler, 194
Cal. 585, 589 [229 P. 704]; see Clark on Code Pleading (2d ed. 1947)
231; Chadbourne, Grossman, Van Alstyne, Cal. Pleading (1961) 812 et seq.; 2
Witkin, Cal. Procedure (1954) 1140.) For example, the courts have permitted
allegations which obviously included conclusions of law and have termed them
'ultimate facts' or 'conclusions of fact.' (See Peninsula etc. Co. v.
County of Santa Cruz, 34 Cal.2d 626, 629 [213 P.2d 489] [one
is the 'owner' of property]; Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 26
Cal.2d 149, 154 [157 P.2d 1] [act was 'negligently' done]; May
v. Farrell, 94 Cal.App. 703, 707 [271 P. 789] [employee was
'acting within the scope of his employment'].) In permitting allegations to be
made in general terms the courts have said that the particularity of pleading
required depends upon the extent to which the defendant in fairness needs
detailed information that can be conveniently provided by the plaintiff, and
that less particularity is required where the defendant may be assumed to
possess knowledge of the facts at least equal, if not superior, to that
possessed by the plaintiff. ...”
 
(Dino, Inc. v. Boreta
Enterprises, Inc. (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 336, 340.)
 
Malice, Oppression, Fraud, or Recklessness
Defendants argue that
Plaintiff failed to plead facts sufficient to show that Defendants acted with
malice, oppression, fraud, or recklessness in the commission of the alleged
abuse of neglect of Plaintiff.
As
stated in Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC:
To recover the enhanced remedies available under the Elder Abuse
Act from a health care provider, a plaintiff must prove more than simple or
even gross negligence in the provider's care or custody of the elder. (Welf.
& Inst.Code, § 15657.2; Delaney, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p.
32, 82 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d 986; Sababin v. Superior Court (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 81, 88, 50 Cal.Rptr.3d 266 (Sababin ).)
The plaintiff must prove “by clear and convincing evidence” that “the defendant
has been guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice in the commission
of” the neglect. (Welf. & Inst.Code, § 15657.) Oppression, fraud and malice
“involve ‘intentional,’ ‘willful,’ or ‘conscious' wrongdoing of a ‘despicable’
or ‘injurious' nature.” (Delaney, at p. 31, 82 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971
P.2d 986.) Recklessness involves “ ‘deliberate disregard’ of the ‘high degree
of probability’ that an injury will occur” and “rises to the level of a
‘conscious choice of a course of action ... with knowledge of the serious
danger to others involved in it.’ ” (Id. at pp. 31–32, 82
Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d 986.) Thus, the enhanced remedies are available only
for “ ‘acts of egregious abuse’ against elder and dependent adults.” (Id. at
p. 35, 82 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d 986; see also Covenant Care, supra, 32
Cal.4th at p. 786, 11 Cal.Rptr.3d 222, 86 P.3d 290 [“statutory elder abuse
may include the egregious withholding of medical care for physical and mental
health needs”].) In short, “[i]n order to obtain the Act's heightened remedies,
a plaintiff must allege conduct essentially equivalent to conduct that would
support recovery of punitive damages.” (Covenant Care, at p. 789,
11 Cal.Rptr.3d 222, 86 P.3d 290.)
(Carter
v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 405.)
Further,
as stated in Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC:
From the statutes and cases discussed above, we distill several
factors that must be present for conduct to constitute neglect within the
meaning of the Elder Abuse Act and thereby trigger the enhanced remedies
available under the Act. The plaintiff must allege (and ultimately prove by
clear and convincing evidence) facts establishing that the defendant: (1) had
responsibility for meeting the basic needs of the elder or dependent adult,
such as nutrition, hydration, hygiene or medical care (Welf. & Inst.Code,
§§ 15610.07, subd. (b), 15610.57, subd. (b); Delaney, supra, 20
Cal.4th at p. 34, 82 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d 986); (2) knew of conditions
that made the elder or dependent adult unable to provide for his or her own
basic needs (Sababin, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at pp. 85,
90, 50 Cal.Rptr.3d 266; Benun, supra, 123 Cal.App.4th at
p. 116, 20 Cal.Rptr.3d 26; Mack, supra, 80 Cal.App.4th at
pp. 972–973, 95 Cal.Rptr.2d 830); and (3) denied or withheld goods or
services *407 necessary to meet the elder or dependent adult's basic
needs, either with knowledge that injury was substantially certain to befall
the elder or dependent adult (if the plaintiff alleges oppression, fraud or
malice) or with conscious disregard of the high probability of such
injury **904 (if the plaintiff alleges recklessness) (Welf. &
Inst.Code, §§ 15610.07, subd. (b); 15610.57, subd. (b), 15657; Covenant
Care, supra, 32 Cal.4th at pp. 783, 786, 11 Cal.Rptr.3d 222, 86 P.3d
290; Delaney, at pp. 31–32, 82 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 971 P.2d 986).
The plaintiff must also allege (and ultimately prove by clear and convincing
evidence) that the neglect caused the elder or dependent adult to suffer
physical harm, pain or mental suffering. (Welf. & Inst.Code, §§ 15610.07,
subds. (a), (b), 15657; Perlin, supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at
p. 664, 77 Cal.Rptr.3d 743; Berkley, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at
p. 529, 61 Cal.Rptr.3d 304.) Finally, the facts constituting the neglect and
establishing the causal link between the neglect and the injury “must be
pleaded with particularity,” in accordance with the pleading rules governing
statutory claims. (Covenant Care, at p. 790, 11 Cal.Rptr.3d
222, 86 P.3d 290.)
(Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley
LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 406-407.)
Here, Plaintiff’s Complaint makes sufficient
allegations for enhanced remedies/punitive damages in ¶¶ 2-21 listed under the
first cause of action of the Complaint. 
Further, Plaintiff’s Complaint met the pleading requirements
for the punitive damages standard as well.
In an action for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that
the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff,
in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example
by way of punishing the defendant. (Cal. Civ. Code §3294(a).) 
“‘Malice’ means conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.” (CCP §3294(c)(1).) 
“‘Oppression’ means despicable conduct that
subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that
person’s rights. (CCP §3294(c)(2).) 
“‘Fraud’ means an intentional misrepresentation,
deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the
intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of
property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury. (CCP §3294(c)(3).)
“In order to survive a motion to strike an
allegation of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to
such relief must be pled by a plaintiff.”  (Clauson v. Superior Court
(1998) 67 Cal. App. 4th 1253, 1255.) Conclusory allegations, devoid of any
factual assertions, are insufficient to support a conclusion that parties acted
with oppression, fraud or malice. (Smith v. Sup. Ct. (1992) 10 Cal. App.
4th 1033, 1042.) 
Here, while portions of Plaintiff’s Complaint do
in fact plead conclusory allegations at various times throughout the Complaint,
there are sufficient allegations throughout the Complaint that allow Plaintiff
to meet the pleading standard for punitive damages. (See ¶¶ 2-21 listed under
the first cause of action of the Complaint.)
As an example, the allegations in ¶¶ 17-18
stated:
17. The FACILITY was aware from the beginning of her residency
that HONKALA was at risk for pressure sores and dehydration. However, the
FACILITY consciously disregarded these risks and withheld the custodial care
she required to ensure she did not suffer harm and injury, including the most
basic of needs such as adequate nutrition and hydration. For example, the
FACILITY failed to timely create a care plan to address her needs and institute
the proper caregiving protocols regarding her high risk of developing pressure
sores. Further, DEFENDANTS failed to properly implement HONKALA’S care plan
that required proper Foley catheter care to prevent UTI’s and sepsis. 
18. Despite knowing HONKALA’S needs, and the risks associated with
not providing her care, DEFENDANTS had a pattern and practice of neglecting
HONKALA’S needs including its consistent failure to turn and reposition her and
ensure she received adequate hydration, nutrition, and Foley catheter care
which led to the development of her significant dehydration, pressure injuries,
and infection. As a direct and proximate cause of DEFENDANTS’ conduct, HONKALA
suffered unnecessary pain, injury, and emotional distress.
(Compl. ¶¶ 17-18.)
“In determining whether a complaint states facts
sufficient to sustain punitive damages, the challenged allegations must be read
in context with the other facts alleged in the complaint. Further, even though
certain language pleads ultimate facts or conclusions of law, such language
when read in context with the facts alleged as to defendants' conduct may
adequately plead the evil motive requisite to recovery of punitive damages.” (Monge
v. Superior Court (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 503, 510 citing Perkins v. Superior
Court (1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 1, 6–7.)
Therefore, Defendants’ argument – that Plaintiff
did not plead facts sufficient to show that Defendants acted with malice,
oppression, fraud, or recklessness in the commission of the alleged abuse or
neglect of Plaintiff – is unavailing.
Officer, Director, or Managing Agent of
Defendants
Defendants argue that Plaintiff
fails to plead facts with strict particularity that establish an officer,
director, or managing agent of Defendants authorized, ratified, or committed
abuse/neglect of Plaintiff with malice, oppression, or fraud.
Defendants cite to Civil Code § 3294(b) which
states:
An employer shall not be liable for damages pursuant to
subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless the
employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed
him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or
authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded
or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect to a
corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard,
authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on
the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.
(Civil Code § 3294(b).)
Defendants also argue that Plaintiff’s Complaint
does not offer any facts showing that an officer, director, or managing agent
confirmed and accepted abuse or neglect of Plaintiff with knowledge of its
outrageous character.
Defendants’ arguments are unavailing. 
Plaintiff alleges the relationship between all
Defendants and their ratification in ¶¶ 22-40 of the Complaint.
 
 
The
general rule of respondeat superior is as follows, “an employer is
vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of
the employment.” (Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital (1995)
12 Cal.4th 291, 298.) Further, to this Court, it appears as if respondeat
superior is codified by statute. Under Civil Code § 2338, “Unless required
by or under the authority of law to employ that particular agent, a principal
is responsible to third persons for the negligence of his agent in the
transaction of the business of the agency, including wrongful acts committed by
such agent in and as a part of the transaction of such business, and for his
willful omission to fulfill the obligations of the principal.” (Civil Code
§2338.) Under Civil Code § 2330, “An agent represents his principal for all
purposes within the scope of his actual or ostensible authority, and all the
rights and liabilities which would accrue to the agent from transactions within
such limit, if they had been entered into on his own account, accrue to the
principal.” (Civil Code § 2330.)
Further,
the case of Michelson v. Hamada helps explain the principal of agency:
Civil Code section 2295 states: “An agent
is one who represents another, called the principal, in dealings with third persons.
Such representation is called agency.” (3) Any person may be authorized to act as an
agent, including an adverse party to a transaction. (See Naify v.
Pacific Indemnity Co. (1938) 11 Cal.2d 5, 7 [76 P.2d 663, 115
A.L.R. 476]; Orfanos v. California Insurance Co. (1938) 29
Cal.App.2d 75, 78-81 [84 P.2d 233]; 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law
(9th ed. 1987) Agency and Employment, § 33, p. 47.) “Whether a person
performing work for another is an agent ... depends primarily upon whether the
one for whom the work is done has the legal right to control the activities of
the alleged agent. [Citations.]” (Malloy v. Fong (1951) 37 Cal.2d
356, 370 [232 P.2d 241].) An agent is a fiduciary. (Kennard
v. Glick (1960) 183 Cal.App.2d 246, 250-251 [agent entrusted with
duty of receiving and disbursing moneys and keep- ing accurate records of the
transactions]; Estate of Arbuckle (1950) 98 Cal.App.2d 562,
569-570 [220 P.2d 950, 23 A.L.R.2d 372] [business manager unable to
produce will entrusted to him]; 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, supra,
Agency and Employment, §§ 41, 43 et seq., pp. 53, 55.) Agency may be implied
from the circumstances and conduct of the parties (see Bergtholdt v.
Porter Bros. Co. (1896) 114 Cal. 681, 685-688 [46 P. 738]; Brand
v. Mantor (1935) 6 Cal.App.2d 126, 130; Pollack v. Lytle (1981) 120 Cal.App.3d
931, 940; Brea v. McGlashan (1934) 3 Cal.App.2d 454,
464 [39 P.2d 877].) (4) When the principal in reliance on the agent
does not have the service performed by others, the agent is liable for failure
to perform. (See Lab. Code, § 2851; Poile v. Stockton Merchants
Assn. (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 100, 104 [collection agency liable
for amount of check it failed to collect and was under duty to inform principal
of failure]; Rest.2d Agency, § 378; 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, supra,
Agency and Employment, § 62, p. 68.) (5) A contract between parties that includes the
rendering of services does not preclude recovery for breach of a confidential
relationship where property is misappropriated. (Agair Inc. v. Shaeffer (1965)
232 Cal.App.2d 513, 517 [42 Cal.Rptr. 883].)
 
(Michelson v. Hamada (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1556, 1579-80.)
 
As
to alleging agency at the pleading stage, “An allegation of agency is an
allegation of ultimate fact that must be accepted as true for purposes of
ruling on a demurrer.” (City of Industry v. City of Filmore (2011) 198
Cal.App.4th 191, 212-13.) “We have already noted, however, that an allegation
of agency as such is a statement of ultimate fact. Consequently further
allegations explaining how this fact of agency originated become unnecessary.”
(Skopp v. Weaver (1976) 16 Cal.3d 432, 439.)
 
TENTATIVE RULING FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Defendants’ demurrer to
the first cause of action is overruled. Plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to
constitute the cause of action.
 
Second Cause of Action – Violation of Residents’ Bill of Rights
(Health & Safety Code § 1430(b))
Defendants
argue that Health and Safety Code § 1430(b) provides for a civil remedy
for patients and residents of a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care
facility for violations of the Patient’s Rights in section 72527 of Title 22 of
the Code of Regulations, or any other right provided for by federal or
state law or regulation. Defendant argues that section 72527 provides a list of
26 very specific rights, and since Plaintiff failed to plead a single violation
of any one of these 26 specific rights, Plaintiff failed to state a cause of
action.
 
In
Opposition, Plaintiff points out that Defendants ignore the section of § 1430(b)
that allows for recovery for “any other right provided for by federal or state
law or regulation.” Plaintiff argues that Defendants violated Plaintiff’s
rights by failing to adhere to the statutes and regulations governing skilled
nursing facilities.
 
The
Court will hear argument.
 
As
stated in Lemaire v. Covenant Care California, LLC:
 
Section 1430, subdivision (b) provides, in relevant part, “A
current or former resident or patient of a skilled nursing facility ... may
bring a civil action against the licensee of a facility who violates any rights
of the resident or patient as set forth in the Patients Bill of Rights
in Section 72527 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, or
any other right provided for by federal or state law or regulation.”
(Italics added.)
 
Covenant has a restrictive view of the private right of
action. But the statutory language about the scope of that right is broad. It
includes violation of any “right provided for by federal or
state law or regulation.”
 
This is also a remedial statute. It must therefore be “liberally
construed on behalf of the class of persons it is designed to protect.” (California Assn.
of Health Facilities v. Department of Health Services (1997)
16 Cal.4th 284, 295, 65 Cal.Rptr.2d 872, 940 P.2d 323.) Those individuals
are nursing care patients, “one of the most vulnerable segments of
our population.” (Ibid.)
 
(Lemaire
v. Covenant Care California, LLC (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 860, 864.)
 
Plaintiff
appears to be correct that it can allege a violation of any right provided for
by federal or state law or regulation.
 
In
¶ 61 of the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges:
 
61. PLAINTIFF is informed and believes, and therefore alleges,
that PLAINTIFF’S rights as a resident were violated in ways which include but
are not limited to:
 
a. The suffering of abuse and neglect by the FACILITY, as stated
supra.
 
b. The failure to treat PLAINTIFF “with consideration, respect and
full recognition of dignity and individuality,” as the FACILITY did not care
for her personal needs, as stated supra, including but not limited to failing
to create and implement proper interventions to prevent and heal her pressure
ulcers, infection, dehydration, and malnutrition.
 
(Compl.
¶ 61.)
 
Although
Plaintiff’s Opposition argues that Plaintiff pled that Defendant violated
Plaintiff’s rights by “failing to adhere to the statutes and regulations
governing skilled nursing facilities,” Paragraph 61 of the Complaint does not
reference a single statute or regulation. It is entirely unclear what federal
or state law or regulation Plaintiff is basing the second cause of action on.
 
Plaintiff’s
Complaint lists various alleged rights in ¶60, but the Complaint in ¶ 61 does
not say that it is the rights listed in ¶ 60 that Defendant violated. Paragraph
61 leaves it unclear and uncertain as to what Plaintiff is basing her second
cause of action on.
 
TENTATIVE RULING SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
The Court will hear
argument. The Court tentatively plans to SUSTAIN Defendant’s demurrer to the
second cause. Plaintiff’s Opposition argued that the second cause of action
alleged sufficient facts because Defendant failed to adhere to the statutes and
regulations governing skilled nursing facilities; however, Plaintiff’s Complaint
does not allege what statutes and regulations Defendant failed to adhere to.
The Court plans to GRANT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
 
 
Management Defendants
Defendants seems to
argue that no causes of action are alleged against the Management Defendants.
Defendants appear to argue that as a matter of law LAC SNF LLC and Cambridge
Healthcare Services cannot be held liable for actions of Glendale Post Acute
Center.
 
This
argument is unavailing. As this Court previously discussed, Plaintiff
successfully alleged agency, ratification, vicarious liability, etc. in ¶¶
22-40 of the Complaint.

“Defendants LAC VERDUGO OPERATIONS, LLC dba
GLENDALE POST ACUTE CENTER; LAC SNF, LLC; and CAMBRIDGE HEALTHCARE SERVICES,
LLC (“Defendants) will and hereby do move to strike portions of Plaintiff
FELICIDAD HONKALA’s Complaint Code of Civil Procedure §§ 435, 436:
1. Page 15, lines 27-28
¶ 56: “…an award of punitive damages in a sum according to proof at trial is
therefore justified and appropriate;” 
2. Page 19, lines 12-13
¶ 3: “For all damages and remedies pursuant to Health and Safety Code § 1430(b)
against the FACILITY;” 
3. Page 19, line 14 ¶
4: “For attorney’s fees against DEFENDANTS;” and 
4. Page 19, line 15 ¶
5: “For punitive damage and exemplary damages against DEFENDANTS.” 
This Motion to Strike
is based on this Notice, the accompanying Memorandum of Points and Authorities,
the Declaration of Jenifer Hassell, Esq., the concurrently filed Demurrer, the
pleadings and papers already on file herein, and any other matter that may be
presented prior to or at the time of the hearing of this matter.”
(Def. Mot. ¶ 2.)
Meet and Confer
Before filing a motion
to strike pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in
person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to
the motion to strike for the purpose of determining if an agreement can be
reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike. If
an amended pleading is filed, the responding party shall meet and confer again
with the party who filed the amended pleading before filing a motion to strike
the amended pleading. (CCP §435.5(a).)
This analysis is the
same as described in the demurrer.
LEGAL
STANDARD – MOTION TO STRIKE
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in
its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false,
or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436(a).) The
court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 436(b).)  A motion to strike cannot be based upon the
grounds that a complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action, but instead is properly based on grounds of superfluous or abusive
allegations, or improprieties in form or procedure.  (Ferraro
v. Camarlinghi (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 509,
528-29.)   
The grounds for moving
to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial
notice.  (Code. Civ. Proc. § 437; Turman v. Turning Point of
Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63 [“judges read
allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts
in their context, and assume their truth”].)   
Further, CCP § 431.10(a)-(c)
states as follows:
(a) A material allegation in a pleading is one essential
to the claim or defense and which could not be stricken from the pleading
without leaving it insufficient as to that claim or defense.
(b) An immaterial allegation in a pleading is any of the
following:
(1) An allegation that is not essential to the statement
of a claim or defense.
(2) An allegation that is neither pertinent to nor
supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense.
(3) A demand for judgment requesting relief not
supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint.
(c) An “immaterial allegation” means “irrelevant matter”
as that term is used in Section 436.
 
(CCP § 431.10(a)-(c).)
 
TENTATIVE
RULING MOTION TO STRIKE
Defendants seek to
strike four portions, as described in the Relief Requested portion of this
tentative, from the Complaint.
Portion 1 seeks to
strike ¶ 56 in the first cause of action that requests punitive damages.
Defendants’ motion to
strike ¶ 56 on page 15 of the Complaint is DENIED.
Although Defendants
argue that the Plaintiff did not successfully allege a cause of action for the
first cause of action, and although Defendants argue oppression, fraud or
malice was not alleged, the Court already addressed these arguments in the demurrer
and found them unavailing. The Court also already addressed Defendants’
argument that Defendants’ officer, director, or agent was not involved in the
oppressive/malicious conduct, and the Court found this argument unavailing.
Portion 2 seeks to strike
¶ 3 on page 19 of the Complaint. These allegations pertain to damages and
remedies from Health and Safety Code § 1430(b). 
The Court GRANTS
Defendants’ motion to strike ¶ 3 in the Prayer for Relief on page 19 of the
Complaint because the Court found that Plaintiff did not successfully allege
the second cause of action under Health and Safety Code § 1430(b). LEAVE TO
AMEND IS GRANTED.
Portion 3 seeks to
strike ¶ 4 in the prayer for relief on page 19 of the Complaint which requests
attorney’s fees. 
The Court DENIES
Defendants’ request to strike Portion 3. Plaintiff successfully alleged the
first cause of action, and the first cause of action allows for the recovery of
attorney’s fees as explained in Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley
LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 404-405.
Portion 4 seeks to
strike ¶ 5 in the Prayer for Relief on page 19 which requests punitive and
exemplary damages. 
Defendants’ motion to
strike ¶ 5 in the prayer for relief on page 19 is DENIED. As previously
discussed, Plaintiff successfully alleged the first cause of action and
successfully alleged oppression or malice.
