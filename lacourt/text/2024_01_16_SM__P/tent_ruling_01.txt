Subaru of America, Inc, et al., Case No. 22SMCV01410

Subaru of
America’s Demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint
 
Plaintiff
Fallieras sued defendants Subaru of America (SOA) and Thousand Oaks-S, Inc. dba
DCH Subaru of Thousand Oaks (DCH) alleging (1) violation of subdivision (d) of
Civil Code section 1793.2 (against SOA only); (2) violation of subdivision (b)
of Civil Code section 1793.2 (against SOA only); (3) violation of subdivision
(a)(3) of Civil Code section 1793.2 (against SOA only); (4) breach of the implied
warranty of merchantability (against SOA only); and (5) negligent repair
(against DCH only). As to DCH, plaintiff alleges it failed to properly perform
necessary repairs. DCH cross complained against SOA, seeking (1) express
indemnity; (2) implied indemnity; (3) equitable indemnity; and (4) declaratory
relief. 
 
The FACC
incorporates portions of the complaint, including that Plaintiff entered into a
warranty contract with SOA, defects and nonconformities to warranty manifested
within the applicable period and SOA failed to replace the vehicle or provide
restitution. FACC ¶4. DCH alleges pursuant to the Dealer Agreement between SOA
and DCH, DCH is entitled to defense and immunity from SOA. See FACC ¶¶ 5-17. SOA
demurrers to the FACC.
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
DCH seeks judicial
notice of SOA’s cross-complaint filed by SOA. The cross-complaint falls under
Evidence Code section 452(d) and 453. GRANTED.
 
Timeliness
SOA argues DCH’s FACC
is untimely. The Court agrees; DCH’s FACC was filed after its answer and
setting of the trial date. Nor did it seek leave of court for the untimely
filing. See Code Civ. Proc. § 428.50. However, the court exercises discretion
to consider the merits.
 
Express Indemnity
“An indemnitee
seeking to recover on an agreement for indemnification must allege the parties’
contractual relationship, the indemnitee’s performance of that portion of the
contract which gives rise to the indemnification claim, the facts showing a
loss within the meaning of the parties’ indemnification agreement, and the
amount of damages sustained.” Four Star Electric, Inc. v. F & H
Construction (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1380.
 
SOA argues DCH
cannot maintain a claim for indemnity because the only cause of action against
DCH is negligent repair, for which SOA is not obligated to defend nor
indemnify. DCH argues the negligent repair claim is inseparable from the
Song-Beverly claims, and the prayer does not distinguish which damages are
sought from each defendant.
 
A demurrer can
only challenge defects on the face of the pleading. See Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. The FACC does not allege sufficient
facts that the Song-Beverly claims andnegligent repair claim are intertwined.
There is no allegation DCH is liable for manufacturing defects or for failing
to confirm the vehicle to applicable warranties.
SUSTAINED with
leave to amend.
Implied Indemnity
Implied
contractual indemnity is not based upon equitable considerations, but on a
contractual relationship between indemnitee and indemnitor from which is
implied an obligation by indemnitor to assume and pay foreseeable damages
assessed against the indemnitee as a result of indemnitor's breach of contract.
Bear Creek Planning Com. v. Title Ins. & Trust Co. (1985) 164
Cal.App.3d 1227, 1239. The same reasoning applies. SUSTAINED with leave to
amend.
 
Equitable
Indemnity
“Equitable
indemnity, which requires no contractual relationship, is premised on a joint
legal obligation to another for damages; it is subject to allocation of fault
principles and comparative equitable apportionment of loss.” C.W. Howe
Partners Inc. v. Mooradian (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 688, 700, quotation marks
omitted. “The elements of a cause of action for equitable indemnity are (1) a
showing of fault on the part of the indemnitor and (2) resulting damages to the
indemnitee for which the indemnitor is equitably responsible.” Id. The
same reasoning applies.
SUSTAINED with
leave to amend.
 
Declaratory Relief
“To qualify for
declaratory relief, a party would have to demonstrate its action presented two
essential elements: (1) a proper subject of declaratory relief, and (2) an
actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the party’s
rights or obligations.” Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213
Cal.App.4th 872, 909. 
 
A cause of action
for declaratory relief should not be used as a second cause of action for the
determination of identical issues raised in another cause of action. General
of America Insurance Co. v. Lilly (1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 465, 470. “The
availability of another form of relief that is adequate will usually justify
refusal to grant declaratory relief” California Ins. Guarantee Assoc. v.
Superior Court (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1617, 1624, and a duplicative cause of
action is subject to demurrer. Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners Assoc.,
Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290.
 
DCH asserts the
complaint is uncertain as to whether the alleged defects were SOA’s
manufacturing defects or caused by DCH’s negligent repairs, so SOA’s refusal to
accept DCH’s tender demand presents an actual controversy. However, DCH fails
to sufficiently demonstrate the negligent repair claim is derivative and stems
from the Song-Beverly claims. SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
