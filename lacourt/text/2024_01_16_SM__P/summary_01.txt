And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled on Subaru of America's demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint filed by DCH Subaru of Thousand Oaks. The court has granted DCH's request for judicial notice of Subaru's cross-complaint.

Subaru has argued that DCH's cross-complaint is untimely, but the court has exercised its discretion to consider the merits. The court has sustained Subaru's demurrer to DCH's claims for express indemnity, implied indemnity, and equitable indemnity, but has given DCH leave to amend.

The court has also sustained Subaru's demurrer to DCH's claim for declaratory relief, finding that the claim is duplicative and fails to demonstrate an actual controversy. The court has given DCH leave to amend its complaint.

The court's tentative ruling is based on the following laws and case citations:
