This tentative ruling summarizes the Judge's thinking based on information presented before the Court hearing. The case involves Built On Solid Rock, Inc. (BOSR), a corporation that was registered and licensed to do business in California from December 2011 to February 2022. The Franchise Tax Board suspended BOSR and it became an inactive corporation on February 1, 2022. The Judge notes that it is unclear whether the arbitration award against BOSR was a disciplinary proceeding.

The Judge will consider these facts and legal requirements when rendering a final decision.
