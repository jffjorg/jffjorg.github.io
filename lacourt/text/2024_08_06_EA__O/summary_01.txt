And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the Plaintiff's FIFTH Petition to Confirm the Contractual Arbitration Award is MOOT because judgment was already entered on February 7, 2024. The Judge also denies the request to hold Prattella individually liable, as Prattella is not a named party to the arbitration award. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's reliance on Business and Professions Code Section 7122.5 is misplaced, and that the statute does not create strict civil liability against Prattella. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's claim that Prattella should be held responsible for the acts of the entity is not supported by the evidence. Finally, the Judge concludes that the petition/motion is moot, as the arbitration award has already been confirmed.
