And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a default judgment application filed by the plaintiff, Rebecca Castillo, against Chaplus Tea U.S.A (and Doe Defendants). The plaintiff claims that the defendant has failed to comply with the Unruh Civil Rights Act (UCRA) and seeks a default judgment. However, the court has denied the application with prejudice due to two defects in the plaintiff's complaint.

Firstly, the complaint fails to plead particular, sufficient facts that establish an UCRA violation. The complaint is 19 pages long and contains 53 factual allegations, but most of these allegations are irrelevant or material to the UCRA cause of action. The complaint does not plead specific, relevant facts that establish an UCRA violation.

Secondly, the court finds that the complaint does not state a cognizable cause of action against the defendants. The court must ensure that only the appropriate claims get through, and the complaint fails to meet this standard. The court has also cited several cases, including Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, Vedder v. City of Imperial (1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 654, 659, and Martinez v. San Diego County Credit Union (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1059, to support its decision.

Therefore, the default judgment application is denied with prejudice, and the plaintiff has not pled a violation of UCRA to reach the merits of the application.
