And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the unopposed motions of the defendant, Angel Betancourt, to compel the initial responses of the plaintiffs, Enrique Betancourt, Jr. and Maria Betancourt, to form interrogatories (set one) and special interrogatories (set two). The defendant has shown that the discovery requests were properly served and that the deadlines to respond have expired, and no responses have been provided. The plaintiffs failed to oppose the motions, and therefore, the judge orders them to provide verified responses within 15 days. Additionally, the judge awards reasonable sanctions of $1,475.00 to the defendant for the failure to oppose the motions.
