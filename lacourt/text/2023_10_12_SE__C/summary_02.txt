And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied without prejudice the plaintiff's unopposed motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories, request for admissions, and form interrogatories from defendant Carr Lee. However, the judge has granted the motions to compel further responses to these same types of discovery requests from defendant Film 102 Productions, LLC. The judge finds that defendant Film 102's responses to discovery requests were incomplete and evasive, and therefore orders defendant Film 102 to produce further documents and verified responses within 30 days. The judge also orders defendant Film 102 to pay reasonable sanctions in the amount of $3,960.00. The judge notes that the automatic stay is triggered by the filing of a bankruptcy petition and becomes effective with or without a court order. A status conference regarding the bankruptcy of defendant Carr Lee is scheduled for March 25, 2024.
