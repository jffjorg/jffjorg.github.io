CASE
NO.:  23NWCV00158
HEARING:  10/12/23
 
ADD-ON
 
Defendant
MARTHA MORALES’s unopposed Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens is OFF-CALENDAR.
Defendant’s Request for Attorney’s Fees is DENIED. 
 
Opposing
Party to give notice. 

In the interests of judicial efficiency, the Court has reviewed and considered
Plaintiff’s untimely Opposition filed on October 11, 2023. In order to prevent
any deprivations of due process, the Court will permit Defendant with the
ability to file a substantive Reply after a brief continuance if Defendant makes
such a request at the hearing. If Defendant does not request a continuance and
leave to file a Reply brief, the Court will issue a ruling on the merits based
on the limited briefing before it (papers filed on or before October 11, 2023).

 
The
Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens is MOOT. A Request for Dismissal of the Entire
Action of All Parties and All Causes of Action was FILED on October 5, 2023.
“Following entry of a dismissal of an action by a plaintiff under Code of Civil
Procedure section 581, a trial court is without jurisdiction to act further in
the action except for the limited purpose of awarding costs and statutory
attorney’s fees. [Citations Omitted.]” (Harris v. Billings (1993) 16
Cal.App.4th 1396, 1405.) Consequently, the Court’s jurisdiction is limited to
determining whether Defendant is entitled to attorney’s fees under CCP §405.38.
 
Defendant
seeks attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $6,521.96 under CCP §405.38.
 
“The
court shall direct that the party prevailing on any motion under this chapter
be awarded the reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of making or opposing the
motion unless the court finds that the other party acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of attorney’s
fees and costs unjust.” (Ibid.) 
Attorney’s fees are authorized if a lis pendens is withdrawn before a
ruling on the motion to expunge. (See Castro v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 1010, 1014.)  
 
Here,
the lis pendens was not withdrawn. As indicated above, for reasons unknown to
this Court, Plaintiff elected to dismiss the entire action without prejudice on
October 5, 2023. 
 
In
an untimely Opposition filed one day before this hearing (October 11, 2023),
Plaintiff does not argue that attorney’s fees should not be awarded. Plaintiff
merely argues that fees should not be awarded against Plaintiff’s Counsel, and
that the fees amount should be reduced. 
 
“Because
section 405.38 does not define prevailing party or expressly authorize or bar
recovery of attorney fees in the event the lis pendens is withdrawn before a
ruling on a motion, we adopt the practical approach to determine whether the
moving party is the prevailing party under section 405.38 by analyzing the
extent to which each party has realized its litigation objectives. To determine
litigation objectives, it is not enough simply to consider that the lis pendens
has been withdrawn; the court must consider and decide whether the moving party
would have prevailed on the motion.” (Castro v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 1010, 1023.) 
 
Because
Plaintiff has withdrawn the lis pendens and dismissed the entire action, the
Court finds that the imposition of attorney’s fees and costs are not warranted
under section 405.38.  
 
Defendant’s
request for attorney’s fees and costs is DENIED.
