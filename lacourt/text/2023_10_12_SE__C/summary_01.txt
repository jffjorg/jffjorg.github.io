	- "A public entity may be negligent—and hence liable for injuries caused by a dangerous condition on its property—in one of two ways.

The public entity is also negligent if it did not take 'measures to protect against a dangerous condition (that it did not create) if it had actual or constructive notice of that dangerous condition...."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the City of Norwalk's motion for summary judgment and alternative motion for summary adjudication. The judge has also denied the alternative motion for summary adjudication in favor of joining parties Southern California Edison Company and Herman Weissker Power, Inc.

The judge ruled that the plaintiff has raised triable issues of fact sufficient to defeat summary adjudication of the issues of whether a dangerous condition existed at the intersection and whether the City of Norwalk was negligent in failing to provide adequate traffic control and signage during the power outage.

The judge found that the City of Norwalk had actual knowledge of the planned power outage and failed to take any measures to protect against the dangerous condition. The judge also found that the traffic signals malfunctioned and shut off during the outage, causing a collision to occur when the Plaintiff's vehicle entered the intersection on a green light.

The judge cited several cases in support of its ruling, including Chowdhury v. City of Los Angeles and Martinez v. City of Beverly Hills. The judge concluded that the City of Norwalk created a dangerous condition on its property by installing traffic signals that malfunctioned during the power outage, and that the City was negligent in failing to take measures to protect against the dangerous condition.
