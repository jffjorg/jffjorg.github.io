And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a future court hearing in the case of CARDENAS v. CAMPOS. The judge has reviewed the parties' submissions and is prepared to make a ruling on the defendant's unopposed motion to expunge lis pendens and request for attorney's fees.

The judge has determined that the motion to expunge lis pendens is moot because the plaintiff has withdrawn the lis pendens and dismissed the entire action. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for attorney's fees and costs because the parties' litigation objectives have not been fully realized.

The judge has considered the relevant laws and case citations, including CCP §405.38 and Castro v. Sup. Ct. (2004), and has determined that the defendant is not entitled to attorney's fees and costs under these provisions. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's untimely opposition filed one day before the hearing did not argue that attorney's fees should not be awarded, but rather sought to reduce the amount of fees and have fees awarded against the plaintiff's counsel.
