RULING

BACKGROUND
On November 18, 2022, CalSafe
Research Center, Inc. filed a complaint for civil penalties and injunctive
relief against Flagship Food Group LLC for violation of Proposition 65. 
On January 6, 2023, defendant filed
an answer.
On August 4, 2023, Dept. 12 ordered
the case stayed.
On December 22, 2023, the case was
deemed unrelated and determined to be non-complex.  The stay was lifted.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Health and Safety Code § 25249.7(f)(4)
requires court approval of all settlements (other than voluntary dismissals) of
actions under the Act brought by a person in the public interest. The court can
approve the settlement only if it finds that:
(A) Any
warning required by the settlement complies with this chapter;
(B)  Any
award of attorneys’ fees is reasonable under California law; and
(C)  Any
penalty amount is reasonable based on the criteria set forth in paragraph (2)
of subdivision (b).
 
Plaintiff
has the burden of producing sufficient evidence to sustain each required
finding. Health & Saf. Code § 25249.7(f)(5).  “In the context of Proposition 65 litigation,
necessarily brought to vindicate the public interest, the trial court also must
ensure that its judgment serves the public interest.” Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. v.
Kintetsu Enterprises of America
(2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 46, 62.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff seeks approval of the
parties’ settlement pursuant to Health and Safety Code §25249.7(f)(4).  Plaintiff states in the motion that the
proposed stipulated consent judgment resolves plaintiff’s allegations that
defendant Flagship Food Group has exposed individuals to lead from its sales of
Hatch Valley, Green Chile, manufactured by defendant that are sold,
distributed, or offered for sale to consumers in California by defendant and
its downstream distributors, private label resellers, and retailers, without
first providing clear and reasonable exposure warnings under Proposition 65
(“Covered Products”).
Plaintiff also asserts that it
mailed to defendant, the Office of the California Attorney General, and each of
California’s district attorney, city attorney, and/or prosecutors’ offices a
60-day Notice of Violation dated May 13, 2022. 
Plaintiff contends that on April 16, 2024, the parties finalized the
terms of the settlement and mutually executed a proposed consent judgment,
which plaintiff submitted to the Attorney General on April 25, 2024. 
1.      The Warning’s Compliance
“Whenever a clear and reasonable
warning is required under Section 25249.6 of the Act, the method employed to
transmit the warning must be reasonably calculated, considering the alternative
methods available under the circumstances, to make the warning message
available to the individual prior to exposure. The message must clearly
communicate that the chemical in question is known to the state to cause
cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to preclude a person from providing warnings other than
those specified in this article that satisfy the requirements of this article,
or to require that warnings be provided separately to each exposed individual.”
 Health & Saf. Code § 25601. 
The
proposed consent judgment states that beginning six months after the Effective
Date/Compliance Date, Flagship shall reduce the level of lead in the Covered
Product, if necessary, manufactured and shipped for sale in California to 0.5
micrograms of lead per serving, or be subject to the warning provisions in
Pars. 3.3 through 3.7.  For Covered
Products that do not meet the Target Level pursuant to para. 3.1, Flagship
agrees by the Compliance Date to only manufacture for sale, purchase for sale,
import for sale, or distribute for sale in or into California (in-person or
online) the Covered Product that contains a warning as provided in Paras. 3.4
through 3.7, including WARNING: 
Consuming this product can expose you to lead, which is known to the
State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive
harm or WARNING:  Cancer and Reproductive
Harm, with a citation to the P65Warnings website.  See Joseph R. Manning decl., ¶10; Exhibit B – a copy of
the Stipulated Consent Judgment, Sections 3.1-3.4.
The
Court finds that the warning(s) required by the settlement complies with
Proposition 65.
2.      Reasonableness
of Award of Attorney’s Fees and Costs
Plaintiff
explains that defendant agreed to pay $9,000 to plaintiff’s counsel for
plaintiff’s attorney’s fees and costs. 
Plaintiff asserts that its attorneys spent in excess of 49.5 hours and
accrued $30,764.83 in fees and costs, beginning in March 2022 through the
hearing on the motion.  The costs include
laboratory testing fees, expert consulting fees, filing fees, shipping costs,
plaintiff’s investigation costs, and product purchases.  Manning decl., ¶¶15, 20. Plaintiff is not seeking any fee enhancement
in the interest of finalizing the settlement.  Manning decl., ¶21.
The
Court finds that the requested attorney’s fees and costs are reasonable.
3.      Reasonableness
of the Penalty
Any civil penalty assessed under
Health and Safety Code § 25249.7(b)
must take into consideration certain factors including the following:
(A) The nature and extent of the
violation;
(B)  The number of, and severity of, the
violations;
(C)  The economic effect of the penalty
on the violator;
(D) Whether the violator took good
faith measures to comply with this chapter and the time these measures were
taken;
(E)  The willfulness of the violator’s
misconduct;
(F)  The deterrent effect that the
imposition of the penalty would have on both the violator and the regulated
community as a whole; and
(G) Any other factor that justice may
require.
The Attorney General promulgated
guidelines for the “other factors” to be considered within the meaning of
Health and Safety Code section 25249.7(b)(2)(G). Cal. Code Regs., tit. 11 § 3203 states: “The following factors
are ‘[other factors] which just may require’ to be considered . . . .: (a) A
settlement with little or no penalty may be entirely appropriate . . . . (b)
Where a settlement provides additional payments to an entity in lieu of a civil
penalty . . . such payments may be proper ‘offset’ to the penalty amount but
are only proper if the following requirements are met: (1) the funded
activities have a nexus to the basis for the litigation, i.e., the funds should
address the same public harm as that allegedly caused by the defendant(s) in
the particular case; (2) the recipient should be an entity that is accountable,
i.e., is able to demonstrate how the funds will be spent and can assure that
the funds are being spent for the proper, designated purpose; (3) if the entity
receiving the funds will in turn make grants of funds to other entities for
specified purposes, the method of selection of the ultimate recipient of
settlement funds must be set forth in the settlement agreement.” 
Plaintiff contends that the parties
agreed to a civil penalty of $1,000, apportioned in accordance with Health
& Saf. Code §25249(c)(1) with 75% remitted to  the State of California’s Office of
Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and 25% earmarked for plaintiff.  Plaintiff asserts that the parties agreed on
the civil penalty after settlement discussions spanning several months, which
included much correspondence between counsel, including exchange of laboratory
testing data, potential means of compliance with Proposition 65, requests for
data concerning the magnitude of sales of such Products in California, and
information on defendant’s role in the chain of commerce and relationships with
upstream and downstream entities.  Plaintiff
explains how the statutory factors support a finding that the civil penalty is
appropriate.  Manning decl., ¶¶11-13.
            In consideration of the factors
above, the Court finds the proposed penalty of $1,000 is reasonable.
4.      Public
Interest
“Reformulation
of a product, . . . or other changes in the defendant’s practices that reduce
or eliminate the exposure to a listed chemical, in lieu of the provision of a
warning, are [also] presumed to confer a significant benefit on the public.” 11
Cal. Code Regs., § 3201(b)(2).
 
The Court also finds that the settlement
is in the public interest.  Here, as
stated above, defendant has agreed to reduce the level of lead in the Covered
Product or provide a warning.  These
actions would reduce, if not eliminate, the public’s exposure to lead from the
Covered Product. 
Thus, the Court approves the
settlement and Stipulated Consent Judgment.
The motion is GRANTED.
