And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to approve the settlement and stipulated consent judgment between CALSAFE RESEARCH CENTER, INC. and FLAGSHIP FOOD GROUP LLC. The settlement concerns allegations that FLAGSHIP FOOD GROUP LLC exposed individuals to lead from its sales of Hatch Valley, Green Chile products in California without providing clear and reasonable exposure warnings under Proposition 65.

The Judge finds that the warning(s) required by the settlement comply with Proposition 65, that the requested attorney's fees and costs are reasonable, and that the proposed penalty of $1,000 is reasonable. The Judge also finds that the settlement is in the public interest, as it requires FLAGSHIP FOOD GROUP LLC to reduce the level of lead in the Covered Product or provide a warning, which would reduce or eliminate the public's exposure to lead.
