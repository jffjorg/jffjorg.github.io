Significant Statements:
  - "The purpose of the discovery rules is to enhance the truth-seeking function of the litigation process and eliminate trial strategies that focus on gamesmanship and surprise." (Juarez v. Boy Scouts of Am., Inc. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 377, 389)
  - "A trial court's determination of a motion to compel discovery is reviewed for abuse of discretion. However, when the facts asserted in support of and in opposition to the motion are in conflict, the trial court's factual findings will be upheld if they are supported by substantial evidence." (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 733)
  - "The Court does not find that Plaintiff's general reference to its document production suffices 'to specify the writings from which the answer may be derived or ascertained [...] in sufficient detail to permit the propounding party to locate and to identify, as readily as the responding party can, the documents from which the answer may be ascertained.'"
