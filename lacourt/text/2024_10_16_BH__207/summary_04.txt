Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered Plaintiff's motion to compel further production of documents, specifically a recorded statement of Ana Hernandez, a former employee of Defendant Marble & Tile USA, Inc. The Court finds that the recorded statement is protected by the attorney-client privilege and denies Plaintiff's motion to compel in its entirety. The Court also denies Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions. The Court's decision is based on the evidence presented, including the Declaration of Marie Rose, a claims adjuster for Travelers Insurance, which shows that the recorded statement was taken at the direction of counsel and intended to be confidential and not used for investigative or business purposes.
