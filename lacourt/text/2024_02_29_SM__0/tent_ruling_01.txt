SUBJECT:                 MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION PER
CCP § 1008(a)

PARTY:   Plaintiff Peter Sjostrand

PARTY:         Defendant Bye Bye
House, Inc.
TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff
Peter Sjostrand’s Motion for Reconsideration Per CCP § 1008(a) against
Defendants Bye Bye House, Inc is DENIED. Plaintiff Peter Sjostrand filed an
incorrect motion to appeal an order granting a motion to expunge lis pendens—the
timely request is petition for review and writ of mandate pursuant to CCP §
405.39. Plaintiff Peter Sjostrand’s motion for reconsideration is procedurally
deficient as the attached affidavit does not state the necessary elements
required under CCP § 1008(a).  
 
            Plaintiff
Peter Sjostrand (“Sjostrand”) brings a motion for reconsideration pursuant to
CCP § 1008(a) of an order granting Defendant Bye Bye House, Inc.’s (“BBH”)
motion to expunge lis pendens. (See Motion, p. 1.) A motion for reconsideration
is not the correct procedural mechanism by which to appeal an order granting a
motion to expunge a lis pendens. (See J&A Mash & Barrel, LLC, supra,
74 Cal.App.5th at p. 16 [“the exclusive means for challenging” an order
granting a motion to expunge lis pendens is through a writ of mandate within 20
days pursuant to CCP § 405.39].) 
 
Motions for reconsideration require that “[t]he
party making the application shall state by affidavit what application was made
before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new
or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown." (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd., (a).)  Sjostrand
did not state in either declaration, “what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008,
subd., (a); see Motion, p. 18–20, Givens Decl., Sjostrand Decl.) The facts and
evidence provided are the same as what was included in the opposition to the
motion to expunge lis pendens.  Sjostrand,
therefore, has not me his burden warranting reconsideration under CCP §
1008(a).
