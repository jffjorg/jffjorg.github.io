The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Peter Sjostrand's Motion for Reconsideration (CCP § 1008(a)) against Defendant Bye Bye House, Inc. The Plaintiff filed an incorrect motion to appeal an order granting a motion to expunge lis pendens, which is not the correct procedural mechanism. Instead, the Plaintiff should have filed a petition for review and writ of mandate pursuant to CCP § 405.39. Additionally, the Plaintiff failed to state the necessary elements required under CCP § 1008(a) in their motion for reconsideration.
