And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Katy Haute. Haute argued that the two-year statute of limitations had expired, and that the claims brought by Plaintiff J. Augustine were barred. However, the judge found that Augustine sufficiently alleged facts regarding the details of his discovery and his inability to discover the breach earlier, and therefore, the statute of limitations did not apply. The judge also denied Haute's motion to strike, finding that Haute did not provide any basis for the motion.

Additionally, the judge noted that the issue of whether Augustine's name is a pseudonym or not will be addressed at the hearing. The judge reminded counsel that the names of all parties to a civil action must be included in the complaint, and that litigating anonymously impacts the First Amendment public access right.
