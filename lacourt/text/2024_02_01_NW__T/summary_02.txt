And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claims in the First Amended Complaint fall within the scope of the arbitration provision in the retainer agreement. However, the judge found that the allegations in the complaint do not involve disputes over the legal services provided or the amounts to be paid by the plaintiff, but rather are for sexual assault and battery. The judge concluded that the defendant did not meet its initial burden to show that the claims are within the scope of the retainer agreement or the arbitration provision. The motion to compel arbitration and stay the action is therefore denied.
