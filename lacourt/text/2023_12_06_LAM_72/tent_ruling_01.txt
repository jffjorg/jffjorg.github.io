  23STCV03899
 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 6, 2023
 Calendar Number:  6



 
 
 
Plaintiff Dixon-Shane, LLC (“Plaintiff”) seeks an entry of
default judgment against Defendant Flash Servicing Company, Inc. (“Defendant”).
 
Plaintiff requests:
 
(1)  money
judgment in the amount of $824,141.98;
(2)  pre-judgment
interest in the amount of $51,841.92;
(3)  attorney’s
fees in the amount of $6,945.00; and
(4)  costs
of litigation in the amount of 676.24.
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is GRANTED. The
Court ORDERS Plaintiff’s counsel to return the Confession of Judgment to
counsel for Defendant upon satisfaction of this judgment and file a proof of
service with the Court.  
 
Background
 
This dispute arises out of a written Wholesaler
Application/Credit Application under which Defendant purchased pharmaceuticals
from Plaintiff on credit. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a Settlement and
Release Agreement (the “Agreement”) on September 29, 2021, under which
Defendant agreed to pay $1,425,150.63 to Plaintiff over time. Defendant also
entered into a Confession of Judgment which stipulated that, if Defendant
failed to perform on the Agreement, Plaintiff could file the Confession of
Judgment with a court and obtain judgment entered according to its terms.
 
Defendant underpaid its payments which were due on October
28, 2021 and November 28, 2021 and missed its December 2021 payment entirely.
 
On February 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed this action, raising
claims for (1) breach of contract; and (2) declaratory judgment. Plaintiff
named Defendant in the complaint, as well as naming Doe defendants 1 through 10.
 
On July 10, 2023, the Court entered default against
Defendant.
 
On September 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed the current request
for default judgment.
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP § 585 permits entry of a judgment after a Defendant has
failed to timely answer after being properly served.  A party seeking judgment on the default by
the Court must file a Form CIV-100 Request for Court Judgment, and: 
 
(1) Proof of service of the complaint and summons;
(2) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought (including Doe defendants) or
an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(7);
(3) A declaration
of non-military status as to the defendant (typically included in Form CIV-100)
(CRC 3.1800(a)(5));
(4) A brief summary of the case (CRC 3.1800(a)(1)); 
(5) Admissible
evidence supporting a prima facie case for the damages or other relief
requested (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361-362); 
(6) Interest computations as necessary (CRC 3.1800(a)(3)); 
(7) A memorandum of
costs and disbursements (typically included in Form CIV-100 (CRC 3.1800(a)(4));

(8) A request for
attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties (CRC
3.1800(a)(9)), accompanied by a declaration stating that the fees were
calculated in accordance with the fee schedule as per Local Rule 3.214.  Where a request for attorney fees is based on
a contractual provision the specific provision must be cited; (Local Rule
3.207); and
(9) A proposed form
of judgment (CRC 3.1800(a)(6));
(10) Where an
application for default judgment is based upon a written obligation to pay
money, the original written agreement should be submitted for cancellation (CRC
3.1806). A trial court may exercise its discretion to accept a copy where the
original document was lost or destroyed by ordering the clerk to cancel the
copy instead (Kahn v. Lasorda's Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th
1118, 1124);
(11) Where the
plaintiff seeks damages for personal injury or wrongful death, they must serve
a statement of damages on the defendant in the same manner as a summons (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11, subd. (c), (d)).
 
 
(California Rules
of Court rule 3.1800.)
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
A party who defaults only admits facts well pleaded in the
complaint or cross-complaint.  (Molen
v. Friedman (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153-1154.)  Thus, the complaint must state a claim for
the requested relief.
           
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Complaint and Summons
 
Defendant was served with the Complaint on March 27, 2023 by
substituted service on a receptionist at its place of business. (Troupson Decl.
¶ 5, Exh. 1.)
 
Dismissal of Other Parties
 
The Doe defendants were dismissed from the action on
September 26, 2023, pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
 
Non-Military Status
 
Plaintiff avers to the non-military status of Defendant in
the submitted Form CIV-100.
 
 
Summary of the Case
 
Plaintiff provides a brief summary of the case in its Brief
Statement of the Case. Plaintiff adequately pleads its causes of action in the
Complaint.
 
 
Evidence of Damages
 
In the event that Defendant failed to timely make any
payment, Plaintiff had the right under the Agreement to accelerate the
remaining payments and seek the outstanding balance in court. (Fraley Decl. ¶
14.) Billie Fraley avers that the outstanding amount under the Agreement is
$824,141.98. (Fraley Decl. ¶ 13.) 
 
Interest
 
The Complaint requests interest on the unpaid amount. (Complaint  p. 6:18.) The amount of principal damages is certain
because it is laid out in the loan agreements; pre-judgment interest is
therefore permissible here.
 
Theresa M. Troupson provides the interest calculation.
(Troupson Decl. ¶ 13-14.) The total interest is $51,841.92.
 
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements
 
Plaintiff includes a memorandum of costs in the submitted
Form CIV-100, averring that it expended $676.24 in costs.
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
          Plaintiff
requests $6,945.00 in attorney’s fees. The Agreement provides that the
prevailing party in an action arising out of the Agreement or the Confession of
Judgment shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of
litigation. (Fraley Decl., Exh. 1 at p. 6.)
 
          This
is an action on a contract. Because the judgment is over $100,000, the maximum recovery
of attorney’s fees is equal to $2,890 plus 1% of the excess over 100,000. (Local
Rule 3.214.) The excess over $100,000 here is $ 724,141.98. 1% of that amount
is $7,241.42. Thus, the maximum amount of attorney’s fees is $10,131.42.
Plaintiff’s request is within this amount. The Court therefore grants
Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees.
 
Proposed Form of Judgment
 
          Plaintiff
provides a proposed form of judgment consistent with the above.
 
Submission of the Written Agreement
 
          California
Rule of Court 3.1806 states that “unless otherwise ordered” judgment upon a
written obligation requires a clerk’s note across the face of the writing that
there has been a judgment. Here, Plaintiff has not submitted the original
documents. The Court does not discern any practical need for such a clerk’s
note on the written obligation in the current case and therefore orders that it
need not be included. If this causes any issues for any party or non-party they
are authorized to bring the matter to the Court’s attention.  
 
Statement of Damages
 
No statement of damages is required because this is not a
personal injury or wrongful death case.
