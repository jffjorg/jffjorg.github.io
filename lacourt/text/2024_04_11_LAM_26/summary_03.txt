And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Quinn Company's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and surrounding allegations in the First Amended Complaint. The court found that the allegations of malice, oppression, and fraud were insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. The court noted that the plaintiff had not alleged any facts to support these claims and that the allegations were made on information and belief without providing any factual basis to support the claims. The court also found that the plaintiff had not opposed the motion, which is a factor in determining whether leave to amend should be granted. As a result, the court denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend.
