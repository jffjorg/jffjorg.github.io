  [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
DEFENDANT HYUNKMOK CHO’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES 
 
 



 
Procedural
Background
             On August 9, 2019, Plaintiff Creditcard Data
Services, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Hyunmok Cho
aka Hank Cho (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 50, inclusive, alleging causes of
action for: (1) breach of written contract; and (2) statutory misappropriation
of trade secrets. The Complaint arises from the alleged breach of the
Confidentiality and Non-Compete Agreement (the “Agreement”), entered into
between Plaintiff and Defendant. (Complaint, ¶ 11-12; Exh. A.) The Agreement
states, in part, that “[t]he prevailing party in any action to enforce this
Agreement shall be reimbursed by the other party for its reasonable attorneys’
fees and all costs incurred in connection with such enforcement.” (Complaint;
Exh. A at ¶ 8.)  
On January 31, 2023, jury trial commenced.
On February 7, 2023, the jury returned a special verdict and found that
Defendant was not liable for breach of contract or misappropriation of trade
secrets. (02/07/23 Minute Order.) The Court entered Judgment on Special Verdict
on May 18, 2023. The Court’s judgment provides that Plaintiff shall recover
nothing by reason of their Complaint against Defendant, and Defendant shall
recover costs and disbursements per a memorandum of costs and reasonable
attorney fees per noticed motion. Notice of entry of judgment was served on all
parties on May 18, 2023. (05/18/23 Minute Order.) 
On July 17, 2023, after taking the matter
under submission, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for a new trial.
(07/17/23 Minute Order.) The Clerk mailed notice of the Court’s ruling to the
parties on July 17, 2023. 
On August 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
Notice of Appeal, which indicated that Plaintiff was appealing the Court’s May
18, 2023 entry of judgment in this matter. 
On September 26, 2023, Defendant filed and
served the instant Motion for Attorneys’ Fees. Defendant requests attorneys’
fees in the amount of $316,580.00.[1] 
On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition to Defendant’s motion for attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff does not take
issue with the reasonableness of Defendant’s requested attorneys’ fees. Rather,
Plaintiff argues that the motion is untimely and should therefore be denied. 
Defendant filed a reply brief on April 2,
2024.  
Although not raised by the parties, the
Court finds that Plaintiff’s pending appeal of the Court’s judgment does not
prohibit the Court from ruling on the instant motion because “[a] motion for
attorneys’ fees is not premature despite the filing of a notice of appeal.” (Bankes
v. Lucas (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 365, 368.) 

Legal
Standard
“In any action on a contract, where the
contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are
incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded to either one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
prevailing party on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in
addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).) “The court, upon
notice and motion by a party, shall determine who is the party prevailing on
the contract . . . whether or not the suit proceeds to final judgment.” (Civ.
Code, § 1717, subd. (b)(1).) “[T]he party prevailing on the contract shall be
the party who received a greater relief in the action on the contract.” (Civ.
Code, § 1717, subd. (b)(1).) A prevailing party is defined as “a defendant as
against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) An award of attorneys’ fees should
compensate “for all time spent, including time spent on fee-related issues.” (Downey
Cares v. Downey Community Development Com. (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 983, 997.)

“It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion.” (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618,
623.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily “begins with the
‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied
by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “The reasonable hourly rate is that
prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Margolin v. Regional
Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.)  
“[A] computation of time spent on a case
and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an
appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982)
134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on
consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided. (See Serrano v. Priest
(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees
award].) Such an approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective
determination of the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount
awarded is not arbitrary. (Id. at p. 48, fn. 23.) The factors considered
in determining the modification of the lodestar include “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”
(Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) “[T]he
burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks
are reasonable.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 44, 98.) “[A]n award of attorney fees may be based on counsel’s
declarations, without production of detailed time records.” (Raining Data
Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1365.) 
Where a party is challenging the
reasonableness of attorney’s fees as excessive that party must attack itemized
billing with evidence that the fees claimed were not appropriate or obtain the
declaration of an attorney with expertise in the procedural and substantive law
to demonstrate that the fees claimed were unreasonable.  (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550,
563-564.)  “[I]t is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence and arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not
suffice.” (Id. at p. 564.)  It is well established that the determination
of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of
the trial court.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096.)  
A “court should defer to the winning
lawyer’s professional judgment as to the tasks completed in an action because
he won, and might not have, had he been more of a slacker.” (Moreno v. City
of Sacramento (9th Cir. 2008) 534 F.3d 1106, 1111.) A losing party cannot
litigate tenaciously then be heard to complain about the time spent or tasks
performed by the prevailing party in response. 
(City of Riverside v. Rivera (1986) 477 U.S. 561, 580,
fn.11.)  Where a defendant does not
produce evidence contradicting the reasonableness of counsel’s hourly rates,
the Court will deem an attorney’s hourly rate as reasonable.  (Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC
(2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462, 473.)
Discussion
Untimeliness

Plaintiff contends that the motion for
attorneys’ fees should be denied because Defendant filed to timely file such a
motion and disregarded the obligation to seek relief from the deadline. Defendant
contends that the Court is empowered to grant relief from an untimely motion
seeking attorneys’ fees pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1702.
“A notice of motion to claim attorney’s
fees for services up to and including the rendition 
of
judgment in the trial court . . . must be served and filed within the time for
filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited civil
case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1702, subd. (b)(1).) “For good cause, the
trial judge may extend the time for filing a motion for attorney’s fees in the
absence of a stipulation or for a longer period than allowed by stipulation.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1702, subd. (d).) A party has 60 days from service
of notice of entry of judgment to file a notice of appeal. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 8.104, subd. (a)(1)(A).) If a motion for new trial is denied, then
the time to appeal from the judgment is extended until the earliest of: (1) 30
days after the superior court clerk or a party serves an order denying the
motion or a notice of entry of that order; (2) 30 days after denial of the
motion by operation of law; or (3) 180 days after entry of judgment. (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 8.108, subd. (b)(1)(A)-(C).) 
            “While an attorney fee motion should
be timely filed, the rule provisions are mandatory but not jurisdictional, and
on a proper showing under section 473, the trial court may grant relief for
such mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Community
Youth Athletic Center v. City of National City (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1385,
1444.) “[T]he trial court has considerably more latitude in ruling on an
extension of time to file an attorney’s fees motion under the good cause
standard of Rule 3.1702(d) than it does granting relief from a judgment,
dismissal [or] order under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision
(b).” (Robinson v. U-Haul Co. of California (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 304,
327.) “Even a claim of inadvertence, if it is not prejudicial, may constitute
good cause for a late filing.” (Id. at p. 326.) “Rule 3.1702(d) is ‘remedial’
and is to be given a liberal, rather than strict interpretation.” (Ibid.,
citation omitted.)
            Defendant’s motion for attorneys’
fees should have been filed no later than August 16, 2023, which would have
been 30 days from the date the Clerk mailed the Court’s ruling as to
Plaintiff’s motion for a new trial. Thus, it is undisputed that the instant
motion is untimely. On reply, Defendant’s counsel, Brad Lee (“Lee”), declares
that he failed to calendar the last day to file the motion for attorneys’ fees
and such failure was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Lee
Reply Decl., ¶ 8.) The Court t finds that Defendant has shown good cause for
the late filing of the motion on September 26, 2023 through counsel’s sworn
declaration. Plaintiff does not indicate any prejudice resulting from
Defendant’s late filing of the instant motion. 
            As such, the Court will consider
Defendant’s motion for attorneys’ fees on the merits. 
Evidence in Support of the Motion
            In
support of the motion, Lee provides a declaration stating the following: he was
actively and personally involved in this litigation since November 1, 2019.
(Lee Decl., ¶ 3.) Lee has been licensed to practice in California since 2002
and has completed over 55 trials and binding arbitrations. (Lee Decl., ¶ 4.)
Lee is fluent in Korean which was a tremendous asset this matter. (Lee Decl., ¶
4.) Lee’s hourly rate is $750.00, which he states is reasonable and customary
within the community of Southern California. (Lee Decl., ¶ 5.) Lee states that
his hourly rate is based on his years of experience, prior successes, the
nature of his practice, his track record at trial and arbitration, and the
hourly rates charged by both plaintiff and defense attorneys in this area. (Lee
Decl., ¶ 6.) Lee presents timesheets reflecting his 135.3 hours of work at
$750.00 per hour (without any enhancement or modification) for total attorneys’
fees of $101,475.00. (Lee Decl., ¶ 7; Exh. 3.) Lee states that he has not
claimed all of his time and his hourly rate is less than what he could actually
charge given his background and experience. (Lee Decl., ¶ 7.) Lee states that
he has spent 13.8 hours preparing the instant motion for total attorneys’ fees
of $10,350.00, and he anticipates spending a minimum of an additional 8 hours
($6,000.00) preparing the reply brief and attending the hearing on the motion.
(Lee Decl., ¶ 8.) Lee states he has excluded certain duplicative work with
co-counsel. (Lee Decl., ¶ 9.) 
            In support of the motion, James H. Kim (“Kim”) provides a
declaration stating the following: he was actively and personally involved in
this litigation since January 2023. (Kim Decl., ¶ 3.) Kim has been licensed to
practice in California since 2002 and has completed over 100 trials, the vast
majority of which being state and federal jury trials. (Kim Decl., ¶ 4.) Kim’s
hourly rate is $750.00, which he states is reasonable and customary within the
community of Southern California. (Kim Decl., ¶ 6.) Kim states that his hourly
rate is based on his years of experience, prior successes, the nature of his
practice, his track record trying cases, and the hourly rates charged by both
plaintiff and defense attorneys in this area. (Kim Decl., ¶ 7.) Kim presents
timesheets reflecting his 200.1 hours of work at $750.00 per hour (without any
enhancement or modification) for total attorneys’ fees of $150,075.00. (Kim
Decl., ¶ 8; Exh. 1.) Kim states he has not claimed all of his time and his
hourly rate is less than what he could actually charge given his background,
education, and experience. (Kim Decl., ¶ 8.) Kim states that he has spent 2
hours preparing the declaration in support of the motion for total attorneys’
fees of $1,500.00. (Kim Decl., ¶ 9.) Kim states that he has excluded
duplicative work with co-counsel. (Kim Decl., ¶ 10.) 

            In
support of the motion, Calvin J. Park (“Park”), provides a declaration stating
the following: he was actively and personally involved in this litigation since
the final quarter of 2019, and sets forth his involvement in this matter. (Park
Decl., ¶ 3.) Park has been licensed to practice law in California since 2020
and states that he has gained extensive knowledge of litigation, law and motion
practice, experience with taking and defending numerous depositions, and trial
preparation. (Park Decl., ¶ 5.) Park’s hourly rate is $350.00, which he states
is reasonable and customary within the community of Southern California. (Park
Decl., ¶ 6.) Park states that his hourly rate is based on his years of
experience, prior successes, the nature of his practice, his track record
trying cases, and the hourly rates charged by both plaintiff and defense
attorneys in this area. (Park Decl., ¶ 7.) Park presents timesheets reflecting
his 90.7 hours of work at $350.00 per hour (without any enhancement or
modification) for total attorneys’ fees of $31,745.00. (Park Decl., ¶ 8; Exh.
1.) Park states he has not claimed all of his time and his hourly rate is less
than what he could actually charge given his background, education, and
experience. (Park Decl., ¶ 8.) Park states that he has spent 2 hours preparing
the declaration in support of the motion for total attorneys’ fees of $700.00.
(Park Decl., ¶ 9.) Park states that he has excluded duplicative work with
co-counsel. (Park Decl., ¶ 10.) 
Analysis as to Reasonableness 
            Initially,
the Court will address Defendant’s request that Lee’s rate per hour be adjusted
upward to $800.00 per hour and that Kim’s hourly rate be adjusted upward to
$800.00 per hour. (Motion at p. 7:12-16.) The Court does not find that the
nature of this action warrants an increase in the hourly rates charged by Lee
and Kim. Apart from the jury trial in this action, Defendant filed a motion to
set aside default, a demurrer with a motion to strike, and a motion to quash a
subpoena for business records. Thus, there was not extensive motion practice
evidencing a lack of complexity in the litigation. Also, the Complaint only
raised two causes of action against Defendant. Moreover, only the declaration
of Kim states that all other trial work and intake of new clients was forgone
for at least two months to prepare for trial and to educate himself on matters
involving this case. (Kim Decl., ¶ 4.) The declaration of Lee does not state
whether any other employment was precluded due to this action. Thus, under Mountjoy
v. Bank of Am., supra, 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 271, an upward
adjustment of Lee and Kim’s hourly rate is not warranted. The Court will
calculate the attorneys’ fees of Kim and Lee at their declared hourly rates of
$750.00 per hour. 
            The
Court finds that Defendant is the prevailing party in this action pursuant to
Civ. Code § 1717 as judgment was entered in his behalf on all claims. The
Agreement provides for attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party. Plaintiff has
not presented any argument or evidence contradicting the reasonableness of
Defendant’s claimed attorneys’ fees. 
            The
lodestar amount for the work done by Lee—including hours spent on the instant
motion—is $111,825.00, which represents 149.1 hours of work at the rate of
$750.00 per hour. The lodestar amount for the work done by Kim—including hours
spent on the instant motion—is $151,575.00, which represents 202.1 hours of
work at the rate of $750.00 per hour. The lodestar amount for the work done by
Park—including hours spent on the instant motion—is $32,445.00, which
represents 92.7 hours of work at the rate of $350.00 per hour. 
            In
sum, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s motion for attorneys’ fees and awards
Defendant reasonable attorneys’ fees in the amount of $295,845.00. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
For the foregoing reasons, Defendant Hyunmok
Cho aka Hank Cho’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANED IN PART. The Court
awards Defendant attorneys’ fees in the reasonable amount of $295,845.00. 
Moving party is
ordered to provide notice and file proof of service of such.
