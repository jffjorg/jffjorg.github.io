 Case Number:  23STCV24205    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  26 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 26        1333    LAS PALMAS AVENUE, LLC ,                          Plaintiff,             v.   RYAN TORIGOE,                           Defendants.       Case No.: 23STCV24205     Hearing Date:  April 11, 2024     [TENTATIVE]    order RE: Plaintiff’s MOTION TO DEEM REQUESTs FOR ADMISSIONs ADMITTED and    request for monetary sanctions         Background On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff 1333 Las  Palmas Avenue, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against defendant Ryan  Torigoe (“Defendant”). This is an unlawful detainer action for failure to pay  rent.             On October 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed  the instant motion to deem admitted Defendant’s request for admissions. As of  April 9, 2024, Defendant has not filed an opposition.     Timeliness Under Code of Civil Procedure section  2033.250 subdivision (a), a party must respond to requests for admission within  30 days of service. However, these time limits are extended if served by mail,  overnight delivery, fax, or electronically.   (See CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(4), 1013.)  Failure  to do so waives all objections including privilege or on the protection of work  product.  (CCP § 2033.280(a).)              Plaintiff’s attorney declares that  the document was served on the in pro per Defendant on October 20, 2023, by mail.  (Godinez Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) In support,  Plaintiff submits the proof of service. (Godinez Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) Accordingly,  responses were due on or about November 20, 2023.  As of filing these motions no responses have  been given and Defendant is now represented by counsel.  (Godinez Decl. ¶ 7.)  Requests  for Admission             Plaintiff moves under Code of Civil Procedure  section 2033.280 to deem the request for admissions admitted. Where there has been no timely response to a  request for admissions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the  propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents  and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as  well as for a monetary sanction.  (CCP §  2033.280(b).)  The party who has  failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the court grants  that party relief from the waiver, upon a showing (1) that the party has  subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the  party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or  excusable neglect.  (CCP §  2033.280(a)(1-2).)  The court “shall”  grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that  the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,  before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for  admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (CCP § 2033.280(c).) As Defendant has not responded to the  request for admissions, Defendant’s motion for an order deeming the Request for  Admissions admitted is granted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280.  Defendant Ryan Torigue is deemed to have  admitted the truth of all matters specified in the Requests of Admission as of  this date. Sanctions Plaintiff requests sanctions against Defendant Ryan Torigue in the sum of $1,035.00.  “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who  unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to  interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted  with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition  of the sanction unjust.” See Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c).  Defendant did not file an opposition therefore the Court is unaware of  any substantial justification for the delay or reasons for it being unjust.  However, the Court finds the request for $1,035.00 for 3.0 hours of one  attorney’s time and the filing/appearance fee at a rate of $325 and filing fee  of $60 to be excessive due to the simplicity of the motion. Therefore, the  Court reduces the amount to $500.00 based on two hours of attorney time at a  rate of $325 and $60.00 in costs.   CONCLUSION AND  ORDER At the hearing on this motion, Defendant's counsel informed the Court that responses to the Requests for Admission had been served. Plaintiff’s motion for an order deeming  the Request for admissions admitted is taken off-calendar as moot.  Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is granted  in the modified amount of $500.00. The moving party is ordered to provide  notice of this order and file proof of service of such.   DATED: April 11, 2024                                                         ___________________________                                                                                           Yolanda  Orozco                                                                                           Judge  of the Superior Court
