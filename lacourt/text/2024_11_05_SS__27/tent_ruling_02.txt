MOTIONS TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
Hearing Date: 11/5/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV04390 ANTONIO
RODRIGUEZ-BAUTISTA, et al. vs TAYLOR COLTON KENT et al.
Moving Party: Defendants TAYLOR COLTON KENT 
Responding Party: Truck Insurance Exchange and
Plaintiffs Antonio Rodriguez Bautista and Christobal
Rodriguez Bautista
Notice: Sufficient
 
Ruling: Motion to Enforce Denied
 
Background
 
This action arises from an automobile accident that occurred on December
17, 2020. At the time of the accident, Plaintiff Antonio Rodriguez Bautista and
his brother, Plaintiff Christobal Rodriguez-Bautista, were in a vehicle acting within
the course and scope of their employment. Both individuals sustained injuries
and received Workers’ Compensation benefits from Plaintiff-in-Intervention,
Truck Insurance Exchange (“Truck”).
 
On April 22, 2022, Truck filed its subrogation lawsuit, which, on
November 28, 2023, was related to the present case, and the  cases were consolidated. The parties allegedly
reached a settlement whereby Truck was to receive $40,500.00, and the
individual Plaintiffs were to receive $9,500.00, with each party bearing its
own attorney’s fees and costs. However, Counsel for the individual Plaintiffs
has refused to return the release in the civil case. Defendant now moves the
court to enforce the settlement agreement against both the individual
Plaintiffs and Trucking.
 
Motion to Enforce Settlement¿¿  
  
CCP § 664.6 states: “If parties to pending
litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence
of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part
thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of
the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction
over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the
terms of the settlement.”¿¿¿  
¿¿¿  
To enforce a written settlement agreement
under CCP section 664.6, the following three elements must be met: (1) the
parties must have come to a meeting of the minds on all material points; (2)
there must be a writing that contains the material terms of the agreement; and
(3) the writing must be signed by the parties.¿ (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 797-98.)¿¿¿  
¿¿¿  
CCP § 664.6 “require[s] the signatures of the
parties seeking to enforce the agreement under [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 664.6 and against whom the agreement is sought to be enforced.”¿ (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232
Cal.App.4th 974, 985.)¿ CCP §
664.6’s “requirement of a ‘writing signed by the parties’ must be read to apply
to all parties bringing the section 664.6 motion and against whom the motion is
directed.”¿ (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 299, 306; see Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman
Const., Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 35-37 [“A written settlement
agreement is not enforceable under section 664.6 unless it is signed by all of
the parties to the agreement, not merely the parties against whom the agreement
is sought to be enforced.”].)¿ “A
procedure in which a settlement is evidenced by one writing signed by both
sides minimizes the possibility of … dispute[s] and legitimizes the summary
nature of the section 664.6 procedure.”¿ (Robertson
v. Chen (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1290, 1293.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿  
 
Discussion
Here, two separate settlement agreements purportedly make up
the global agreement among the parties: (1) an agreement between Plaintiffs and
Defendant; and (2) an agreement between Defendant and Truck.  However, neither settlement agreement at
issue here bears the signature of all parties. The settlement agreement between
the individual Plaintiffs and Defendant does not contain any signatures. The
settlement agreement between Defendant and Truck includes only Truck’s
signature but lacks Defendant’s. Defendant concedes that “Defendant did not
sign either of the personal injury or subrogation Settlement Agreements.” (Mtn.
at pg. 9.)
Strict compliance with statutory requirements is essential
before a court can enforce a settlement under Code of Civil Procedure § 664.6.
(Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc.
(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) Section 664.6 mandates that “the signatures of
the parties seeking to enforce the agreement under [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 664.6 and against whom the agreement is sought to be enforced” are
required. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014) 232
Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) This requirement for a “writing signed by the parties”
applies to all parties involved in the § 664.6 motion. (Harris v. Rudin,
Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 306; see also Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Const., Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30,
35-37 [holding that a settlement agreement is not enforceable under § 664.6
unless signed by all parties, not merely the parties against whom enforcement
is sought].)
Defendant has failed to satisfy the statutory requirements
of § 664.6, and thus, the motions are denied. Furthermore, Defendant requests
that the court compel Plaintiffs and their counsel to sign the settlement
agreement as allegedly agreed upon in the August 2, 2024 email. Such remedy is
unavailable under § 664.6. However, “The procedure to enforce a settlement
under section 664.6 is not exclusive; parties may pursue alternative relief,
such as a motion for summary judgment, a separate suit in equity, or an
amendment of the pleadings.” (Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th
578, 581.)
