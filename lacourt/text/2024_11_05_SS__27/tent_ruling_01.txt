CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV40224 YOUSEFF v.
MICHALENGELO, et al.  
Moving Party: Defendant Hertz
Responding Party: Unopposed 
Notice: Sufficient¿¿ 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS DENIED BUT
CROSS DEFENDANTS’ MSJ IS ADVANCED 
 
On November 2, 2021, Plaintiff filed the
present case. The trial date is currently set for January 22, 2025. Defendant
Hertz moves the Court to continue the trial date so its MSJ can be heard prior
to trial.
 
Numerous courts of appeal have held that a
trial court cannot refuse to consider a motion for summary judgment that is
timely filed. "A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 437c.
[Citation.] Local rules and practices may not be applied so as to prevent the
filing and hearing of such a motion." (Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First State Inc.
Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330 [invalidating case
management order to the extent it precluded filing motions pursuant to section
437c ]; Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918,
923 [local court rule that "require a party filing a complex summary
judgment motion to file the motion six months before the date set for trial is
void and unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section 437c"].) As
the Sentry court explained: "We are sympathetic to the problems the
trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many motions for summary
judgment. However, the solution to these problems cannot rest in a refusal to
hear timely motions." (Sentry, supra, at p. 530.)
 
Motions for Summary Judgment (MSJs) must be
served at least 105 days before trial, or 107 days before trial if served
electronically. (Cole v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
On October 7, 2024, Defendant served its MSJ via electronic service. The trial
date is currently set for January 22, 2025, which is 107 days from the service
of the MSJ. Therefore, the motion is timely. Defendant is entitled to have its
MSJ heard prior to trial.
 
This case was filed in November 2021, and the
trial is set for January 22, 2025, more than three years after the filing. The
Court is required to make diligent effort to ensure that civil cases conclude
within two years (see CRC 2.2). Therefore, the Court denies the request
for a continuance but advances the MSJ hearing to a date prior to trial.
 
No opposition was filed contesting Defendant’s
request to have its MSJ heard prior to the trial date. The court thus finds
good cause to advance Defendant’s MSJ to December 23, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.
