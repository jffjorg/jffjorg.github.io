And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to continue the trial date, but advances the cross-defendants' motion for summary judgment (MSJ) to a date prior to the trial date. The trial date is currently set for January 22, 2025, and the MSJ was served electronically on October 7, 2024. The court finds that the MSJ is timely and entitled to be heard prior to trial. The case was filed in November 2021, and the court is required to make diligent effort to ensure that civil cases conclude within two years. The court denies the request for a continuance, but advances the MSJ hearing to December 23, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.
