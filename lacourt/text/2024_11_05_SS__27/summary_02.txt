And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the parties in a lawsuit arising from an automobile accident. The settlement agreement is not signed by all parties, which is a requirement for enforcement under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 664.6. The judge finds that the Defendant has failed to satisfy this requirement and therefore denies the motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The judge also notes that the parties may pursue alternative relief, such as a motion for summary judgment or a separate suit in equity.
