Significant Statements:
  - The court must liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve all doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party
  - A property owner owes no further duty to make a condition reasonably safe or give an adequate warning of a condition when the danger of the condition is so obvious that the condition itself serves as a warning
  - Whether a condition is obvious and whether the obviousness negates a property owner's duty of care are legal questions for the court
  - The court may determine a condition is open and obvious where "photographs prima facie establish[] the obviousness" of the condition
  - The court notes that Fielder addresses trivial defects, not open and obvious dangerous conditions
  - There is an established body of law specifying factors such as the size of the displacement that courts must consider when determining whether a defect is trivial
  - The court finds that reasonable minds could differ as to whether the speed bump was open and obvious, particularly when considering whether a person might be distracted as they approach or otherwise unlikely to notice the condition, even if it could be safely avoided if seen.
