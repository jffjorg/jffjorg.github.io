Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most qualified (PMQ) with regards to certain categories of examination. The court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for this motion, as the information sought is necessary to demonstrate that the defendant was aware of the subject vehicle's defects but failed to replace or repurchase the vehicle. The court has ordered the defendant to produce its PMQ for deposition within 10 days of this order, and has specified what information the PMQ must provide regarding each of the categories of examination at issue. The court has also addressed the defendant's objections to certain categories of examination, finding that they are unfounded.
