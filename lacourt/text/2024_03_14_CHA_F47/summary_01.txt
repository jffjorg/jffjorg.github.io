And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling notes that the motion to compel is placed off calendar due to a defect in notice. The defendant, D&M Home Inspections, served the plaintiff, Delia Gonzalez, with interrogatories, but she failed to respond despite meet and confer efforts. The defendant is seeking an order compelling the plaintiff to serve complete and verified responses to the interrogatories within 7 days after the hearing, as well as imposing sanctions in the amount of $1,430. The court notes that there is no evidence that the plaintiff has consented to receive electronic service, and the email address listed in the proof of service is not a valid email address for the plaintiff. Therefore, the motion is being placed off calendar to allow the parties to cure the defect in notice.
