And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied, in part, and granted, with 20 days leave to amend, the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendants. The motion was denied as to the first cause of action for breach of contract, and granted as to the third cause of action for constructive trust. The judge found that the plaintiff has sufficiently stated facts to meet the elements of the cause of action for breach of contract, but that the existence, amount, and enforceability of the lien is a factual issue that cannot be adjudicated with a motion for judgment on the pleadings.

The judge also denied the motion as to the second, fourth, and fifth causes of action, finding that the plaintiff has sufficiently stated facts to meet the elements of those causes of action. The judge recognized the fifth cause of action as one based on quasi-contract.

Finally, the judge stayed the action as to defendants Kenechi Reuben Agu and KRA Legal, P.C., and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
