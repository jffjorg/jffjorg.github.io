And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the City of Gardena's demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Michael Sargent, a former City Lieutenant, alleges that he was discriminated against due to his age and disability when he was asked to take industrial disability retirement.

The judge found that the plaintiff failed to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action for disparate impact discrimination and disparate treatment discrimination under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action for hostile work environment harassment and unlawful retaliation.

The judge noted that the City's Resolution 6627 does not discriminate against individuals with disabilities and that the City Manager's requests for favors were not based on the plaintiff's age and disability. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to allege facts that he engaged in protected activity and that there was a causal link between the protected activity and the employer's action.

The judge granted the City's request for judicial notice and sustained the demurrer to the Sixth Cause of Action for Civil Action for Deprivation of Rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 with 20 days leave to amend.

The judge ordered the defendants to give notice of this ruling and granted the City 20 days leave to amend its demurrer.
