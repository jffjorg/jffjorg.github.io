 Case Number:  22PSCV00373    Hearing Date:   September 27, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
Plaintiffs’
APPLICATION FOR DEFAULT
JUDGMENT is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
 
This case
arises from an oral contract. Plaintiffs Art and Theresa Saracho (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) allege the following against Defendant Mario Lemus (“Defendant”):
In March 2021, the parties entered into an oral agreement[1]
wherein Defendant would prepare the necessary plans to obtain the required
permits to construct an ADU on the subject property. Defendant ceased all work,
requiring Plaintiffs to complete the project. The FAC seeks damages totaling
$127,912.00.
 
On April 13,
2022, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendant MARIO LEMUS, as an individual and
dba MAXIMUM VARIETIES STRUCTURES for: 1.     Breach Of Oral Contract 2.     Fraud 3.     Negligence And 4.     Violation Of Business &
Professions Code §17200
 
On May 31,
2022, default was entered against Defendant.
 
On August 25,
2022, Plaintiffs filed an application for default judgment, which on 1/26/23
the court denied with prejudice because the complaint sought damages “in an
amount not less than $100,000.00”, which amounted to open-ended liability.
 
On February
27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint (FAC) for the same
COAs against the same Defendants. 
 
On August 2,
2023, the court entered default against Defendants. That same day, Plaintiffs
filed the instant application for default judgment. 
 
Discussion
 
The
application is denied for a couple of reasons, notably (1) unclear evidence and
(2) certain damage(s) are not recoverable.
 
1.     Evidence 
 
As a
complaint governs the amount of damages and an application for default judgment
must submit evidence in support thereof,[2]
the court turns to the relevant allegations in the FAC that delineate the
payments subject to the instant judgment: 
 
-       
Plaintiffs
allege LEMUS indicated the cost for the construction was $57,000.00 and a ten
(10) percent deposit was required. On June 5, 2021, Plaintiffs allege they gave
LEMUS a payment of $5,700.00 as down payment for the construction. (FAC ¶¶ 16,
20)
-       
Plaintiffs
allege LEMUS further required a payment of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) to
prepare the plans and submit the permit request (FAC ¶17)
-       
they
gave LEMUS a check in the amount of $2,000 on March 20, 2021 (FAC ¶18)
-       
On
or about May 22, 2021, Plaintiff paid an additional $3,000.00 to Defendant for
the construction. (FAC ¶19)
-       
on
June 16, 2021, they gave LEMUS a check in the amount of ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00) for material and labor. (FAC ¶23)
-       
June
21, 2021, they gave LEMUS an additional check in the amount of thirteen
thousand dollars ($13,000.00) (FAC ¶24)
 
Adding the
payments, $5,700 + $2,000 + $2,000 + $3,000 + $10,000 + $13,000 equals $35,700.[3]

 
However, Plaintiffs’ declaration does not clearly
evidence the payments.
(Plaintiffs’ declaration generally sights to Exhibit 1 for the invoices.) 
 
For example,
the date of the first invoice provided is to 5/22/2021. Based upon the FAC, the
payment on 5/22/2021 was $3,000. (Plaintiffs’ Decl., p. 8 of 47 of PDF.) But
according to the invoice, the payment made on 5/22/2021 was for $1,200, not
$3,000. By way of another example, the next invoice is dated to 6/04/2021 with
a payment of $51,300.00. (Plaintiffs’ Decl., p. 9 of 47 of PDF.) However, the
FAC does not allege that a payment was made on 6/04/2021. 
 
Thus, as the
evidence does not match the allegations, the application is denied without
prejudice. Upon refiling, the court requests that each allegation that
mentions a payment be tied to a specific exhibit. 
 
Plaintiffs
also seek judgment for monies beyond payments. Plaintiffs’ declaration explains
the following costs sought: 
 
a. Monies paid directly to Defendants totaling $33,700.00; 
b. Costs to repair the Property due to Defendants’ negligent work
totaling $55,390.00;[4]

c. Fees and costs to obtain permits for construction of ADU totaling
$5,068.33; 
d. Storage costs totaling $3,150.00 
e. Loss rental income of $24,381.00.
 
In support of
costs to complete the new project, Plaintiffs cite to Exhibit 3. However, while
the invoice (dated to 12/26/2022) bears the $55,390.00 total, it is
unclear whether such payment has been made. Rather, it appears that this
will be the cost “to prepare” the project. (See Plaintiffs’ Decl., ¶28 [“The
cost to complete the new construction project and repair damage caused by
Defendant’s negligent work is approximately $55,390.00 plus an additional
$5068.33 to prepare the plans for the construction and obtain the permits.”].) 
 
Thus, it appears Plaintiffs are attempting to
recover for a cost not yet incurred. And if Plaintiffs have not yet started the construction to repair
Defendant’s work/complete the project, then Plaintiffs’ attempted recovery for
RV storage would likely not be recoverable as Plaintiffs have a duty to
mitigate damages,[5]
and it is unreasonable to not have resumed construction since Defendant’s
abandonment of the project in October 2021. 
 
Additionally,
Plaintiffs seek to recover for potential rent. (See Plaintiffs’ Decl., ¶35
[“Lastly, we intended to construct the ADU so that we could rent it out and
earn rental income. We had a prospective tenant that was prepared to enter into
a twelve (12) month lease agreement beginning in November 2021 at a monthly
rental rate of $1,161.00.”].) But the FAC does not seek special damages/consequential damages
nor does the FAC allege that Defendant was aware of such special damages.
As the court in Hadley v. Baxendale 156
Eng. Rep. 145 (Ex. Ch. 1854) concluded, a party injured by a breach of contract
can recover only those damages that either should “reasonably be considered ...
as arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things” from the
breach, or might “reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of
both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the
breach of it.” (Id. at 151.) On the basis of
the two rules of Hadley v. Baxendale, contract
law has conventionally distinguished between general or direct damages
on the one hand (i.e., damages that flow from a given type of breach without
regard to the buyer's particular circumstances) and special or consequential
damages on the other (e.g., consequential damages). And as to the latter
form of damages, they can be recovered only if, at the time the contract was
made, there was reason to foresee that the consequential damages were the
probable result of the breach. Put simply, when calculating expectation
damages, it is subject to limitations of what parties contemplated (i.e.,
foreseeable) during the time of contract formation. Here, however, Plaintiffs have not alleged that
Defendant was made aware that the ADU must be completed by November 2021 for
the purpose of a lease agreement. Plus, Plaintiffs’ have not provided
evidence that a tenant was secured (e.g., advertisements for the tenancy, the
lease, etc.). 
 
Therefore, Plaintiffs are not entitled to prospective rent. 
 
Conclusion
 
In sum,
Plaintiffs have not provided clear evidence of their payments nor a (legal)
explanation as to why they are entitled to certain damages beyond general
damages. Based on the foregoing, the application is denied without prejudice.
