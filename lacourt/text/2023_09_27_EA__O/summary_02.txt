## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion to compel discovery in a case where the plaintiff sought to amend their complaint.  The plaintiff's husband, who is not a party to the lawsuit, is the subject of a subpoena seeking his personal information, including social security numbers and financial details.  

The judge acknowledges that the plaintiff's husband is not a party to the lawsuit, and the defendants conceded that the requested information might be considered sensitive. The judge finds the defendants' argument for discovering the husband's personal information unconvincing, stating that the information is irrelevant to the case and not discoverable.  


Essentially, the judge is siding with the plaintiff and protecting the privacy of the plaintiff's husband.

However, the Judge has determined that Mr. So's personal information, such as his social security number and wage, is irrelevant to the case and not discoverable. The Defendants had conceded that this information is sensitive, and their analysis only pertained to the Plaintiff, further supporting the conclusion that Mr. So's information is immaterial to the promissory estoppel defense.
