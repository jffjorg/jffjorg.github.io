## English Summary

The judge is reviewing a case where Plaintiffs claim Defendant breached a contract by performing work poorly. The work caused further damage to Plaintiffs' property, increasing their expenses. The judge is unsure about the accuracy of Plaintiffs' calculation of damages, which they state is $33,700.00 but evidence shows payments totaling $35,700.00.  

The judge also notes that while Defendant did some work, it was done poorly and caused further damage, meaning the work itself needs to be repaired. 

The judge will consider the doctrine of mitigation of damages, which means Plaintiffs have a duty to minimize their losses.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the Plaintiffs are seeking damages from the Defendant. The Plaintiffs had requested written documentation from the Defendant, but it was not provided. The Judge notes that the Plaintiffs' computation of damages is uncertain, with the total payments adding up to $35,700, not $33,700. The Defendant did perform some work, but it was done in an unworkmanlike manner that caused damage to the property. The Judge cites the doctrine of mitigation of damages, which requires the Plaintiffs to take reasonable steps to mitigate their damages. The Judge also references previous cases, including Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. and Agam v. Gavra, which establish the importance of mitigating damages in breach of contract cases. The tentative ruling suggests that the Judge is uncertain about the Plaintiffs' claim and is considering the Defendant's arguments about the quality of work performed.
