And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a tentative ruling in a case where the Plaintiff is seeking damages from the Defendant. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant failed to provide written documentation, despite a request to do so. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's calculation of damages is uncertain, but that the payments made to the Defendant total $35,700, not $33,700 as claimed. The Judge also finds that the Defendant's work on the Plaintiff's property was performed in an unworkmanlike manner, causing damage that needs to be repaired. The Judge is considering the doctrine of mitigation of damages, which holds that a plaintiff has a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages caused by a breach of contract. The Judge may rule that the Plaintiff cannot recover for damages that could have been avoided through ordinary care and reasonable exertion.
