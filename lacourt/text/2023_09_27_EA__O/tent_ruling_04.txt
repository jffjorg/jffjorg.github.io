[1] According to
Plaintiffs, they requested a written documentation, but Defendant did not
provide such. 
 


[2] (See Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267 [on a default judgment,
the court must compare the properly pled damages
for each defaulting party with the evidence offered in the prove-up].) 
 


[3] As noted in the
court’s first tentative, the court is uncertain as to Plaintiffs’ computation.
The payments added equals $35,700, not $33,700.00. (See FAC ¶69; see also
Plaintiffs’ Decl., ¶38 [“Monies paid directly to Defendants totaling
$33,700.00”].) 
 


[4] Though Defendant
performed some work (demolished the inside of their garage and removed concrete
from their driveway FAC ¶57), it was done in an unworkmanlike manner that it
caused damage to the property such that the work done needs to also be
repaired. 
 


[5] “The doctrine of mitigation of
damages holds that ‘[a] plaintiff who suffers damage as a result of ... a
breach of contract ... has a duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate those
damages and will not be able to recover for any losses which could have
been thus avoided.’ [internal citation omitted]. Under the doctrine, ‘[a]
plaintiff may not recover for damages avoidable through ordinary care and
reasonable exertion.’” (Agam v. Gavra (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 91, 111.)
