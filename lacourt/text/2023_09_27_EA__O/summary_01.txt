And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to quash (or modify) and/or for a protective order regarding a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The court modifies the subpoena to allow for production of the specific section of the Form that states whether Plaintiff rented or owned the subject Recinto property. The court concludes that the subpoena is overly broad and that there are less intrusive means to obtain the information. The parties agreed to jointly own the Recinto Property, but Defendant O Chan told F Chan he didn't need to make payments when F Chan lost his job. K Chan made payments until 2020 when she paused due to COVID-19. The court has already granted motions for summary judgment and demurrer, and the parties have filed lawsuits and motions. The court finds that the subpoena seeks information that is irrelevant, unnecessary, and intrusive, and that it violates considerations of privacy.
