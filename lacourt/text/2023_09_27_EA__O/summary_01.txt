The tentative ruling grants the motion to quash (or modify) and/or for a protective order regarding a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The court modifies the subpoena to allow for production of the specific section of the Form that states whether Plaintiff rented or owned the subject Recinto property. The court concludes that the subpoena is overly broad and that there are less intrusive means to obtain the information. The parties agreed to jointly own the Recinto Property, but Defendant O Chan told F Chan he didn't need to make payments when F Chan lost his job. K Chan made payments until 2020 when she paused due to COVID-19. The court has already granted motions for summary judgment and demurrer, and the parties have filed lawsuits and motions. The court finds that the subpoena seeks information that is irrelevant, unnecessary, and intrusive, and that it violates considerations of privacy.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash or modify a subpoena for business records served by defendants to LENNAR Mortgage, LLC. The plaintiff, Kaymi Chan, argues that the subpoena seeks irrelevant, unnecessary, and intrusive information that violates her privacy. The defendants argue that the information is relevant to their defense and that there is no other way to obtain it. The judge agrees that some of the information is discoverable, but finds that the subpoena is overbroad and exceeds the scope of permissible discovery. The judge modifies the subpoena to allow only the production of the specific section of the Form that states whether the plaintiff rented or owned the subject property.

english:
The tentative ruling is for the motion to quash (or modify) and/or for a protective order regarding a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The motion is granted, and the subpoena is modified. The case is a real property dispute between siblings, Kaymi Chan, Fred Lapwo Chan, and On Chan. The plaintiffs and defendant agreed that Fred and On would contribute the down payment, Kaymi and Fred would contribute part of the mortgage payments, and On would contribute the property tax and insurance. However, in 2017, Fred lost his job, and On told him he need not continue to make payments if he removed his name from the title. On then added his wife, Binh Luu, to the title. Kaymi paused making monthly payments due to COVID-19. The plaintiffs seek relief for breach of oral contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, rescission, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, declaratory relief, and partition. The defendant filed a cross-complaint for rescission, breach of contract/lease, damage to real property, and declaratory relief. The court granted the defendant's demurrer in part and sustained the plaintiff's demurrer in part. After mediation, some causes of action were dismissed. The defendant then filed a motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The court granted the motion as to the second, third, tenth, and thirteenth causes of action, but did not grant it as to the twelfth cause of action for promissory estoppel. The plaintiff, Kaymi Chan, then filed the instant motion to quash the subpoena for business records served by the defendants to LENNAR Mortgage, LLC on the grounds that the subpoena seeks information that is irrelevant, unnecessary, intrusive, and violates considerations of privacy. The court modifies the subpoena to only allow for production of the specific section of the Form that states whether Plaintiff rented or owned the subject Recinto property.
