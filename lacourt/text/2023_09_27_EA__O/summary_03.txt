English Summary:

The Judge denied the Plaintiffs' application for default judgment in this case involving a dispute over an oral contract for construction work.  

The Judge found the Plaintiffs' evidence of payments made to the Defendant unclear and inconsistent with the presented documentation. Additionally, the Judge ruled that certain damages sought by the Plaintiffs, including lost rental income and costs for future repairs, were not properly supported and may not be recoverable.

The Judge denied the application without prejudice, meaning the Plaintiffs can refile their application after providing clearer evidence and addressing the concerns raised about the recoverability of certain damages.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant, Mario Lemus, breached an oral contract to prepare plans to obtain permits for the construction of an ADU on the subject property. The plaintiffs claimed damages totaling $127,912.00, including payments made by them, costs to repair the property, fees and costs to obtain permits, storage costs, and loss rental income.

The judge found that the application was denied due to unclear evidence of the payments made by the plaintiffs. The judge also found that certain damages were not recoverable as they were not contemplated by the parties at the time of the contract. Specifically, the judge found that the costs to repair the property and the fees and costs to obtain permits were not recoverable as they were not incurred yet. The judge also found that the plaintiffs were not entitled to prospective rent as there was no evidence that a tenant was secured.

The judge requested that the plaintiffs refile their application with clear evidence of their payments and a legal explanation for why they are entitled to certain damages beyond general damages.

summary:
  The tentative ruling denies Plaintiffs' Application for Default Judgment without prejudice due to unclear evidence and certain damages not being recoverable. The case arises from an oral contract in March 2021 where Defendant was supposed to prepare plans for constructing an ADU on the subject property. However, Defendant ceased all work, and Plaintiffs had to complete the project. Plaintiffs seek damages totaling $127,912.00 for breach of oral contract, fraud, negligence, and violation of Business & Professions Code §17200. Default was entered against Defendant in May 2022, and Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint in February 2023 for the same causes of action against the same Defendants. The court entered default against Defendants in August 2023, and Plaintiffs filed the instant application for default judgment. However, the application is denied due to unclear evidence regarding payments and Plaintiffs seeking damages beyond general damages, such as prospective rent, without providing a legal explanation or evidence that Defendant was aware of the special damages.
