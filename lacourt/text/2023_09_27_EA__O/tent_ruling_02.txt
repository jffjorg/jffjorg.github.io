[1] While leave to amend
was granted, Plaintiffs did not file a Second Amended Complaint. 
 


[2] And
as to Mr. So’s (Plaintiff’s husband, who is a non-party) personal information
such as social security numbers, wage and salary, etc. that could be obtained
from this subpoena, that information is inarguably irrelevant, a point tacitly
conceded by Defendants in opposition. (See Opp. p. 5:3-5 [“Plaintiff
contends that the information sought includes sensitive personal information,
such as social security numbers, wage, and salary etc of her and her husband,
who is not a party to the lawsuit. Although these things may be true ….”],
emphasis added.) To the extent Defendants aver Mr. So’s personal information is
discoverable, the analysis Defendants provide only pertains to Plaintiff, which
but further evidences Mr. So’s information is immaterial to the promissory
estoppel defense and thus not discoverable.
