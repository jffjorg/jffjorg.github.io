And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default entered against Northpoint School. The defendant, Child and Family Guidance Center, argued that Northpoint School is not a separate legal entity, but rather a fictitious business name used by the defendant. The court finds that the defendant has established that Northpoint School is not a separate legal entity and that the default should be set aside. The court concludes that the defendant has shown a valid basis for relief under the discretionary relief authority of Code of Civil Procedure section 437 or its inherent power as outlined under Code of Civil Procedure section 128. The court sets aside the default and grants the defendant's motion to file an amended answer. The defendant is ordered to file and serve the amended answer within 10 days. The moving party is ordered to give notice."
