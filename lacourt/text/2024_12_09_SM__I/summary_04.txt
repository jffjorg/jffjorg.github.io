And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion for judgment on the pleadings. The case is related to a Bankruptcy Action brought in Florida, and the Bankruptcy Court has issued an order that requires claims to be determined through a specific process. The defendant claims that this case falls under this order, and any claims for recovery must be brought through the Tort Claims Trust. Since this is the case, the matter before the court is considered a barred claim and cannot proceed. The plaintiff likely agrees with this assessment, which is why there is no opposition to the motion. The motion is therefore granted without leave to amend, and the defendant is responsible for preparing the final order.
