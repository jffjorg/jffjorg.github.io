The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to strike a declaration filed by defendant Irvin. The declaration was filed in response to the plaintiff's complaint and objected to service. The judge agrees with the plaintiff that filing a declaration is not an appropriate way to attack service and recommends that the parties agree that service is effective as of the present date. The judge also suggests that the parties move forward to the merits of the case and not continue to engage in disputes over service. The judge notes that Irvin and Zytko have actual knowledge of the lawsuit and its basis, and that the purpose of service has been fulfilled. The judge urges the parties to refrain from further disputes and instead focus on resolving the case through the merits.
