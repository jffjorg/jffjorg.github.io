And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for sanctions filed by the plaintiff. The judge found that the motion was not served on the defendants 21 days before it was filed, as required by CCP section 128.7. The judge also noted that the plaintiff has no fees or costs that can be awarded under the statute.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's motion under the Discovery Act, which sought sanctions in an amount equal to the fees and costs incurred in bringing or opposing a discovery motion. The judge found that the plaintiff has no basis for the motion, as there is no evidence of abusive discovery or short deadlines.

The judge did, however, order the defense to provide insurance information to the plaintiff within 10 days. The judge also reminded the parties of the upcoming trial and final status conference and encouraged them to work together to prepare for the conference.

The judge's ruling is based on the facts presented and the applicable laws and statutes. The judge found that the plaintiff's claims of abusive discovery and short deadlines are unsupported by the record and that the defense has a duty to respond to discovery requests.
