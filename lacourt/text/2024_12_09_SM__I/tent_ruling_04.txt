 Case Number:  24SMCV00071    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion for judgment on the pleadings is
GRANTED.  This suit is within the
proceedings of a Bankruptcy Action brought in Florida.  It appears that the Bankruptcy Court has set
forth an order that deals with certain litigation, requiring that those claims
be determined according to the order and not through separate lawsuits.  This case appears to fall within the
Bankruptcy Court’s channeling order and any claims for recovery must be brought
pursuant thereto and will be paid through the Tort Claims Trust.  At least that is what defendant contends and
what the evidence submitted in support suggests.  Because of that, the matter now before the
court is a barred claim and cannot proceed. 
Plaintiff likely agrees, which is why there is no opposition.  The motion is therefore GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE
TO AMEND.  Defendant to prepare the
appropriate final order.
