And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment and instead has set a hearing to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed. The hearing will also consider sanctions of $250 against the plaintiff's counsel for failing to enter the default judgment in a timely manner. The judge's decision is based on the lack of foundation in the declaration submitted by the plaintiff, which fails to establish the facts alleged and authenticate the exhibits attached.
