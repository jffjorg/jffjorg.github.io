The court has reviewed the petition to approve compromise of pending action of a minor, filed by Petitioner Sasha Santana on behalf of Claimant Jayde Santana, age 11. The court denies the petition without prejudice for the following reasons. Petitioner checked item 14a, indicating they are not seeking reimbursement, but failed to fill out item 14b accordingly. Additionally, counsel representing other parties in the action must provide an updated attachment and include attorney fees received through other minors' compromises in item 17f. The court denies the petition without prejudice, and Petitioner must give notice and file proof of service.
