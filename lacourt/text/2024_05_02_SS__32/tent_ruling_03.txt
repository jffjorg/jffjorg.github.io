court may permit withdrawal or amendment of an admission only if it determines
that the admission was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect, and that the party who obtained the admission will not be
substantially prejudiced in maintaining that party’s action or defense on the
merits.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.300(b).)
