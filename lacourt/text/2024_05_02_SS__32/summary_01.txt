Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court has granted the Defendant's motion to reopen discovery to designate new experts to analyze SPECT data related to Dr. Steven Storage's opinions on Plaintiffs' traumatic brain injury causation. The Court found that the Defendant acted diligently in seeking to reopen discovery and that the trial date would not likely be affected. The Court noted that the Defendant's current experts are not qualified to analyze the SPECT data. The Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the Defendant failed to review medical records showing that Dr. Storage's opinions were based on the SPECT test. The Court ordered the Defendant to provide notice and file a proof of service of the new experts.
