MOTIONS:  


Motion
  for Reconsideration




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Farida Amer  




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  Rasier-CA, LLC



 
BACKGROUND
 
On March 6, 2024, the Court
granted Defendant Rasier-CA, LLC’s (“Defendant”) unopposed motion to
compel three sets of discovery responses and to deem admitted three sets of
Request for Admissions against Plaintiff Farida Amer (“Plaintiff”). (Min.
Order, 3/6/24.) 
 
On March 7, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion for reconsideration of the Court’s March 6, 2024 order
deeming the truth of the admissions. Plaintiff brings this motion under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 1008 and 473(b). Defendant opposes. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Reconsideration
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 provides, in pertinent
part:   
 
“(a) When an application for an order has been made to a
judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make an application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.  
 
(b) A party who originally made an application for an order
which was refused in whole or in part, or granted conditionally or on terms,
may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts circumstances, or law are claimed to
be shown. For a failure to comply with this subdivision, any order made on a
subsequent application may be revoked or set aside on an ex parte
motion.   
… 
(e)¿This section specifies the court’s jurisdiction with
regard to applications for reconsideration of its orders and renewals of
previous motions, and applies to all applications to reconsider any order of a
judge or court, or for the renewal of a previous motion, whether the order
deciding the previous matter or motion is interim or final. No application to
reconsider any order or for the renewal of a previous motion may be considered
by any judge or court unless made according to this section.”  
 
(Code Civ. Proc. section 1008, subds. (a),
(b), (e).)   
 
A motion for
reconsideration under Section 1008 requires that the moving party present new
or different facts that were not previously considered by the Court. (New
York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-13.)
However, the burden under Section 1008 “is comparable to that of a party
seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information
must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have
discovered or produced it at the trial.” (Id.; Even Zohar
Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61
Cal.4th 830, 833 [finding that Section 1008 imposes the special requirement of
having to not only show new or different facts, circumstances, or law, but also
to “show diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not presenting the new
or different information earlier…”].)¿¿A disagreement with a ruling is not a
new fact that will support the granting of a motion for reconsideration. (Gilberd
v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500.)  
 
If the above
statutory requirements are met, reconsideration should be granted. However, a
court is not required to change its decision upon reconsideration. (Corns v.
Miller (1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 195, 202, 226 CR 247, 251.) Although parties
may move for reconsideration only as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, the statute “do[es] not limit the court's ability, on its own
motion, to reconsider its prior interim orders so it may correct its own
errors.” (Le Francois v. Goel¿(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1107.)  
 
Relief under Section 473(b)
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may
relieve a party from a dismissal taken against him through his mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  This application must be
filed no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is
sought, and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  
 
A mistake is a basis for relief under section 473 when by
reason of the mistake a party failed to make a timely response.¿ Surprise
occurs when a party is unexpectedly placed in a position to his injury without
any negligence of his own. Excusable neglect is a basis for relief when the
party has shown some reasonable excuse for the default.¿ (Credit Managers
Association of California v. National Independent Business Alliance (1984)
162 Cal.App.3d 1166, 1173; Davis v. Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892,
905.)¿ Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, the moving party bears the
burden of demonstrating an excusable ground, such as fraud or mistake,
justifying a court’s vacating a judgment.¿ (Basinger v. Roger & Wells
(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23–24.)¿¿¿ 
 
Relief under
this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) However mandatory relief is only
available when a party fails to oppose a dismissal motion (“which are
procedurally equivalent to a default”). (Leader v. Health Industries
of America, Inc.¿(2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) The mandatory relief
provision does not apply to dismissals for “failure to prosecute [citations
omitted], dismissals for failure to serve a complaint within three years
[citations omitted], dismissals based on running of the statute of limitations
[citations omitted], and voluntary dismissals entered pursuant to settlement
[citations omitted].” (Id.)       
 
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
The Court declines Defendant’s requests for judicial notice as they
have no effect on the ruling herein. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff contends that a day
before the hearing, she provided responses to the three sets of Requests for
Admissions, but due to attorney error, the verifications were not properly
dated and did not have the full clause “signed under penalty of perjury.” Additionally,
the verifications should have stated that they were signed in Korea and not Los
Angeles. Plaintiff asserts she provided corrected verifications to Defendant on
March 7, 2024, a day after the hearing. 
 
According to Plaintiff, these facts
were disclosed to the Court at the hearing. (Motion, 3.) In response, Defendant
showed that the verifications contained defects. Since Plaintiff admits she did
not cure the verifications until the day after the hearing, they were unverified
and tantamount to no response at all. (Appleton v. Superior Court (1988)
206 Cal. App. 3d 632, 635-36.)¿ The granting of the motion was therefore
proper, and these facts were disclosed at the hearing. Therefore,
the motion for reconsideration under section 1008 is denied since Plaintiff fails
to present new facts that were not considered by the Court. 
 
Plaintiff alternatively seeks relief under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). The Court cannot grant this motion
based on section 473(b) because Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300
provides a method for relief from an order deeming the truth of admissions.
(See Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979; Zellerino v.
Brown (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1097, 1107 [“Relief under section 473 is
unavailable when the discovery act provides analogous, if more limited
relief.”]. Here, Defendant did not bring this motion under section 2033.300.[1] 
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
