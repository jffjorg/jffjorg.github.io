MOTION
 
On August 11, 2022, Plaintiff David Lopez (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Tyler Cassidy, Rocio Sandoval, and Does 1 to 50
for negligence related to a motor vehicle accident. 
 
Defendant Rocio Sandoval (“Defendant”) now demurs to the complaint for
failing to state facts to constitute a cause of action and for uncertainty. Plaintiff
filed an opposition on April 30, 2024. The Court exercises its discretion to
consider the late-filed opposition.[1]
Defendant replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A demurrer is a pleading used to
test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. 
It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the
opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege
ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter
of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is that his complaint set
forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precision and with
sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source and
extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149,
156-157.) 
 
On demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to
“determine whether or not the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a
cause of action under any legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.) Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
A
demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the pleading is so bad
that the responding party cannot reasonably respond, i.e., he or she cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what claims are
directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Where a demurrer is made upon the ground of uncertainty,
the demurrer must distinctly specify exactly how or why the pleading is
uncertain, and where such uncertainty appears by reference to page and line
numbers. (See Fenton v. Groveland Comm. Services Dist. (1982) 135
Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)
 
            Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
According to the Declaration of Mai
X. Nguyen, counsel for Defendant sent correspondences to Plaintiff’s counsel
requesting a meet and confer on this demurrer but received no response. Even
assuming that the meet and confer letter was sent to the incorrect email
address as Plaintiff contends, “[a] determination by the court that the meet
and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain
a demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41 (a)(4).)
 
ANALYSIS
The elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) a
duty on the part of defendant toward plaintiff; (2) defendant’s breach of that
duty; and (3) harm to the plaintiff caused by that breach. (Kesner v.
Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1142.)  
Generally, “one who places or entrusts his [or her] motor vehicle in the
hands of one whom he [or she] knows, or from the circumstances is charged with
knowing, is incompetent or unfit to drive, may be held liable for an injury
inflicted by the use made thereof by that driver, provided the plaintiff can
establish that the injury complained of was proximately caused by the driver's
disqualification, incompetency, inexperience or recklessness.”¿(Flores v.
Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1055, 1063 [quoting Osborn
v. Hertz Corp. (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 703, 708] [alteration in original;
citation omitted].)
Here,
the complaint alleges that on August 12, 2020 a motor vehicle driven by David
Lopez collided into Plaintiff’s vehicle, causing injuries. (Complaint ¶ 7-9.) It also alleges that defendants were “owners
and operators” of the subject vehicle, and that “each of them, so negligently
entrusted, managed, maintained, drove, and operated said defendants' vehicle.”
(Id. ¶ 6, 9.) 
 
Based
on this, the Court finds the complaint is not so uncertain that Defendant
cannot reasonably respond or understand the claims asserted against him.
However, seeing as Defendant is not alleged to have driven the car, his
liability appears to be based on a theory of negligent entrustment. The
complaint contains no allegations that Defendant knew the driver was
incompetent or unfit to drive. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained with leave
to amend. 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court sustains Defendant Rocio Sandoval’s demurrer to
Plaintiff’s complaint with leave to amend. Any amended complaint must be filed
and served within 30 days.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
