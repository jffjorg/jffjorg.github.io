```
Case Number: 21STCV01840
Court: Department 32
Hearing Date: May 2, 2024

Parties:
- Plaintiff: Farida Amer
- Defendant: Rasier-CA, LLC

Background:
- On March 6, 2024, the Court granted Defendant's unopposed motion to compel discovery responses and deem admitted Request for Admissions against Plaintiff.
- On March 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's March 6, 2024 order deeming the truth of the admissions.

Legal Standard:
- Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 provides for reconsideration of an order based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law.
- A party seeking reconsideration must show diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not presenting the new or different information earlier.

Motion for Reconsideration:
- Plaintiff contends that a day before the hearing, she provided responses to the three sets of Requests for Admissions, but due to attorney error, the verifications were not properly dated and did not have the full clause "signed under penalty of perjury."
- The Court declines Defendant's requests for judicial notice.
- Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration under section 1008 is denied since Plaintiff fails to present new facts that were not considered by the Court.

Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b):
- The Court cannot grant Plaintiff's motion for relief under section 473(b) because Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300 provides a method for relief from an order deeming the truth of admissions.

Conclusion and Order:
- The Court DENIES Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration.
- Plaintiff shall provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
