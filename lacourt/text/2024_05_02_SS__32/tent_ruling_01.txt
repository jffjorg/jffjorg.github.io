OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiffs
  Phillip Bernard and Antoinette Bernard



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On August 19, 2019, Plaintiffs
Phillip Bernard and Antoinette Bernard (“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendant
Bing H. “Keni” Huang (“Defendant”) after allegedly being hit by a golf ball from a
golf course. Defendant filed his answer on January 14, 2020.  
 
On October
16, 2020, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued trial and all related
dates from February 16, 2021 to August 19, 2022. 
 
On August
12, 2022, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued trial and expert
discovery cutoffs to November 28, 2022. Fact discovery remained closed. 
 
At the
final status conference, the parties orally stipulated to continue trial to
December 12, 2022. All discovery was closed. (Min. Order, 11/15/22.) 
 
On November
21, 2022, the Court granted Defendant’s ex parte application and continued
trial and all related dates to January 27, 2023.
 
On January
11, 2023, the Court ordered the parties to participate in a mandatory
settlement conference. The Court then continued trial, on its own, to March 24,
2023. 
 
On March
17, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte application shortening the time
to hear a motion to continue trial. Pursuant to oral stipulation, the Court
continued trial to June 22, 2023. All discovery was closed with the exception
of Dr. Molaie. (See Min. Order, 3/17/23.)
 
On June 22,
2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel was engaged in another trial. Pursuant to oral
stipulation, the trial was continued to October 2, 2023. All discovery remained
closed. (Min. Order, 6/22/23.)
 
On October
2, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel requested a continuance since their primary expert
witness was not available due to a personal health procedure. Defendant
objected. The Court continued trial to November 1, 2023. All discovery remained
closed.
 
On November
1, 2023, trial was continued to November 6, 2023 and discovery remained closed.
When the case was called for trial, the parties each made peremptory challenges
to judicial officers under Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6. As a result,
pursuant to oral stipulation, trial was continued to March 6, 2024. Discovery
remained closed. (Min. Order, 11/6/23.) 
 
On February 13, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to reopen
discovery to complete discovery related to Plaintiff’s treating physician Dr.
Steven Storage. (Min. Order, 2/13/24.) 
 
On March 6, 2024, the case was called for trial and pursuant to oral
stipulation, continued to March 11, 2024. The discovery/motion cut off was
closed, and the pre-trial motion cut off remained in effect.  
 
On March 11, 2024, the case was called for trial and pursuant to oral
stipulation, continued to June 3, 2024. All discovery remains closed, and the
pre-trial motion cut off remains in effect. 

 
On April 29, 2024, pursuant to stipulation, the Court continued trial
to June 10, 2024. 
 
On March 8, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to reopen
discovery to designate psychiatrist Jeffrey A. Lieberman, M.D. and radiologist
Jay S. Tsuruda, M.D. as retained experts. Plaintiff opposes and Defendant
replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“On motion of any party, the court may grant leave to
complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery heard,
closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new trial date
has been set.¿ This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., section 2024.050, subd.
(a).)¿ 
¿¿ 
“In exercising its discretion to grant or deny this motion,
the court shall take into consideration any matter relevant to the leave
requested, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) The necessity and
the reasons for the discovery.¿ (2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the
party seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the
reasons that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was
not heard earlier.¿ (3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing
the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the date set,
or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any
other party.¿ (4) The length of time that has elapsed between any date
previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., section 2024.050, subd. (b)(1)-(4).)¿¿¿ 
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen discovery,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., section 2024.050, subd. (c).)¿¿¿ 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of David Belofsky contains limited facts about a meet
and confer effort. The declaration only states that “[t]he defense also advised
attorney Markley of its intent to retain new experts to address the issues
raised by the SCAT imaging as testified to by Dr. Storage at his February 26th
deposition.” (Belofsky Decl. ¶ 10.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
The Court
reopened discovery in this case on February 13, 2024 for the
limited purpose of allowing discovery related to Plaintiff’s treating
physician, Dr. Steven Storage, who he began seeing in November 2023. Dr.
Storage was deposed by Plaintiff on February 26, 2024. Defendant argues Dr.
Storage testified about Plaintiff’s traumatic brain injury causation.
Additionally, Defendant asserts that Dr. Storage’s opinions are based on the
use of a controversial single-photon emission computed tomography (“SPECT”). Defendant
contends the use of this technology requires radiographic and psychiatric
analysis from experts. As a result, Defendant seeks to designate psychiatrist
Jeffrey A. Lieberman, M.D. and radiologist Jay S. Tsuruda, M.D. as retained
experts. Defendant contends his current experts are not qualified to analyze
the SPECT data. (Belofsky Decl. ¶ 16-17.)
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues Defendant was aware in November 2023 that
Dr. Storage’s opinion on causation and treatment derived from the SPECT test. However,
Plaintiff does not provide the medical records showing this. Also, the February
26, 2024 deposition transcript does not show that Defendant failed to review
the November 2023 medical records as Plaintiff contends. (See Markley Decl.,
Exh. 1.) 
 
Based on the information provided, it appears that Defendant acted
diligently seeing that he learned that Dr. Storage was basing his medical
opinion on the SPECT test on February 26, 2024. The trial is currently set for
June 10, 2024, meaning that to permit discovery regarding the SPECT data would
likely not affect the trial date.
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
motion to reopen discovery is GRANTED. 
 
Defendant to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
