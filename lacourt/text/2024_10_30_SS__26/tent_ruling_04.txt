Carrillo v. Becerra, et al.PETITION TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD
(CCP § 1285, et seq.)
 

 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: 
 
Petitioner Fabian Carrillo’s Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award is DISMISSED.
 
 

ANALYSIS:
 
On March 17, 2024, Petitioner Fabian Carrillo (“Petitioner”)
filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the “Petition”)
against Laura Becerra (“Respondent”). The Petition initially came for hearing
on July 31, 2024, at which time the Court ruled that it did not meet the
necessary procedural or substantive statutory requirements. (Minute Order,
07/31/24.) These requirements were detailed in the Court’s order and the
hearing was continued to give Petitioner an opportunity to correct the
deficiencies. (Ibid.) On September 26, 2024, Petitioner filed a document
entitled “Evidence.” No proof of service of, nor opposition to, the Petition
has been filed to date.
 
 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be
served on Respondents “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for
the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
It remains that no proof of service of the Petition and
Notice of Hearing has been filed as required by Code of Civil Procedure section
1290.4. The arbitration agreement is now submitted with the “Evidence” and
demonstrates that it does not provide for the manner of service of the Petition
and Notice of Hearing, which must therefore be served in the manner provided
for service of a summons. Without a
proof of service, the Court cannot find that the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1290.4 are satisfied. 
 
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service
of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a
signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by
registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1283.6.) This requirement may be satisfied by service by the
arbitrator, or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) The
arbitration award was served on the parties by certified mail on February 7,
2023, meeting the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6.
(Evidence, p. 3.) 
 
Also, a party seeking a court judgment confirming an
arbitration award must file and serve the petition no more than four years, but
not less than 10 days, after the award is served.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) As there is no proof of service of
the Petition, Petitioner also has not demonstrated compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and
1288.4.
 
 
Confirmation of the Arbitration Award
 
An arbitration award
is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award
as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The Petition now sets forth the
nature of the arbitration agreement, attaches a copy of the award, and demonstrates
the name the arbitrator. (Evidence, pp. 2-7.) However, this demonstrates that
the arbitration award resolves a dispute between Laura Becerra and “Fabian
Carrillo Pools.” (Id. at p. 3.) It is unclear if “Fabian Carrillo Pools”
is a dba of Petitioner, and it is unclear if Petitioner is a named party to the
arbitration, but the Petition cannot be granted solely on behalf of “Fabian
Carrillo.”
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Petitioner Fabian Carrillo’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration
Award is DISMISSED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
