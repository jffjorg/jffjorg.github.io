ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff
Nathaniel Bendo (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the instant action for
fraud, negligence, and other claims against Defendants Laura Martz (erroneously
sued as Laura Marzt dba Emerald Isle Assisted Living”), and Paul Dizon
(“Defendants”) on December 17, 2021. On October 5, 2022, the Court sustained
Defendants’ demurrer to the Complaint with leave to amend. (Minute Order,
10/05/22.) Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on November 7, 2022.
Defendants answered the First Amended Complaint on July 31, 2023. On August 7,
2023, Defendant added Emerald Isle Assisted Living, Inc. as a doe defendant. 
 
On
September 3, 2024, Defendant Emerald Isle filed the instant Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s
Attendance at Deposition and Request for Monetary Sanctions. Plaintiff
filed an opposition on procedural grounds on October 21, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Motion and Notice of Hearing
 
Plaintiff’s opposition contends that service of the Motion
did not comply with the statutory requirement to provide 16 court days, plus
five regular days’ notice prior to the hearing. (Citing Code Civ. Proc.,
§1005.) Defendant Emerald Isle filed proof of service of the Motion and Notice
of Hearing on October 16, 2024. The proof of service states that the Motion and
Notice of Hearing were served on Plaintiff’s counsel on October 1, 2024. (Proof
of Service, filed 10/16/24, ¶¶4-6.) Plaintiff incorrectly argues that the
Motion papers were not served until October 8, 2024, which appears to be based
on the date the proof of service was signed. (Id. at p. 2.) Nor does the
state any of these facts in an affidavit under penalty of perjury. (Opp., pp.
1-2.) 
 
16 court days, plus five regular days prior to the October
30, 2024 hearing required service to be effectuated by October 3, 2024. Therefore,
service of the Motion and Notice of Hearing complied with the statutory
requirements and the Court will consider the merits. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, section (a) states
in relevant part: 
 
If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must
also “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice” and “be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (b)(1), (2).) 
 
Motion to Compel Deposition
 
In order to set a mutually agreeable deposition date,
defense counsel called Plaintiff’s counsel at the number listed on the
Substitution of Attorney filed with this Court on November 7, 2022, and at the
number listed on the State Bar website, on May 12, 21, 22, 23 (x3), 28, 29, 30,
31, and June 11, 2024. (Motion, Martz Decl., ¶5.) Plaintiff’s attorney did not
answer or return any of the messages left after each call. (Ibid.)
Defense counsel served Plaintiff with a Notice of Deposition on June 11, 2024,
setting the deposition for June 27, 2024. (Id. at ¶5 and Exh. A.)
Defense counsel called Plaintiff’s counsel on June 17, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, and
27 (x4), 2024, to confirm the deposition would go forward. (Id. at ¶6.)
It was not until June 27, 2024 that Plaintiff’s counsel informed defense
counsel that Plaintiff would not appear. (Ibid.) Plaintiff’s counsel was
advised that a certificate of non-appearance would be prepared. (Id. at
¶8.) On June 28, July 2, 3, 5 and 8(x2), 2024, defense counsel called Plaintiff’s
counsel to again arrange a deposition date before the August 19, 2024, trial. (Id.
at ¶7.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not answer, call, or respond to the phone
messages. (Ibid.) 
 
Based on this history and the lack of any substantive opposition,
Defendant Emerald Isle has demonstrated that the meet and confer requirement is
satisfied and that there was no good cause for Plaintiff’s failure to
communicate regarding, or appear at, their deposition. Due to Plaintiff’s
failure to cooperate in the taking of their deposition, Defendant Emerald Isle
is entitled to an order compelling their appearance and awarding sanctions.
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) Defendant Emerald Isle is
awarded $2,485.00 in sanctions as follows: four hours of attorney time billed
at $400.00 per hour; $60.00 in filing fees; and $825.00 for Plaintiff’s
non-appearance. (Motion, Martz Decl., ¶¶8-10.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Emerald Isle Assisted Living, Inc.’s Motion to
Compel Plaintiff’s Attendance at Deposition and Request for Monetary Sanctions
is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF NATHANIEL BENDO IS ORDERED TO APPEAR FOR DEPOSITION AT A DATE AND
TIME DETERMINED BY DEFENSE COUNSEL, WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER. PLAINTIFF AND
COUNSEL OF RECORD ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF
$2,485.00 TO MOVING DEFENDANT’S COUNSEL, ALSO WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
