ANALYSIS:
 

On February 7,
2024, Plaintiff Farm Bureau Insurance (“Plaintiff”) filed this subrogation
action against Defendant Calistro Rosalez, III (“Defendant”). On July 25, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Action. On August 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a copy of the parties’
settlement agreement with a request for dismissal and retention of jurisdiction
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The Court dismissed the action
pursuant to the stipulation on the same date. (Order for Dismissal, 08/07/24.) 
 
On August 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment. To
date, no opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) The settlement agreement complies
with the statutory requirements set forth above because it was signed by both
parties and their attorneys. (Motion, Smith Decl., Exh. 1, p. 5.)
 
Furthermore,
the request for retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the
parties, before the action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of
jurisdiction to conform to the statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If, after a suit has been dismissed, a party
brings a section 664.6 motion for a judgment on a settlement agreement but
cannot present to the court a request for retention of jurisdiction that meets
all of these requirements, then enforcement of the agreement must be left to a
separate lawsuit.”].) The parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction
complies with these requirements because it was made in writing to the Court
before the action was dismissed. (Motion, Smith Decl., Exh. 1, ¶7.) 
 
The settlement provides that
Defendant would pay Plaintiff $4,991.22, plus filing fees in the sum of $450.00
plus service fees in the sum $198.00, plus mandatory E-filing fees in the sum
of $50.10 for the total sum of $5,689.32. (Id. at Exh. 1, ¶3.) Defendant
was to make monthly payments starting on July 25, 2024. (Ibid.) The settlement
agreement also provides that in the event of Defendant’s default, Plaintiff may
seek judgment in the amount of $4,991.22, plus court costs including all first
appearance fees, and interest, less payments received. (Id. at ¶7.) No payments
have been made to date. (Id. at ¶7.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is
entitled to entry of judgment against Defendant in the amount of $4,991.22,
plus costs of $739.36, and interest at 10 percent per annum in the amount of
$59.84, for a total judgment amount of $5,790.42. (Id. at ¶8.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Farm Bureau Insurance’s
Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED. JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED IN
PLAINTIFF’S FAVOR AND AGAINST DEFENDANT CALISTRO ROSALEZ, III IN THE AMOUNT OF $4,991.22,
PLUS COSTS OF $739.36, ANS INTEREST AT 10 PERCENT PER ANNUM IN THE AMOUNT OF
$59.84.
