The Judge has tentatively ruled that the Demurrer filed by Defendant America Chung Nam, LLC is OVERRULED. The Defendant must file and serve an answer to the Complaint within 20 days of this order. The Judge found that the Demurrer was based on a mischaracterization of the Complaint and failed to demonstrate that the allegations in the Complaint were insufficient or uncertain. The Judge also noted that the attached exhibits to the Complaint did not contradict the allegations in the Complaint. The Judge concluded that the Defendant's argument that the Complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action was without merit.
