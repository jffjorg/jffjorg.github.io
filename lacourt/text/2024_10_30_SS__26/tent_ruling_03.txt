Knowledgeable and Compliance with Demand for Production of Documents, on September

Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, section (a) states
in relevant part: 
 
If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must
also “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice” and “be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (b)(1), (2).) 
 
Following a meet and confer between the parties’ attorneys,
Plaintiff served Defendant Reunion with Notice of Deposition of Reunion Apparel
Inc.’s Person Most Knowledgeable, for July 1, 2024. (Motion, Tabibi Decl., ¶2
and Exh. 1.) Defendant Reunion did not serve a written objection to the Notice
of Deposition. (Id. at ¶3.) Plaintiff’s counsel repeatedly contacted defense
counsel about the noticed deposition, but defense counsel did not communicate
until June 28, 2024. (Id. at ¶4.) At that time, defense counsel stated
that they had lost contact with their client and that neither Defendant Reunion
nor counsel would appear for the deposition. (Ibid.) Further
communication between the attorneys did not result in any agreement regarding
how to proceed with the deposition. (Id. at ¶¶5-7 and Exh. 2.) 
 
Based on this non-cooperation by Defendant Reunion regarding
its deposition, the Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated an adequate
meet and confer effort and grounds for an order compelling its appearance. The
Motion also articulates good cause for a production order with respect to the
document demands, which pertain to the subject transactions upon which
Plaintiff’s claims are based, an investigation of alter ego liability among the
multiple Defendants, and facts and documents supporting the affirmative
defenses in Defendants’ Answer. As Plaintiff points out, these topics are within
the broad permissible scope of discovery. (Citing Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.)

 
Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling
Defendant Reunion’s PMK to appear for deposition and for production of the
documents sought in the deposition notice. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Hermozo Textile, LLC’s Motion to Compel Deposition of Person Most Knowledgeable and Compliance
with Demand for Production of Documents is GRANTED. DEFENDANT REUNION
APPAREL, INC.’S PERSON MOST KNOWLEDGABLE IS ORDERED TO APPEAR AT DEPOSITION AND
PRODUCE DOCUMENTS RESPONSIVE TO THE DEPOSITION NOTICE WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS
ORDER, AT A DATE AND TIME DETERMINED AND NOTICED BY PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL.
