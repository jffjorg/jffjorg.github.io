And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff, Farm Bureau Insurance, is entitled to enforce a settlement agreement against the defendant, Calistro Rosalez, III. The settlement agreement was signed by both parties and their attorneys, and it provides that the defendant would pay the plaintiff $4,991.22, plus filing fees, service fees, and e-filing fees. The defendant failed to make any payments, and the plaintiff is therefore entitled to entry of judgment against the defendant in the amount of $4,991.22, plus costs of $739.36, and interest at 10 percent per annum in the amount of $59.84. The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement and orders entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant.
