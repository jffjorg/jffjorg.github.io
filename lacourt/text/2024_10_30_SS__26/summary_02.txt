And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to compel deposition and request for monetary sanctions filed by Defendant Emerald Isle Assisted Living, Inc. The motion was filed because the plaintiff, Nathaniel Bendo, failed to appear for his deposition and failed to cooperate with the deposition process. The judge finds that the defendant has demonstrated good cause for the production of documents and electronically stored information and that the plaintiff's failure to appear for the deposition was intentional. The judge orders the plaintiff to appear for deposition at a date and time to be determined by the defense counsel within 20 days of the order, and orders the plaintiff and his counsel to pay sanctions of $2,485.00 to the moving defendant's counsel within 20 days of the order.
