And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to dismiss the petition filed by Fabian Carrillo to confirm an arbitration award against Laura Becerra. The petition was filed on March 17, 2024, but it failed to provide proof of service of the petition and notice of hearing, as required by law. The arbitration award was served on the parties by certified mail on February 7, 2023, but the petition did not demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4. The judge also noted that it is unclear if "Fabian Carrillo Pools" is a dba of Petitioner and if Petitioner is a named party to the arbitration. Therefore, the petition is dismissed.
