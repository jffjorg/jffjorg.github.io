And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's person most knowledgeable and compliance with the demand for production of documents. The defendant, Reunion Apparel, Inc., is ordered to appear at a deposition and produce documents responsive to the deposition notice within 20 days of the order. The judge finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated an adequate meet and confer effort and grounds for an order compelling the defendant's appearance. The motion also articulates good cause for a production order with respect to the document demands, which pertain to the subject transactions upon which the plaintiff's claims are based, an investigation of alter ego liability among the multiple defendants, and facts and documents supporting the affirmative defenses in the defendants' answer.
