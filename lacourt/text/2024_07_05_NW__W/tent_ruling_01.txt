BACKGROUND
 
On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. filed a complaint against Defendant Raul Perez for breach of
contract and common counts. Plaintiff alleges defaulted on a credit card
agreement.
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests for
Admissions Admitted is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. moves
the court for an order deeming Plaintiff’s Request for Admissions, Set One
admitted against Defendant Raul Perez. Plaintiff makes the motion on the
grounds Defendant has failed to serve any response to Plaintiff.
 
Where there has been no timely response to a request for admission
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move
for an order that the truth of any matters specified in the requests and the
genuineness of any documents be deemed admitted, as well as a monetary
sanction. (CCP §2033.280(b).) The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially
compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (CCP §2033.280(a)(1)-(2).) The
court shall grant the motion “unless it finds that the party to whom the
requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the
motion, a proposed response … in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”
(CCP §2033.280(c); St. Mary v. Sup. Ct. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762,
777-78.)
 
On February 16, 2024, Plaintiff
propounded on Defendant Raul Perez their Request for Admissions, Set One.
(Ahearn Decl. ¶2, Exh. A.) Defendant’s responses were due 35 days later.
(Ahearn Decl. ¶3.) However, to date, Plaintiff has not received any responses
from Defendant. (Ahearn Decl. ¶3.)
 
The court finds Defendant Perez has
failed to timely respond to Plaintiff’s properly served discovery request. The
court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions
Admitted. Plaintiff waived their request for sanctions.
