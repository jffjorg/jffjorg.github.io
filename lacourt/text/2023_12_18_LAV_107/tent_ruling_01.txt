Timeline
 
            Plaintiff filed their complaint on
March 22, 2023, alleging the following causes of action against Defendant:
1.      Breach of Contract;
2.      Promissory Fraud;
3.      Accounting;
4.      Unjust Enrichment; and
5.      Elder Abuse.
 
This
action arises out of a construction contract entered into between Plaintiff and
Defendant on January 2, 2020 pertaining to a remodel of Plaintiff’s condominium
(the “Residence”) (the “Agreement”). Plaintiff alleged Defendant breached the
agreement and seeks to recover compensatory damages, punitive damages, enhanced
damages for elder abuse, interest, attorneys’ fees and costs of suit, as well
as accounting, the creation of a trust over property held by Defendant, and an
equitable lien over proceeds from Plaintiff’s property. 
 
            On August 11, 2023, Defendant filed
a demurrer as to the second, third, fourth and fifth causes of action for
failure to state sufficient facts to constitute those causes of action.
Defendant also moved to strike punitive damages from Plaintiff’s prayer. 
 
            Plaintiff opposed the demurrer and
motion to strike in papers filed on November 27, 2023. Defendant replied on
December 4, 2023.

Legal Standard
 
A demurrer
tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law. Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358. The court gives the complaint
a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded. Ibid. A demurrer accepts as true all well
pleaded facts and those facts of which the court can take judicial notice but
not deductions, contentions, or conclusions of law or fact. Fox v. JAMDAT
Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078. Doubt in the complaint may
be resolved against the plaintiff and facts not alleged are presumed not to
exist. Kramer v. Intuit Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 574, 578. “As a
general rule in testing a pleading against a demurrer, the Facts alleged in the
pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” Del E. Webb
Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d 593, 604.
 
Further,
the court may, upon motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading. The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn
or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order
of the court. The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has
irrelevant, false, or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in
conformity with laws. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) The grounds for moving to
strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437.) “A motion to strike does not lie to attack a
complaint for insufficiency of allegations to justify relief; that is a ground
for general demurrer.” Pierson v. Sharp Memorial Hospital, Inc. (1989)
216 Cal.App.3d 340, 342; see also Warren v. Atchison, T.
& S. F. Ry. Co. (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 24, 41 (the grounds that the
allegations were insufficient as a matter of law to constitute the cause of
action were grounds for demurrer and were not proper grounds for a motion to
strike). “[A] motion to strike is generally used to reach defects in a pleading
which are not subject to demurrer.” Pierson 216 Cal.App.3d at
342.
 
Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. See, e.g., Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th
761, 768 (“When the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of
cure, the court should allow leave to amend.”). The burden is on the
complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.
 
Analysis
 
i.                   
Promissory
Fraud
 
“The
elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” Beckwith v.
Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1059-1060. The falsity of the promise is
sufficiently pled “with a general allegation the promise was made without an
intention of performance. . . . Hence, the only necessary averment is the
general statement that the promise was made without the intention to perform
it, or that the defendant did not intend to perform it.” Id, 1060
(emphasis added).
 
Here,
Plaintiff sufficiently pled that Defendant made a false representation that he
would complete performance under the Agreement if Plaintiff provided an
additional progress payment; Plaintiff relied on that promise and provided an
additional progress payment; Defendant did not intend to complete performance
when he asked for such payment; and Plaintiff was harmed as a result of his
reliance on the false representation. (Complaint ¶ 44-53.)
 
In
opposition and in reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cause of action for
fraud simply repeats his first cause of action for breach of contract. Breach
of contract and fraud are separate and distinct causes of action, and Plaintiff
has alleged sufficient facts to establish both. 
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer as to Plaintiff’s second cause of action for promissory
fraud is overruled. 
 
ii.                 
Accounting
 
An
accounting is an equitable proceeding which is proper where there is an
unascertained amount owing that cannot be determined without an examination of
the books to determine what is due and owing. An action for an accounting has
two elements: (1) “that a relationship exists between the plaintiff and
defendant that requires an accounting” and (2) “that some balance is due the
plaintiff that can only be ascertained by an accounting.” Teselle, v.
McLoughlin (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 156, 179. Defendant argues that Plaintiff
has failed to allege the existence of such a relationship between the parties.
Plaintiff does not argue this point. (Opposition 2:27-3:8.)
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer as to Plaintiff’s third cause of action for accounting is
sustained without leave to amend. 
 
iii.               
Unjust
Enrichment
 
Defendant
argues that unjust enrichment is not a cause of action but an “effect” or a
“general principle” synonymous with restitution (Demurrer 8:14-22, citing Lauriedale
Associates, Ltd. v. Wilson (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448; Dinosaur
Development, Inc. v. White (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1310, 1315; and Melchior
v. New Line Productions, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793. Defendant
concludes that “restitution is a remedy and not a freestanding cause of
action.” Reid v. City of San Diego (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 343, 362.
Plaintiff does not argue this point and asks that the Court construe this cause
of action as a remedy request instead. (Opposition 3:13-20.)
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer as to Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action for unjust
enrichment is sustained with leave to amend for the limited purpose of adding
unjust enrichment and/or restitution to Plaintiff’s prayer. 
 
iv.               
Elder
Abuse
 
A party
engages in financial elder abuse by “misappropriating funds to which an elder
is entitled under a contract.” Paslay v. State Farm Gen. Ins. Co.,
(2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 639, 656. Defendant demurs to this cause of action on
substantially the same grounds as his demurrer to Plaintiff’s second cause of
action for fraud. Defendant seeks to reduce Plaintiff’s pleadings to one cause
of action for breach of contract. Defendant denies that Plaintiff made
pleadings sufficient to establish fraud. As stated above, this court disagrees
because “a general statement that [a] promise was made without the intention to
perform it” is sufficient to establish a pleading of scienter. Beckwith v.
Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1060.
 
Defendant
also makes the argument that the additional payment Plaintiff alleges to have
made in reliance of Defendant’s false representation was an amount that
Plaintiff had already agreed to pay pursuant to the Agreement. However,
Plaintiff alleged that when he made the payment, the amount was
“as-yet-unearned” (Complaint ¶ 21) and fell outside of the agreed upon payment
plan (Exh. A, 2.)
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to the fifth cause of action for elder abuse is overruled.

 
v.                 
Defendant’s
Motion to Strike Punitive Damages
 
                        Defendant seeks to
strike punitive damages from the pleadings on the grounds that Plaintiff did
not state a prima facie claim of fraud. In light of the evidence and pleadings,
the Court deems that Plaintiff sufficiently pleaded the causes of action for promissory
estoppel and elder abuse. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to strike punitive
damages from the pleadings is denied.

Tentative Ruling
            
Defendant’s
demurrer to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action is SUSTAINED with 10 days’
leave to amend. Defendant’s demurrer to the second and fifth causes of action
is OVERRULED. Defendant’s motion to strike punitive damages is DENIED.
