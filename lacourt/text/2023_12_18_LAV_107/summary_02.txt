And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Eric Harmon regarding a motion to strike by GTO Security Corp, one of the defendants in the case. The case arises out of an alleged altercation between the plaintiffs and Raymundo Reducindo Oliva, a security guard for Park Reseda and an employee of GTO. The plaintiffs allege that Reducindo was inebriated on the job and attacked them, resulting in medical expenses. The defendants, including GTO, have filed a motion to strike sections of the complaint pertaining to punitive damages and GTO's alleged ratification of Reducindo's conduct. The plaintiffs have filed opposition to the motion, arguing that punitive damages are available for loss of consortium and that GTO ratified Reducindo's conduct. The court has granted the motion to strike, but has also granted leave to amend the complaint.
