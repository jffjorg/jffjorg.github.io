Significant Statements:
  "The elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage." (Beckwith v. Dahl)
  "A motion to strike does not lie to attack a complaint for insufficiency of allegations to justify relief; that is a ground for general demurrer." (Pierson v. Sharp Memorial Hospital, Inc.)
  "An accounting is an equitable proceeding which is proper where there is an unascertained amount owing that cannot be determined without an examination of the books to determine what is due and owing." (Teselle v. McLoughlin)
  "A party engages in financial elder abuse by ‘misappropriating funds to which an elder is entitled under a contract.’" (Paslay v. State Farm Gen. Ins. Co.)

Summary:
The Judge issues a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike punitive damages. The Judge sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action (accounting) without leave to amend, sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action (unjust enrichment) with 10 days' leave to amend, and overrules the demurrer to the second and fifth causes of action (promissory fraud and elder abuse). The Judge denies the motion to strike punitive damages.
