And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion of Air Center Aviation, Inc. (ACAI) to intervene in the lawsuit between Bonseph Helinet LLC and the City of Los Angeles. ACAI is the current tenant of the Site at Van Nuys Airport and has been the tenant for over 50 years. Despite having a month-to-month lease, ACAI is concerned that if the petition is granted, it will be expelled from the Site. The court finds that ACAI has an interest in opposing the petition and has a mandatory right to intervene in the proceeding. The court also finds that the respondents, the City of Los Angeles, may not adequately represent ACAI's interests and that ACAI may raise arguments that the City is reluctant to make, such as the City's alleged non-compliance with the City Administrative Code during the Request for Proposal process.
