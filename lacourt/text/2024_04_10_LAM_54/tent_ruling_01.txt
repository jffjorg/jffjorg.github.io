BACKGROUND
 
On September 6, 2022, Plaintiff Iconic Hearts
Holdings, Inc. filed the operative first amended complaint against Defendants
Raj Vir and NGL Labs LLC, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of
contract; and (2) misappropriation of trade secrets. Plaintiff
alleges its founder Hunter Rice and Defendant Raj Vir were longtime friends.
Plaintiff alleges that while Vir worked as a consultant and developer for
Plaintiff’s app “sendit”, he breached a confidentiality agreement and
misappropriated Plaintiff’s trade secrets to create a competing app called
“NGL.”
EVIDENCE
OBJECTIONS
“In granting or denying a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication, the court need rule only on those objections
to evidence that it deems material to its disposition of the motion.” (CCP §
437c(q).) Plaintiff’s objections to the Vir Declaration and Schuman Declaration
are OVERRULED. Defendants’ objections to the Rice Declaration are OVERRULED.
ANALYSIS
“The purpose of the law of summary
judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties'
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Trial judges are required “to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) Once the defendant has met that
burden, “the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one
or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.”
(Id.)  To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial
responsive evidence.” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384,
389.)
 
A. First Cause of Action for Breach of Contract
“The standard elements of a claim for breach
of contract are: ‘(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff
therefrom.’” (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.) 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Vir entered
into a “Master Development Agreement” with Plaintiff on September 1, 2018. The
MDA contains a confidentiality provision, which states, “[d]uring and after the
term of this Agreement, Developer will hold in the strictest confidence, and
take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure
of Confidential Information, and Developer will not (i) use the Confidential
Information for any purpose whatsoever other than as necessary for the
performance of the Services on behalf of Company, or (ii) disclose the
Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent
of an authorized representative of Company.” (FAC Exh. A. § 6.2.) Plaintiff
alleges Vir violated this provision, using Plaintiff’s confidential information
to create a competing app. 
Defendants assert that the first cause of
action fails because Plaintiff was not an incorporated entity at the time the
agreement was executed, the MDA expired in 2018, and Defendants did not breach
the agreement by using confidential information. In support, Defendants present
evidence showing the MDA was executed in connection with one small work order
for 10 hours of work from Defendant Vir for Plaintiff. Defendants argue the MDA
expired at completion of Vir’s work order. Defendants also state that Vir did
not use any purported confidential information while the MDA was in force.
In opposition, Plaintiff disputes that the
agreement expired at the completion of the contracted work. Plaintiff points to
the language of the agreement, which contains no expiration date and states
that it applies during and after the term of the agreement. Plaintiff
represents that the parties did not intend to terminate the confidentiality
clause upon completion of the contracted work. Plaintiff also presents evidence
purporting to show that Vir misused Plaintiff’s trade secrets. And Plaintiff contends
that the agreement was made for its benefit, allowing Plaintiff to execute and
enforce the agreement before Plaintiff was an incorporated entity. (See 02 Dev., LLC v. 607 S. Park, LLC (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 609, 612.) This is sufficient to create a triable
issue of fact as to breach of contract. 
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is
DENIED. Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication of the first cause of
action is DENIED.
B. Second Cause of Action for Misappropriation of Trade
Secrets
Defendants assert the second cause of action
fails because Plaintiff did not take reasonable steps to protect its
confidential information. (See Hooked Media Grp., Inc. v. Apple Inc.
(2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 323, 333.) Defendants present evidence showing that Plaintiff
and Vir had public conversations about the purported trade secrets, Plaintiff
provided a consultant, David Tesler, unfettered access to the trade secrets,
and Plaintiff posted trade secret information on social media. Defendants Joao Figueiredo
and Hunter Isaacson represent that they did not know the MDA existed or that
Vir had any confidentiality obligations.
Plaintiff argues that it took reasonable
steps to protect its trade secrets by requiring officers, management, and critical contractors to sign confidentiality
agreements, by only sharing confidential information with those who had signed
an agreement, and by limiting access to digital files with two-factor authentication.
Plaintiff presents evidence showing Figueiredo and Isaacson knew that Vir was
obtaining “inside information” from Rice about Plaintiff and encouraged this
conduct—Vir had relayed information he learned from Rice under false pretense
to Figueiredo and Isaacson, including information about how Iconic Hearts got
sendit content on Instagram, and which of Iconic Hearts’ prompts were top
performing so Defendants could re-create those prompts for the NGL App. This is
sufficient to create triable issues of fact.
Defendants’
motion for summary adjudication of the second cause of action is DENIED.

BACKGROUND
 
On September 6, 2022, Plaintiff Iconic Hearts
Holdings, Inc. filed the operative first amended complaint against Defendants
Raj Vir and NGL Labs LLC, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of
contract; and (2) misappropriation of trade secrets. Plaintiff
alleges its founder Hunter Rice and Defendant Raj Vir were longtime friends.
Plaintiff alleges that while Vir worked as a consultant and developer for
Plaintiff’s app “sendit”, he breached a confidentiality agreement and
misappropriated Plaintiff’s trade secrets to create a competing app called
“NGL.”
ANALYSIS
Code of Civil Procedure § 128.7(b)
provides that by signing and filing a pleading, an attorney “is certifying that
to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an
inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, all of the following conditions are
met: (1) [i]t is not being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as
to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of
litigation[;] (2) [t]he claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein
are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the
extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of
new law[;] (3) [t]he allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary
support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary
support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or
discovery[;] (4) [t]he denials of factual contentions are warranted on the
evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of
information or belief.” CCP § 128.7 authorizes the court to impose
appropriate sanctions upon attorneys or parties that have violated subsection
(b). (CCP § 128.7(c).)
 
Defendants move for sanctions against
Plaintiff on the ground that Plaintiff added Defendants Joao Figueiredo and
Hunter Issacson to delay trial. Defendant assert Plaintiff has no evidence that
Figueiredo and Issacson knew Vir was possibly misappropriating Plaintiff’s
trade secrets. 
 
Plaintiff alleges that Figueiredo and
Issacson, who developed Defendants’ competing app, knew Vir acquired and was
using Plaintiff’s trade secrets. Plaintiff presents evidence showing that Figueiredo
and Issacson knew Vir had worked on Plaintiff’s app and that Defendants’ app
was a copy of Plaintiff’s app. Defendants have not shown that Plaintiff
violated CCP § 128.7. 
 
Defendants’ motion for sanctions is
DENIED.

Motion to Seal

T/R:      PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO SEAL IS GRANTED.
 
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.

BACKGROUND
 
On September 6, 2022, Plaintiff Iconic Hearts
Holdings, Inc. filed the operative first amended complaint against Defendants
Raj Vir and NGL Labs LLC, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of
contract; and (2) misappropriation of trade secrets. Plaintiff alleges its
founder Hunter Rice and Defendant Raj Vir were longtime friends. Plaintiff
alleges that while Vir worked as a consultant and developer for Plaintiff’s app
“sendit”, he breached a confidentiality agreement and misappropriated Plaintiff’s
trade secrets to create a competing app called “NGL.”
 
ANALYSIS
“The court may order that a record be
filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There
exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the
record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A
substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced
if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and
(5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.”  (CRC Rule 2.550(d).)  “The motion or application must be
accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to
justify the sealing.”  (CRC Rule
2.551(b)(1).)  
 
Plaintiff moves to seal documents
Defendants filed with their motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff asserts
these documents, designated confidential or highly confidential under the
parties’ protective order, disclose confidential information regarding
Plaintiff’s trade secrets. 
 
In opposition, Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s
motion is untimely, and these documents already have become part of the public
record. The Court declines to deny this motion on these grounds. Plaintiff has
made a good faith effort to keep these documents sealed, and there is no
evidence the documents already are in the public record. Plaintiff’s interest
in the confidential documents overrides the public’s need for access. The
requirements of California Rules of Court 2.550(d) have been established.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
