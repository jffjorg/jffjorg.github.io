And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is a response to a dispute over the termination of employment of a plaintiff, Prell, by The Lobster, a restaurant. The arbitrator rejected the plaintiff's claims of retaliation, failure to accommodate, and failure to engage in an interactive process. The arbitrator found that the termination was for valid, non-discriminatory reasons, citing evidence of poor judgment and unreliability by the plaintiff. The ruling is based on California labor laws and court cases, including Guz v. Bechtel National, Inc. and Tomlinson v. Qualcomm, Inc. The Court is puzzled by the plaintiff's contention that the arbitrator ignored prehearing Order No. 4, and finds that the arbitrator did not violate or misapply the order in issuing the Award.
