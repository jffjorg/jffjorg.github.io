And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the defendants' motion to set aside or vacate the default entered against them. The defendants' attorney, Williams, mistakenly believed that submitting a motion for reconsideration would result in an extension of time to plead, which led to the default. The court clerk is entitled to rely on a document's title in determining whether it is one of the permitted responses listed, and in this case, the motion for reconsideration was not one of the permitted responses. The defendants must substantially comply with the requirement for section 473(b) relief by proffering a proposed answer before the motion can be granted. If the defendants comply, the court would grant the motion.
