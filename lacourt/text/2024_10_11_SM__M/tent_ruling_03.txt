Standard
 
Relief under section 473(b) is either discretionary
or mandatory. A motion for mandatory relief must be made no more than six
months after entry of judgment and be accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to the attorney’s “mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) The attorney affidavit of fault must contain a
“straight forward admission of fault.” (State Farm Fire & Casualty Co.
v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610.) But it need not contain an
explanation of the reasons for the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence surprise or
neglect. (Martin Potts &
Assocs., Inc. v. Corsair, LLC (2016)
244 Cal.App.4th 432, 438-441.)
Relief must be
granted “unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact
caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.) If mandatory relief is
granted, the court must “direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs” to the
opposing counsel or parties. (CCP § 473(b).)
 
Where a party cannot obtain an attorney affidavit of
fault, the party may seek discretionary relief under section 473(b) due to
“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) A
motion for discretionary relief must be made “within a reasonable time but in
no instance exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Id.) If discretionary relief is granted, the court may
in its discretion order the moving party to pay the costs, including attorney fees,
incurred in obtaining the default. (Rogalski v. Nabers Cadillac (1992)
11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823; Vanderkous v. Conley (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 111, 118-119.) If the motion for discretionary relief is granted,
the court may order the offending attorney to pay monetary sanctions up to
$1,000 to opposing parties, or up to $1,000 to the State Bar Client Security
Fund, or “[g]rant other relief as is appropriate.” (CCP § 473(c)(1)(A), (B),
(C).)
 
A motion for relief under section 473(b) “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted. . .” (CCP § 473(b).)
However, this requirement is
not jurisdictional; substantial compliance may suffice. (Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403
[finding substantial compliance where counsel offered proposed answer at
motion hearing rather than serving it with moving
papers].) 
 
Analysis
 

Defendants the William Law Group
and Andrew Williams moves to vacate or set aside the default entered against
them on June 24, 2024.  Williams explains
that after the Court denied the Motion to Quash, Defendants filed a Motion for
Reconsideration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 1008. (Williams
Decl. ¶¶ 21-25.) Defendants mistakenly believed that the submission of the
motion for reconsideration would result in an extension of time to plead.  In reality, CCP section 585(b) would not
preclude the clerk from entering default. This section provides in pertinent
part: “if the defendant has been served other than by publication, and no
answer, demurrer, notice of motion to strike ..., notice of motion to transfer
..., notice of motion to quash service of summons or to stay or dismiss the
action ... or notice of the filing of a petition for writ of mandate ... has
been filed ..., the clerk ... upon written application of the plaintiff, shall
enter the default of the defendant.” The court clerk is entitled to rely on a
document's title in determining whether it is one of the permitted
responses listed. (Wisdom v. Ramirez, (1985) 177 Cal. App.3d Supp. 1, 8,
disapproved of on other grounds by Janssen v. Luu, (1997) 57 Cal.
App. 4th 272.) A defendant cannot claim it has filed an answer (or other
responsive pleading) if the document filed is labelled otherwise because “entry
of default by the clerk is a ministerial duty and that he has no authority
whatever to determine the sufficiency, either as to the substance or form, of a
pleading on file.” (Id.) “[T]he clerk [is] not authorized to peruse the
document in question to determine whether or not it constituted an answer or
should be construed as one. Instead, the clerk was entitled to rely on the
document's label in making the determination whether an answer had been filed
by defendant.” (Id.; see Rios v. Singh (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 871,
884-885 [motion titled “reply” did not pause entry of default when it was not
titled “answer” or other permissible responsive pleading or motion, it did not
contain general or specific denials of the allegations of the complaint, and it
did not separately number defenses to the complaint].) Here, the motion for
reconsideration is not one of the responses identified by section 585. Thus,
the clerk properly entered default despite the submission of the motion for
reconsideration. 
 
That said, Defendants demonstrate that
their default resulted from Williams’s
“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect” regarding the effect of
the motion for reconsideration.  Defendants
do not supply any responsive pleading required for section 473(b) relief. Before
granting the motion, Defendants must substantially comply with this requirement
by proffering a proposed
answer. If Defendants comply, then
the Court would grant the motion.
 
Accordingly, the motion is tentatively GRANTED.
