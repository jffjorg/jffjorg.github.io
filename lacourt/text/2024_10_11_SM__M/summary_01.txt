And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff had originally filed a complaint alleging three causes of action, but subsequent to the filing of the complaint, the plaintiff's attorney substituted in and determined that additional causes of action should have been alleged. The proposed second amended complaint adds two new causes of action for breach of contract and money had and received, which arise from the same general facts as the original causes of action.

The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the delay in seeking leave to amend was unjustified and prejudicial. However, the judge found that the delay was not prejudicial to the defendant, as the new causes of action only expand on the legal theories and pertain to the same set of facts as the prior causes. Therefore, the court granted the motion to amend.
