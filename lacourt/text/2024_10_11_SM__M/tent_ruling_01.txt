MOTION:                  Motion
for Leave to Amend to File a Second Amended Complaint
HEARING DATE:   10/11/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party
wishes to amend a pleading after an answer has been filed, or after a demurrer
has been filed and after the hearing on the demurrer, or if he or she has
already amended the pleading as a matter of course, the party must obtain permission
from the court before amendment. (CCP §§ 473(a)(1), 576.) 
 
Motions
for leave to amend the pleadings are directed to the sound discretion of the
court. “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading . . ..” (CCP § 473(a)(1); see CCP §
576.) Policy favors liberally granting leave to amend so that all disputed
matters between the parties may be resolved. (See Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.) Absent prejudice to the adverse party, the court may permit amendments
to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial.”
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761 [internal quotes omitted].) Where leave is
sought to add entirely new claims, the court may grant leave to amend if the
new claims are based on the same general set of facts, and the amendment will
not prejudice the opposing party. (Austin
v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-602; Glaser v. Meyers (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 770, 777 [holding
trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting amendment of complaint,
which originally alleged constructive eviction, to allege retaliatory eviction
where the new claim was based on the same general set of facts].)
 
Although
denial is rarely justified, a judge has discretion to deny leave to amend if
the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced
the opposing party. (Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490). An opposing party is prejudiced where the
amendment would necessitate a trial delay along with a loss of critical
evidence, added preparation expense, increased burden of discovery, etc. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488 [leave properly
denied where plaintiff sought leave on the eve of trial, nearly two years after
the complaint was originally filed and gave no explanation for the delay which
prejudiced defendant who did not discover or depose many of the witnesses who would
support the new allegations and had not marshaled evidence in opposition of the
new allegations].)
 
Procedurally,
a motion for leave to amend must state with particularity what allegations are
to be amended. Namely, it must state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted and/or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).) The motion must be accompanied
by a declaration specifying: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(b).) The motion must also be
accompanied by the proposed amended pleading, numbered to differentiate it from
the prior pleadings or amendments. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(1).) It is within the
court’s discretion to require compliance with Rule 3.1324 before granting leave
to amend. (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.)
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff Gwenique Williams
(“Williams”) moves for leave to file a proposed Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”).

 
The current First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”) alleges three causes of action for conversion, breach of good fair and
fair dealing, and declaratory relief. Plaintiff’s proposed SAC states four
causes of action for breach of oral contract, breach of duty of good faith and
fair dealing, common counts for money had and received, and conversion. Thus,
the SAC seeks to replace the declaratory relief cause of action with two new
causes of action for breach of contract and money had. Notably, liability is
set on the same general facts as alleged in the initial complaints. Williams’s
breach of oral contract and common count for money had and received arise from
the subject vessel transaction. Plaintiff explains that this amendment is
necessary and not filed sooner because when this action was filed, her current
attorney was not the attorney of record. (Sullivan Decl., ¶ 4.) When new
counsel substituted into the action, he reviewed the facts and law and
determined that additional causes of action should have been alleged. (¶¶5-7.) When
the court sustained the demurrer with leave on June 11, 2024, counsel first
requested to add new causes of action. (¶ 9.) Following the sustained demurrer,
Williams filed an amended complaint on July 8, 2024. (¶ 11.) Current counsel
then drafted the SAC. (¶ 12.) 
 
Defendant observes that these
theories should have been readily apparent when this action was filed on March
14, 2022. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff delayed over a year seeking leave to
amend. Counsel first substituted in November 2023, yet failed to make the
amendments
prior to the demurrer hearing and waited almost a year to
propose the requested amendments.
(Crump Decl. ¶¶ 5–10.) Defendant posits that such a delay is
unwarranted, unjustified, and
unreasonable. Defendant, however, does not explain any
prejudice stemming from this delay. There would likely be very little prejudice
to Defendant, since the amendments only expand on the legal theories and
pertain to the same set of facts as the prior causes. Thus, to the extent that
Plaintiff delayed in bringing the breach of contract and common counts, there
is no observable prejudice to Defendant. Since
Plaintiff’s delay was not prejudicial, the court must grant leave to amend.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
