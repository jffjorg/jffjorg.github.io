And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for a protective order to prevent the disclosure of certain confidential information. The defendant, Chance Berman, had requested the protective order to cover corporate policies, internal incident reports, and other confidential business records in his possession and belonging to his employer, Polar Ice Enterprises California, LLC (Doe 3). The judge found that the defendant had shown good cause for the protective order and that the proposed LA Model Protective Order, which defines "confidential" information and provides a procedure to challenge designations, is sufficient to protect the defendant's confidential information without unduly burdening the plaintiff. The judge notes that the parties have met and conferred, and the defendant has agreed to produce the surveillance video once a protective/confidentiality order is in place. The motion is granted, and the court enters a protective order - confidential designation based on the Los Angeles Model.
