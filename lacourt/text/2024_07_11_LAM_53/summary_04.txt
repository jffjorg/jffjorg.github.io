And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the allegations made by the plaintiff and has considered the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant. The plaintiff has brought this action against the defendant for legal malpractice, alleging that the defendant was their former client. The court notes that the plaintiff has also alleged that they are bringing this action as an assignee of the claims from Maroon Society Inc. However, the court finds that because the plaintiff's claim for legal malpractice may support the entire cause of action, even if the assigned claim may not be viable. The court cites Spencer v. City of Palos Verdes Estates (2023) 88 Cal.App.5th 849, 861, which states that a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the functional equivalent of a general demurrer, and general demurrers do not lie as to portions of a cause of action. Therefore, the court is tentatively ruling that the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.
