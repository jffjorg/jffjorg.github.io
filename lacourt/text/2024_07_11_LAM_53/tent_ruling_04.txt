The first 15 pages of the memorandum, excluding the caption page, notice of
motion and motion, and the tables of contents and authorities, are numbered as
pages 7 through 21.  (Cal. Rules of Ct.,
rule 3.1113, subd. (d).) 


[2] The
court notes that Plaintiff has further alleged that he has brought this action
both in his individual capacity “and as an assignee of the claims
alleged in this matter from the assignor, Maroon Society Inc. . . .”  (FAC ¶ 2 [emphasis added].)  However, as set forth above, Plaintiff has
also alleged that he was Defendant’s client. 
Thus, because a motion for judgment on the pleadings does not lie to a
portion of a cause of action, the court finds that Plaintiff’s claim for legal
malpractice—brought by him as Defendant’s former client—may support the entire
cause of action, even if Plaintiff’s assigned claim for legal malpractice may
not be viable.  (Spencer v. City of
Palos Verdes Estates (2023) 88 Cal.App.5th 849, 861 [a motion for judgment
on the pleadings is the functional equivalent of a general demurrer, and
general demurrers do not lie as to portions of a cause of action].)
