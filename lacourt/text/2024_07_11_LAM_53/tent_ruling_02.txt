MOVING PARTIES:              Plaintiffs Antonio Capulong and
Robert Capulong               
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Porsche Cars North America, Inc.
Motion to Compel Compliance with Court’s October 24, 2023 Order
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs Antonio Capulong and Robert Capulong (“Plaintiffs”) move
the court for an order compelling defendant Porsche Cars North America, Inc.
(“Defendant”) to comply with the court’s October 24, 2023 order compelling
Defendant, within 20 days of the date of that order, (1) to serve on Plaintiffs
further written responses to certain of Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production of
Documents, and (2) to produce to Plaintiffs all documents and things in
Defendant’s possession, custody, or control which are responsive to those
requests.  (Oct. 24, 2023 Order, pp. 2:18-3:2.)  The court further ordered counsel for
Plaintiffs and Defendant to meet and confer no later than October 27, 2023 to
agree on the defects alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  (Id. at p. 3:11-15.) 
Plaintiffs have presented evidence establishing that (1) after meeting
and conferring telephonically, Plaintiffs’ counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel
with a proposed list of defects as to Plaintiffs’ document demands; (2) in
response to that email, Defendant’s counsel informed Plaintiffs’ counsel that “the
search terms need to be aimed at the defects which allegedly were not repaired
after a reasonable number of repair attempts” and requested that counsel
“narrow the terms and/or the list of defects” sought; and (3) Defendant has not
produced responsive documents as ordered by the court in its October 24, 2023
order.  (Kohanoff Decl., Exs. 4, pp. 1-2
[November 7, 2023 email from Plaintiffs’ counsel], 5, p. 1 [November 20, 2023 email
from Defendant’s counsel]; Kohanoff Decl., ¶¶ 13-14.)  In its opposition, Defendant asserts that it
produced additional documents on May 6, 2024 and is “still working diligently
to obtain more responsive documents.” 
(Opp., p. 2:11-14; Liss Decl., ¶ 8.) 
Thus, Defendant does not appear to dispute that it did not fully comply
with the court’s order directing it to produce responsive documents to
Plaintiffs within 20 days of the date of the order.  Moreover, Defendant has not presented
argument or authority establishing that its request that Plaintiffs narrow
their list to “defects which allegedly were not repaired after a reasonable
number of repair attempts” complied with the court’s order to meet and confer
regarding “which defects are alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint.”  (Liss Decl., ¶ 7; Oct. 24, 2023 Order, p.
3:11-16.) 
To remedy the prejudice to Plaintiffs as a result of Defendant’s
failure to fully comply with the court’s order, the court will order Defendant
to serve further written responses to Plaintiffs’ document demands and to produce
responsive documents based on the list of defects provided by Plaintiffs’
counsel on November 7, 2023, except that Defendant will not be required to
serve responses and to produce documents regarding the chronometer and chassis
error defects.  (Kohanoff Reply Decl., ¶
6 [during the parties’ March 20, 2024 meet and confer conversation, “Plaintiffs
agreed to strike the requests regarding the chronometer o[r] the Chassis”].) 
The court denies Plaintiffs’ request, made in their reply papers, that
the court impose prospective sanctions of $500 per day against Defendant. 
ORDER
            The court grants in part plaintiffs
Antonio Capulong and Robert Capulong’s motion to compel compliance as follows. 
            The court orders defendant Porsche Cars
North America, Inc. (1) to serve on plaintiffs Antonio Capulong and Robert
Capulong further written responses to plaintiffs Antonio Capulong and Robert
Capulong’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two, (i) numbers 5-6,            (ii) numbers 7-11, 14, 16, 18-22,
25, 27, 29-33, 36, 38, 40-43, 46, and 48, but limited to Defendant’s producing
any internal analysis or investigation regarding the defects set forth in the
November 7, 2023 email from counsel for plaintiffs Antonio
Capulong and Robert Capulong in vehicles for the same year, make, and model of the subject
vehicle, except as to “Defects resulting in chronometer
inoperative” and “Defects resulting in ‘Chassis Error’ Indicator illuminating,” and (iii)
numbers 12-13, 15, 23-24, 26, 34-35, 37, 44-45, and 47, but limited to
Defendant’s producing any customer complaints relating to the defects set forth
in the November 7, 2023 email from counsel for plaintiffs Antonio
Capulong and Robert Capulong in vehicles purchased or leased in California for the same
year, make, and model of the subject vehicle, except as to
“Defects resulting in chronometer inoperative” and “Defects resulting in
‘Chassis Error’ Indicator illuminating,” and (2) to produce to plaintiffs
Antonio Capulong and Robert Capulong all documents and things in defendant
Porsche Cars North America, Inc.’s possession, custody, or control which are
responsive to those requests (and limited as set forth above), within 15 days
of the date of this order.  
            The court denies plaintiffs Antonio
Capulong and Robert Capulong’s request for monetary sanctions.
 
 
 
            The court orders plaintiffs Antonio
Capulong and Robert Capulong to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  July 11, 2024
