And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff claims that the defendant made a false representation that harmed the plaintiff. To prove this claim, the plaintiff must show that the defendant made a false representation, knew it was false, intended to deceive the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representation. The defendant's representation must have caused harm to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff's reliance on the representation must have been a substantial factor in causing that harm. The law states that a deceit is either the suggestion of something that is not true, the assertion of something that is not true, or the suppression of a fact. The judge will consider the evidence presented to determine whether the defendant intended to deceive the plaintiff and whether the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representation.
