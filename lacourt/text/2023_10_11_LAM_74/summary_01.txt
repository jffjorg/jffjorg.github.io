Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the Defendant's motion to strike certain portions of the first amended complaint (FAC) in the case of Mamdouh Habib, et al. v. A.L. Wilson Chemical Company, Inc., et al.

The Defendant is seeking to strike paragraphs and lines in the FAC that list "other products to be determined during discovery" and "other chemical products which will be identified during the course of discovery" as chemicals to which Decedent Mamdouh Habib was exposed. The Judge grants the motion, holding that the Plaintiffs must identify the specific products that allegedly caused Decedent's injury.

The Defendant is also seeking to strike paragraphs and lines in the FAC that allege that all Plaintiffs are entitled to punitive and exemplary damages. The Judge grants the motion, holding that punitive damages are not available in a statutory wrongful death action, but that Decedent's wife, Loris Attia, as the successor-in-interest, may claim punitive damages.

Finally, the Defendant is seeking to strike claims for pain, suffering, and disfigurement in the FAC. The Judge denies the motion, holding that the Plaintiffs may bring such claims because the case was filed after January 1, 2022, and before January 1, 2026, and that the exception in the relevant statute does not require the action to be commenced on or after January 1, 2022.

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion to strike certain portions of the FAC, but grants Plaintiffs leave to amend. The Judge denies the Defendant's motion to strike other portions of the FAC.
