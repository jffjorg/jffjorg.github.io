Significant Statements:

  - "To grant such an order, the court must expressly find that . . .

```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to seal documents that disclose the names of third-party employees and private information about the plaintiff. The court found that a legitimate interest supports sealing the documents, as the employees have a right to privacy in their confidential personnel information. Additionally, the court found that the sealing of the documents was narrowly tailored and that no less restrictive means existed to achieve the overriding interest. The court also granted the motion to seal documents that disclose private information about the plaintiff, including his address and earnings, as well as his medical records. The court found that the plaintiff's right to privacy in these matters outweighed any public interest in accessing the information.
