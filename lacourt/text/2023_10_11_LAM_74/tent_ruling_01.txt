  Case Number:  21STCV01740    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  74 Mamdouh Habib, et al. v. A.L. Wilson
Chemical Company, Inc., et al.
Defendant’s Motion to Strike
Portions of Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint
The court considered the moving
papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from a dispute over Decedent Mamdouh Habib’s (Decedent) exposure
to chemicals.
            On
January 14, 2021, Decedent and Loris Attia filed a complaint against Defendant The
Dow Chemical Company (Defendant) and others. In the complaint, Decedent and
Loris Attia alleged negligence, strict liability, fraudulent concealment,
breach of implied warranties, and loss of consortium.
            On
July 28, 2023, Plaintiffs Loris Attia, Jennifer Habib, Sara Habib, and
Stephanie Habib (Plaintiffs) filed a first amended complaint (FAC).
            On
August 29, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to strike portions of the FAC.
LEGAL STANDARD
            A court may strike any “¿irrelevant,
false or improper matter¿inserted in any pleading¿” or any part of a pleading
“¿not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule,
or an order of the court.¿” (¿Code Civ. Proc., § 436¿.) “¿The grounds for a
motion to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from
any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.¿” (¿Code
Civ. Proc., § 437¿.)¿            
DISCUSSION  
            In
its motion, Defendant first aims to strike page 5, line 5 and page 6, lines 21-22. Those portions of the FAC list
“other products to be determined during discovery” and “other chemical products
which will be identified during the course of […] discovery” as chemicals to
which Decedent was supposedly exposed. To allege causation in toxic injury
cases, a plaintiff must, in part, identify each product that caused the injury
at issue. (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71,
80 (Bockrath).) However, a plaintiff may allege this fact in a
conclusory fashion if its knowledge of the precise cause of injury is limited.
(Ibid.) This does not excuse Plaintiffs from the requirement of
identifying the products that allegedly caused Decedent’s injury, though. The
court in Bockrath expressly held that, “It is insufficient to allege
that the toxins in [a defendant’s] products caused [the injury].” (Ibid.)
Moreover, on June 3, 2021, this court held that another defendant in this case has
the right to be presented with a pleading that places it on proper notice of
all material allegations against it, which includes allegations of the specific
products being challenged. Accordingly, the court grants Defendant’s motion to
strike page 5, line 5 and page 6, lines 21-22 of the FAC without prejudice.
Plaintiffs may seek leave to amend the FAC to add allegations about other
products once Plaintiffs can identify them.
            Defendant
also seeks to strike the following portions of the FAC: page
38, line 4; page 42, line 6; page 46, line 19; and page 51, line 11. Each
portion alleges that all Plaintiffs are entitled to punitive and exemplary
damages. But punitive damages are not available in a
statutory wrongful death action. (Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2010)
48 Cal.4th 788, 796.) Consequently, Decedent’s children—Plaintiffs Sara Habib,
Jennifer Habib, and Stephanie Habib—cannot recover punitive damages. However,
Plaintiff Loris Attia is Decedent’s wife. As the successor-in-interest, she may
claim punitive damages. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.34.) Thus, the court grants
Defendant’s motion to strike the following portions of the FAC: page 38, line 4; page 42, line 6; page 46, line 19; and
page 51, line 11. The court also grants Plaintiffs leave to amend so the
allegations reflect that only Plaintiff Loris Attia is entitled to punitive
damages.
            Lastly,
Defendant seeks to strike Plaintiffs’ claims for the decedent’s pain,
suffering, and disfigurement. To that end, Defendant points to Code of Civil
Procedure section 377.34, subdivision (a): “In an action or proceeding by a
decedent's personal representative or successor in interest on the decedent's
cause of action, the damages recoverable […] do not include damages for pain,
suffering, or disfigurement.” In such an action or proceeding, though,
recoverable damages may include those for pain, suffering, and disfigurement if
that action or proceeding was filed on or after January 1, 2022, and before
January 1, 2026. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.34, subd. (b).) Here, the complaint
was filed before January 1, 2022. But this case did not become an action or
proceeding by a decedent’s personal representative or successor in interest on
the decedent’s cause of action until Plaintiffs filed the first amended
complaint with survival claims on July 28, 2023. Consequently, Plaintiffs filed
their survival action on a date that would permit damages for pain, suffering,
and disfigurement under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34, subdivision
(b). The court notes that the exception in the provision at issue does not
require the action to be commenced on or after January 1, 2022. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 377.34, subd. (b).) Rather, it merely requires that the action be
filed, as Plaintiffs did with their first amended complaint. Nor does the
relevant statute or other statutes within the same article restrict the meaning
of ‘filed’ to the initiation of an action. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 377.30, 377.31,
377.34, subd. (b).) Thus, the court denies Defendant’s motion to strike the
following portions of the FAC: paragraph 130; paragraph 149; paragraph 172;
paragraph 201; paragraph 224; page 50, lines 18-19 (and page 59, lines 18-19,
because the FAC does not have a 59th page).
CONCLUSION 
            Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Defendant’s motion to strike the following
portions of the FAC: page 5, line 5; page 6, lines 21-22; page 38, line 4; page
42, line 6; page 46, line 19; and page 51, line 11. But the court grants
Plaintiffs leave to amend. The court denies Defendant’s motion to strike the
following portions of the FAC: paragraph 130; paragraph 149; paragraph 172;
paragraph 201; paragraph 224; page 50, lines 18-19 (and page 59, lines 18-19,
because the FAC does not contain a 59th page).
            Defendant
is ordered to give notice.
