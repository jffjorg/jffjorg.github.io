 Case Number:  21STCV21273    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  74 Richard
Conell v. Transdev Services, Inc., et al.
Motion to File Under Seal
BACKGROUND 
            This
action arises from an employment dispute. 
            On
June 8, 2021, Plaintiff Richard Conell (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Transdev Services, Inc., Transdev North America, Inc., and Timothy Grensavitch
(Defendants).
            On
August 8, 2022, the court entered a joint stipulation and protective order. 
            February
9, 2023, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment with exhibits that
included documents subject to the protective order.
            On
September 18, 2023, Defendants filed this motion to seal documents.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Unless confidentiality is required
by law, court records are presumed to be open to the public. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 2.550, subd. (c).) Consequently, pleadings, motions, evidence, and
other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties;
rather, a prior court order is necessary. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551,
subd. (a).) 
            To
grant such an order, the court must expressly find that . . . “on overriding
interest exists that overcomes the right of public access to the record, an
overriding interest supports sealing the records, a substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed, the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored, and no less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550, subd. (d).) 
            If
the court fails to make the required findings, the order is deficient and
cannot support sealing. (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014)
231 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.) 
DISCUSSION  
The Identities of Defendants’ Former
Employees
            In their motion, Defendants first
seek to seal portions of documents disclosing the names of third-parties who
are former employees. The court finds that a legitimate interest supports this
sealing. As Defendants note, courts recognize a right to privacy in
confidential personnel information. (El Dorado
Savings & Loan Assn. v. Superior Court (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 342, 346,
disapproved on other grounds in Williams v. Superior Court (20170 3
Cal.5th 531.) This interest overrides that of the public in access to the names
of the third-party, former employees. And it goes without saying that this
interest will be compromised if the names remain unsealed and open to the
public. Lastly, the court finds the sealing of the
following documents sufficiently narrow tailored:

            The
names of third-party, former employees on page 81,
line 6 to page 82, line 1 of the     Deposition
of Michelle De Alba (Scott Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. B.)

            The
names of third-party, former employees on page 5, lines 6, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19,
22, 26,             and 27 of the

            The
names of third-party, former employees on page 6, lines 2, 6, and 7 of the       Declaration of Michelle De Alba. (De Alba
Decl., ¶¶ 29-30.)

22; Ex. FF.)
 
Irrelevant Information About
Third-Party Employees
 
            In addition, Defendants seek to seal
private information about third-party employees that Defendants do not rely on
in their motion for summary judgment. To that end, Defendants note the
third-party employees’ privacy interest in documents concerning their
employment with Defendants. (El Dorado Savings & Loan Assn. v. Superior
Court, supra, 190 Cal.App.3d at p. 246.) This interest overrides that of
the public in access to the names of the third-party employees, especially
since Defendants do not rely on the information in their motion for summary
judgment. And it goes without saying that this interest will be compromised if
the names remain unsealed and open to the public. Lastly, the court finds the
sealing of the following documents sufficiently narrow tailored:
            The
names of third-party employees in the following portions of the Transcript for
the      Deposition of Michelle De Alba:
page 49, lines 11 through 23; page 80, line 10 through          page 81, line 5; page 82, line 2 through 8; page 104, line
25; page 137, line 10. (Scott            Decl.,
¶ 4; Ex. B.)
 
            The
names of third-party employees in the following portions of the Transcript for
the      Deposition of Timothy
Grensavitch: page 82, line 14; page 110, line 7. (Scott Decl., ¶ 9;         Ex. G.) 
 
            The
names of third-party employees in the following portions of the Transcript of  the       Deposition
of Nyehsia Artavia: page 57, lines 10, 14, and 18. (Scott Decl., ¶ 11; Ex. I.) 
 
            The
names of third-party employees in the following portions of the Transcript for
the      Deposition of Vincent Verret:
page 204, lines 21 and 25. (Scott Supp. Decl., ¶ 12;        Ex. V.) 
 
            The
names of third-party employees listed in the Transcript for the Deposition of  Charlene Nicholson. (Scott Supp. Decl., ¶ 20;
DD.) 
 
Plaintiff’s Private Information
 
            Lastly, Defendants aim to seal
documents disclosing private information about Plaintiff—namely, his address
and earnings in his IRS Form W-2, as well as his medical records. Defendants
note Plaintiff’s right to privacy in such matters. (Valley Bank of Nevada v.
Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 657; Oiye v. Fox (2012) 211
Cal.App.4th 1036, 1070.) This interest overrides any interest the public might
have in such records. Moreover, the court finds the proposed sealing
sufficiently narrow. Thus, the court will grant the motion to seal for the following:
Exhibit A attached to the Declaration of Thomas Feddor and Exhibit N attached
to the Declaration of Allison Scott.
CONCLUSION 
Based
on the foregoing, the court grants Defendants’ motion to seal.
