```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents as "moot" because the plaintiff has already served their responses, albeit untimely. The judge notes that the plaintiff's counsel mistakenly assumed that a mutual agreement to extend the time to respond to discovery was in place.

The judge also declines to order sanctions against the plaintiff despite their failure to timely respond to the discovery requests. The judge believes it was reasonable for the plaintiff to assume that an extension of time would be mutually agreed upon.

In summary, the judge's ruling is a denial of the defendants' motions to compel responses to discovery, and no sanctions are ordered against the plaintiff.
