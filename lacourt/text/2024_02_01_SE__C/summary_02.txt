And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the complaint filed by BHAVIK THAKKAR, M.D. is sustained with 30 days' leave to amend. The complaint alleges medical negligence and loss of consortium on behalf of DOLORES ESPINOZA, who was treated at Lakewood Regional Medical Center. Dr. Thakkar argues that the claims are uncertain and do not state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action because the complaint does not specifically mention him, except as a Doe defendant. The judge agrees that the claims are uncertain and do not provide sufficient facts to support the alleged negligence and loss of consortium. However, the judge declines to sustain the demurrer on the basis of a statute of limitations defense, as the relation-back doctrine applies to the amended complaint naming Dr. Thakkar as a defendant.
