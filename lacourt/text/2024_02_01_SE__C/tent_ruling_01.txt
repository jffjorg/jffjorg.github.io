No
Oppositions filed as January 29, 2024.       
 
The
Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper
notice to the last known residence or business address of the client.  C.R.C. 3.1362.
 
Here,
Counsel’s declarations indicate that there has been a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship(s). Where the issue (or conflict) is between the
lawyer and client(s), without implicating other parties, the court can rely on
counsel’s sworn declaration absent any reason to doubt the representations. 
 
There
is an undisputed breakdown in attorney-client communications. It does not
appear that Attorney Melkonian’s continued representation would serve the
interests of justice. The motions to withdraw are GRANTED.
