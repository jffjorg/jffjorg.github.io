Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Requests for Production of Documents (set one) is CONTINUED to Thursday, March 21,
2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  

 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
This
lemon law action was filed by Plaintiffs MARTIN GARIBAY and MARIA TERESA
GARIBAY (“Plaintiffs”) on February 22, 2023. 
 
On
August 25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the subject Motion, which seeks to compel
Defendant’s further responses to Request for Production of Documents (set one)
Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 17, 19, 23, 25, 31, 36, 39, 42, 43, 49, 56, 58, 59,
68, 77, 78, and 79.
 
In
Opposition, Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer in good
faith, and that Supplemental Response were served on August 31, 2023—after the
Motion was filed. 
 
No
Reply has been filed as of January 29, 2024. 
 
It
is undisputed that supplemental responses were served after this Subject Motion
was filed. No meet and confer has occurred with respect to the Supplemental
Responses. Counsel are advised that their meet and confer efforts should go
beyond merely sending letters stating their respective positions. (See Townsend
v. Superior Court (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1431, 1439.) “A determination of
whether an attempt at informal resolution is adequate…involves the exercise of
discretion. The level of effort at an informal resolution which satisfies the
‘reasonable and good faith attempt’ standard depends upon the circumstances. In
a larger, more complex discovery request, a greater effort at informal
resolution may be warranted. In a simpler, or more narrowly focused case, a
more modest effort may suffice. The history of the litigation, the nature of
the interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the type and scope
of the discovery requested, the prospects for success and other similar factors
can be relevant. Judges have broad powers and responsibilities to determine
what measures and procedures are appropriate in varying circumstances.” (Obregon
v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.) 
 
Counsel
are instructed to further meet and confer on the issues outlined in the subject
Motions. 
 
Counsel
are ORDERED to make further efforts
to resolve the issues presented. If, after exhausting those efforts, court
intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the
continued hearing date. If counsel are unable to informally resolve their
discovery disputes, then counsel are instructed to submit a JOINT STATEMENT
outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required. The
joint statement must be FILED on or before Monday, March 11, 2024.
