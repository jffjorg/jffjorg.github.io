TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


July
  17, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV32266




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Set Aside Order that Request for Admissions are Deemed Admitted




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Larry Finley




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  City of Carson 



 
 
BACKGROUND
 
On
January 3, 2024, the Court granted Defendant City of Carson’s (“Defendant”)
motion to deem admitted Request for Admissions against Plaintiff Larry Finley
(“Plaintiff”). The Court also awarded monetary sanctions against Plaintiff’s
counsel of record for $337.50. The monetary sanctions were due within 30 days
to counsel for Defendant.  
 
Plaintiff
now moves to set aside the deemed admissions ostensibly under Code of Civil
Procedure sections 473(b) and 2033.280. Defendant opposes. No reply has been
filed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
As an initial matter, Plaintiff appears to seek relief under section
473(b). However, the Court cannot grant this motion based on section 473(b) because Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.300 provides a method for relief from an order
deeming the truth of admissions. (See Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21
Cal.4th 973, 979; Zellerino v. Brown (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1097, 1107
[“Relief under section 473 is unavailable when the discovery act provides
analogous, if more limited relief.”]. However, Plaintiff does not discuss
section 2033.300 in his motion. 
 
Instead,
Plaintiff cites to section 2033.280 which describes a procedure for relief from
waiver of objections. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(a).) The statute also
mandates granting a motion a to deem admitted unless the party to whom the
request for admissions was directed has served substantially compliant responses
prior to the hearing. (Id., § 2033.280(c).) 
 
Here,
Plaintiff admits that he served responses on January 19, 2024—after the hearing
on January 3, 2024. Therefore, he provides no basis for relief under section
2033.280. 
 
The
discovery was propounded on May 25, 2023. Plaintiff’s counsel, Ronald J.
Higgins, declares that when the discovery was due in June 2023, his office was
burglarized and Plaintiff’s responses were destroyed. (Higgins Decl. ¶ 4.)
Additionally, he states he contracted COVID-19 and was unable to work. (Id.
¶ 5.) However, he does not state how long his illness lasted. Higgins further
admits he was granted multiple extensions to respond to the discovery, but
states he was engrossed in several trials and matters. (Id. ¶ 6.)
However, he does not state the exact dates when these trials or matters took
place, or otherwise explain why he could not prepare and serve responses to
Requests for Admissions while also handling other matters. Nevertheless, he
asserts: “Because of my engagement in the above matters, and
others, I inadvertently overlooked the extensions and deadlines that defense
counsel had granted to submit responses to request for admissions. The delay
was the result of inadvertence, mistake and/or excusable neglect.” (Id.
¶ 7.) Counsel does not explain why the notice of motion to deem RFA’s admitted
did not provide him information regarding the deadline (i.e. prior to the
hearing on the motion), or explain why he could not prepare the responses
between September 8, 2023, when the motion was served on counsel, and January
3, 2024, when the motion was heard and granted.
 
In opposition, Defendant confirms that it granted multiple extensions
to respond until September 1, 2023. (Imeri-Garcia Decl. ¶ 12.) However, on
September 1, 2023, Plaintiff only sent responses to Request for Production and
Special Interrogatories. (Id. ¶ 13.) The fact that Plaintiff sent
responses to some of the discovery undermines counsel’s assertion that he
overlooked the deadlines for the Request for Admissions. Plaintiff has filed no
reply explaining this, or addressing the various extensions granted by
Defendant, which provided information regarding the deadline.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff has not shown that failure to respond was due
to inadvertence, mistake and/or excusable neglect. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s
motion to Set Aside Order that Request for Admissions are Deemed
Admitted is
DENIED.   
 
Plaintiff shall give notice of the Court’s
order and file a proof of service of such.
