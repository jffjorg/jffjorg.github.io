MOTION
 
On December 22, 2023, Plaintiff Veronica Aguilar (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Luvic Management Inc. LLC, Luis C. Montes, and
Does 1 to 20 for negligence and premises liability. Plaintiff alleges that on
December 30, 2021, she was at her place of employment when a piece of ceiling
fell on her. (Complaint ¶ 1.) She alleges that Luvic Management Inc. LLC
owned, managed, or controlled the subject property. (Id. ¶ 6.) She also
alleges that Does 1 to 20 owed a duty of care to reasonably foreseeable persons
at the property and breached that duty, thereby causing the incident. (Id.
¶ 11–14.)
 
On May 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the complaint, substituting
Luvic Health Care, LLC as Doe 3.  
 
Defendant Luvic Health Care, LLC (“Defendant”) now demurs to the
entire complaint on the following grounds: (1) the court lacks jurisdiction
(Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(a)); and (2) Plaintiff does not have legal capacity
to sue (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(b)). Plaintiff opposes and Defendant replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A demurrer is a pleading used to
test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. 
It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the
opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege
ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter
of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is that his complaint set
forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precision and with
sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source and
extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149,
156-157.) 
 
On demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to
“determine whether or not the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a
cause of action under any legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.) Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
            Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
The Declaration of Christopher
Carrillo, Defendant’s counsel, states that he met and conferred telephonically
with Plaintiff’s counsel on May 28, 2024, regarding the issues in this demurrer.
(Carrillo Decl. ¶ 2.) Therefore, the meet and confer requirement is met.  
 
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
Defendant
requests the Court take judicial notice of Plaintiff’s purported worker’s
compensation claim filed with the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board. Defendant
does not cite to a specific subsection of Evidence Code section 452. Therefore,
the request for judicial notice is denied. (See Evid. Code § 453(b).)
 
ANALYSIS
Here, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s claim is barred by
the worker’s compensation exclusivity rule, and thus the Court lacks
jurisdiction and Plaintiff lacks legal capacity to sue.
Under Labor Code
section 3602, “[w]here the conditions of compensation set forth in Section 3600
concur, the right to recover compensation is, except as specifically provided
in this section and Sections 3706 and 4558, the sole and exclusive remedy of the
employee or his or her dependents against the employer.” (Lab. Code, § 3602,
subd. (a).) Section 3602, subdivisions (b) and (c) set forth the exceptions to
the exclusive remedy provision of subdivision (a). Additionally, the exclusive
remedy provision of Section 3602, subdivision (a) does not apply where an
employer fails to secure the payment of compensation or where the employee’s
injury or death is proximately caused by the employer's knowing removal of, or
knowing failure to install, a point of operation guard on a power press. (See
Lab. Code, §§ 3607, 4558.)  
Here, the complaint alleges: “On December 30, 2021,
57-year-old Veronica Aguilar or "Plaintiff", tragically sustained
damaging injuries when a decaying and poorly maintained large ceiling inside
her place of employment ("Subject Office") fell on her while he was working
on the property located at 924 S. Atlantic Boulevard, Los Angeles, California
90022 ("Subject Property").” (Complaint ¶ 1.) 
While the
complaint appears to allege that Plaintiff was injured at her work, the
Complaint does not allege that Defendant was her employer at the time. As
stated above, the worker’s compensation exclusivity rule generally pertains to
lawsuits against the employer. (See, e.g., Labor Code § 3852.) Therefore,
because there are no allegations that Defendant was her employer, or even that
her employer secured payment of compensation, the face of the complaint does
not demonstrate that the worker’s compensation exclusivity rule applies. 
Since the
Court is limited to the pleadings on demurrer, and may not consider evidence
not judicially noticed, the face of the complaint does not reflect that the
Court lacks jurisdiction or that Plaintiff lacks standing and therefore the
Court overrules the demurrer.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court OVERRULES Defendant’s demurrer to the complaint. 
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
