And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff Larry Finley to set aside an order deeming his responses to Request for Admissions admitted. The Plaintiff's counsel, Ronald J. Higgins, claims that responses were destroyed in a burglary and that he was unable to work due to COVID-19, leading to the delay in responding to the Request for Admissions. However, the judge finds that the Plaintiff has not shown that the failure to respond was due to inadvertence, mistake, and/or excusable neglect. The judge also notes that the Plaintiff sent responses to some discovery requests on September 1, 2023, but not to the Request for Admissions. Therefore, the judge has denied the motion to set aside the order.
