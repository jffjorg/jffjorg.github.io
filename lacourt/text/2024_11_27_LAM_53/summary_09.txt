And here is the English text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding Plaintiff's Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel in this civil case. The court notes that Plaintiff's Counsel checked the box stating that Plaintiff was personally served with the moving papers, but failed to file a proof of service as required. Despite this, the court has considered the attached proofs of service, which show that Plaintiff was served by certified mail on October 8, 2024, and the statement made by Plaintiff's Counsel that they confirmed Plaintiff's address within the past 30 days. The court will likely consider these facts when making a final decision on the motion.
