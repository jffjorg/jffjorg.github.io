And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Nancy Kurpjuweit. The motion was filed by Matthew W. Dietz and Blackstone Law, APC, who are seeking to withdraw as counsel for plaintiff. The court finds that the motion should be granted, as plaintiff's counsel has shown sufficient reasons for withdrawal and has served the plaintiff with the necessary papers. The court notes that the proposed order is incomplete and requires the addition of plaintiff's current or last known address and telephone number. The court will grant the motion, but it will not take effect until the signed order is filed with the court.
