The court notes that, on the “Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel – Civil,” Plaintiff’s Counsel checked the box stating that
Plaintiff was personally served with the moving papers and that a proof of
service would be filed five court days before the hearing on this motion.  (MC-052, ¶ 3, subd. (a)(1).)  However, Plaintiff’s Counsel has not filed a
proof of personal service. 
Notwithstanding this assertion, the court has considered (1) the proofs
of service attached to the moving papers, which state that Plaintiff was served
therewith by certified mail on October 8, 2024, and (2) the statement made by
Plaintiff’s Counsel on the declaration form that Plaintiff’s Counsel has
confirmed within the past 30 days that Plaintiff’s address is current.  (MC-052, ¶ 3, subd. (b)(1)(c).)
