  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel responses to
  form interrogatories – employment and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant California Department
of Social Services 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories – Employment, and
for Sanctions
The court considered the moving papers filed in connection with this
motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Defendant California Department of Social Services (“Defendant”) moves
the court for an order (1) compelling plaintiff Antoinette Morris (“Plaintiff”)
to serve responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories—Employment, Set One, and
(2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff in
the amount of $440.
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).)¿ 
Defendant served Plaintiff with its Form Interrogatories—Employment,
on June 22, 2023, by mail and email. 
(Vallecillo Decl., Ex. A.) 
Although counsel for Defendant granted Plaintiff a 30-day extension to
serve responses, Plaintiff did not serve timely responses and had not served
responses as of the date that Defendant filed this motion.  (Vallecillo Decl., ¶¶ 4, 7.)  Plaintiff did not file opposition papers or
other evidence establishing that responses to this discovery have since been
served.  The court therefore grants
Defendant’s motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (b).) 
The court grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)  The court finds that $440 (2 hours x $220
hourly rate) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to impose against Plaintiff in
connection with this motion.  (Vallecillo
Decl., ¶ 8.)
ORDER
            The court grants defendant
California Department of Social Services’ motion to compel responses to form
interrogatories—employment and for sanctions. 
            Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.290, the court orders plaintiff Antoinette Morris to serve on
defendant California Department of Social Services full and complete verified
answers, without objections, to defendant California Department of Social
Services’ Form Interrogatories—Employment, Set One, that comply with Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.220-2030.250, within 20 days of the date of
service of this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff
Antoinette Morris to pay monetary sanctions to defendant California Department
of Social Services in the amount of $440 within 30 days of the date of service
of this order. 
            The court orders defendant
California Department of Social Services to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  November 27, 2024
