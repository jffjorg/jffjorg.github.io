(1)  
Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories
(2)  
Motion
to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories
(3)  
Motion
to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with each
motion.  No reply papers were filed. 
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM
INTERROGATORIES
Plaintiff Kristin Davidkhanian
(“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling defendant Advanced
Skin Care Center Inc. (“Defendant”) to serve responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of
Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $2,720.
If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿ 
Plaintiff served Defendant
with her Form Interrogatories—General, Set One, on March 29, 2023 by mail, and on
April 8, 2024, by mail.  (Banayan Decl.,
Exs. A, F.)  Plaintiff’s counsel asserts
that Defendant did not serve timely responses and had not served responses as
of the date that Plaintiff filed this motion. 
(Banayan Decl., ¶ 7.)  
Defendant has submitted
evidence showing that it served, on May 26, 2023, verified responses to
Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories—General, Set One, numbers 3.1-3.7, 4.1, 4.2,
12.1-12.4, 12.6, 12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 15.1, and 17.1.[1]  (Nov. 7, 2024 Opp., Burgee Decl., Ex. A [Def.
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One].) 
Thus, the court denies as moot Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
responses to those interrogatories. 
However, Defendant did not serve a response to Form Interrogatory number
12.5.  (Banayan Decl., Exs. A, F, p. 6
[requesting a response to No. 12.5].) 
Thus, the court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant to serve a
response to Form Interrogatory, Set One, number 12.5, without objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) 
The court finds that the
circumstances presented would make the imposition of sanctions unjust and
therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)  
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES
Plaintiff moves the court for
an order (1) compelling Defendant to serve responses to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendant in the amount of $2,720.
If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿ 
Plaintiff served on Defendant’s
counsel the Special Interrogatories, Set One, on April 20, 2023 by email, and on
April 8, 2024.  (Banayan Decl., Exs. B
[email to counsel on April 20, 2023], F.)  Plaintiff asserts that Defendant did not serve
timely responses and had not served responses as of the date that Plaintiff
filed this motion.  (Banayan Decl., ¶ 7.)
 Defendant has submitted evidence showing
that it served on Plaintiff its verified responses to Special Interrogatories,
Set One, on May 26, 2023.  (Nov. 7, 2024
Opp., Burgee Decl., Ex. B, p. 7.)  Plaintiff has not filed reply papers disputing
service of such responses as of that date. 

Thus, the court denies as moot
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s responses to Special
Interrogatories.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (b).)  The court finds
that the circumstances presented would make the imposition of sanctions unjust
and therefore denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)  
MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
Plaintiff moves the court for an order (1) compelling Defendant to
serve responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One,
and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in
favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $2,720.
If a party to whom a demand
for inspection is directed fails to serve a timely response, the party making
the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., §¿2031.300, subd. (b).)
            Plaintiff served Defendant with her
Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, on April 8, 2024 by mail.  (Banayan Decl., Ex. F.)  Defendant did not serve timely responses and
had not served responses as of the date that Plaintiff filed this motion.  (Banayan Decl., ¶ 7.)  Although Defendant has submitted evidence
showing that (1) defendant Elena Janev served responses to the discovery
directed to her, and (2) Defendant served responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production, Set Two, Defendant did not submit evidence showing that it served
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set One, which is the
discovery that is the subject of this motion. 
(Nov. 7, 2024 Opp., Burgee Decl., Exs. E [Elena Janev’s Responses to
Req. for Production], F [Def. Responses to Set Two]; Notice of Mot., pp.
1:28-2:3; Banayan Decl., Ex. F.)  
The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set One.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
The court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)  The court finds that $895 ((1.5
hours x $550 hourly rate) + $70 filing fee) is a reasonable amount of sanctions
to impose against Defendant in connection with this motion.  (Banayan Decl., ¶ 8.)

            The court denies as moot plaintiff
Kristin Davidkhanian’s motion to compel responses to special interrogatories.

Davidkhanian’s motion to compel responses to requests for production of
documents as follows.

to serve on plaintiff Kristin Davidkhanian full and complete verified
responses, without objections, to plaintiff Kristin Davidkhanian’s Requests for

sections 2031.210-2031.250, and (2) to produce to plaintiff Kristin
Davidkhanian all documents and things in defendant Advanced Skin Care Center
Inc.’s possession, custody, or control which are responsive to those requests,
within 20 days of the date of service of this order. 
            The court orders defendant Advanced
Skin Care Center Inc. to pay monetary sanctions to plaintiff Kristin
Davidkhanian in the amount of $895 within 30 days of the date of service of
this order.
            The court orders plaintiff Kristin
Davidkhanian to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
