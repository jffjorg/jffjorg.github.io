And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by JETNET, LLC to the First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Complainants Gregory Rowlee and Golden Hammer Ops, LLC. The Court has sustained the demurrer in part and overruled it in part.

The Court finds that the First Cause of Action for Fraud and Conspiracy to Commit Fraud is not superseded by the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act, as the allegations in the First Amended Cross-Complaint are separate from the trade secret misappropriation claims. The Court finds that the allegations in the First Amended Cross-Complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud.

The Court sustains JETNET's demurrer to the Second Cause of Action for Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, as the allegations in the First Amended Cross-Complaint do not sufficiently state a cause of action. The Court finds that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot impose substantive duties or limits on the contracting parties beyond those incorporated in the specific terms of their agreement.

The Court grants Cross-Complainants leave to amend the First Amended Cross-Complaint within 30 days.
