And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for attorney fees filed by the defendants, McGarrigle, Kenney & Zampiello, APC, and Patrick C. McGarrigle, in the amount of $120,959.20. The defendants seek attorney fees for work performed on an anti-SLAPP motion, which was granted by the Court. The Court finds that the defendants are entitled to recover attorney fees, despite the fact that their insurance company handled their representation. The Court also agrees that the defendants do not need to provide detailed billing records, citing a previous case that states that California courts do not require such records. The Court finds that the amount of attorney fees requested by the defendants is reasonable and grants the motion.
