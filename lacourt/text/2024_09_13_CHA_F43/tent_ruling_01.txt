SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff The
Las Canoas Co. (Plaintiff) filed this action on February 27, 2023. On April 29,
2024, this Court issued a ruling granting Defendants McGarrigle, Kenney &
Zampiello, APC, and Patrick C. McGarrigle’s (Defendants) anti-SLAPP motion.
This made Defendants the prevailing party for purposes of this action. As such,
Defendants filed a motion for attorney fees on July 2, 2024.
 
Defendants are
requesting $120,959.20 in attorney fees from Plaintiff. Defendants argue in
their motion that the attorney fees and hourly rates are reasonable. Defendants’
evidence in support of their request for attorney fees included a declaration
from their attorney, Courtney Curtis-Ives, and billing statements (with some
redactions as to the tasks and the amount billed for the task) that show which
attorney worked on a task, what the task was, and how much time was spent on
the task. (Curtis Ives Decl., Ex. 2.) The Curtis-Ives Declaration also describes
the hourly rates of the attorneys who worked on the case and the amount that
those attorneys billed. (Curtis-Ives Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6, 8, 10, 11.)
 
Courtney
Curtis-Ives’ hourly rate was $878.00 an hour for 102.9 hours ($90,346.20). Mr.
Waxler’s hourly rate was $1,057.00 for 1.2 hours ($1,268.40). Mr. Bucknell’s
hourly rate was $1,057.00 for 14.8 hours ($15,643.60). Ms. Stone’s hourly rate
was $538.00 for 1.1 hours (though technically $591.80, Defendants’ attorney’s
declaration only asks for $591.00). Mr. Goldstein’s hourly rate was $437.00 for
16 hours ($6,992.00). Ms. Boyd’s hourly rate was $437.00 for 14 hours ($6,118.00).

 
The total
lodestar was calculated by multiplying each of these attorney’s hourly rate by
their hours worked then adding them all together. The total hours worked for
the attorneys totaled 150. The total lodestar amount, as previously noted, is $120,959.20.
 
In Plaintiff’s
opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendants should not be awarded the attorney
fees because their defense was provided by an unnamed insurance company. Next,
Plaintiff argues that the number of hours is excessive for a simple and
straightforward anti-SLAPP motion. Plaintiff also argues that the request for
fees includes time that was solely attributable to the anti-SLAPP motion and
that the redactions of some of the time entries makes it impossible to tell if
they were for time spent on the anti-SLAPP motion. Finally, Plaintiff argues
that the hourly rates are excessive and unwarranted given that the Defendants
did not disclose that they were being represented by their insurer.
 
Defendants
argue in their reply that it is irrelevant that Defendants have liability
insurance, and defense counsel did not conceal anything. Next, they argue that
this was not a simple or straightforward anti-SLAPP motion and that the hourly
rates and total fees sought are reasonable. Finally, Defendants argue that the
fee request does not seek time for work outside of the anti-SLAPP motion.
 
ANALYSIS
A prevailing
party is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract,
statute, or law. (See CCP § 1033.5(a)(10); Cal. Civ. Code § 1717(a).) “A
successful party means a prevailing party, and [a party] may be considered
prevailing parties for attorney’s fees purposes if they succeed on any
significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties
sought in bringing suit.” (Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2005) 131
Cal.App.4th 173, 178.) An award of attorney fees is mandatory upon the granting
of an anti-SLAPP motion in favor of a defendant. (CCP § 425.16(c); see also Ketchum
v. Moses (2021) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.)
 
Defendants are
the prevailing party because their anti-SLAPP motion was granted by the Court. Defendants
have requested a total of $120,959.20 in attorney fees.
 
First is the
issue raised by Plaintiff that Defendants should not be able to recover
attorney fees because Defendants’ insurance company handled their
representation. Defendants cite cases in their reply that are instructive on
this issue. There are cases that support Defendants’ position that it should
still be able to recover fees. (See, e.g., Nemecek & Cole v. Horn
(2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 641, 652 (“We also reject Horn’s contention that the
attorney fee request should have been denied because the fees were paid by
Lawyers Mutual rather than Nemecek itself”) (citing Staples v. Hoefke (1987)
189 Cal.App.3d 1397, 1410 (“Plaintiffs were not entitled to avoid their
contractual obligation to pay reasonable attorney fees based on the fortuitous
circumstance that they sued a defendant who obtained insurance coverage
providing a defense”)); see also Rosenaur v. Scherer (2001) 88
Cal.App.4th 260, 284-285 (found that there is no authority to support the
proposition that a defendant who successfully brings an anti-SLAPP motion is
barred from recovering fees if the fees were paid by a third party).)
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants may recover attorney fees even though their insurance
company handled their representation in this case. 
 
The next issue
is the argument raised by Plaintiff is that Defendants should not have redacted
their billing statements because it makes it difficult to determine whether the
requested fees were directly attributable to the anti-SLAPP motion or if they
were for something else. The Court, having reviewed the billing statements
submitted by Defendants as Exhibit 2 to the Curtis-Ives Declaration, agrees
that the redactions make it difficult to determine what exactly the billings
were for. Also, because the amount of money charged for each task was redacted,
it also makes it difficult to determine whether the attorney fees requested by
Defendants in their motion is an accurate reflection of the amount actually
generated. In a few instances, even the number of hours spent on certain tasks
is redacted.
 
Footnote 1 of
the Curtis-Ives declaration indicates that the descriptions of the time entries
were redacted for confidentiality, work product, and/or attorney-client
privilege concerns. (Curtis-Ives Decl., p. 3.) However, the California Supreme
Court has distinguished between providing such information during pending
litigation as opposed to litigation that has concluded. (Los Angeles County
Bd. Of Supervisors v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 282.) Because the
fees request does not concern ongoing litigation, it appears that the privilege
does not apply to that information. 
 
To the extent
that Defendants argue that they do not have to provide this billing information
(see Syers Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691,
698), the Court agrees. In Syers, the Court of Appeal found that “The
trial court did not abuse its discretion in accepting defense counsel’s
computation of attorney hours as hours reasonably spent working on the case. It
is well established that ‘California courts do not require detailed time
records, and trial courts have discretion to award fees based on declarations
of counsel describing the work they have done and the court’s own view of the
number of hours reasonably spent. [Citations.]’” (Id.) “‘Because time
records are not required under California law ..., there is no required level
of detail that counsel must achieve. See, e.g., PLCM Group[, supra,
22 Cal.4th at p.] 1098, 95 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 997 P.2d 511 (‘We do not want “a
[trial] court, in setting an attorney’s fee, [to] become enmeshed in a
meticulous analysis of every detailed facet of the professional representation.
It ... is not our intention that the inquiry into the adequacy of the fee
assume massive proportions, perhaps dwarfing the case in chief,” ’…)’” (Id.
at 699-700.)
 
Based on the
language in Syers, the Court will not require more detailed billing
records from Defendants. Based on the Court’s review of the Declaration
submitted by Defendants’ attorney and the Court’s review of the relevant
anti-SLAPP motion, it is reasonable that Defendants’ attorneys would have spent
150 hours on the motion. Accordingly, the Court finds that the amount of
attorney fees requested by Defendant is reasonable.
 
The Court
grants Defendants’ motion in the full requested amount of $120,959.20.
 
CONCLUSION
Defendants’
motion for attorney fees is granted in the amount of $120,959.20.
