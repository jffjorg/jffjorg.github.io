Legal
Standard
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the
court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof,
the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the
settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over
the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of
the settlement.
 
(CCP, § 664.6(a).)
 
“Because of its summary nature,
strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to
invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement agreement.” (Sully-Miller
Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 30, 37; Critzer v. Enos (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1262.)
In ruling on a motion under § 664.6, the trial judge may receive oral
testimony, or may determine the motion upon declarations alone. (Corkland v.
Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994.) Where the agreement was reached at
a court hearing, the court can resolve the dispute on the basis of its own
notes or recollection of what was agreed to (as well as any transcripts of the
proceedings). (Richardson v. Richardson (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 91, 97.)
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiff demonstrates that the parties
to this litigation stipulated, in a signed writing, for settlement of the case.
On January 30, 2020, Plaintiff AENB and Defendant Olmstead entered into a
"settlement agreement," regarding this action. The written agreement
was signed by the parties. Pursuant to the agreement, the parties agreed that
Defendant would make certain payments to Plaintiff. If Defendant failed to make
the payments and did not cure their default after written notice, Plaintiff was
entitled to a judgment for the outstanding balance owed on Defendant's account.
The parties entered into a stipulation reflecting the agreement and submitting
to this court’s jurisdiction per CCP § 664.6. (See 1/30/2020 Stipulation.) Defendant
defaulted on the agreement by failing to make the required payments. (Dyle
Delc., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff mailed a notice of the default to Defendant on August 4,
2021. (Id., Ex. B.) Defendant has not cured the default. (Id. ¶ 9.) Therefore, the
Court may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement.
 
Plaintiff provides a proposed
judgment consistent with the agreement. The terms of the agreement provide that
a judgment may be entered for the outstanding balance owed on the account plus
costs. The outstanding amount is $26,385.50. (Dyle Decl., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff
claims costs of $563.00. (Id.) Thus, the Court will sign the proposed judgment.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
