Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions: (1) a motion to strike certain portions of the complaint, and (2) a motion for leave to amend to add punitive damages. The judge grants the motion to strike the unauthorized practice of law by Alejandro Alers Jr., the plaintiff's son. The judge denies the motion for leave to amend to add punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff has failed to meet their burden to show a substantial probability of success on the merits of their negligence claim or punitive damages. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for an order to cease and desist and reinstate the physician-patient relationship between defendant and plaintiff.
