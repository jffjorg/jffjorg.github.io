Legal
Standard
 

“A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of
motion for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her. . . .” (CCP § 418.10(a).) A court lacks
jurisdiction over a party if there has not been proper service of
process. (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 801, 808.)
“When a motion to quash is properly brought,
the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to establish the facts of
jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.” (Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 556, 568.)  The plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did
give the court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective
service.”  (Coulston v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868;
see also Elkman v. National States Ins. Co. (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 1305, 1312-13 [“Where a nonresident defendant challenges
jurisdiction by way of a motion to quash, the plaintiff bears the burden of
establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that minimum contacts exist
between the defendant and the forum state to justify imposition of personal
jurisdiction.”].)  
 
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
 
Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED.
(Evid. Code § 452(d).)
 
Defendant Y.Y.G.M., S.A (YYGM)’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED. (Id.) 
 
Defendant YYGM’s objections are OVERRULED.
 
Analysis
 
Specially
Appearing Defendant YYGM moves to quash the summons by Plaintiff Jane Doe on
the grounds there are insufficient minimum contacts with California such that
this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over YYGM. 
 
There
is no reasonable dispute that this Court lacks general jurisdiction over this
defendant. YYGM is a Swiss corporation headquartered in Switzerland. (Fabiani
Decl., ¶ 2.) It provides that has no offices, stores, employees, assets, or
presence in California. (Id. ¶¶ 2-4.) It conducts no advertising,
manufacturing, sales, or other operation in California. (Id. ¶¶ 2-4, 6.). It is
not registered with the California Secretary of State, has designated no agent
for service of process in California, and pays no taxes in California. (Id. ¶¶
2-4.) YYGM maintains all corporate records in Switzerland. (Id. ¶ 11.) YYGM
owns the trademark “Brandy Melville,” used on young women’s apparel. (¶ 4.) While
certain retail stores in California sell Brandy Melville-trademarked
merchandise, YYGM does not own those outlets. (Id.) YYGM never employed Doe and
claims no ownership interest in the companies that employed her. (¶¶ 4, 7.) Even
if the Court were to credit Plaintiff’s evidence that YYGM operates the Brandy
Melville stores in California (PCOE, Ex. 2, ¶¶ 3, 11; Ex. 4 ¶¶ 3, 11-12), the
Court would not find this operation to be systematic business contacts with
California such that YYGM is “at home” in California. Therefore, the Court focuses
its discussion on specific jurisdiction.
 
“Where general jurisdiction cannot be established, a court
may assume specific jurisdiction over a defendant in a particular case if the
plaintiff shows the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of
forum benefits; [ie.] the nonresident purposefully directed its
activities at forum residents or purposefully availed itself of the privilege
of conducting activities within the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and
protections of local law. (Hanson v. Denckla (1958)
357 U.S. 235.) Specific jurisdiction involves a 3-part test: (1) the
nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction with the
forum or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the
privilege of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits
and protections of its laws; (2) the claim must be one which arises out of or
results from the defendant's forum-related activities; and (3) exercise of
jurisdiction must be reasonable.”  (Jewish Defense Organization,
Inc. v. Sup. Ct. of Los Angeles County (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1054 [purposeful availment exists
where a defendant performed some type of affirmative conduct which allows or
promotes the transaction of business within the forum state].)
 
“[C]ourts
consistently exercise personal jurisdiction over corporations based upon their
agents’ activities within the forum state.” (Magnecomp Corp. v. Athene Co.
(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 526, 535.) “[T]he activities of [defendant’s] employees
are attributed to the business entity for purposes of personal jurisdiction.” (Anglo
Irish Bank Corp., PLC v. Superior Court (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 969, 981.)
“[A]ctivities that are undertaken on behalf of a defendant may be attributed to
that defendant for purposes of personal jurisdiction if the defendant
purposefully directed those activities toward the forum state.” (Id.)
 
This
case arises from Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual assault by Luca Rotondo at
certain points from 2016 through 2019. (Compl., ¶¶ 22-66.) Plaintiff worked for
Defendants in several different capacities from June 2015 to late 2018,
beginning as a salesclerk and later adding employment duties as an Instagram
and e-commerce model for the brand as well as visual merchandizing roles for Defendants’
Hawaii and Santa Monica stores. As alleged in the complaint, Rotondo used his
connections within Bastiat to contact and attempt to seduce Plaintiff. For
instance, Rotondo used his position within Bastiat to pressure Plaintiff into a
relationship, including setting up photoshoots of Plaintiff in Singapore,
Bangkok and London. In sum, Rotondo harassed and sexually assaulted Plaintiff
at several points, including while Plaintiff was in Bangkok for the November 2016
photoshoot.
 
Plaintiff
proffers evidence that she worked in California-based Brandy Melville stores at
various times from 2016 to 2018, including working directly with Rotondo.
(PCOE, Ex. 12 [Palacios SJ Decl.] ¶¶ 18-19, 21; PCOE, Ex. 13 [Palacios Depo.]
at 86:9-90:3; PCOE, Ex. 10 [Swanberg Depo.] at 27:17- 30:11; PCOE, Ex. 14 [Doe
Depo.] at 67:1-18, 72:17-73:22, 76:21-24, 139:21-140:1, 142:7- 146:4,
163:18-165:13, 166:1-168:11, 188:8-11, 188:19-22, 189:6-11.) Plaintiff
experienced sexual harassment from Rotondo in 2018, while Rotondo was directly
employed by YYGM. For instance, during a confrontation about his assault of
Plaintiff, Rotondo “manipulated [Plaintiff] and made [her] feel like it was
[her] fault” and called her a “slut.” (PCOE, Ex. 14 [Doe Depo.] at 65:18-66:25.)
She also had encounters with Rotondo at the Santa Monica store during the
summer of 2018. (Id. at 145.) A few weeks before this confrontation, Plaintiff
saw Rotondo in Santa Monica, which triggered a PTSD-related panic attack. (Id.
at 129.) Furthermore, after Rotondo transferred to the Santa Monica store, he
reached out to Plaintiff and insisted on an in-person meeting. (Id. at 164-167.)
Rotondo demanded that Plaintiff travel with him for the company. Plaintiff felt
as though she could not say no, or she would risk losing her job. (Id.) Also in
2018, Rotondo secretly videotaped sexual relations with Plaintiff, and he
showed other male employees at their company these videos. (Id., at 116:2-15.) While
these are not the only injuries Plaintiff claims, these interactions form a
substantial basis for Plaintiff’s sexual harassment and intentional infliction
of emotional distress claims. 
 
As
noted previously, YYGM likely has some control over Brandy Melville stores in
California. It has admitted that it operates “35 retail locations throughout
the state of California, dozens more across the United States, and many more abroad.”
(PCOE, Exs. 2-6.) Rotondo worked on behalf of YYGM from July 2017 to November 2018.
Rotondo acted as one of the managers for the Santa Monica store which included
his visual merchandising duties, managing loss prevention and approving
employee discounts. (PCOE Ex. 9 [Alvarez Depo.] at 30:16-31:16; See Ex. 10
[Swanberg Depo.] at 23:8-15 [Rotondo involved in “loss-prevention” and
“approving employees’ discounts”].) 
 
With
this evidence, Plaintiff demonstrates that YYGM purposefully availed itself of
the protections of California’s laws. Rotondo was exercising control over
Brandy Melville stores in California, including managing employees such as
Plaintiff. YYGM admits it operated and had some form of control over those same
stores. Critically, it admits that during the summer of 2018, Rotondo was their
direct employee and agent. Considering YYGM’s affirmative conduct in sending
Rotondo to manage its store in California, YYGM
purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in
California and invoked the benefits and protections of its laws. Moreover, the
matters at issue here arise, in substantial part, out of actions by Rotondo in
California while employed and working on behalf of YYGM and managing YYGM’s
Brandy Melville brand stores. Thus, the first two elements of specific
jurisdiction are met. 
 
Moreover,
the record shows substantial and direct connections between YYGM’s employee’s
actions in California and Plaintiff’s injury. Under such circumstances, the
exercise of jurisdiction would be reasonable and comport with traditional
notions of fair play. 
 
Accordingly,
the motion to quash is DENIED.
