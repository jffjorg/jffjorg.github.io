And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement. The parties signed a settlement agreement on January 30, 2020, in which the defendant agreed to make certain payments to the plaintiff. However, the defendant defaulted on the payments and failed to cure the default after written notice. As a result, the court may enter judgment for the outstanding balance owed on the account plus costs. The proposed judgment is consistent with the agreement and the court orders the defendant to pay $26,385.50 plus costs of $563.00.
