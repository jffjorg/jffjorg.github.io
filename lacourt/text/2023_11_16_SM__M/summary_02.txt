Significant Statements:
  - The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.
  - A party may move for summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action within an action, one or more affirmative defenses, one or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of duty, if the party contends that the cause of action has no merit, that there is no affirmative defense to the cause of action, that there is no merit to an affirmative defense as to any cause of action, that there is no merit to a claim for damages, as specified in Section 3294 of the Civil Code, or that one or more defendants either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or plaintiffs.
  - To prevail, the evidence submitted must show there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

**Tentative Ruling:**

* The motion is GRANTED as to issue no. 4 (punitive damages) and DENIED as to the remainder.
* The motion is DENIED as to issues nos. 1 and 3 (trespass and ejectment).
* The motion is GRANTED as to issue no. 5 (chain of title of Parcel 2 Easement), as adjudication of this issue would not dispose of the entirety of any complete cause of action and is therefore improper on a motion for summary adjudication.
