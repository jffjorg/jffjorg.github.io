And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion to quash a summons filed by Plaintiff Jane Doe against Defendant Y.Y.G.M., S.A (YYGM). The Judge is reviewing the evidence presented by both parties and has determined that YYGM has purposefully availed itself of the protections of California's laws. Specifically, the Judge finds that Rotondo, an employee of YYGM, engaged in sexual harassment and assault of Plaintiff while working in California, and that YYGM has some control over the Brandy Melville stores in California where these incidents occurred. The Judge concludes that the exercise of jurisdiction over YYGM would be reasonable and comport with traditional notions of fair play, and therefore denies the motion to quash the summons.
