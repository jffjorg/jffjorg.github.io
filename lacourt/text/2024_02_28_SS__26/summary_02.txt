Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a lawsuit filed by Coreen Lockett against Nexxt Car, Inc. and American Contractors Indemnity Company. The defendant filed a motion to compel deposition and request for sanctions, and a motion to deem requests for admission admitted. The court denied both motions. The court found that the defendant unnecessarily caused the dispute over the deposition date and that the plaintiff properly served responses to the requests for admission. The court also noted that the defendant had more than a year to set the deposition date and instead waited until the last possible date without conferring with the plaintiff's counsel. The court granted the defendant's ex parte application to continue the trial date, but found that the parties can resolve the dispute over the deposition date without the court's intervention.
