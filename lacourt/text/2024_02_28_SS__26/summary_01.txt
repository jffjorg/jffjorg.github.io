Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion filed by defendants Victor A. Velasquez and Melissa Vargas, requesting an order requiring plaintiff Alejandro Diaz to post security or dismiss the consolidated cases. The defendants claimed that Diaz is a vexatious litigant and that there is not a reasonable probability that he will prevail in the litigation against them. However, the Judge found that the defendants confused "vexatious litigant" with "high-frequency litigant" and that there is no authority to indicate that high-frequency litigants are subject to the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 391.1 regarding vexatious litigants. As a result, the Judge denied the motion for an order requiring Diaz to post security or dismiss the action.
