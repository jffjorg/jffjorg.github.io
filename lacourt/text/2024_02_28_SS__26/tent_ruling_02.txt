(CCP §§
2025.450, 2033.280)

ANALYSIS: 
 
On February 22, 2022, Plaintiff Coreen Lockett (“Plaintiff”)
filed this action against Defendants Nexxt Car, Inc. (“Defendant”)
and American Contractors Indemnity Company (“ACIC”). Plaintiff filed the First
Amended Complaint on May 9, 2022, and following the Court sustaining the
demurrer with leave to amend, filed the Second Amended Complaint on August 18,
2022. On October 26, 2022, the Court overruled the demurrer to the Second Amended
Complaint and accepted the parties’ stipulation to reclassify the action as a
limited jurisdiction case. (Minute Order, 10/26/22.) The stipulation was made
on the “condition that (1) all previously propounded written discovery shall
count towards the discovery limits in limited civil cases, and (2) the limits
on the number of depositions allowed in limited civil cases shall not apply.” (Ibid.)

 
Defendants
filed their answer to the Second Amended Complaint on November 1, 2022. On July
10, 2023, the Court determined that this action was related to Have Fun
Event Planning LLC v. Nexxt Car Inc., et al., LASC Case No. 22STCV35099 and
designated Case No. 22STCV35099 as the lead case. (Minute Order, 07/10/23.)
Both cases were assigned to Department 36 in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. (Ibid.)
Following dismissal of Case No. 22STCV35099, the instant action was transferred
back to the limited jurisdiction court on September 18, 2023. (Minute Order,
09/18/23.) On November 30, 2023, the Court set the trial date for February 29,
2024. (Minute Order, 11/30/23.) 
 
Defendant filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Deposition and
Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Deem Requests for Admissions, Set One,
on January 30, 2023. Plaintiff filed oppositions on February 14, 2024 and
Defendant replied on February 21, 2024. 
 
Motion to Compel Deposition

 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, section (a) states
in relevant part: 
 
If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party
under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) The motion must
also “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice” and “be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subds. (b)(1), (2).) 
 
Defendant served Plaintiff with a Notice of Deposition on January
19, 2024, setting the deposition for January 30, 2024. (Motion, Fisher Decl.,
Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s counsel’s office responded that Plaintiff’s counsel was
not available on January 30, 2024 and provided alternative dates of February 5
or 6, 2024. (Id. at Exh. B.) Based on the trial date of February 29,
2024, the discovery cutoff date at the time the deposition was noticed was also
January 30, 2024. Defense counsel requested a stipulation to continue the trial
date, which Plaintiff’s counsel refused on January 22, 2024. (Id. at
Exh. E.) Defendant filed the instant Motion to Compel
Deposition and Request for Sanctions on January 30, 2024. 
 
The Court finds the instant Motion was unnecessarily caused
by defense counsel. This case has been at issue since November 1, 2022, on
which date the trial was scheduled for August 22, 2023. (Notice of Trial,
11/01/22.) The time to complete discovery pursuant to that trial date was July
23, 2023. Following the order relating this action to Case No. 22STCV35099 and
the subsequent transfer of this action back to the limited jurisdiction court,
there was no trial date until November 28, 2023 at which time trial was set for
February 29, 2024. Defendant had more than a year since the case was at issue
to set the deposition date and instead waited until the last possible date
without conferring with Plaintiff’s counsel. Could Plaintiff’s counsel have
stipulated to a continuance of the trial date? Certainly. Defendant, however,
could have just as soon filed an ex parte application to continue the trial
date instead of filing the instant Motion. Indeed, Defendant was obligated to
file just such an ex parte application anyway because the discovery motion
cutoff would pass before the instant Motion could be heard, a fact that would
be obvious given the Motion was filed one week before the discovery cutoff. 
 
The Court now having granted Defendant’s ex parte
application to continue the trial date, the issue of the discovery and motion
cutoffs is not relevant until April 30, 2024. The Court is confident the
parties can reach an agreement regarding the deposition date before that time,
without the Court’s intervention. The Motion to Compel Deposition and for
Monetary Sanctions is denied.
 
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted
 
On December 29, 2023, Defendant served Requests for
Admissions on Plaintiff. (Motion, Fisher
Decl., Exh. A.) Responses were due by January 29, 2024. On January 3, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel inquired which discovery requests were at issue because
more than 35 requests—the limit for written discovery in the limited
jurisdiction—had been served. (Opp., Cooper Decl., Exh. C.) Plaintiff’s counsel
inquired again on January 6, 2024 and the attorneys engaged in a discussion
about the responses without resolving the dispute. (Ibid.) Defendant
filed the instant Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted the day after
the responses were due. In opposition, Plaintiff has demonstrated that although
the dispute over the number of requests was not resolved, they served verified
responses to some of the requests on January 29, 2024 and then served verified
responses to all the requests for admission on February 13, 2024. (Id.
at Exhs. A, E.) 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
When a party fails to timely serve verified responses, the propounding party is
entitled to an order deeming the Requests for Admission admitted. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280.) The Court must make this order “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before
the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission
that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280.) The Court finds that Plaintiff did serve code-compliant responses,
therefore, the Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted is denied.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Nexxt Car, Inc.’s (1)
Motion to Compel Deposition and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Deem
Requests for Admissions, Set One, Admitted, are DENIED.
