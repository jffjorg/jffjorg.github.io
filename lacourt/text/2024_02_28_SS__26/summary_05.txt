And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The plaintiff, Daniel Lupa-Chazan, alleges that the defendants, Alicia Garcia and Sergio Garcia, were negligent in a motor vehicle accident that occurred on March 26, 2023. The defendants argue that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge agrees, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do not demonstrate that the defendants' conduct was oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious. However, the judge grants the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to provide additional facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The motion to strike punitive damages is granted with 30 days' leave to amend.
