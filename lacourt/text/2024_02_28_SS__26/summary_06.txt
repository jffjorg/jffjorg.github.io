And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the hearing on the disbursement of surplus proceeds to April 30, 2024, at 9:30 am. Claimant Nicole Hrobak is required to file and serve a supplemental declaration by April 9, 2024, attaching copies of the orders and judgment in LASC Case No. BD501536 that demonstrate her entitlement to the surplus proceeds. The judge is unable to determine what orders were made or what judgment was issued in the dissolution proceeding, Truxal v. Truxal, LASC Case No. BD501536, which is necessary to support Claimant's claim to the surplus proceeds.
