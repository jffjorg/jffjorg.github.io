And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants. The defendants sought to compel arbitration of the claims brought by the plaintiffs, alleging that the plaintiffs' daughter, Latia Salter, signed an arbitration agreement on behalf of her deceased father, Abraham Salter. However, the judge found that the defendants failed to meet their burden of proving that Abraham Salter conferred actual or ostensible authority on Latia Salter to execute the arbitration agreement on his behalf. Without evidence that Abraham Salter intentionally consented to or authorized Latia Salter to act as his agent, the judge concluded that there was no valid arbitration agreement.
