And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One, filed by Defendant Hanseo University. The court finds that the defendant has conceded that supplemental responses have been provided by the plaintiff, and therefore, the court declines to award monetary sanctions.

The court notes that the parties had previously agreed to extend the plaintiff's time to respond to discovery requests, but the plaintiff failed to provide substantive responses. The court advises the parties that future failure to timely respond to discovery may result in monetary sanctions.

The court orders that the defendant's motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One, are granted in part, and the plaintiff is ordered to provide further responses to the discovery requests.
