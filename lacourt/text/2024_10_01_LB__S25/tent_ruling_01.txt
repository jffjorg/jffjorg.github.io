(Seymour Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A.) Defense counsel further states that Plaintiff did not object or request an extension of time to provide response, failing to serve responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, by April 29, 2024. (Seymour Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)On April 30, 2024, Defense counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel, requesting objection-free responses on or before May 6, 2024. (Seymour Decl., ¶ 6, Ex.

(Seymour Decl., ¶ 16, Ex. L.) The requirements have been satisfied.DiscussionThe Court notes that Defendant erroneously designated the instant motion as a “Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Initial Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One;” however, Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. Plaintiff provided initial responses to the Form Interrogatories, Set One, on May 6, 2024 (Seymour Decl., ¶ 7, Ex. C; Demirjian Decl., ¶ 5) but Defendant is now seeking “full, complete, and objection free responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 9.1 and 9.2”. (See Proposed Order at p. 2; Defendant’s Separate Statement.) The Court will proceed as such.Defendant seeks further responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 9.1 and 9.2, arguing that Plaintiff’s statement that she “is in the process of obtaining and will supplement upon receipt” is not code-compliant and hinders Defendant’s ability to establish Plaintiff’s damages from the incident. In opposition, Plaintiff states that on August 29, 2024, Plaintiff served verified, code-compliant responses, without objection to Form Interrogatory Nos. 9.1 and 9.2. Plaintiff further asserts that the responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 9.1 and 9.2 only state “No”. (Demirjian Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.) In response, Defendant concedes that supplemental responses have been sent by Plaintiff, only arguing that the instant motion is not moot because of Defendant’s monetary sanctions request.Tentative RulingDefendant concedes supplemental responses were provided. The Court declines to award monetary sanctions. The parties are advised that future failure to timely respond to discovery may result in monetary sanctions.Defendant Hanseo University's Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One and Request for Monetary SanctionsProcedural HistoryOn September 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Rochelle R Anderson, Kenneth J Anderson and Does 1 to 50, alleging a sole cause of action for wrongful death – negligence/premises liability.
