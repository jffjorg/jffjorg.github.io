And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case filed by Michael Mann and Marilyn Craig against Farmers Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance Exchange, Truck Insurance Exchange, Mid-Century Insurance Company, and Farmers New World Life Insurance Company. The case involves claims of age discrimination and violation of wage and hour laws in California. The defendants, Arnoldo Jaquez, filed four discovery motions related to requests for admissions (RFAs) and form interrogatories (FROGs) that he served on the plaintiffs. The motions were initially set for hearing on July 11, 2018, but were continued to July 18, 2024, to allow for more time for oral argument.

The judge denied Jaquez's motions to compel further responses to RFAs and FROGs, finding that Jaquez's definition of "managing agent" in RFA Number 18 was problematic and that the RFAs and FROGs served on the plaintiffs violated the self-containment rule. The judge also declined to order sanctions against Jaquez and his attorneys, finding that Jaquez's positions were substantially justified and that the tone and rhetoric used by the plaintiffs' attorneys in the meet and confer process and in their briefs was unnecessarily and unreasonably sharp and harsh.
