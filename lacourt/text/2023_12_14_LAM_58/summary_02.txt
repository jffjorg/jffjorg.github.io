Here is a brief summary in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment in a medical malpractice case. The plaintiff, Roland Minsal, alleges that the defendant, Sanjay Logani, M.D., performed a vitrectomy surgery on his left eye that resulted in the loss of vision. The defendant argues that the surgery was medically indicated and in compliance with the applicable standard of care. The judge finds that the defendant has shifted the burden of proof and that the plaintiff's opposition is late and inadequate. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's expert declaration is insufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact on the issue of informed consent. As a result, the judge grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
