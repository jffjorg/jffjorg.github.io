And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving sexual assault and discrimination in an employment context. The plaintiff, Jane Doe, filed a complaint against the defendant, MB Salon Inc., and its employee, Miakel Bishay, alleging various torts and employment-related claims.

The defendant, MB Salon Inc., demurred to the first, sixth, and tenth causes of action, arguing that the doctrine of respondeat superior liability does not attach to conduct that falls outside the course and scope of employment. The judge agrees with the defendant and sustains the demurrer to these causes of action, finding that the alleged conduct was not within the scope of employment.

The judge also denies the defendant's motion to strike portions of the complaint that reference the defendant's alleged drug and alcohol use, finding that these allegations are relevant to the evaluation of the defendant's conduct.

Finally, the judge grants the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint and orders that an amended complaint be filed and served by January 15, 2024.
