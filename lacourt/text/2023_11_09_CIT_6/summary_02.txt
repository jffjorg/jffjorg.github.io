The Court finds that the Plaintiff's motions are moot due to the Defendant's timely provision of verified responses to the discovery requests. However, the Court may still consider the issue of sanctions. The Court awards monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $510.00 against the Defendant, to be paid within 20 days of the order. The Court also orders the Plaintiff to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days.
