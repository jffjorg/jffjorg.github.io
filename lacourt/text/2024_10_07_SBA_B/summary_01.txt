And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration in this case. The case is stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration. The Judge found that an enforceable arbitration provision exists between the plaintiff (as an assignee) and the defendants as contained in the Staffing Agreement. The plaintiff purchased Paramount's invoices and sent Notice of Assignments (NOAs) to account debtors, but the defendants failed to make payment despite written demand. The Judge rejected the plaintiff's argument that the defendants waived their right to arbitration, finding that there was no clear and convincing evidence of intentional relinquishment or abandonment of the right to arbitration. The Judge also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the NOAs amended the Staffing Agreement, finding that there was no evidence that the NOAs were served as required by the Staffing Agreement.
