And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Cross-Complainant Kasra Mizban's motion to compel initial discovery responses from Cross-Defendant Gabriel Sanchez. The discovery requests were served on June 14, 2023, and responses were due on July 18, 2023. Despite multiple extensions, no response was received. The judge also grants the motion to deem the requests for admission (RFAs) admitted, as Cross-Defendant failed to respond to the RFAs. The judge awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,760.00 against Cross-Defendant and/or his counsel, jointly and severally, for failing to respond to the discovery requests. The sanctions are to be paid to Cross-Complainant's counsel within 30 days.
