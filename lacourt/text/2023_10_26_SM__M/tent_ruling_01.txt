to Compel Initial Discovery Responses 
HEARING DATE:   10/26/2023

 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand,
the demanding party must seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.)
Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work
product. Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief
from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There
is no deadline for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to
respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court
before filing the motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the
inspection demand, no showing of "good cause" is required.
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The
statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have
been served. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of
interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to
respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Pursuant to CCP section 2033.280(b), a party may move for
an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). “Failure to timely
respond to RFA does not result in automatic admissions. Rather, the propounder of the RFA
must ‘move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction’ under § 2023.010 et seq.” (CCP, § 2033.280(b).) The court
“shall” grant the motion to deem RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the party
to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP, § 2033.280(c).) 
 
Analysis
 
Cross-Complainant Kasra Mizban moves to compel
initial discovery responses from Cross-Defendant Gabriel Sanchez as to 1) Form
Interrogatories, Set One; 2) Special Interrogatories, Set One; 3) Request for
Production of Documents, Set One; and 4) Requests for Admission, Set One. (See
Kang Decls., Exs. A.) Cross-Complainant also requests sanctions against
Cross-Defendant and/or his counsel of record, Joseph Gualderon of the Law
Offices of Robyn S. Hosmer and Angel Chavez of Hanger, Steinberg, Shapiro &
Ash, in the amount of $1,320.00 for the RPDs, and $690.00 for each other
motion. 
 
            Here, Cross-Complainant served Cross-Defendant
with the first sets of discovery on June 14, 2023, including FROGs, SROGs,
RPDs, and RFAs. (Kang Decls., ¶¶ 4, Exs. A.) Responses were due on July 18,
2023. After receiving no response, Cross-Complainant’s counsel sent meet and
confer letters and gave an extension to respond until September 9, 2023. (Id., ¶¶
6-8.) No response was ever received. (Id., ¶¶ 9.) As Cross-Defendant has failed
to respond, the motions to compel are GRANTED and the motion to deem matters
admitted is GRANTED.  Further responses
to the motions compel, without objections, are ordered within 10 days.
 
Monetary sanctions are mandatory,
unless the imposition of sanctions would be unjust or the party subject to the
sanctions acted with substantial justification. As to the RFAs, the sanctions
are mandatory, without exception. Cross-Defendant has failed to respond or
oppose, and therefore failed to justify their non-response to the discovery.
 
Accordingly, Cross-Complainant’s requests
for sanctions are GRANTED in the reduced, total amount of $2,760.00, inclusive
of costs, against Cross-Defendant and/or his counsel of record, Joseph
Gualderon of the Law Offices of Robyn S. Hosmer and Angel Chavez of Hanger,
Steinberg, Shapiro & Ash, jointly and severally. Sanctions to be paid to Cross-Complainant’s
counsel within 30 days. Sanctions are awarded in the amount of $690 per motion.
