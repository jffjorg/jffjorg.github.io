And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for a continuance of the trial from August 5, 2024, to February 5, 2025. The defendant argues that the parties need additional time to complete discovery and for settlement negotiations. The plaintiff does not oppose the request. The court finds that the defendant has not shown good cause for the continuance, as the parties have not demonstrated why discovery could not be completed before the current discovery cut-offs. The court believes that the parties still have time to complete the cited depositions within the months leading up to trial.
