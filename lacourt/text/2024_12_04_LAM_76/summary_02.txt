**Significant Statements**

* "A demurrer for uncertainty is properly sustained where the complaint is so vague or uncertain that the defendant cannot reasonably respond, i.e., when the defendant cannot determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts are directed against the defendant." (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc.)
* "The elements of the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress are: ‘ “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct. …” Conduct to be outrageous must be so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.’" (Catsouras v. Department of California Highway Patrol)
* "A landlord's failure to correct uninhabitable conditions may support a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress." (Stoiber v. Honeychuck)
