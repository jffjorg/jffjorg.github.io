ANALYSIS
Motion To Deem Admitted Requests For Admission
Defendant 600 Tower moves for an
order deeming admitted requests for admission served upon Plaintiff Thea
Samper, and for sanctions.
When a party to whom a request for
admissions are directed fails to respond, under Civ. Proc. Code § 2033.280(b) a
party propounding the request for admission may move for an order that the
truth of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted.  “The court shall make this order [deem
admitted], unless it finds that the party to whom the request for admissions
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the request for admission that is in substantial compliance with
section 2033.220.” (Civ. Proc. Code, § 2033.280(c).)  
As of the date this motion was
filed, Plaintiff had not served timely responses to requests for admission.
(Declaration of Elisa Wayne, ¶ 3.) As such, the motion to deem admitted
requests for admission is GRANTED.
Defendant’s request for sanctions
against Plaintiff Thea Samper is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $245. (1 hour
at $194/hour plus $60 filing fee—Wayne Decl., ¶ 4.) Sanctions are to be paid to
Defendant’s counsel within 20 days.
