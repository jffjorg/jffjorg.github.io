And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of the counsel for the plaintiffs, Crystal Calderon and Maria Esther Gonsalez, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The judge has concerns about the service and notice of the upcoming hearings. The counsel claims to have served the plaintiffs by mail, but the proof of service indicates electronic service, and the proposed orders suggest personal service. Additionally, the counsel has incorrectly stated the type of hearings scheduled for October 29, 2024. The judge orders the moving party to give notice and clarifies that the hearings are actually an OSC re Dismissal for Failure to Enter Default and a Trial Setting Conference, not an OSC and a Final Status Conference as claimed by the counsel.
