The Court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the
guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference
call.  
 
The Court has reviewed the Petition to Approve
Compromise of Disputed Claim of a Minor Valerie
Portugal (Age 15). There are a number of issues that must be
addressed before the Court can grant the petition:
 
(1)  Petition,
Item 13b.  Item 13b is only for costs. Fees
are (properly) listed separately in Item 13a. 
To avoid confusion and potential double counting, the request for $8,800
in attorney fees should be removed from Item 13b.
 
(2)  The reduction
agreements for medical services with the medical providers must be attached to
the petition.
 
(3)  There
is no proof of service showing that Defendants have been served with the
petition and proposed orders.
 
(4)  Order,
Item 8a(3) should list medical expenses.
 
(5)  Order,
Item 5 incorrectly states costs and fees amount to $2,221.43. 
 
 
Accordingly, the hearing on this
petition is CONTINUED so that Petitioner may correct these issues. 
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
