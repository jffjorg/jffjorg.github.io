And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's motion for relief from waiver of jury trial is granted. The Plaintiff had inadvertently failed to post jury fees in a timely manner, which resulted in the waiver of their right to a jury trial. However, the Judge finds that this waiver was not intentional and that no party would suffer undue or unfair prejudice from granting the motion. The Judge exercises its discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 631, subdivision (g), to grant relief from waiver and to allow a trial by jury. The Court notes that the Defendant has twice filed answers with demands for jury trial and that all parties have been preparing for a jury trial. The Court denies the Defendant's alternative request for a continuance of the trial date, finding that there is no good cause for a continuance.
