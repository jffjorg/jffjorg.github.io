 Case Number:  22STCV25497    Hearing Date:   October 7, 2024    Dept:  29 TENTATIVE
 
The motions to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs Crystal
Calderon and Maria Esther Gonsalez are DENIED without prejudice. There are
issues with service and notice of the upcoming hearings. Counsel states that he
served the clients by mail at their last known address and has been unable to
confirm it after efforts such as mailing the motion papers to their last known
address, return receipt requested. However, the proof of service attached to
all moving papers indicates only electronic service. Further, the proposed
orders indicate personal service. Lastly, counsel incorrectly and incompletely
states that the October 29, 2024 hearing is an OSC and a Final Status
Conference. The hearings are an OSC re Dismissal for Failure to Enter Default
and a Trial Setting Conference. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
