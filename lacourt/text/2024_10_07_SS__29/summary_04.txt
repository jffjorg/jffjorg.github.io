The Judge excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by phone or video conference instead. The Judge identifies several issues that need to be addressed before the petition can be granted, including removing the request for $8,800 in attorney fees from Item 13b, attaching reduction agreements for medical services, providing proof of service, and correcting errors in the proposed orders. As a result, the hearing on the petition is continued to allow the petitioner to correct these issues.
