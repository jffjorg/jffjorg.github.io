Significant Statements:
  - "The purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute." (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843)
  - "The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings." (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67)
  - "The Court liberally construes the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolves doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party." (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389)
  - "The Bartletts' ordinary use of their driveway (including crossing the sidewalk with their vehicles as they entered and exited their private, abutting property) does not constitute 'control' of the sidewalk sufficient to impose negligence liability against them."
