And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Cross-Defendants' motion for attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of $132,577.30. Cross-Defendants are entitled to attorney fees and costs because they were partially successful in their special motion to strike Lab Zero's claims. The judge reduces the amount of attorney fees and costs requested by Cross-Defendants based on the complexity of the case, the quality of services provided, and the attorneys' experience. The judge also reduces the amount of attorney fees and costs by $10,500 due to Cross-Defendants' unsuccessful attempt to strike one of Lab Zero's claims. The judge awards costs in the amount of $1,149.80. The judge declines to stay enforcement of the award pending completion of the remainder of the litigation.
