Simone Shah   CASE NO.:    23STCP03014   MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS    MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff and Judgment-Creditor Kyra Ackerman     RESPONDING PARTY:  Defendant and Judgment-Debtor Simone Shah     I. BACKGROUND  Kyra Ackerman (Ackerman) was employed by Dwell Management, LLC (Dwell Management) from 2016 to 2018.  Simone Shah (Shah) served as Dwell Management’s chief executive officer.  Shah later terminated Ackerman’s employment.  On April 25, 2018, Ackerman filed a claim with the Labor Commissioner to recover unpaid wages and penalties.  On November 18, 2021, the Labor Commissioner awarded Ackerman overtime wages of $22,383.38, interest of $8,235.86, and waiting penalties of $5,040.00, for a total of $35,659.24.  Notice of the Labor Commissioner’s award was given on January 12, 2022.   On January 27, 2022, Dwell Management and Shah (hereafter, Employers) appealed the decision in LASC Case No. 22STCP00292.   On January 30, 2023, the Employers dismissed the appeal with prejudice.  On the same day, dismissal of the appeal was entered and Ackerman was served with notice of the dismissal.   On June 23, 2023, Ackerman filed an Ex Parte Application for Order of Dismissal.  The court granted the ex parte application on June 26, 2023.  Ackerman served notice of the ruling on the same day.  On August 15, 2023, the Labor Commissioner’s decision became final.  On August 17, 2023, the Labor Commissioner filed a request in this court (Case No. 23STCP03014) for the clerk to enter judgment against Shah on the Labor Commissioner’s decision.1  Judgment was entered in favor of Ackerman and against Shah on August 18, 2023.  The Labor Commissioner served a Notice of Entry of Judgment on the parties on August 25, 2023.   On February 13, 2024, Ackerman filed this Motion for Attorneys’ Fees pursuant to Labor Code section 98.2.  Ackerman seeks an order awarding her attorneys’ fees in the amount of $52,776.25.  Shah filed an opposition.2  Ackerman replied.  The motion was heard on May 7, 2024.  In advance of the hearing, the court issued a tentative ruling granting in part Ackerman’s motion for attorney fees.  At the hearing, Shah argued the motion was untimely and cited Sanabria v. Embrey (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 422 for the first time in support of that position.  The court took the matter under submission.  The court did not issue a ruling.  On September 6, 2024, the parties appeared for a status conference.  The court set a briefing schedule for Ackerman’s motion for attorney fees and directed Shah to identify why fees and costs are not timely.3  The hearing was scheduled for October 21, 2024.  The parties have submitted supplemental briefing.  The court now rules as follows.  II. LEGAL STANDARDS   Labor Code section 98.2 sets forth the procedure to appeal a Labor Commissioner’s order, decision, or award.  It states, [w]ithin 10 days after service of notice of an order, decision, or award the parties may seek review by filing an appeal to the superior court, where the appeal shall be heard de novo. …. For purposes of computing the 10-day period after service,¿Section 1013 of the Code of Civil Procedure¿is applicable.”  (Lab. Code, § 98.2, subd. (a).)  “[I]f the appeal is withdrawn or dismissed without entry of judgment, the employer shall pay the amount owed pursuant to the order, decision, or award of the Labor Commissioner unless the parties have executed a settlement agreement for payment of some other amount, in which case the employer shall pay the amount that the employer is obligated to pay under the terms of the settlement agreement.”  (Lab. Code, § 98.2, subd. (b).)   Subdivision (c) concerns the award of attorney fees.  “If the party seeking review by filing an appeal to the superior court is unsuccessful in the appeal, the court shall determine the costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the other parties to the appeal, and assess that amount as a cost upon the party filing the appeal. An employee is successful if the court awards an amount greater than zero.”    The timeliness of a fee motion in a Labor Code section 98.2 case is governed by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702.  (See Stratton v. Beck (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 483, 491 (applying California Rules of Court, rule. 3.1702 to determine the timeliness of the fee motion).)    III. DISCUSSION   Typically, fee-shifting provisions are designed as rewards for success, to incentivize the filing of meritorious cases that might not otherwise make economic sense.  Labor Code section 98.2, subdivision (c) is the opposite sort of provision. It is designed as a punishment for the  filing of an unsuccessful appeal.  (See Arias v. Kardoulias (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 1429, 1435.)    In determining whether a fee award is proper, the question for the court is not who succeeded; the question is who didn’t.  The provision is also asymmetrical – it gives no specific definition of when an employer unsuccessfully appeals, but it does provide clarity as to an employee.  An employee only fails if the court awards him nothing after a full hearing on the appeal.  (Arias, 207 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1435-39.)  An employer, however, remains subject to the ordinary legal definitions that apply in other contexts; the employer is unsuccessful in the appeal if the appeal is dismissed at any point (not including jurisdictional grounds).  (Arneson v. Royal Pacific Funding Corp. (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 1275, 1277-80.)    Here, Shah (and Dwell Management) dismissed the appeal.  More specifically, the appeal was dismissed voluntarily and not jurisdictional grounds.  Shah was therefore unsuccessful in her appeal and became liable for the fees and costs incurred by Ackerman.  The court’s task is to determine if Ackerman’s requested fees are reasonable.    Shah challenges the timeliness of the motion.  The court initially found Ackerman’s motion was timely because it was filed within 180 days after entry of judgment.  “A notice of motion to claim attorney’s fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial court-including attorney’s fees on an appeal before the rendition of judgment in the trial court-must be served and filed within the time for filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited civil case or under rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited civil case.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1702(b)(1).)  California Rules of Court (CRC) rule 8.104(a)(1) further provides that “a notice of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of: (A) 60 days after the superior court clerk serves on the party filing the notice of appeal a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the judgment, showing the date either was served; (B) 60 days after the party filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the judgment, accompanied by proof of service; or (C) 180 days after entry of judgment.”   Upon review of the record of the supplemental briefing, the court agrees with Shah that the motion is untimely.  Sanabria v. Embrey (1996) 92 Cal.App.4th 422 is instructive.  There, the Court of Appeal stated in no uncertain terms that “the time the time for filing a motion for attorney fees commences upon service of notice of entry of dismissal.”  (Sanabria, supra, 92 Cal.App.4th at p. 427.)  The same holds true for a voluntary dismissal.  This is so because “[a] voluntary dismissal immediately resolves the action as to the dismissed defendant.”  (Id.)  So too here.  By voluntarily dismissing the appeal (which is the separately filed action Case No. 22STCP00292) on January 30, 2023, and serving notice of the entry of dismissal on that same day, the time for filing a motion for attorney fees commenced.  In other words, the voluntary dismissal terminated the appeal.  Ackerman thus had 60 days to file this motion for attorney fees for Shahs unsuccessful appeal but did so nearly a year later.  The motion is untimely.  But the late filing of the motion for attorney fees does not mean that Ackerman is precluded from recovering her reasonable attorney fees.¿ California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702(d)¿provides: “For good cause, the trial judge may extend the time for filing a motion for attorney's fees.”¿ The rule is “ ‘remedial’ and is to be given a liberal, rather than strict interpretation.”  (Lewow v. Surfside III Condominium Owners’ Assn., Inc. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 128, 135.)  The court may grant an extension of time even if the 60-day period has already expired.  (Id.)  A mistake of law may provide a good cause for the extension of time for filing a fees motion.  (Id.)  Here, the court finds good cause exists to extend the time for the filing of Ackerman’s fees motion.  Ackerman’s counsel was mistaken about the triggering event for timely filing the motion.  As discussed, Shah’s voluntary dismissal of the appeal, and not the entry of judgment (the Labor Commissioner’s order), started the clock.¿ The point, however, is debatable.  The case law does not clarify the application of Rule 3.1702 in this context—where the filing of an appeal of a Labor Commissioner’s order in a superior court divests the Labor Commissioner of jurisdiction.  For this reason, the court reaches the merits of Ackerman’s motion.   Reasonableness of the Fees¿ ¿ As indicated above, Ackerman is entitled to some award of attorney fees.¿ She requests $52,776.25, which is based upon hourly billing rates of $795, $750, and $250, total hours spent in this matter in the sum of 84.84 hours, and a 1.25 multiplier.¿  Hourly Rate¿ ¿ Attorneys Angel J. Horacek and Iryll Robbins-Umel and paralegal Ryan M. Kondyra worked on this matter.¿ They billed at hourly rates of $795, $750, and $250, respectively, and represented Ackerman on a contingency basis.¿ Shah argues the foregoing rates are excessive.¿¿ ¿ Appellate authority requires that the court take the inherent risk of contingency matters into account.¿ (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 394-395.)¿ The court may do so in one (and only one) of two ways: by fixing a somewhat larger hourly rate than it otherwise would, or else by awarding a multiplier.¿ (Id. at pp. 394-395.)¿ Multipliers are favored in cases that involve novel and difficult issues, call forth extraordinary skill from counsel, and otherwise prevent counsel from attending to other business. (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)¿ This case involves none of those factors. The court will account for the contingent nature of this litigation by fixing a larger hourly rate than it otherwise would.¿ ¿ Based upon general prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area for this type of litigation, and in consideration of the contingent nature of this litigation, the court finds the reasonable rate for Plaintiff’s counsel’s billing is as follows: for Lodestar purposes, the court will award a “blended” hourly rate of $725.00 per hour.¿ (See, e.g., Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240 [trial court has discretion to award a “blended hourly rate” for attorney’s fees motion].)¿ The court further finds the reasonable rate of Mr. Kondyra’s billing is $200.¿ Pursuant to Horsford, the court does not apply a multiplier.¿ ¿ Hours Expended¿ ¿ Ackerman seeks to recover to 38.8 hours in attorney time and 46.04 hours in paralegal time for the total time of 84.84 hours.¿¿¿ ¿ Shah argues that Ackerman should not be awarded for billing after the entry of judgment, which amounts to 42.77 hours.¿ Ackerman attributes much of this time to Shah’s failure to pay the judgment.¿ In response, Shah explains she was required to post an undertaking and takes the position that Ackerman should have asked the court to release the undertaking to satisfy the judgment.¿ This is backwards.¿ Ackerman obtained a judgment against Shah.¿ It was therefore Shah’s responsibility to pay the judgment.¿ ¿ Notwithstanding the foregoing, the court agrees that, generally, the hours expended are somewhat excessive.¿ After review of the bills presented as Exhibit B to the Declaration of Angel J. Horacek, Exhibit B to the Declaration of Iryll Robbins-Umel, and Exhibit A to the Declaration of Ryan Kondyra, the court finds the reasonable time expended is as follows: 35 hours for time expended by counsel and 35 hours for time expended by paralegal.¿¿¿  III.  CONCLUSION   Based on the foregoing, the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED.  Plaintiff and Judgment-Creditor Kyra Ackerman is awarded the total sum of $32,375.00, consisting of $25,375.00 in attorney fees and $7,000.00 in paralegal costs.  Moving party to give notice.       Dated:   October 21, 2024        ¿¿ ¿¿¿¿ ¿¿ ¿ Kerry Bensinger¿¿¿ ¿ Judge of the Superior Court¿¿
