And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorneys' fees filed by plaintiff Kyra Ackerman. The motion was filed after the defendant, Simone Shah, appealed the Labor Commissioner's award to the superior court, but the appeal was voluntarily dismissed. The judge finds that the motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 60 days after the appeal was dismissed. However, the judge also finds good cause to extend the time for filing the motion, as Ackerman's counsel was mistaken about the triggering event for timely filing.

The judge awards Ackerman attorneys' fees in the amount of $32,375.00, consisting of $25,375.00 in attorney fees and $7,000.00 in paralegal costs. The judge fixes a "blended" hourly rate of $725.00 per hour for Ackerman's counsel and $200.00 per hour for the paralegal. The judge does not apply a multiplier, as the case does not involve novel or difficult issues.

The judge's ruling is based on California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702, which governs the timing and procedures for filing a motion for attorneys' fees. The judge also relies on Labor Code section 98.2, which provides for the award of attorneys' fees to the prevailing party in a labor dispute.
