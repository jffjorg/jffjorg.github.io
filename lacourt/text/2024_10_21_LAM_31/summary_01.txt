And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to reopen discovery in this breach of contract case. The plaintiff, Baha Tan Toksoz, had entered into an oral lease agreement with the defendant, Chris Furie, for the purchase of a property in Los Angeles. The defendant had represented that he and his company were purchasing the property from its owner, Alex Goodson, and had directed the plaintiff to deposit $118,500 into escrow. However, the defendant had terminated the escrow and had forfeited the plaintiff's deposit as liquidated damages.

The defendant is seeking to take the deposition of David Illulian, the plaintiff's former landlord, to show that the plaintiff was untruthful in his dealings with the defendant. However, the court finds that the motion is not justified and that good cause does not exist to reopen discovery. The court notes that the defendant had failed to explain why Mr. Illulian's deposition was necessary and that the defendant had not shown what other purpose could be served by taking the deposition. The court also finds that the defendant had not demonstrated diligence in completing discovery and that the motion was filed at the last minute. Therefore, the court denies the motion to reopen discovery.
