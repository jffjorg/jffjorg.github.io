Farmers Insurance Exchange  CASE NO.:    24STCP01962    PETITION FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING UNDERINSURED MOTORIST ARBITRATION (C.C.P. § 1281.2)  MOVING PARTY: Petitioners Maria Botham, et al.  RESPONDING PARTY:  Respondent Farmers Insurance Exchange   I. INTRODUCTION  On June 10, 2021, a vehicle driven by Daniel Ibrahim Lazarnejad (Lazarnejad) collided into the home of Maria Botham (Maria), Georgia Botham (Georgia), and Lucia Botham (Lucia). The vehicle caught fire and exploded.  Lazarnejad died as a result of his injuries.  Maria, Georgia, and Lucia were at the house at the time of the incident.    As relevant here, Maria, Georgia, and Lucia (collectively, Petitioners) submitted an underinsured motorist (UIM) claim to their insurer, Farmers Insurance Exchange (Respondent), to recover for emotional distress damages.  Respondent denied coverage.    On May 15, 2024, Respondent filed a declaratory relief action in Case No. 24STCV12267.  Respondent seeks a declaration that Petitioner’ auto policy did not provide coverage for Petitioners’ injuries.  On June 18, 2024, Petitioners filed this Petition for an Order Compelling Underinsured Motorist Arbitration in this court.    The Petition was heard on September 18, 2024.  The court identified a potentially related case, Case No. 24STCV12267, which was filed on May 15, 2024.  That case is currently pending before Judge Elaine Lu in Department 26.  The court directed the parties to file a Notice of Related Case.    The parties have not properly complied with the court’s order.  A Notice of Related Case has been filed in this action and in Case No. 24STCV12267, but Respondent has requested that this court determine whether the cases are related.  As stated previously, Case No. 24STCV12267 is the lower numbered case.  ¿The trial judge in the low-numbered case, decides whether the cases are related.  (Harris v. Rojas (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 817, 820.)  Accordingly, the court will continue the matter once more to allow Department 26 to decide whether the cases are related.    II.  CONCLUSION  The petition is CONTINUED to November 27, 2024 at 8:30 AM.    Clerk of the court to give notice.     Dated:   October 21, 2024    ¿ ¿¿¿ ¿ ¿ Kerry Bensinger¿¿ ¿ Judge of the Superior Court¿
