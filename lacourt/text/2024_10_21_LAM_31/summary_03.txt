And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a vehicle collision and fire/explosion that resulted in the death of the driver and physical harm to three plaintiffs (Maria, Georgia, and Lucia). The plaintiffs submitted an underinsured motorist (UIM) claim to their insurer, Farmers Insurance Exchange, which was denied. The insurer then filed a declaratory relief action seeking a declaration that the plaintiffs' auto policy did not provide coverage for their injuries. The plaintiffs responded by filing a petition for an order compelling underinsured motorist arbitration. The case was heard on September 18, 2024, and the judge continued the matter to allow another department to decide whether the two cases are related. The judge has scheduled the next hearing for November 27, 2024, and has ordered the clerk to give notice.
