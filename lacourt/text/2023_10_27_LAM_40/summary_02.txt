And here's a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions: a motion for judgment on the pleadings against Defendant Bassam F. Sayegh and a motion to set aside default against Defendant RPM Brake Services, Inc.

The motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied, as the Court finds that the May 23, 2023 "Response" by Defendant Sayegh is not a legally sufficient answer to the complaint. The Court notes that Defendant Sayegh has been diligent in attempting to respond to the lawsuit and that equity does not call for permitting a default judgment request to proceed against him.

The motion to set aside default is granted, as the Court finds that Defendant Sayegh's mistake in filing a defective "Response" constitutes excusable neglect. The Court also finds that Defendant RPM Brake Services, Inc. has exercised diligence in attempting to ascertain what the law requires of them and that it is entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) and on equitable grounds. The July 12, 2023 entry of default against Defendant RPM Brake Services, Inc. is set aside, and the company is ordered to file its proposed verified answer within 10 court days.
