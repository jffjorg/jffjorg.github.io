Plaintiff Irven D.
  Mitchell’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings Against Defendant Bassam F.
  Sayegh; and
Defendant RPM
  Brake Services, Inc.’s Motion to Set Aside and/or Vacate Defaults Entered on
  July 12, 2023, Pursuant to CCP § 473(b) and on Equitable Grounds.



 
Background
On May 8, 2023, Plaintiff Irven
Mitchell—an 82-year-old individual—sued Defendants Bassam F. Sayegh, RPM Brake Services Inc., RPM Auto Service & Repair,
and Does 1 through 100 pursuant to a Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of
Written Contract, (2) Breach of Oral Agreement, (3) Breach of the Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (4) Rescission – Unjust Enrichment,
(5) Fraud in the Inducement, (6) Deceit (Promissory Fraud), (7) Financial Abuse
of Elder, (8) Conversion, (9) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
(IIED), and (10) Breach of Written Warranty.
The claims arise from allegations that Defendants—automobile repair
dealers—took advantage of Plaintiff’s impaired cognitive ability to twice
perform unnecessary repairs to Plaintiff’s classic car, causing Plaintiff an
out-of-pocket loss in the sum of $16,000, minus a $1,454 refund, for damages of
$14,546, plus costs related to the retention of experts and an attorney to
recover unjust amounts spent due to Defendants’ fraud and deceit.
On May 12, 2023, the Complaint, summons, and other documents were served
on Defendants RPM Brake Services Inc. and RPM Auto Service & Repair.
On May 18, 2023, the Complaint, summons, and other documents were served
on Defendant Sayegh.
On May 23, 2023, Defendant Sayegh filed a “Response to 23STCV10239” that
states, in full: “I am responding to Irven D. Mitchell (Case# 23STCV10239)
whose car I repaired in 2021. He is now suing, claiming that the repair was not
done properly. Bassam F. Sayegh.”
On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed proofs of service for all three
Defendants.
On June 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed amended proofs of service for all three
Defendants.
On July 12, 2023, Plaintiff secured entries of default against Defendants
RPM Brake Services Inc. and RPM Auto Service & Repair.
On August 3, 2023, Defendant RPM Brake Services, Inc. filed and served a
motion to set aside the default against it.
On August 18, 2023, Defendant Sayegh filed a substitution of attorney
indicating that Defendants Sayegh and RPM Brake Service, Inc. were to be
represented by David K. Dorenfeld of DorenfeldLaw, Inc.
On September 5, 2023, the Court held an Order to Show Cause (OSC) re:
Failure to File Proof of Service and Case Management Conference (CMC) hearing.
At that time, the Court noted that there was a motion to set aside default on
file and that Defendant Sayegh attempted to file a response that was not
legally entered as an Answer to the Complaint, and inquired whether Plaintiff
was agreeable to setting aside the default; Plaintiff’s counsel responded that
he was not. The OSC and CMC were continued to the hearing date on the motion, October
27, 2023.
On September 27, 2023, Defendant Sayegh filed a Verified Answer.
On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff opposed the motion to set aside.
On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff made a motion for judgment on the pleadings
(MJOP) against the May 23, 2023 “Response” by Defendant Sayegh.
On October 18, 2023, Defendant Sayegh opposed the MJOP.
On October 20, 2023, Defendant RPM Brake Services, Inc. replied to the
October 3rd opposition to its motion to set aside.
The motion to set aside default and MJOP are now before the Court.
The Court first discusses the MJOP
and then moves on to the analysis on the motion to set aside default.
 
Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings
Legal Standard
Either prior to trial or at the
trial—and barring statutory provisions otherwise—the plaintiff or the
Defendants may move for judgment on the pleadings where the appropriate ground
for such a motion is the same as that arguable by general demurrer, namely, the
failure to state a cause of action or defense. (Dobbins v. Hardister
(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 787, 791 A motion for JOP is used to challenge a pleading
in the same manner as a general demurrer—that is, the challenged pleading (1)
establishes that the court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction or (2)
does not allege facts sufficient to support a cause of action or defense. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1); see Marzec v. Public Empls. Ret. Sys. (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 889, 900; International Assn of Firefighters v. City of San
Jose (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1196.)
To sufficiently allege a cause of
action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that is, the facts
needed to establish each element of the cause of action pleaded. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey Savings & Loan
Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) In testing the sufficiency of the cause
of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)
Courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228,
disapproved on other grounds, Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership
(2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) However, this analysis “does not admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab
Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.) The face of the complaint includes exhibits
attached to the complaint. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d
91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts
in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc.
(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded by statute on other grounds as
stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
As with a demurrer, the grounds for
a motion for judgment on the pleadings must appear on the face of the pleading
or be based on facts capable of judicial notice. (Bufil v. Dollar Fin. Grp.
(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1202, disapproved on other grounds in Noel v.
Thrifty Payless, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 955, 985-986, fn. 15.) The only
significant difference between the two motions is that a motion for judgment on
the pleadings is brought after the time to file a general demurrer has expired.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (f); Caldera Pharms. v. Regents of the Univ.
of Cal. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 338, 350; International Assn of
Firefighters v. City of San Jose, supra, at p. 1196.)
Order Granting Judgment on the
Pleadings: DENIED.
In his MJOP, Plaintiff Mitchell seems
to challenge the May 23, 2023 “Response” by Defendant Sayegh as an answer to
the Complaint, i.e., a pleading subject to a sufficiency challenge. Plaintiff
argues that the “Response” is defective and that equity calls for permitting a
default judgment request to proceed against Defendant Sayegh. (MJOP, pp. 3-5.)
In opposition, Defendant Sayegh
argues that the MJOP does not present arguments on which MJOP relief may be
granted. Defendant Sayegh also argues that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer
prior to the filing of this motion and that the motion is, in effect, mooted by
the filing of the September 27, 2023 Verified Answer. (Opp’n to MJOP, pp. 1-2.)
No reply is on file.
The Court finds in favor of
Defendant Sayegh.
On September 5, 2023, the Court
indicated to the parties that the June 23, 2023 “Response” by Defendant Sayegh
was “not legally entered as an Answer,” i.e., Defendant Sayegh’s filing did not
constitute a pleading in response to the Complaint. The record thereafter fails
to reflect that Plaintiff Mitchell sought an entry of default against Defendant
Sayegh. In turn, Defendant Sayegh filed a Verified Answer on September 27,
2023. Under these circumstances, the MJOP challenges a filing that the Court never
accepted as an Answer, i.e., a pleading that can be subject to a sufficiency
challenge. For this reason, the MJOP lacks merit.
The Court also notes that Defendant
Sayegh has been diligent, before and after retaining counsel, in attempting to respond
to this action. As a result, even had an entry of default been entered against
him, grounds would exist under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 to relieve
him from that default.
In conclusion, Plaintiff Mitchell’s
MJOP is DENIED.
 
Motion
to Set Aside Default
Legal Standard
Section 473 subdivision (b) of the
Code of Civil Procedure provides for both discretionary and mandatory relief
from a judgment, dismissal, and/or order or other proceeding taken against a
party through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b) [mandatory relief more narrowly targeted to
defaults, default judgments, and dismissals]; Pagnini v. Union Bank, N.A.
(2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 298, 302.)
The discretionary provision of
section 473, subdivision (b), states in pertinent part that “[t]he court may,
upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against
him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect” and that “the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).)
Order Setting Aside and/or
Vacating Default: GRANTED.
In its motion, Defendant RPM Brake
Services, Inc. argues that it is entitled to an order setting aside and/or
vacating the default on statutory and equitable grounds. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 473, subd. (b).) As background, the motion explains that Defendant Sayegh is
RPM Brake’s sole officer and director, that the Complaint, summons, and other
documents for this lawsuit were found by him in front of his business address
on Robertson Blvd, and that none of Defendants’ employees were served with the
papers. The motion also explains that the May 23, 2023 “Response” by Defendant
Sayegh was made on his and RPM Brake’s behalf and that Sayegh was unaware of
service requirements for his “Response” or the fact that leaving documents on
the floor in front of his offices did not constitute service of the summons and
Complaint. 
Based on these facts, Defendant RPM
Brake Services, Inc. argues that it is entitled to statutory relief against
default based on improper service—i.e., leaving the service documents on the
floor in front of his offices. RPM Brake Services, Inc. also argues that the
entry of default against it is a result of a failure by Defendant Sayegh to
understand that his May 23, 2023 “Response” did not include RPM Brake,
constituting a failure to respond to the Complaint as a result of a mistake.
Last, Defendant RPM Brake Services, Inc. notes that it has acted diligently to
address default. (Set Aside Mot., pp. 4-7; see Set Aside Mot., Sayegh Decl., ¶¶
1-8 & Dorenfeld Decl., ¶¶ 1-5.)
In opposition, Plaintiff attempts
to rebut these positions. Plaintiff argues that the mandatory provision of
section 473, subdivision (b) is not available here, with which the Court
agrees. Plaintiff next makes a variety of arguments against relief. These
include arguments that: service was properly effected on RPM Brake Services,
Inc. by substituted service at the Robertson address; Defendants have acted
improperly, e.g., Defendants’ employee shoving Plaintiff’s process server;
Defendant Sayegh was aware of this lawsuit based on various mailings to the
Robertson address; any failure to respond to the Complaint by RPM Brake
Services, Inc. cannot be based on inexcusable neglect insofar as Defendant
Sayegh’s ignorance of the law is not a ground for relief; the three elements
for extrinsic mistake are not met here; Defendant Sayegh should face Code of
Civil Procedure section 1209 sanctions (contempt proceedings); Defendants have
attempted to avoid service of settlement offers; the June 23, 2023 “Response”
was defective; Defendants should not be allowed to play “fast and loose” with
the law; and Defendant Sayegh’s Answer should be stricken, among other things. (Set
Aside Opp’n, pp. 2-9.)
In reply, Defendant RPM Brake
Services, Inc. reiterates its motion arguments in support of relief under
section 473, subdivision (b) and on equitable grounds. (Set Aside Reply, pp.
1-3.) 
The Court
finds in favor of Defendant RPM Brake Services, Inc.
The
Court is satisfied that Defendant Sayegh’s misimpression as to whether the June
23, 2023 “Response” applied to him and Defendant RPM Brake Services, Inc. constitutes
excusable neglect that put Defendants under the mistaken impression that they
had answered the Complaint, however defective the “Response” may have been. Indeed,
the result in this case is consistent with public policy in the state regarding
judgments. “[D]uring the period when relief under section 473 is available,
there is a strong public policy in favor of granting relief and allowing the
requesting party their day in court. Beyond the period when relief under section
473 is available, there is a strong public policy in favor of the finality of
judgments and only in exceptional circumstances should relief be granted.” (In
re Marriage of Stevenot (1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 1051, 1071; Rappleyea v.
Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 981-982 [quoting same].) 
The
Court also finds Plaintiff’s reference to Kramer v. Traditional Escrow, Inc.
(2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 13, 31 unconvincing. While the June 23, 2023
“Response” was defective, Defendants have generally exercised diligence in
responding to this lawsuit through that response and subsequently securing
counsel. (Set Aside Mot., Sayegh Decl., ¶¶ 2-8.) This new counsel has attempted
to obtain a stipulation to set aside the default, which Plaintiff’s counsel has
refused. (Set Aside Mot., Dorenfeld Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.) The timeline in this case
supports a finding of diligence: The complaint was filed on May 8, 2023;
service was effected on RPM Brake Services on May 12, 2023; a “response” was
filed on May 23, 2023 by defendant Sayegh, who is the sole officer and director
of RPM Brake Services, Inc.; entry of default of RPM Brake Services, Inc. was
entered on July 12, 2023; a motion to set aside the default was filed on August
3, 2023, and a Verified Answer was filed by defendant Sayegh on September 27,
2023. 
Based
on these circumstances, the Court cannot say that Defendants have not exercised
diligence in attempting to ascertain what the law requires of them.
Defendant
RPM Brake Services, Inc.’s motion is thus GRANTED. 

Conclusion
Plaintiff Irven D. Mitchell’s
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings Against Defendant Bassam F. Sayegh is DENIED.
Defendant RPM Brake Services,
Inc.’s Motion to Set Aside and/or Vacate Defaults Entered on July 12, 2023,
Pursuant to CCP § 473(b) and on Equitable Grounds is GRANTED.
The July 12, 2023 entry of default
against Defendant RPM Brake Services, Inc. is SET ASIDE.
Defendant RPM Brake Services, Inc.
is ORDERED to file its proposed Verified Answer—attached as Exhibit C to the
Dorenfeld declaration—within 10 court days of this ruling.
