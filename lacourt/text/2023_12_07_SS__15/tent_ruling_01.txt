  Case Number:  22STCV30677    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION TO QUASHOn July 28, 2023,
Plaintiffs Lucille Lazio and John Lazio filed this action alleging that Lucille
Lazio developed malignant mesothelioma as a result of exposure from asbestos in
products from Cover Girl, Revlon, and Estee Lauder.  (Opposition at p.1.)  On October 26, 2023, Defendant Cosmetic
Specialties Inc. filed its motion to quash service of summons for lack of
personal jurisdiction. 
A
defendant may move to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)  The court may dismiss without prejudice the
complaint in whole, or as to that defendant, when dismissal is made pursuant to
Section 418.10.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 581,
subd. (h).)
"A
court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent
with the Constitution of this state or of the United States."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 410.10.)  "The Due Process Clause protects an
individual's liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of
a forum with which he has established no meaningful 'contacts, ties, or
relations."'  (Burger King Corp.
v. Rudzewicz (1985) 471 U.S. 462, 471-472.)  A state court may not exercise personal
jurisdiction over a party under circumstances that would offend
"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice."  (Asahi Metal Industry Co., Ltd., v.
Superior Court of California, Solano County (1987) 480 U.S. 102, 113.)
When
a defendant moves to quash service of process on jurisdictional grounds, the
plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise
of jurisdiction.  (Jayone Foods, Inc.
v. Aekyung Industrial Co. Ltd. (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 543, 553.)  Once facts showing minimum contacts with the
forum state are established, the defendant has the burden to demonstrate the
exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.  (Ibid.)  "The plaintiff must provide specific
evidentiary facts, through affidavits and other authenticated documents,
sufficient to allow the court to independently conclude whether jurisdiction is
appropriate. [Citation.]  The plaintiff
cannot rely on allegations in an unverified complaint or vague and conclusory
assertions of ultimate facts.  [Citation.]"
 (Strasner v. Touchstone Wireless
Repair & Logistics, LP (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 215, 222.)
A
defendant is subject to a state's general jurisdiction if its contacts
"are so continuance and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home
in the forum State."  (Daimler AG
v. Bauman (2014) 571 U.S. 117, 127.)  A nonresident defendant may be subject to the
specific jurisdiction of the forum "if the defendant has purposefully
availed himself or herself of forum benefits [citation], and the 'controversy
is related to or "arises out of' a defendant's contacts with the forum.'
[Citations.]"  (Vons Companies,
Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 446.)  This test does not require a "causal
relationship between the defendant's in-state activity and the
litigation."  (Ford Motor Co. v.
Montana Eighth Judicial District Court (2021) 141 S.Ct. 1017, 1026.) The
"arise out" of standard "asks about causation," but
"relate to" does not.  (Ibid.)
 "[W]hen a corporation has
'continuously and deliberately exploited [a State's] market, it must reasonably
anticipate being haled into [that State's] court[s]' to defend actions 'based
on' products causing injury there."  (Id. at p. 1027.)
"In
a case raising liability issues, a California court will have personal
jurisdiction over a successor company if (1) the court would have had personal
jurisdiction over the predecessor, and (2) the successor company effectively
assumed the subject liabilities of the predecessor."  (CenterPoint Energy, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1101, 1120.) 
Defendant provided
evidence that it is incorporated and has its principle place of business in New
Jersey.  (Katerndahl Decl., Exs. C, D; Grexa
Decl., ¶ 5.)  Therefore, it is not a resident
of California and not subject to its general jurisdiction. Plaintiffs do not
argue otherwise. 
Defendant argues that it
has never engaged in business in California.  (Motion at pp. 9-10.)  
Plaintiffs contend
Defendant facilitated supply of asbestos-containing talc in California which
was used to manufacture talcum powder and cosmetic products, including Cover
Girl, Revlon, and Estee Lauder products.  (Opposition at p. 4.)  Plaintiffs cite evidence that Defendant distributed
talc used to make cosmetics.  (Opposition
at p. 2; Gamble Decl., Ex. B at pp. 36:25-37:1, 37:19-25.)  On December 1, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
additional evidence that they contend shows Defendant distributed talc in
California.  
The motion is CONTINUED
to January 10, 2023 at 9 a.m.  Defendant
may file a response to Plaintiffs’ new evidence by January 3, 2023.
            The
moving party is to give notice.
