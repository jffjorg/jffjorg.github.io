And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash service of summons filed by Port Jervis Laboratories, Inc. (Defendant) on the grounds that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it. The Defendant argues that it does not do business in California and the plaintiff's claims do not arise out of or relate to its contacts with California. The Plaintiff, Alicia Miranda Bojorquz, claims that she developed mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos in products from various defendants, including the Defendant.

The judge notes that the Plaintiff has not disputed the lack of general jurisdiction over the Defendant, and the Defendant has presented evidence showing that it does not have an office, employees, or property in California and does not design, make, or sell products in California.

However, the Plaintiff has submitted evidence that the Defendant had facilities in California during the time of exposure. The judge finds that the Plaintiff needs to identify the specific products she used and the time period she used them before conducting jurisdictional discovery. The motion is continued to March 7, 2023, at 9 a.m., and the parties may file supplemental opposition and reply briefs on regular notice.
