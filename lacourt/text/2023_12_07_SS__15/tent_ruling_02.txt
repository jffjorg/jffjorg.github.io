 Case Number:  23STCV21311    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION TO QUASHOn September 6,
2023, Plaintiffs filed this action alleging that Otilia Rosas developed
mesothelioma as a result of exposure from asbestos from asbestos-containing
products.  On October 26, 2023, Defendant
Cosmetic Specialties, Inc. filed its motion to quash service of summons for
lack of personal jurisdiction. 
A
defendant may move to quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).)  The court may dismiss without prejudice the
complaint in whole, or as to that defendant, when dismissal is made pursuant to
Section 418.10.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 581,
subd. (h).) 
"A
court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent
with the Constitution of this state or of the United States."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 410.10.)  "The Due Process Clause protects an
individual's liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of
a forum with which he has established no meaningful 'contacts, ties, or
relations."'  (Burger King Corp.
v. Rudzewicz (1985) 471 U.S. 462, 471-472.)  A state court may not exercise personal
jurisdiction over a party under circumstances that would offend
"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice."  (Asahi Metal Industry Co., Ltd., v.
Superior Court of California, Solano County (1987) 480 U.S. 102, 113.)
When
a defendant moves to quash service of process on jurisdictional grounds, the
plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise
of jurisdiction.  (Jayone Foods, Inc.
v. Aekyung Industrial Co. Ltd. (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 543, 553.)  Once facts showing minimum contacts with the
forum state are established, the defendant has the burden to demonstrate the
exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable. (Ibid.)  "The plaintiff must provide specific
evidentiary facts, through affidavits and other authenticated documents,
sufficient to allow the court to independently conclude whether jurisdiction is
appropriate. [Citation.] The plaintiff cannot rely on allegations in an
unverified complaint or vague and conclusory assertions of ultimate facts.  [Citation.]”  (Strasner v. Touchstone Wireless Repair
& Logistics, LP (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 215, 222.)
A
defendant is subject to a state's general jurisdiction if its contacts
"are so continuance and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home
in the forum State."  (Daimler AG
v. Bauman (2014) 571 U.S. 117, 127.)  A nonresident defendant may be subject to the
specific jurisdiction of the forum "if the defendant has purposefully
availed himself or herself of forum benefits [citation], and the 'controversy
is related to or “arises out of” a defendant's contacts with the forum.'  [Citations.]"  (Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods,
Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 446.)  This
test does not require a "causal relationship between the defendant's
in-state activity and the litigation." (Ford Motor Co. v. Montana
Eighth Judicial District Court (2021) 141 S.Ct. 1017, 1026.)  The "arise out" of standard
"asks about causation," but "relate to" does not. (Ibid.)
 "[W]hen a corporation has
'continuously and deliberately exploited [a State's] market, it must reasonably
anticipate being haled into [that State's] court[s]' to defend actions 'based
on' products causing injury there."  (Id. at p. 1027.)
"In
a case raising liability issues, a California court will have personal
jurisdiction over a successor company if (1) the court would have had personal
jurisdiction over the predecessor, and (2) the successor company effectively
assumed the subject liabilities of the predecessor."  (CenterPoint Energy, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1101, 1120.)
Defendant provided
evidence that it is incorporated and headquartered in New Jersey.  (Katerndahl Decl., Exs. C, D; Grexa Decl., ¶
5.)  Therefore, it is not a resident of
California and not subject to its general jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs do not argue otherwise. 
Defendant argues that it
has not engaged in business in California.  (Motion at p. 11.)  
Plaintiffs contend
Defendant supplied talc to Avon Products, Inc., which had facilities in
California.  (Opposition at p. 1; Seitz
Decl., Ex. 2 at pp. 61-63; Katerndahl Decl., Ex. A at p. 22.)  As evidence, Plaintiffs filed an excerpt from
the deposition of Gina Grant about Avon at one time having a manufacturing
facility in Pasadena, California and the Preliminary Fact Sheet generally
identifying “various” Avon product(s).  (Seitz
Decl., Ex. 2 at pp. 61-63; Katerndahl Decl., Ex. B. at p. 2.)  Plaintiffs do not identify the specific Avon
products Otilia Rosas used or the time period she used those products.
Plaintiffs state they
need jurisdictional discovery.  Defendant
does not object to jurisdictional discovery and a continuance.  Therefore, the motion is CONTINUED to March 7,
2024 at 9 a.m. to allow for jurisdictional discovery.  First, Plaintiffs are to identify the specific
Avon products Otilia Rosas used and the time period she used those
products.  Then, Plaintiffs may take
discovery into Defendant’s activities in California in connection with the
types of Avon products Otilia Rosas during the time period she used them.  The parties may file supplemental opposition
and reply briefs according to the statutory schedule. 
            The
moving party is to give notice.
