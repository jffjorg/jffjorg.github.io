Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to quash service of summons filed by defendant Cosmetic Specialties Inc. in a case alleging that plaintiff Lucille Lazio developed malignant mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos in products from Cover Girl, Revlon, and Estee Lauder. The defendant argues that it is not subject to personal jurisdiction in California because it is incorporated and has its principle place of business in New Jersey, and has never engaged in business in California. The plaintiffs argue that the defendant facilitated the supply of asbestos-containing talc in California, which was used to manufacture cosmetic products. The judge notes that the defendant has provided evidence that it is not a resident of California, and the plaintiffs do not argue otherwise. The motion is continued to January 10, 2023, at 9 a.m., and the defendant may file a response to the new evidence by January 3, 2023.
