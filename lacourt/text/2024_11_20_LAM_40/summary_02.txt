And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The case arises from the defendant's warranty obligations issued in connection with the plaintiff's purchase of a 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander. The plaintiff alleges that the vehicle developed serious defects and nonconformities that the defendant failed to repair.

The defendant sought to compel arbitration based on an arbitration provision in a lease agreement signed by the plaintiff with a dealership, Toyota of Riverside. However, the judge found that the defendant is not a party to the lease agreement and therefore cannot enforce the arbitration provision.

The judge also rejected the defendant's argument that it can enforce the arbitration provision as a third-party beneficiary of the lease agreement. The judge held that the defendant must show that the lease agreement was made expressly for the benefit of the defendant, which it did not do.

The judge also rejected the defendant's contention that the California Supreme Court's opinion in Sanchez v. Valencia Holding Co., LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 899 supports its position.

The judge's tentative ruling is based on several California and federal laws, including the California Code of Civil Procedure, the California Civil Code, and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). The judge also cited several California appellate court decisions, including Thomas v. Westlake (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 605, Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324, and Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958.
