Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint adding all partners as defendants in the dissolution claims. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached a 2015 written contract, forged and transferred the plaintiff's interest in Kellytoy Worldwide, Inc. and Hamilton Towers, LP, and distributed funds without the plaintiff's knowledge or consent. The plaintiff seeks to add all partners as defendants in the dissolution claims because they have an interest in the litigation and are indispensable parties. The judge finds that the plaintiff's motion is timely and will not result in prejudice to the defendants, and that permitting the amendment will bring all necessary parties before the court and promote judicial efficiency. The judge also takes off calendar the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, Citrin Cooperman & Company, LLP, as the proposed pleading supersedes the first amended complaint.
