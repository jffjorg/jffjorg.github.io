Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike parts of the Third Amended Complaint filed by the defendant, Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC and Gulf Harbour Investments Corp. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiff, Denise R. Birtch, alleging breach of contract, fraudulent concealment, unfair business practices, and declaratory relief.

The Judge grants the motion to strike in part, denying the request to strike allegations related to punitive damages. The Judge finds that the plaintiff has remedied the issues previously identified by alleging conduct that was perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by an officer of the defendant Gulf Harbour.

The Judge also grants the motion to strike paragraphs 38 and 57 of the Third Amended Complaint, finding that these paragraphs contain legal conclusions rather than ultimate facts. The Judge denies the motion to strike paragraph 34, finding that it alleges conduct that was perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by an officer of the defendant Gulf Harbour.

The Judge orders the defendants to file an answer to the Third Amended Complaint within 21 days, unless they have already done so. The Judge also orders the moving parties to give notice of the ruling, unless waived.
