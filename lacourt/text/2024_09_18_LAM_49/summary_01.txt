And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $74,700. This amount is based on the lodestar method, which takes into account the number of hours reasonably spent on the appeal and the reasonable hourly rate. The judge has determined that the reasonable hourly rate for this case is $750 per hour. The judge has also found that the time spent by the plaintiff's attorney on the appeal was reasonable and recoverable. The motion for attorney's fees was opposed by the defendants, who argued that it was untimely and that the plaintiff had engaged in "block billing." However, the judge has rejected these arguments and found that the motion was properly filed and that the plaintiff's billing records were reasonable.
