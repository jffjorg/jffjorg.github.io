  Case Number:  20STCV42456    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2024    Dept:  49 Immigrant Rights Defense Counsel v. Luther Linton, et al.MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense CounselRESPONDING PARTY(S): Defendants Brandi Linton and Pecorelli Enterprises STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:Plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Counsel filed this action against Defendants Brandi Linton, Luther Linton, and Pecorelli Enterprises, alleging violations of the Immigration Consultant Act.  Defendant Luther Linton was dismissed on August 13, 2021.After a bench trial on March 7 and 8, 2022, the court issued an informal statement of decision on April 7, 2022, finding in favor of Plaintiff. Judgment for Plaintiff and against Defendants was entered on April 29, 2022.  The court permanently enjoined Defendants from violating the Immigration Consultants Act for a period of ten years.Plaintiff now moves to recover attorney’s fees on a second appeal.  Defendants opposed.TENTATIVE RULING:Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the total amount of $74,700, as requested.Plaintiff is to file and serve a [Proposed] Amended Judgment consistent with this and the prior rulings of this court.Plaintiff is ordered to give notice, unless waived.  DISCUSSION:Motion for Attorney’s FeesA. Attorney’s Fees Are Recoverable on an Appeal Under the ICAThe Immigration Consultants Act (“ICA”) provides that a party who claims a violation of the ICA and prevails in the action “shall recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.” (Bus. & Prof. Code § 22446.5(b).) As a general rule, “ ‘ [a] statute authorizing an attorney fee award at the trial court level includes appellate attorney fees unless the statute specifically provides otherwise.’ ” (Rancho Mirage Country Club Homeowners Assn. v. Hazelbaker (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 252, 265 [emphasis added].) The ICA does not “specifically provide[]” an exception to the general rule that attorney’s fees authorized by statute includes those incurred on appeal.  (See Rancho Mirage Country Club Homeowners Assn., supra, 2 Cal.App.5th at 265.) Accordingly, Plaintiff is once again entitled to its reasonable attorney fees and costs after “prevailing” on appeal.  (See Bus. & Prof. Code § 22446.5(b).) It is irrelevant that the Court of Appeal’s decision only mentioned “costs.” (Butler-Rupp v. Lourdeaux (2007) 154 Cal. App. 4th 918, 927 [“a decision about the entitlement to costs on appeal is entirely separate from a decision about the entitlement to attorney fees on appeal”].)B. The Court Rejects All of Defendant’s Timeliness or Technical ArgumentsDefendants contend that the motion for fees were “untimely,” since the Plaintiff did not file “an amended memorandum of costs” in a timely manner.  Additionally, Defendant notes that in the memorandum of costs on appeal which was filed by Plaintiff, “IRDC does not claim costs for attorneys [sic] fees anywhere on the memorandum of costs.”  (Defendants’ Opposition, 4:24 to 5:9.)These points are simply specious and of no consequence.  Plaintiff has, in fact, properly and timely filed a motion for attorney’s fees on appeal in this case.C. Determination of Reasonable FeeThe determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial courts.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.)  “The determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar work.’”  (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 603, 615.) The Court has broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.  The Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)D. Reasonable Hourly RatePlaintiff seeks an hourly rate of $750 per hour for all work on the appeal. (Medvei Decl. ¶ 7.) When awarding attorney’s fees on the first appeal, this court found that $500 per hour was the appropriate rate. (See 04/27/2023 Final Ruling.) That fee award occurred over a year-and-half ago. The first appeal also did not involve nearly as much substantive work, nor require any serious expertise, when compared to the second appeal. Therefore, a higher award is now justified.  Based on the prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area, the complexity of the case, and the quality of services provided, the court will now award a reasonable hourly rate of $750.00 per hour. E.  Hours Reasonably IncurredThe fee award “should ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent, including those relating solely to the fee.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal. 4th 1122, 1133 [emphasis in the original].) In his declaration, Attorney Medvei attests to a total of 99.6 hours spent on the appeal. (Medvei Decl. ¶ 7.) The bulk of the work included preparation of two motions to dismiss and a brief on the merits. "[I]t is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged [within the moving party’s verified billing invoice], with a sufficient argument and citations to evidence.”  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.) Defendants oppose the motion, arguing generally that Plaintiff has engaged in “block billing.” But Defendant has not pointed to any particular task in the billing records that it contends is excessive or unreasonable.Here, considering the totality of the circumstances—including the complexity of the appeal, the quality of the work, and the appeal’s success—the court finds the time requested was reasonable and recoverable.Accordingly, utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, this court finds and awards $74,700 in attorney’s fees, calculated by multiplying a rate of $750 per hour times 99.6 hours.
