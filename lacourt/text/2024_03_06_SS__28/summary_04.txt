And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for terminating sanctions filed by the Cross-Defendants, Estate of Westin Lee Stewart, Deceased, and Nancy Stewart, against Audrey Forte. The Cross-Defendants are seeking terminating sanctions against Forte for failing to comply with court orders. Forte filed an untimely opposition to the motion, stating that she had mistakenly believed she had served the responses to the requests for production of documents. The judge has denied the Cross-Defendants' request for terminating sanctions, but has awarded additional monetary sanctions of $430.00 against Forte for her delay in complying with the court's November 28, 2023 order. The judge has ordered Forte and her counsel to pay the sanctions by April 5, 2024.
