 Case Number:  21STCV13660    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  28 I. Motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission Having  considered the moving and opposing papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On April  12, 2021, Plaintiff Menajoyrie Melentha Francis Webster (“Plaintiff”) filed  this action against Defendants Ramiro Montiel Lopez (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20  for motor vehicle tort, general negligence, and emotional distress.  On  April 3, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.  On  November 22, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to deem admitted matters specified  in requests for admission and for sanctions, to be heard on March 6, 2024.  On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a response.  Trial  is currently scheduled for April 29, 2024.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Defendant  asks the Court to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission,  set one, and award sanctions.  Plaintiff  asks the Court to deny the motion and deny the sanctions request.  LEGAL STANDARD             Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides:  “If a party to whom requests for admission are  directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:  “(a) The party to whom the requests for admission  are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on  privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing  with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this  waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are  satisfied:   “(1) The party has subsequently served a response  that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and  2033.230.   “(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely  response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.   “(b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the  truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as  for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section  2023.010).   “(c) The court shall make this order, unless it  finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has  served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests  for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is  mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing  with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to  serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”   (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2033.280.)   DISCUSSION   On April  4, 2023, Defendant served requests for admission, set one, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff served unverified  responses on July 31, 2023.  However,  Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not provide timely verified responses and  had not provided verified responses by the time Defendant filed the motion to  deem admitted matters specified in the requests for admission.  In  her response, Plaintiff asserts that she served a verification on March 4, 2024.  Plaintiff has attached a copy of a signed  verification with a proof of service dated March 3, 2024.  Because  Plaintiff has provided evidence that she served a verification before the  hearing on the motion, the Court denies the request to deem admitted matters  specified in the requests for admission.  Sanctions  are mandatory under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c).  Defendant requests $1,155.00 in sanctions based  on seven hours of attorney time at a rate of $165.00 per hour.  The Court awards sanctions of $330.00 based  on two hours of attorney time.  CONCLUSION            The Court DENIES Defendant Ramiro Montiel Lopez’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in  requests for admission, set one.            The Court GRANTS Defendant  Ramiro Montiel Lopez’s request for sanctions and orders Plaintiff Menajoyrie  Melentha Francis Webster and her counsel to pay Defendant Ramiro Montiel Lopez $330.00 by April 5, 2024.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.

the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for
inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice. “(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with

the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against
the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the

justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. “(2) On motion of any other party who, in person or by
attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the deposition notice in
the expectation that the deponent’s testimony would be taken, the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)

deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the
