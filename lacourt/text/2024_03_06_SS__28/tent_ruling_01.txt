(“Cooper”), Nbalia Soumah, D.O. (“Soumah”), and Does 1-250 for negligence,

and Soumah filed an answer. 
On
June 1, 2020, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include Defendant Glenn Mark

On

claim with prejudice at Plaintiffs’ request. 
On
October 20, 2020, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include Defendant Healthcare
Partners Medical Group, Inc. as Doe 101 (“Healthcare Partners”).  On July 13, 2021, the Court dismissed Healthcare

On
September 22, 2021, the Court granted Grossman’s motion for summary
judgment.  On November 5, 2021, the Court

On
February 8, 2024, Petitioner Karla Alvarez (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for approval
of minor’s compromise to be heard on March 6, 2024. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for October 7, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Karla Alvarez asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of
Plaintiff Ellie Alvarez (“Claimant”). 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION         
In
Section 11 of the petition, Petitioner checked the boxes for both 11a and 11b.  The checking of the box for Section 11a appears to be an
error. 
In
Section 12 of the petition, Petitioner did not list the amount of Claimant’s
total medical expenses in Section 12a(1). 
However, in Section 12a(2) Petitioner stated that $120,001.00 of Claimant’s
medical expenses were paid.  (This figure
is inconsistent with Section 12b(4), which states that Medi-Cal paid
$160,004.00, and Section 12b(5)(b)(ii), which states that Equian for Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Illinois paid $4,616.58)  In Section 12a(3) Petitioner states that
Claimant’s total medical expenses were reduced by $29,556.75 as the result of
negotiated, contractual, or statutory reductions.  In Section 12a(4), Petitioner did not state
the amount to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  (However, in Section 16b, Petitioner stated
that $149,557.75 in medical expenses
would be paid from the settlement proceeds and Section 12b(5)(b) lists amounts
to be paid from the settlement proceeds.) 
In Section 12a(5), Petitioner listed liens of $149,557.75. 
Petitioner
must provide the information requested in Section 12a, keeping in mind that the
Court cannot approve a petition for minor’s compromise unless it shows that all
medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed
from the settlement proceeds. 
In
Section 16d of the petition, Petitioner states that $103,776.25 in
non-medical and non-attorney's fees expenses are to be paid from the proceeds
of the settlement. Petitioner should explain the basis for this figure given
that counsel is requesting only $60,000.00 in costs. 
CONCLUSION    
          The Court DENIES the petition filed by Petitioner Karla
Alvarez on February 8, 2024, without prejudice. 
          Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
