And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the documents submitted in support of default judgments and rules as follows. Plaintiff Walter Moore seeks to enter default judgments against Defendants Bionicos Genesis, Inc., Jesus Rodriguez, and Rosie Quezada for negligence and premises liability. The court denies Plaintiff's applications for default judgment against all three defendants without prejudice. The court finds that Plaintiff has not provided a sufficient calculation of interest, and Plaintiff must submit a separate declaration supporting each default judgment packet. Plaintiff is also ordered to provide a summary and list of medical expenses and special damages, and to submit a copy of the statement of damages served on Quezada. The court orders Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
