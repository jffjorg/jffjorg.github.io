LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Default judgment 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and
the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A memorandum
of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal
of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a).) 
B.   Damages 
          “Where a cause of action is stated in the complaint, plaintiff
merely needs to introduce evidence establishing a prima facie case for damages.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶
5:213.1, p. 5-56 (Cal. Practice Guide), citing Johnson v. Stanhiser
(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361 [trial court erred in applying preponderance of the
evidence standard].) 
          The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's
default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or, for personal
injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the amount
listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a), 585,
subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494 (Becker).) The statute insures that “defendants in cases
which involve a default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may
be taken against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is
demanded is taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in
court—a right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p.
493.) A trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of
the amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at
p. 494; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:258,
p. 5-70.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff’s CIV-100 forms for Bionicos, Rodriguez, and
Quezada request interest of “7%” but do not provide a dollar amount. Plaintiff
must calculate the interest and provide a declaration explaining the
calculation of the interest amounts.  Unlike the CIV-100 forms, the
JUD-100 forms do not request prejudgment interest.  The forms should be consistent.
Plaintiff must submit a separate declaration
supporting each default judgment packet if Plaintiff wishes to obtain three
separate judgments rather than one judgment, jointly and severally, against all
three defendants. 
When Plaintiff submits revised applications, Plaintiff
should summarize and list Plaintiff’s medical expenses to allow the Court to
verify Plaintiff’s special damages. 
Plaintiff should also submit a copy of the statement
of damages served on Quezada. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Walter Moore’s
application for default judgment against Defendant Bionicos
Genesis, Inc. filed on October 6, 2023 without prejudice. 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff
Walter Moore’s application for default judgment against Defendant Jesus Rodriguez filed on October 11, 2023 without
prejudice. 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff Walter Moore’s application
for default judgment against Defendant Rosie Quezada filed on December 21, 2023
without prejudice. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
