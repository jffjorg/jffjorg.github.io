And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's application for a writ of attachment and has tentatively ruled that it will be denied. The plaintiff is seeking to attach all corporate property of defendant Zart Art Printing, Inc. and all property of individual defendant Vaheh Mansourian that falls within the types of property listed in Code of Civil Procedure section 487.010. The plaintiff alleges that it loaned $2,000,000 to defendant Zart Art Printing, Inc. to purchase assets and that defendant Vaheh Mansourian guaranteed payment of all sums owing to the plaintiff. The plaintiff is seeking a right to attach order in the amount of $1,893,777.67 against defendants.

The court finds that the plaintiff's claims against defendants are based on contractual obligations and that the claims are properly subject to attachment. However, the court finds that the amount due is not readily ascertainable because the plaintiff has not provided a basis by which the damages can be determined by proof. Therefore, the court will not adjudicate whether the claim on which the attachment is based is one on which an attachment may be issued or if the plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim.

The court notes that the plaintiff has not filed an undertaking, which is required prior to the issuance of a writ of attachment. The court also notes that the plaintiff's memorandum of the application for the writ of attachment lacks proof of service.
