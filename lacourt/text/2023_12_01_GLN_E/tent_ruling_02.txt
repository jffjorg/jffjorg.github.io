RELIEF REQUESTED:
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses from Defendant
Severo Professional Law Corporation to Plaintiff’s (1) Requests for Admission
(Set One); (2) Special Interrogatories (Set One); (3) Form
Interrogatories—Employment (Set One); and (4) Form Interrogatories—General (Set
One).  Plaintiff also asks that the Court
impose sanctions in the amount of $4,000/motion against Defendant and/or its
counsel.  
 
BACKGROUND:
 
Plaintiff was employed by Defendant
Severo Professional Law (“Severo”) Corporation as a paralegal. Plaintiff
alleges Defendant Severo misclassified her as an exempt employee when she was
nonexempt.  Plaintiff alleges she was
forced to work through her meal periods without pay.  
 
Plaintiff alleges her supervisor,
Defendant Lawrence LaRocca, approached her for sex multiple times.  Plaintiff alleges her supervisor demanded her
compliance with his demands in exchange for her continued employment.  Plaintiff alleges that, when she informed the
officer manager, the office manager essentially told her to search for new
employment if she objected to her supervisor’s conduct.  Plaintiff alleges the office manager also
threatened her with termination of employment in response to her sexual harassment
complaints.  Plaintiff was terminated
from Defendant’s employ on August 18, 2022.
 
Plaintiff filed a charge of
disability discrimination on March 3, 2023. 
Plaintiff received a right to sue letter within one year of March 8,
2023, the date this action was filed. 
 
On March 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this action against Defendant Severo.  On
June 16, 2023, Plaintiff the operative FAC against Defendant Severo and
Defendant Lawrence La Rocca (Plaintiff’s supervisor) alleging (1) failure to
provide meal periods; (2) failure to provide rest periods; (3) failure to pay
all wages owed; (4) failure to provide accurate wage statements; (5) failure to
pay waiting time penalties; (6) unfair business practice; (7) sexual harassment
in violation of FEHA (quid pro quo); (8) sexual harassment in violation of FEHA
(hostile work environment); (9) retaliation in violation of FEHA; (10)
whistleblower retaliation in violation of Labor Code §1102.5; (11) failure to
prevent harassment and retaliation in violation of FEHA; (12) negligent hiring;
(13) negligent supervision and retention; (14) wrongful termination in
violation of FEHA; (15) wrongful termination in violation of Public Policy;
(16) IIED.  
 
On August 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed
Notices of Acknowledgment of Receipt as to Defendants Severo and LaRocca. The
Notices of Acknowledgment of Receipt indicated the FAC and summons were mailed
to Defendants on July 5, 2023.  The
Notices were signed by Patrick Martinez of the Law Offices of Patrick D.
Martinez.  Service was therefore complete
on August 1, 2023 per CCP §415.30(c) and a response to the complaint was due on
August 31, 2023.  
 
As of November 29, 2023, Defendants
have not filed any response to the FAC.  However,
based on the meet and confer correspondence between the parties, Defendant
Severo served discovery on Plaintiff. 
(Motions to Compel, Grau Dec., ¶5, Exs. A and K.)  If in fact Severo served discovery on
Plaintiff without challenging this Court’s jurisdiction over it, Defendant
Severo has made a general appearance, waiving any objections based on personal
jurisdiction.  (Factor Health Mgmt. v.
Sup.Ct. (Apex Therapeutic Care, Inc. 
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 246, 250, 250; Creed v. Schultz (1983) 148
Cal.App.3d 733, 739-740.)

and Severo’s counsel will be taken up at the hearing.  
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Legal Standard
 
CCP §2030.300
 
(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply:
            (1) An
answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
            (2) An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate.
            (3) An
objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.
(b)(1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under the
California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute.
(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the interrogatories.
(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter
7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.
(e) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
further response to interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).
 
CCP §2033.290
(a) On receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the
party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response
if that party deems that either or both of the following apply:
            (1) An
answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete.
            (2) An
objection to a particular request is without merit or too general.
(b)(1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
            (2) In lieu
of a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.
(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
any specific later date to which the requesting party and the responding party
have agreed in writing, the requesting party waives any right to compel further
response to the requests for admission.
(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter
7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
(e) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
further response to requests for admission, the court may order that the
matters involved in the requests be deemed admitted. In lieu of, or in addition
to, this order, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010).
 
If a timely motion to compel has been filed, the burden is
on the responding party to justify any objection or failure to fully answer the
interrogatories and RFAs. (Coy v. Sup.Ct. (Wolcher) (1962) 58 Cal.2d
210, 220–221; Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Stendell) (2000) 22 Cal.4th
245, 255.)  
 
Discussion
 
Notice and Lack of Opposition—Plaintiff filed these four
motions to compel further responses on August 9, 2023, and they were set for
hearing before Judge Ralph C. Hofer in Department D on December 1, 2023.  
 
On September 12, 2023, Judge Ralph C. Hofer reassigned this
matter to this Court and ordered that the motions be heard on December 1, 2023
in this department.  
 
Plaintiff served a copy of the order reassigning the matter
and continuing the hearing date on Plaintiff’s motion to compel further in this
department on December 1, 2023.  (Notice
of Case Reassignment filed on October 5, 2023.) 
Despite notice of these motions to compel further and the reassignment
of the case, Defendant Severo has not filed any response to the motions.  
 
Meet and Confer—Plaintiff sufficiently met and
conferred on the discovery responses at issue. 
Plaintiff and Defendant communicated extensively regarding the subject
discovery.  Plaintiff also served a
formal meet-and-confer letter on August 2, 2023, a week before filing this
motion.  (Motions, Grau Dec., ¶¶16-17,
Exs. K and L.)  Rather than respond in
good faith to the substantive attempt to meet and confer, Defendant continued
to argue irrelevant ancillary issues. 
(Motions, Grau Dec., ¶18, Ex. M.)
 
Timeline—
 

May 8, 2023 Plaintiff
     serves Defendant Severo with the subject discovery (Motions, Grau Dec.,
     ¶4.)
May 31, 2023 Plaintiff
     grants Defendant Severo an extension to July 5, 2023 to respond to the
     discovery (Id. at ¶5.)  
July 5, 2023 Plaintiff
     grants Defendant Severo an extension to July 12, 2023 (Id. at ¶9,
     Ex. E.)
July 12, 2023 Plaintiff
     grants Defendant Severo an extension to July 17, 2023 (Id. at ¶10.)
     
July 17, 2023 Defendant
     Severo claims it served the discovery responses by mail, as confirmed by
     the POS attached to the discovery responses (Id. at ¶12, Ex. H.)
July 18, 2023 Defendant
     Severo serves copy of the responses by email on Plaintiff (Id. at ¶¶12
     and 13, Exs. H and I.)
August 2, 2023 Plaintiff
     sends an official meet and confer letter regarding the subject discovery
     requests and Severo’s responses thereto and requesting supplemental
     responses by August 8, 2023  (Id.
     at ¶16, Ex. K.)
August 2, 2023 Defendant
     response to the meet and confer arguing the request for supplemental
     responses was an improper quid pro quo/extortion (Id. at ¶18, Ex.
     M.)  
August 2, 2023 Plaintiff
     responds with a statement that failure to serve supplemental responses by
     August 8, 2023 would result in motions to compel further (Id. at
     ¶19, Ex. N.)
August 8, 2023 No
     supplemental responses are served (Id. at ¶20.)
August 9, 2023 Plaintiff
     files the instant motions to compel further responses

 
RFAs, Special Interrogatories, Form Interrogatories
(Employment) and Form Interrogatories (General)— If a timely motion to
compel has been filed, the burden is on the responding party to justify any
objection or failure to fully answer the interrogatories and RFAs. (Coy v.
Sup.Ct. (Wolcher) (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221; Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Sup.Ct. (Stendell) (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
 
Defendant Severo asserted boilerplate objections to RFA Nos.
2-4, 6, Special Interrogatories Nos. 1-11, Form Interrogatories (Employment) Nos.
200.1, 200.3-200.5, 209.2, 217.1 and Form Interrogatories (General) Nos. 1.1,
4.1, 12.1-12.7 and 17.1.  Based on a
review of the discovery, the objections are meritless.  Defendant Severo failed to oppose the motions,
and they have therefore failed to justify their failure to provide substantive
responses.  
 
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel Further Responses to RFA Nos.
2-4, 6, Special Interrogatories Nos. 1-11, Form Interrogatories (Employment)
Nos. 200.1, 200.3-200.5, 209.2, 217.1 and Form Interrogatories (General) Nos.
1.1, 4.1, 12.1-12.7 and 17.1 are GRANTED. 
Defendant Severo is ordered to serve further responses to RFA Nos. 2-4,
6, Special Interrogatories Nos. 1-11, Form Interrogatories (Employment) Nos.
200.1, 200.3-200.5, 209.2, 217.1 and Form Interrogatories (General) Nos. 1.1,
4.1, 12.1-12.7 and 17.1 within 20 days.  
 
Sanctions—Plaintiff asks that the Court impose
sanctions against Severo and/or Severo’s counsel of record in the amount of
$4,000 per motion based on 4 hours motion prep, 2 hours separate statement
prep, 2 hours reply prep and 2 hours hearing attendance @ $400/hr.  The motions largely overlap and Defendant
Severo did not oppose them.
The issue of sanctions will be taken up at the hearing.
