And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by a judge in a lawsuit filed by John and Ronda Ramseyer against FCA US LLC. The lawsuit alleges that the defendant failed to comply with the express warranty of a Jeep Cherokee purchased by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are seeking an order compelling the defendant to produce documents that it agreed to produce. The defendant has failed to produce these documents despite agreeing to do so. The court has reviewed the defendant's responses and finds that many of them indicate that the defendant will comply with the request and produce specific documents. Therefore, the court grants the motion to compel compliance. The court also orders the defendant to pay sanctions in the amount of $2,160 to the plaintiffs for the defendant's failure to produce the documents. The hearing on this matter is scheduled for December 1, 2023.
