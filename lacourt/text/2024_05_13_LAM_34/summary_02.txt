Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the defendant's requests for production of documents. The court finds that the plaintiff's meet and confer requirement is met, but the plaintiff failed to provide a separate statement as required by California Rules of Court. The court also finds that the motion is moot since the defendant served supplemental responses on April 12, 2024, one day after the motion was filed. The court grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,375.00 against the defendant and defense counsel, jointly and severally.
