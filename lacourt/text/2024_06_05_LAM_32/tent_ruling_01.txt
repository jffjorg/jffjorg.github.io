  Case No.:  19STCV36296
  Hearing Date:  June 5, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion to tax costs 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 10, 2019, Plaintiff
Raymond Tunyan filed this action against Defendants BMW of North America, LLC
and Valencia BMW for breach of warranty under the Song-Beverly Act. The case
was compelled to arbitration, which proceeded until Defendants failed to pay a
JAMS invoice needed to continue the arbitration. The Court thereafter granted
Plaintiff’s motion to withdraw from arbitration. The case settled on February
26, 2024.
            On April 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
Memorandum of Costs (MOC) totaling $27,313.99 for the representation by Wirtz
Law APC. On April 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a MOC totaling $919.95 for the
representation by Norman Taylor & Associates. 
On April 30, 2024, Defendants filed the
instant motion to tax the April 15 MOC. Plaintiff filed his opposition on May
22, 2024. Defendants filed their reply on May 29, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
The statutory scheme for cost recovery
establishes three categories of trial preparation expenses: (1) one category
allowable as a matter of right to the prevailing party (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5(a)); (2) one category disallowable unless expressly authorized elsewhere
by law (id., subd. (b)); and (3) one category allowable or disallowable
in the court’s discretion (id., subd. (c)(4)). Even where costs are
deemed allowable, such costs are only recoverable to the extent that they are
(1) reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation and (2) reasonable in amount. (Id.,
subd. (c)(2)-(3).)
Additionally, the prevailing buyer in a
claim under the Song-Beverly Act “shall be allowed by the court to recover as
part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,
including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the
court to have been reasonably incurred.” (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).) This section “permits
the prevailing buyer to recover both ‘costs’ and ‘expenses.’”
(Jensen v. BMW of North America, Inc. (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137.)
“[I]t is clear the Legislature intended the word ‘expenses’ to cover items not
included in the detailed statutory definition of ‘costs’ provided in Section
1033.5. (Ibid.) 
“If the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Sanford v. Rasnick (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 1121, 1128.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
Arbitration Costs
Defendants argue that most of the claimed
costs were incurred during arbitration, and Plaintiff has already recovered the
costs of arbitration pursuant to his motion under Section 1281.98. The Court
previously awarded “attorney fees in the amount of $49,500” based on 110 hours
at a rate of $450. (Aug. 28, 2023 Order re Mtn. for Sanctions 3:20-4:7.) This
did not cover the costs presently being claimed in Plaintiff’s MOC. Therefore,
the earlier recovery does not preclude the costs in the MOC. 
II.
Deposition Costs (Item 4)
            Deposition costs are expressly
allowed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(3).) Plaintiff’s MOC claims $8,451.92 in
deposition costs. Defendants argue that Plaintiff has provided no invoices to
substantiate the amount. Defendants also challenge the cost of deposing the
same individual, Gabriel Paredes, three times. 
            Plaintiff substantiates the costs
with invoices. (Wirtz Decl., Ex. 2.) The Court does not find any impropriety in
deposing Gabriel Paredes in different capacities, as expert and PMK. The Court
does not find that three deposition sessions is unreasonable. Therefore, the
deposition costs are reasonable. 
III.
Witness Fees (Item 8)
            While fees of experts not ordered by
the court are disallowed under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(b)(1),
they are allowed under the broader definition of “expenses” under Civil Code
section 1794(d)). (Jensen, supra, 35 Cal.App.4th at pp. 137-38.)
Plaintiff’s MOC claims witness fees of
$8,812.50 for his expert, Anthony Micale. Defendants argue that the amount is
unsubstantiated because there is no documentation regarding Mr. Micale’s
billing rate or the number of hours he worked on the case. The billing is
substantiated by invoices attached to Plaintiff’s opposition. (Wirtz Decl., Ex.
3.) Mr. Micale prepared an expert report and attended two depositions. (Id.,
¶ 6.)
The slight difference between the hourly
rate claimed in Plaintiff’s expert disclosure and the rate ultimately charged
on the invoice does not render the fees unreasonable. (See Wirtz Decl., Ex. 3;
Villegas Decl., Ex. 1.) Defendant cites no authority requiring an expert’s fees
to precisely match the rates claimed in the disclosure. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2034.260(c)(5).) The rate claimed in the disclosure ($350) substantially aligns
with the rate charged ($375 or $390), and Defendants have shown no prejudice as
a result of the discrepancy. Therefore, the Court finds that the expert fees
are reasonable. 
IV.
Court Reporter Fees (Item 11)
            Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5 does not expressly prohibit court reporter fees, leaving such fees in
the court’s discretion. Additionally, these fees may constitute “expenses”
under Civil Code section 1794(d). Plaintiff’s MOC claims court reporter fees of
$5,045. Defendants argue that there is no supporting documentation and that the
hearings did not require a reporter. 
            Plaintiff substantiates the costs
with invoices. (Wirtz Decl., Ex. 4.) That Defendants do not believe reporters
were needed for certain hearings does not render the costs unreasonable.
Defendants cite no authority for their proposition that a reporter is
unnecessary just because a minute order is available. (See Reply 3:23-24.) The
Court finds that the costs were reasonably necessary to the litigation.  
However, Plaintiff also claims $625 in
anticipated costs for a motion for attorney’s fees that has not yet been filed.
(Wirtz Decl. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff provides no legal authority suggesting that a
party may claim anticipated costs in a MOC. Costs cannot be reasonably incurred
if they have not been incurred at all. Therefore, Item 11 is taxed in the
amount of $625. 
V.
Other Costs (Item 16)
            Plaintiff’s MOC claims “other” costs
of $3,420.07, consisting of a variety of costs as listed in Attachment 16a.
Defendants challenge the costs for “legal research” ($1,192.02), “printer
charges” ($519.50), and “business meal” ($401.45). The Court does not find
these costs to be reasonably incurred or reasonably necessary. Therefore, Item
16 is stricken in the amount of $2,112,97. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to tax costs is
GRANTED in part. Plaintiff’s April 15 MOC is taxed in the amount of $2,737.97.
