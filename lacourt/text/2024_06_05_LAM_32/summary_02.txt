This tentative ruling addresses a motion to quash subpoenas issued by Defendants to Wells Fargo for records pertaining to a joint account belonging to Plaintiff and other individuals. The subpoenas seek various records, including bank statements, deposits, withdrawals, and a cashier's check for $239,487.70. The Plaintiff argues that the subpoenas are procedurally defective, unduly burdensome, and not reasonably particularized. However, the Judge finds that the subpoenas are not procedurally defective, are reasonably particularized, and are not unduly burdensome. The Judge also finds that the information sought by the subpoenas is directly relevant to the merits of the case and is not being sought in relation to punitive damages. The motion to quash is denied, and production shall be subject to a protective order.
