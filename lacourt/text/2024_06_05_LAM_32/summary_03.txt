And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Summary**

The Court has reviewed Defendant Caesarstone USA, Inc.'s demurrer and motion to strike the complaint. The Court has determined that the complaint adequately pleads causation and failure to warn. The Court has also determined that the complaint adequately pleads fraudulent concealment and punitive damages. However, the Court has stricken the phrase "and other silica-containing stone products to be identified during the course of discovery" (FAC ¶ 171) as it contravenes the heightened standard under Bockrath.

**Conclusion**

Defendant Caesarstone USA, Inc.'s demurrer is overruled. Defendant's motion to strike is granted as to the stricken phrase and denied as to punitive damages.
