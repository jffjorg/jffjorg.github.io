---

This tentative ruling grants a motion filed by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) for the disclosure and use of Connie Guzman’s personnel records in the case of Peniche v. California Highway Patrol, et al. The motion was filed on August 18, 2023 and no opposition was filed. The ruling orders the custodian of records to bring Connie Guzman’s personnel records to court on September 26, 2023 for an in camera review. The case involves allegations of improper dissemination of private videos belonging to the plaintiff, a former law enforcement officer previously employed with the CHP. The defendants Melissa Hammond, Robert Ruiz, and Matt Lentz are accused of sharing the plaintiff's private videos. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants spread false rumors based on the videos. The ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff's allegations are in part based on purportedly hearsay statements made by Connie Guzman to the plaintiff, which demonstrates potential bias by Ms. Guzman. The plaintiff and Ms. Guzman have not opposed the motion, so there does not appear to be any evidence of prejudice to them if these records were disclosed.
