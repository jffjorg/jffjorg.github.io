---

This tentative ruling grants a motion filed by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) for the disclosure and use of Connie Guzman’s personnel records in the case of Peniche v. California Highway Patrol, et al. The motion was filed on August 18, 2023 and no opposition was filed. The ruling orders the custodian of records to bring Connie Guzman’s personnel records to court on September 26, 2023 for an in camera review. The case involves allegations of improper dissemination of private videos belonging to the plaintiff, a former law enforcement officer previously employed with the CHP. The defendants Melissa Hammond, Robert Ruiz, and Matt Lentz are accused of sharing the plaintiff's private videos. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants spread false rumors based on the videos. The ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff's allegations are in part based on purportedly hearsay statements made by Connie Guzman to the plaintiff, which demonstrates potential bias by Ms. Guzman. The plaintiff and Ms. Guzman have not opposed the motion, so there does not appear to be any evidence of prejudice to them if these records were disclosed.

**English Summary:**

The judge has ruled in favor of the California Highway Patrol (CHP) in their request to access the personnel records of Officer Connie Guzman.  The CHP argues this information is relevant to their defense in the lawsuit filed against them by a former officer, Peniche. 

Peniche claims that other CHP officers improperly shared her private videos with her captain, who then spread rumors about her. The judge found that CHP demonstrated enough reason to seek Guzman's records, particularly given potential bias from Guzman's involvement in the same overtime investigation as Peniche. 

The personnel records will be reviewed confidentially by the judge on September 26th, with the custodian of the records required to provide testimony about the documents.
