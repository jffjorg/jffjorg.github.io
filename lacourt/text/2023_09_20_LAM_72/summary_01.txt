And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the California Highway Patrol's (CHP) Pitchess motion for disclosure and use of Connie Guzman's personnel records. The motion was filed on August 18, 2023, and no opposition was filed. The judge finds that CHP has demonstrated good cause for the disclosure of Connie Guzman's personnel records, citing the potential bias of Connie Guzman due to her involvement in an administrative investigation into overtime fraud, in which both Plaintiff and Ms. Guzman were investigated. The judge orders that the custodian of records must bring Connie Guzman's personnel records to court on September 26, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. for an in camera review, and that the custodian must be prepared to give sworn testimony regarding the documents produced and any documents that were not produced and the reasons they were not produced.
