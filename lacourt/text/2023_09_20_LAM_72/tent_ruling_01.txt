Case Number:  20STCV18935
Case Name:  Peniche v. California Highway Patrol, et al.
 
 
            On
August 18, 2023, CHP filed a Pitchess motion for disclosure and use of Connie
Guzman’s personnel records to litigate and defend this case. No opposition was
filed. On September 5, 2023, CHP filed a notice of non-opposition from
Plaintiff.
 
The
Court GRANTS CHP’s motion. The Court further orders that, per Evidence Code
sections 1043 and 1045, the custodian of records must bring Connie Guzman’s
personnel records to this Court on September 26, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. for an in
camera review. (People v. White (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1335.) The
custodian of records must be prepared to give sworn testimony regarding the
documents so produced, as well as testimony regarding any documents that are
part of the personnel record that were not produced and the reasons they were
not produced. (People v. Superior Court (Johnson) (2015) 61 Cal.4th 696,
722.)
 
Background of the Case
 
            This
action arises out of a dispute involving the alleged improper dissemination of
private videos belonging to Plaintiff, a former law enforcement officer
previously employed with Defendant CHP. Defendants Melissa Hammond, Robert
Ruiz, and Matt Lentz were purportedly involved in the alleged improper
dissemination of Plaintiff’s private videos. 
 
            Plaintiff
had been the subject of an administrative investigation at CHP with respect to
officers obtaining unauthorized overtime and her cellphone had been the target
of a search warrant. Plaintiff had private videos on her cellphone involving
her having sex with another person. Plaintiff alleges Defendants Ruiz and
Lentz, who were involved in the administrative investigation into overtime
hours, shared these videos with Defendant Hammond, who was Plaintiff’s captain
and who in turn purportedly spread a false rumor that Plaintiff had been having
an affair with her brother-in-law based on the videos.
 
            Plaintiff
filed this action on May 18, 2020. Plaintiff recently filed the operative
Second Amended Complaint on February 14, 2023, alleging causes of action for
Intrusion of Private Affairs, Public Disclosure of Private Facts, Distribution
of Private Sexual Material, Negligence, Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Defamation Per Se,
Defamation Per Quod, and Negligence Per Se. The Court sustained a demurrer to
Plaintiff’s second cause of action for Public Disclosure of Private Facts, but
all other causes of action have otherwise proceeded.
            
Legal Standard
 
Good cause for the disclosure of a
police officer’s personnel records under Evidence Code §1043 is shown when the
affidavit in support of the motion “provide[s] a ‘specific factual scenario’
establishing a ‘plausible factual foundation’ for…allegations of police
misconduct and…set[s] forth the materiality of ‘the discovery or disclosure
sought’ to ‘the subject matter involved in the pending litigation.’” (See City
of San Jose v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1146-1147; see
also California Highway Patrol v. Superior Court (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th
1010, 1020 [“[A] showing of good cause must be based on a discovery request
which is tailored to the specific officer misconduct that is alleged.”]; see California
Highway Patrol, supra, at p. 1021.) The statutory scheme for Pitchess motions equally applies to
civil and criminal discovery. (See Haggerty v. Superior Court (2004) 117
Cal.App.4th 1079, 1085.)
 
Analysis
 
Here,
the Court finds CHP has demonstrated good cause justifying the disclosure of third-party
Connie Guzman’s personnel records under Evidence Code section 1043. The
declaration submitted in support of the motion provides sufficient factual information
demonstrating the basis for seeking discovery of Connie Guzman’s personnel
records. (Younger Decl., ¶¶ 3-7.) More specifically, Plaintiff’s allegations in
this action are in part based on purportedly hearsay statements made by Connie
Guzman to Plaintiff against a backdrop of both Plaintiff and Ms. Guzman having
been investigated by CHP in connection with overtime fraud, which demonstrates
potential bias by Ms. Guzman. (Id.) Additionally, Plaintiff and Ms.
Guzman have not opposed his motion, so there does not appear to be any evidence
of prejudice to them if these records were disclosed. Accordingly, the Court
GRANTS the motion.
 
The
Court further orders that, per Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1045, the
custodian of records must bring Connie Guzman’s personnel records to this Court
on September 26, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. for an in camera review. (People v.
White (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1335.) The custodian of records must be
prepared to give sworn testimony regarding the documents so produced, as well
as testimony regarding any documents that are part of the personnel record that
were not produced and the reasons they were not produced. (People v.
Superior Court (Johnson) (2015) 61 Cal.4th 696, 722.)
