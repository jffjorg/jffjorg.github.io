of transfer of structured settlement payment rights. 
 
The Court GRANTS the Petition. 
 
 
Background
 
          On July 6, 2023, Petitioner filed the Petition seeking approval of
transfer of structured settlement payment rights.  Payee Vjeko Dusevic (“Dusevic”) will transfer
to Petitioner future payments totaling $100,000.00 in exchange for a purchase
price of $40,000.00. According to the Petition: (1) in or about September 2009,
Dusevic, by and through their guardian became entitled to certain structured
settlement payments resulting from a claim for damages arising in connection
with a wrongful death claim (Petition at ¶ 3); (2) the settlement agreement
agreed to by the transferor provides for periodic structured payments
including, but not limited to, one payment of $100,000.00 on April 6, 2031 (Id.
at ¶ 4); (3) the annuity issuer who has issued an insurance contract used to
fund the structured settlement payments is John Hancock Life Insurance Company
n/k/a John Hancock Life Insurance Company (USA) (Id. at ¶ 5); (4) the
structured settlement obligor with respect to the aforementioned structured
settlement payments is John Hancock Assignment Company (Id. at ¶ 6); (5)
transferor has agreed to sell, and Petitioner has agreed to purchase a certain
lump sum payment as referenced within their proposed purchase agreement (Id.
at ¶ 7 and Exhibit A); and (6) all the provisions set forth in California Insurance
Code, Sections 10134 through 10139.5 have been met or will be met prior to
any scheduled hearing (Id at ¶ 9). 

 
          The
Petition is unopposed. A review of the papers indicates that the Petition was
served on all interested parties on July 6, 2023. 
                     
Discussion
 
          Compliance
with California Insurance Code, Section 10139.5(f)(1)
          
Under California Insurance Code, Section
10139.5(f)(1), all petitions for approval of transfer of structured settlement
payment rights must be filed by the transferee in the county where the payee is
residing at the time of the agreement, or if the payee is domiciled outside of
California, in the county of the settlement obligor or annuity issuer. 
 
Here, the filed proof of service states that
Dusevic’s address will be provided at the hearing. Dusevic’s declaration in
support of the Petition states that Dusevic resides in Los Angeles County,
California and provides Dusevic’s residence address, which is in the city of
Rancho Palos Verdes.  (Dusevic Decl. at
¶¶ 1-2.)  Therefore, the Court finds that
the Petition was filed in the correct county and venue is proper.  
 
Compliance with California Insurance Code,
Section 10139.5(f)(2)
 
          California
Insurance Code, Section 10139.5(f)(2) provides that not less than 20
days prior to the scheduled hearing on any petition for approval of a transfer
of structured settlement payment rights under this article, the transferee
shall file with the court and serve on all interested parties a notice of the
proposed transfer and the petition for its authorization.  Included with the notice of the proposed
transfer, a transferee must include a listing of each of the payee’s
dependents, together with each dependent’s age. 
(Cal. Ins. Code § 10139.5(f)(2)(C).) 
Cal. Ins. Code § 10139.5(f)(2)(A) requires the transferee to file with
court and serve on interested parties “[a] copy of the transferee’s current
petition and any other prior petition, whether approved or withdrawn, that was
filed with the court in accordance with paragraph (6) of subdivision (c).”  Information regarding previous transfers or
attempted transfers may be provided by providing copies of pleadings,
transaction documents, or orders involving any previous attempted or completed
transfer or providing the court a summary of available information regarding any
previous transfer or attempted transfer. 
(Cal. Ins. Code § 10139.5(c)(6).) 

 
          The
Petition includes the proposed transfer agreement (Petition at Exhibit A) and
the disclosure form required by California Insurance Code, Section
10136(b) (Petition at Exhibit B). The declaration of Dusevic lists Dusevic’s
dependents with the age of the dependent. 
(Dusevic Decl. at ¶ 8.)  Petitioner
has provided the Court with: (1) an affidavit from Dusevic that the Qualified
Assignment cannot be located (Petition at Exhibit D); (2) evidence of the terms
of the structured settlement agreement (Petition at Exhibits C and D.)
 
          Thus,
the Petition complies with California Insurance Code, Section
10139.5(f)(2).  All procedural
requirements have been satisfied. 
 
Compliance with California
Insurance Code, Section 10139.5 
Under California Insurance Code,
Section 10139.5, a transfer of structured settlement payment rights is not effective
unless the transfer has been approved in advance in a final court order.  In order to approve the transfer, the Court
must make the following findings pursuant to California Insurance Code, Section
10139.5:
 
1) The transfer is in the best
interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the
payee's dependents.
          
2) The payee has been advised in
writing by the transferee to seek independent professional advice regarding the
transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived that advice in
writing.
          
3) The transferee has provided the
payee with a disclosure form that complies with Insurance Code section 10136
and the transfer agreement complies with Insurance Code sections 10136 and
10138.
          
4) The transfer does not
contravene any applicable statute or the order of any court or other government
authority.
          
5) The payee reasonably
understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms set forth
in the disclosure statement required by Insurance Code section 10136.
          
6) The payee reasonably
understands and does not wish to exercise the payee's right to cancel the
transfer agreement.
          
According to the declaration of Dusevic
in support of the Petition:
(1) Dusevic believes that it is in
Dusevic’s best interest to enter into the transaction contemplated in the
Purchase Agreement (Dusevic Decl. at ¶ 4); (2) Dusevic is transferring one
payment of $100,000.00 on April 6, 2031 and, if approved, will receive
$40,000.00 from the transaction (Id. at ¶ 5); (3) when the original
settlement was completed, the future periodic payments that are the subject of
the proposed transfer were not intended to pay for future medical care and
treatment relating to the incident that was the subject of the settlement (Id.
at ¶ 6); (4) when the original settlement was completed, the future periodic
payments that are the subject of the proposed transfer were solely monetary in
nature and were not intended to provide for necessary living expenses (Id.
at ¶ 7); and (5) Dusevic is 22 years old and has one minor child, R.D. who is 4
months old, employed as a remote insurance agent, and is unmarried (Id.
at ¶ 8).  
Dusevic further declares that: (1)
Dusevic has completed a previous transaction on March 3,
2023 through the Los Angeles County Court (Case No. 23STCP00137) transferring
one lump sum payment of $60,000.00 due on April 6, 2026 to Petitioner, and from
such settlement, Dusevic received $34,000.00 (Id. at ¶ 9); (2)
Dusevic has completed a previous transaction on May 31, 2023 through the Los
Angeles County Court (Case No. 23STCP01128) transferring one lump sum payment
of $84,077.00 due on April 6, 2031 to Petitioner, and from such settlement,
Dusevic received $30,000.00 (Id.); (3) Dusevic has not attempted any
previous transactions involving Dusevic’s structured settlement payment that
were denied, dismissed, or withdrawn prior to a decision on the merits, within
the past five years (Id. at ¶ 10); (4) Dusevic is currently experiencing
a financial hardship and, if approved, would use the money received from the
proposed settlement for a down payment on a home (Id. at ¶ 11); (5) Dusevic
understands the terms of the transfer agreement including the terms set forth
in the disclosure statement (Id. at ¶ 13); (6) Dusevic waived the right
to seek independent legal advice (Id. at ¶ 12; Petition at Exhibit E);
and (7) Dusevic understands and does not wish to cancel the agreement (Id. at
¶ 14). 
Petitioner provided a disclosure
form that complies with California Insurance Code, Section 10136
(Petition at Exhibit B) and a transfer agreement that complies with California Insurance
Code, Sections 10136 and 10138 (Petition at Exhibit A.)  The transfer will not contravene any
applicable statute or known order of a Court or other governmental
authority.  
A review of the Petition reveals
that it includes the evidence necessary to make the findings required under
California Insurance Code, Section 10139.5. 
The Petition is therefore GRANTED.
