Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Gloria Mendoza's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to Plaintiff Jose Mendoza's causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress in both complaints without leave to amend. The Judge finds that the complaints fail to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and that the complaints do not contain a separate negligence cause of action or allegations that would allow for a recovery under an NIED theory of liability. The Judge also construes Plaintiff's lack of opposition to the motion as a tacit admission that Defendant's arguments are meritorious. The Judge orders Defendant to lodge a Proposed Dismissal Order and give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of the order.
