[1] The Court
agrees with Defendant that the allegations in both complaints, i.e., LASC Case
Nos. 22PSCV0083 and 22PSCV01319, are virtually identical to each other, and
therefore the Court will treat the allegations and causes of action between
both complaints as one and the same. The
Court also notes that although it previously sustained Defendant’s demurrer
without leave to amend as to the First Cause of Action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress in LASC Case No. 22PSCV00083, it was not
sustained as to the same cause of action in LASC Case No. 22PSCV01319, as the
consolidation of these cases occurred after the Court sustained that demurrer.
