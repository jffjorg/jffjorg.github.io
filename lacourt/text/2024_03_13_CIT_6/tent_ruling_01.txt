BACKGROUND 
These are emotional distress cases arising from the disposition of
certain real property. On January 25, 2022, plaintiff Jose Mendoza (Plaintiff)
filed this action (LASC Case No. 22PSCV00083) against defendant Gloria Mendoza
(Defendant) and Does 1 through 10, alleging causes of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
On October 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed a separate action (LASC Case
No. 22STCV32136) against Defendant and Does 1 through 10, alleging one cause of
action for promissory estoppel. On October 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed another
separate action (LASC Case No. 22PSCV01319) against Defendant and Does 1
through 10, alleging causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional
distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
On November 29, 2022, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to
the First Cause of Action for intentional infliction of emotional distress without
leave to amend in LASC Case No. 22PSCV00083. 
On December 22, 2022, Defendant filed an answer to the complaint
in LASC Case No. 22STCV32136.) On January 4, 2023, Defendant filed an answer to
the complaints in LASC Case Nos. 22PSCV00083 and 22PSCV01319. 
On February 7, 2023, the Court consolidated all three of these
actions, with this action (LASC Case No. 22PSCV00083) being designated as the
lead case. 
On February 15, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion for
judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff’s causes of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress
in both LASC Case No. 22PSCV00083 and LASC Case No. 22PSCV01319. The motion is
unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
            A defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings when the
“complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against that defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subds. (b)(1),
(c)(1)(B)(ii).)  
A
motion for judgment on the pleadings tests the legal sufficiency of the
complaint and is analyzed in all material respects as though it were a
demurrer.  (Wise v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 725, 738; Kapsimallis v. Allstate Insurance Co. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 667, 672.) 
“A
motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general
demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings
or by matters that can be judicially noticed.” (Cloud v. Northrop
Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999 [citations omitted].) 
REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
            The Court GRANTS
Defendant’s requests for judicial notice. (Evid. Code § 452, subd. (d).) However, the Court takes judicial notice of the
foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of
public records and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice
of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.) 
DISCUSSION 
Meet and Confer 
Per Code of Civil Procedure section 439, subdivision (a)(1),
Defendant was required to meet and confer in person or telephonically with
Plaintiff before bringing this motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 439, subd. (a)(1).) The
Court finds Defendant’s meet-and-confer efforts sufficient. (Meigs Decl., ¶ 4.) 
First Cause of Action – Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress 
To state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional
distress, the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating, “(1) extreme and
outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless
disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff's
suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate
causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct.
[Citations].” (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050, internal
quotation marks and citation omitted.) 
A defendant’s conduct is outrageous “when it is so extreme as to
exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.” (Hughes
v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050-1051 [internal quotations and citation
omitted].) “[T]he defendant’s conduct must be intended to inflict injury
or engaged in with the realization that injury will result. (Id. at
p. 1051 [internal quotations and citation omitted].) Further, “severe emotional
distress” means “emotional distress of such substantial quality or enduring
quality that no reasonable [person] in civilized society should be expected to
endure it.” (Potter v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993) 6 Cal.4th
965, 1004, internal quotation marks and citation omitted.) “[F]acts giving rise
to a cause of action for injuries resulting from emotional distress must be
specifically pleaded.” (Deboe v. Horn (1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 221, 224.) 
Defendant moves for judgment on the pleadings as to the First
Cause of Action for intentional infliction of emotional distress on the grounds
that it is barred by res judicata, and on the grounds that the complaints,
i.e., LASC Case Nos. 22PSCV00083 and 22PSCV01319,[1] fail to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Defendant
argues Plaintiff’s allegations are insufficient to constitute a cause of action
for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). Defendant contends
that Plaintiff’s claims are rooted in a breach of an alleged promise, and do
not rise to the level of outrageousness necessary for an IIED claim. The Court
agrees the complaints fail to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action for IIED. The Court further agrees  that the Court previously sustained the
demurrer to the IIED cause of action in 22PSCV00083 without leave to amend. 
Emotional distress damages are generally unavailable
in breach of contract type claims. (See Levy v. Only Cremations for
Pets, Inc. (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 203, 214, internal quotation marks
omitted [“[D]amages for mental suffering and emotional
distress are generally not recoverable in an action for breach
of an ordinary commercial
contract in California.
[Citation.] There are two exceptions to this rule: (1) when the emotional
distress caused by the breach is accompanied by physical injury; or (2) when
the breach is of such kind that serious emotional disturbance was a
particularly likely result. [Citation.]”]) 
The extent of
Plaintiff’s allegations are rooted in a breach of contract type claim. (See
Compl. (LASC Case No. 22PSCV00083), ¶¶ 10-16; Compl. (LASC Case No.
22PSCV01319, ¶¶ 10-16.) Neither complaint alleges any physical injury or any
facts demonstrating that a breach of such a contract or promise is the kind
that would lead to serious emotional distress. (See Compl. (LASC Case No.
22PSCV00083), ¶¶ 10-16; Compl. (LASC Case No. 22PSCV01319, ¶¶ 10-16; Levy, supra, 57 Cal.App.5th at p. 214.) Additionally, the Court construes
Plaintiff’s lack of opposition to this motion as a tacit admission that
Defendant’s arguments are meritorious. (Holden v. City of San Diego (2019)
43 Cal.App.5th 404, 418; C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition,
Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10.) 
Because the Court finds the complaints fail to allege sufficient
facts here, the Court declines to address Defendant’s res judicata arguments. Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion for judgment on the pleadings as
to the First Cause of Action for intentional infliction of emotional distress in
both complaints without leave to amend. 
Second Cause of Action – Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress 
To state a cause of action for negligent
infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiff must allege facts that would
otherwise support a claim for negligence, such as duty, breach, causation, and
damages. (Eriksson v. Nunnink (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 708, 729, internal quotation
marks omitted and italics in original [“negligent causing
of emotional distress
is not an independent tort
but the tort of negligence.... [Citation.] The traditional elements
of duty, breach
of duty, causation,
and damages apply.”]) 
Defendant
moves for judgment on the pleadings as to the Second Cause of Action for
negligent infliction of emotional distress on the grounds of res judicata, and
on the grounds that the complaints fail to allege facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. Defendant contends the complaints do not contain
a separate negligence cause of action (NIED), nor are there any allegations
that would allow for a recovery under an NIED theory of liability. The Court again
agrees that the complaints fail to allege facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action for NIED. 
The complaints do not allege any facts indicating Defendant owed a
duty to Plaintiff, or that Defendant breached that duty. (See
Compl. (LASC Case No. 22PSCV00083), ¶¶ 17-21; Compl. (LASC Case No.
22PSCV01319, ¶¶ 17-22.) As noted above, Plaintiff’s emotional distress claims are
based on a breach of contract type of claim, which generally do not permit
recovery of emotional distress damages. (See Levy, supra, 57
Cal.App.5th at p. 214.) As also noted above, neither of the
complaints allege any facts indicating Plaintiff suffered physical injury or
that severe emotional distress was the kind of harm that was likely to result
here. (See Compl. (LASC Case No. 22PSCV00083), ¶¶ 17-21; Compl. (LASC
Case No. 22PSCV01319, ¶¶ 17-22; Levy,
supra, 57 Cal.App.5th at p. 214.) Furthermore,
the Court again construes Plaintiff’s lack of opposition to this motion as a tacit
admission that Defendant’s arguments are meritorious, and Plaintiff has not
requested leave to amend. (Holden v. City of San Diego (2019) 43
Cal.App.5th 404, 418; C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal.
Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10.)            Because the Court again finds the
complaints fail to allege sufficient facts for this cause of action too, the Court
declines to address Defendant’s res judicata arguments. Based on the foregoing,
the Court GRANTS the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the Second
Cause of Action for negligent infliction of emotional distress in both
complaints without leave to amend. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Gloria Mendoza’s Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings as to Plaintiff Jose Mendoza’s causes of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress
in both complaints without leave to amend.  
              Defendant Gloria Mendoza is ordered
to lodge a Proposed Dismissal Order within five calendar days of this order. 
Defendant Gloria Mendoza is ordered to give notice of the Court’s
ruling within five calendar days of this order.
