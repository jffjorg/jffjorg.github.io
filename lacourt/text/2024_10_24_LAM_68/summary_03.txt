And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a demurrer to the first amended complaint and a motion to strike allegations in support of and claim for punitive damages. The demurrer, brought by Caesarstone Ltd., challenges the fourth cause of action for fraudulent concealment. However, the court finds that the demurrer is moot since the court previously sustained a similar demurrer brought by MS International, Inc. with 20 days leave to amend, and no second amended complaint has been filed. Alternatively, if a second amended complaint was filed, the court would sustain the demurrer with 10 days leave to amend.

The court also grants the motion to strike, brought by Caesarstone Ltd., which seeks to strike a reference to potential "other stone products" yet to be identified in discovery, as well as an allegation in support of and claim for punitive damages. The court finds that the allegations are impermissibly vague and lack support.

The court sets an OSC re: Possible Referral to Complex Court for November 6, 2024, and an OSC re: Possible Long Cause Referral for December 17, 2024.
