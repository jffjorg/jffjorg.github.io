As for the English text summary, here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the unopposed motion of the plaintiffs, Shirley Huffman and Richard Tipping, for leave to file a first amended complaint. The proposed amendments include adding causes of action for assault and violation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to the complaint, as well as correcting the caption to remove a repeated cause of action. The plaintiffs deny any prejudice and the City of Los Angeles has not opposed the motion. The court notes that the purpose of the motion is to present all claims conforming with proof of damages that will be presented at trial. The motion is granted and the parties are ordered to separately file the first amended complaint within three days. The trial remains set for October 31, 2024.
