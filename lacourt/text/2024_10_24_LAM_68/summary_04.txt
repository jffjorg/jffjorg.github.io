And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication on the three individual causes of action regarding Song-Beverly Act compliance and potential civil penalties. The court finds triable issues of material fact from the course and conduct of the parties, including the delay in repurchasing the vehicle, which makes it impossible to determine whether the defendant complied with the Song-Beverly Act and whether the delay was willful. The court also declines to address the existence of a third-party dispute program mentioned in the reply. The motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication is denied. The trial date remains set for August 18, 2025.
