SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Houston
Tipping, son of Shirley Huffman and Richard Tipping, was a Los Angeles Police
Department officer, suffered fatal head injury when a fellow officer conducted
an exercise causing blunt force trauma to the head and neck of Officer Tipping
during a “training exercise” purportedly to simulate a fall from a certain
height. The training program was part of the Arrest and Control Bicycle
Training Program. Officer Tipping was not provided any protective gear normally
associated with such a training program, and other padding was not properly
placed. 
 
Plaintiffs
allege that at the time of the fatal injury, Officer Tipping was investigating
a fellow officer allegedly responsible for sexually assaulting a person,
thereby providing motivation to an officer to cause harm to Officer Tipping.
 
On
December 7, 2022, Shirley Huffman, Houston Tipping, and the Estate of Houston
Tipping, filed a complaint for Battery, Whistleblower Retaliation, Bane Act,
and Wrongful Death against City of Los Angeles and Richard Tipping (nominal
defendant). On June 14, 2023, Richard Tipping and the Estate of Houston Tipping
filed a complaint for Assault, Battery, Violation of Civil Code section 52.1,
Violation of Civil Rights 42 USC 1983, Bane Act, and Wrongful Death against
City of Los Angeles, and David Cuellar.
 
On
March 6, 2024, the court entered the stipulation of the parties to consolidate
the actions.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiffs
Shirly Huffman and Richard Tipping move for leave to file a first amended
complaints. The proposed additions are summarized as follows: 
 
1.
Plaintiff Huffman (Lead Case No. 22STCV38178) seeks to add causes of action for
Assault and Violation of Civil Rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to her Complaint.
These causes of action are already present in Cross-Complainant Tipping’s
Complaint (filed in Case No. 23STCV13772). 
2.
Cross-Complainant Tipping seeks to add a cause of action for Whistleblower
Retaliation under Labor Code § 1102.5 to his Complaint. This cause of action is
already present in Plaintiff Huffman’s Complaint (filed in Case No.
22STCV38178). 
3.
Tipping further requests to correct the caption in his complaint which
incorporates the causes of action under the Bane Act twice in the caption, and
once in the body of his complaint. Tipping seeks to remove the repeated cause
of action from the caption.
 
The
purpose of the motion is present all claims conforming with proof of damages
that will be presented at trial. Plaintiffs deny any prejudice in that all
proposed amendments add no new legal theories, facts or evidence. City of Los
Angeles submits no opposition to the motion. The court filing system shows no
reply on file at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
The unopposed motion is therefore GRANTED.
