On September 13, 2023, Plaintiff CVD Diamond,
Inc. filed a request for entry of default judgment against Defendant Stephen
Morris. 
 
Plaintiff CVD Diamond
Inc.’s request for entry of default judgment against Defendant Stephen Morris is GRANTED.
 
Background
 
On February 16, 2023, Plaintiff CVD Diamond,
Inc. (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendant Stephen Morris, and DOES 1
through 20, inclusive, alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract,
(2) book account, and (2) good sold and delivered. 
 
On March 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed proof of
service indicating that the summons and complaint were served by personal
service on Defendant on March 7, 2023.
 
On April 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for
entry of default. On May 4, 2023, this Court entered a notice of rejection re
default indicating that Item #1(a) on the CIV-100 form did not match the
complaint filing date. 
 
          On
May 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment. On May
19, 2023, this Court entered a notice of rejection re default judgment
indicating that Plaintiff still had not corrected the incorrect date on the
CIV-100 form previously submitted. 
 
          On
May 19, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default with the
correction to Item #1(a) resolved. On the same day, this Court entered default
against Defendant.
 
          On
September 13, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on this motion to allow Plaintiff
to file a new request for default judgment CIV-100 form curing the defects
identified in the Court's tentative ruling. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a), “a party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for
Entry of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100)…the
following must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: (1) except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of the plaintiffs claim; (2) declarations or other admissible
evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary;
(4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a declaration of nonmilitary
status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; (6) a proposed form
of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought
or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorney fees if
allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.”
 
Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1), items are
allowable as costs under Section 1032 if they are “filing, motion, and jury
fees.”
 
Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff CVD Diamond, Inc. filed a
request for entry of default judgment on May 25, 2023. Plaintiff requests a
judgment of $91,895.68, consisting of (1) $77,249.00 in damages; (2) $11,576.70
in prejudgment interest; (3) $635.00 in costs; and (4) $2,434.98 in attorneys’
fees. 
 
The Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s default
package and the following items are sufficient for entry of default judgment:
 
·       Item #1(a) of
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment CIV-100 form lists the proper date of
the complaint as February 16, 2023. This was the deficiency identified in the
prior minute order. The Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently remedied
this error.  
·       Item #2 of the CIV-100 form is properly filled
out with the amount in damages, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys’
fees being requested.
·       Item #7 of the CIV-100 form consists of
memorandum of costs that are allowable under CCP § 1033.5(a)(1). 
·       Item #8 of the CIV-100 form properly declares
the Defendant’s nonmilitary status.
·       Plaintiff filed a declaration from its attorney
that includes a computation of interest and attorney fees calculation with
exhibits attached in support. 
·       Plaintiff filed a proposed form of judgment
using the JUD-100 form.
·       Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal properly
dismissing DOES 1 through 20. 
·       Plaintiff filed a declaration from its President
with exhibits attached to support its request for damages and briefly
summarizing the case.
 
Therefore, Plaintiff CVD Diamond Inc.’s request for default judgment against
Defendant Stephen
Morris is GRANTED.
