## English Summary

This tentative ruling concerns a motion by attorney Ryan D. White to be relieved as counsel for the Plaintiffs in a landlord-tenant dispute case (Case No. 21STCV38616). The Judge grants the motion because Mr. White was recently appointed to the bench. 

The Court finds that Plaintiffs will not be prejudiced by this withdrawal as they have three other attorneys still representing them.  The case has several upcoming hearings, including a motion to amend the complaint and a summary adjudication hearing.  The trial was originally scheduled for October 2023, but has been continued to May 2024.
