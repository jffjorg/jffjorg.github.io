**Summary Judgment Motion**

* Samuel Freshman moved for summary judgment (or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication) as to the remaining claims
* The Court denied Freshman's Motion

**Facts**

* Freshman argued that he did not own or manage the property and therefore did not owe a duty of care to Plaintiff

**Legal Standard**
