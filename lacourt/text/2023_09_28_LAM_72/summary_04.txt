## Tentative Ruling Summary: Case No. BC684588

**Case Number:** BC684588
**Plaintiff:** Tatiana Solomon (and Norman Solomon, previously dismissed)
**Defendant:** Samuel Freshman (individually and as Trustee of the S and A Freshman Trust), 404 N. Maple Dr., LLC, Standard Management Company
**Hearing Date:** September 28, 2023
**Department:** 72

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute between Tatiana Solomon, a tenant, and Samuel Freshman, the former owner of her rental property, regarding alleged property defects. 

**Background:**

* Plaintiff leased a unit at 404 N. Maple Drive, Beverly Hills, in 2008, renewing the lease in 2013.
* Plaintiff alleged various issues with the unit, including mold, plumbing problems, vermin, and asbestos.
* The case originally included several causes of action, but the Court of Appeal reversed summary judgment on claims of negligence, breach of implied warranty of habitability, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, nuisance, and constructive eviction.

**Freshman's Motion:**

* Freshman moved for summary judgment, arguing he was not liable because he no longer owned the property when the alleged damages occurred.
* Freshman cited a December 2012 grant deed transferring ownership to 404 N. Maple Dr., LLC.

**Court's Ruling:**

* The Court denied Freshman's motion.
* The Court found that Freshman failed to establish that Plaintiff's injuries only occurred after December 2012. Plaintiff's complaint alleges issues dating back to 2010, during the Trust's ownership.
* The Court also noted that Freshman did not argue for a distinction between his individual and trustee capacities.

**Key Takeaways:**

* The Court emphasizes the need for clear evidence supporting summary judgment motions.
* Plaintiff's allegations of earlier harm create a factual dispute regarding the timing of damages.
* Freshman's failure to address the potential difference between his individual and trustee capacities may have contributed to the denial of his motion.

In this tentative ruling, the Judge denies Defendant Samuel Freshman's motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims in the case. The Judge finds that Freshman did not meet his burden of showing that Plaintiff’s injury occurred after December 22, 2012, a critical assumption in Freshman's argument. Freshman also failed to demonstrate that he did not own or manage the property at the time of the injury or damages. The Judge grants Plaintiff's request for judicial notice and overrules Freshman's evidentiary objections.
