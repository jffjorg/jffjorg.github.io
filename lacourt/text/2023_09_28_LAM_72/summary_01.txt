```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is continuing the final fairness hearing to October 27, 2023, due to the failure of class counsel to submit the required briefing and supporting declarations. The court had granted preliminary approval of the class settlement on April 27, 2023, but the required documents have not been filed. The court needs the briefing and declarations to determine the reasonableness of the attorney's fees sought and to ensure that the class representative is compensated for the expenses and risks incurred in conferring a benefit on other members of the class. The court orders class counsel to file the required documents by October 20, 2023.
