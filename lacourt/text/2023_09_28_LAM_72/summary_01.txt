The court needs the briefing and declarations to determine the reasonableness of the attorney's fees sought and to ensure that the class representative is compensated for the expenses and risks incurred in conferring a benefit on other members of the class. The court orders class counsel to file the required documents by October 20, 2023.

summary:

English:
The Court has granted Plaintiff Luis Garcia's motion for preliminary approval of a class action settlement in a case against Car Aroma Supplies, Inc. The Court had previously denied a similar motion in August 2022, as the complaint only set forth claims under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) and no class action claims were asserted. However, the Plaintiff filed an amended complaint in October 2022, adding class action claims.

In April 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff's motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement. The Court ordered the Plaintiff to submit briefing and supporting declarations regarding a lodestar calculation of the attorney’s fees sought, and the class representative to submit a declaration explaining why he should be compensated for the expense or risk incurred in conferring a benefit on other members of the class.

The Court has continued the final fairness hearing to Friday, October 27, 2023, as the Plaintiff has not submitted the required documents. The Plaintiff is ordered to file the required briefing and declarations with the Court by the close of business on Friday, October 20, 2023.
