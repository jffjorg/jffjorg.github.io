 Hearing Date: September

 Calendar Number: 4



 
 
Defendant Samuel Freshman (“Freshman”), who was
sued both individually and as trustee of the S and A Freshman Trust, U/T/A
6/28/89 (hereinafter, the “Trust”). 
Freshman moves for summary judgment (or, in the alternative, for summary
adjudication) as to the remaining claims in this case (the “Motion”).
 
For the reasons explained below, the Court
DENIES Freshman’s Motion. 
 
Background
Tatiana Solomon and
her husband, Norman Solomon, sued their landlords and apartment managers, naming
404 N. Maple Dr., LLC, Standard Management Company, and Samuel Freshman,
individually and as Trustee of the Trust (collectively, “Defendants”).  The lawsuit relates to several alleged
defects within an apartment unit the Solomons rented in October of 2008. The
Solomons signed a rental lease in 2008 for a unit located at 404 N. Maple
Drive, Beverly Hills, CA, 90210 (hereinafter, the “Unit”) and renewed the lease
in 2013.  The Solomons alleged that soon
after occupying the Unit, they began to experience several issues including
mold infestation, plumbing failures, vermin, and the presence of asbestos.
(Second Amended Complaint, “SAC”, ¶ 160.) 
 
On August 29, 2018,
Norman Solomon dismissed his claims. The next day, the trial court granted
Solomon’s attorney’s motion to be relieved as counsel, and the case proceeded
with Tatiana Solomon (“Plaintiff”) as the sole plaintiff, pro per. 
 
Plaintiff’s Second Amended
Complaint (“SAC”), filed June 18, 2018, alleged nine causes of action:
 
1.    
Negligence
2.    
Breach of the Warranty of Habitability
3.    
Fraud
4.    
Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
5.    
Nuisance
6.    
Breach of Contract
7.    
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
8.    
Violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200 et seq. 
9.    
Constructive Eviction
 
On March 6, 2019, the
trial court granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to each cause of
action within the Complaint. Plaintiff appealed.  On February 16, 2022, the Court of Appeal
affirmed the trial court’s grant of summary adjudication regarding Plaintiff’s
claims for fraud, breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional
distress, violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200, and the demand
for punitive damages. However, the Court of Appeal reversed the trial court’s
order granting summary adjudication for “negligence, breach of implied warranty
of habitability, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, nuisance, and
constructive eviction because landlord defendants failed to demonstrate there
was no material issue of disputed fact as to those five causes of action.” (See
decision for Tatiana Solomon v. 404 N. Maple Dr., LLC et al., (2022) ,
Case No. B297996, filed with LASC on April 22, 2022.)  
 
Freshman, who was sued
as an individual and as trustee of the Trust, filed the current Motion on
January 31, 2023.  Freshman argued that
he did not own nor manage the property that is the subject of this action and
therefore, Freshman did not owe a duty of care to Plaintiff. Freshman’s Motion
specifically addresses the causes of action that were restored to the case on
appeal: (1) the first cause of action for negligence, (2) the second cause of
action for breach of implied warranty of habitability, (3) the fourth cause of
action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, (4) the fifth cause of
action for nuisance, and (5) the ninth cause of action for constructive
eviction. 
 
Plaintiff filed her
opposition (“Opposition Papers”) on September 14, 2023. Freshman filed a reply
(“Reply Papers”) on September 21, 2023.  
 
Legal Standard
The
function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a
determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support
for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the
need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) CCP Section 437c(c) “requires
the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and
‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by
other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.)  
 
“The
function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the
scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to
disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited
by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367,
381-382.)
 
As
to each claim as framed by the complaint, the defendant moving for summary
judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to negate
an essential element, or to establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support
of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the
evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Once
the defendant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show
that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of
action or a defense thereto.  
To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
 
Preliminary Matters
 
Request for Judicial Notice - 
Freshman requests that this Court take judicial notice of
the following items:
 
1.     Plaintiff’s SAC against Defendants;
and 
2.     A December 22, 2012 Grant Deed
transferring the subject property from the S and A Freshman Trust to 404 N.
Maple Dr., LLC. 
 
The request as to item 1 is granted pursuant to CEC §
452(d)(1). The request as to item 2 is granted pursuant to CEC § 452(b). 
 
Evidentiary Objections - 
Freshman, upon reply, submitted 22 objections to the
evidence submitted by Plaintiff. The Court overrules the objections. 
 
Discussion
 
            Freshman’s
argues that he cannot be held liable because he did not own or manage the
property that contains the Unit which is the subject of this lawsuit “at the
time” that the injury occurred or damages arose.  (See Motion at pp. 6:19-21, 7:21-22, 8:21-23,
9:13-15, 10:24-26.)  According to
Freshman, the undisputed facts show that Freshman no longer held any interest
in the property after December 22, 2012, even as trustee of the Trust.  (UMF 5.) 
Because the injury arose after that date, Freshman asserts, he cannot be
liable in either his individual capacity or his capacity as trustee.
 
            Freshman’s
argument depends on the assumption that Plaintiff’s injury occurred after
December 22, 2012.  But Freshman has not
met his burden of showing that this is the case.  In support of this critical assumption, he
cites only Plaintiff’s own allegations which refer to dates in 2013 and
afterwards.  (UMF 3.)  Freshman cites no other evidence to support
this point or to establish that it is undisputed.  However, Plaintiff’s allegations also contain
assertions of earlier harm, dating back to the period before December 22, 2012
when the Trust certainly owned the property. 
Plaintiff alleges that since “the inception of
Plaintiffs’ tenancy at the property, they have been forced to reside in unsafe,
unsanitary, untenantable, and uninhabitable conditions…” (SAC, ¶ 23.) As noted
above, the tenancy commenced in 2008. Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that “Beginning
about 2010, Plaintiffs notified Defendants that their residence contained
visible microbial and fungal growth in their bathroom…” (SAC, ¶ 34.) These
allegations are repeated in ¶¶ 77, 133, and 137 in the SAC.  All of these allegations are incorporated
into each cause of action.  Because
Freshman  has not met even his initial
burden on this issue, his summary judgment Motion must be denied.
 
            Freshman also asserts that “Samuel
Freshman, as an individual or as trustee of the S and A Freshman Trust never
managed the Property, held any control over the property, or acted as an agent
for the Property owner in relation to leasing the Property.”  (UMF p. 18, number 7.)  But Freshman’s own request for judicial
notice demonstrates—through a grant deed signed by Freshman as Trustee—that the
Trust owned the relevant property prior to December 22, 2012.  (Freshman’s Request for Judicial Notice Ex.
2.)  
 
            It may be that Freshman should have
been sued solely in his capacity as trustee of the Trust and not in his
individual capacity.  However, the Motion
filed by Freshman does not squarely present the issue.  None of the arguments raised by Freshman
attempt to make this distinction. 
Instead, each argues that “Defendant Freshman” is not liable because of
the alleged later timing of Plaintiff’s injury. 
(See
Motion at pp. 6:19-21, 7:21-22, 8:21-23, 9:13-15, 10:24-26.)  The Court has rejected those arguments for
the reasons discussed above.
 
            Accordingly,
the Court denies the Motion.
