And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions in limine filed by both parties. The plaintiff, Amir Balouch, has filed seven motions to exclude certain evidence and arguments from the trial. These motions aim to exclude any mention of settlement negotiations, proposed arbitration, attorney fees and litigation costs, the plaintiff's application for financing, and statements by dealership personnel. The judge has granted all of these motions.

The defendant, General Motors, did not file any motions in limine, as they were untimely. The judge has indicated that the motions in limine are now closed, and the parties will proceed with the trial without the excluded evidence and arguments.

The judge has also granted the plaintiff's motion to establish that statements by dealership personnel are not hearsay and are admissible as evidence. The judge has excluded evidence and arguments related to the CCP 998 offer, and has granted the plaintiff's motion to exclude any mention of this offer.
