And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a denial of the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents. The Plaintiff, Marc Bensemhoun, leased premises from the Defendant, ROHCS Property Management Co., and discovered mold on the premises in September 2017. The Plaintiff notified the Defendant, but no remediation was undertaken. The Defendant served a Three Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit, and the Plaintiff filed a complaint for various claims. The Plaintiff moved to compel further responses to the request for production of documents, but the Defendant opposes the motion, citing settlement of the unlawful detainer action. The Plaintiff denies any settlement agreement. The Judge finds that the motion is untimely and, even if considered on the merits, cannot definitively determine the impacts of the settlement on the instant discovery. The Judge orders the Defendant to produce all non-privileged documents as promised and will consider the meet and confer efforts of the parties. The Judge also warns of the possibility of sanctions for any failure to produce documents.
