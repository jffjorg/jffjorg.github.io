Hearing
on OSC re: Entry of Default
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
May 9, 2023, plaintiff Mural Media, LLC 401K Plan acquired a single parcel of
real property with a multi-unit building. The property was sold pursuant to a
trustee sale following the default on the secured loan to the property by defendant
Linda Maultsby. On September 1, 2023, plaintiff filed a complaint for unlawful
detainer as to 5109 Westhaven St., Los Angeles.
 
On
October 2, 2023, the clerk entered a default against all unnamed occupants. On
October 24, 2023, the court denied Defendant’s motion to quash service of the
summons and complaint. The court ordered Defendant to serve a responsive
pleading within five (5) days of service of the order. On November 2, 2023,
Defendant filed a notice of filing of a petition for writ of mandate. On
November 30, 2023, the Appellate Division issued an order denying the writ of
mandate. 
 
On
December 12, 2023, the clerk rejected the request for entry of default
applications seeking possession of the premises, due to the failure to dismiss
all unnamed occupants. At the time of the January 5, 2024, Case Management
Conference, the court set an OSC re: Why Default Should Not Be Entered Based On
The Determination Of The Writ Proceedings Before The Court of Appeals for
January 19, 2024. On January 19, 2024, the court acknowledged the petition to
the California Supreme Court, and set a hearing date for March 5, 2024. 
 
RULING: Off-Calendar.
Plaintiff,
Mural Media, LLC 401K Plan, in its supplemental brief represents that the
California Supreme Court rejected the writ of mandate. A motion to transfer and
demurrer were also filed on January 29, and February 1, 2024, thereby
constituting at least one responsive document in compliance with the prior
motion to quash.
 
The
court therefore takes the subject OSC off-calendar. Motion to Transfer and
Demurrer set for March 26 and March 27, 2024, respectively. 
 
Clerk
to give notice to all parties.
