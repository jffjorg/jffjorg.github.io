Haber, and 330 North Genesee Avenue LLC, and located at 332.5 Genesee Ave., Los

discovered mold on the premises, and notified defendants. No remediation was
undertaken. 
 
On
February 18, 2022, Defendants filed an unlawful detainer action against
Plaintiff, which was dismissed. On May 3, 2022, Defendants served a Three Day
Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. A secont Three Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit was
served on May 16, 2022.

Warranty of Habitability (Violation of Civil Code § 1941.1), Breach of Warranty
of Habitability (Health & Safety Code § 17920.3), Breach of Warranty of

Harassment Ordinance, Los Angeles Tenant Anti Harassment Ordinance Section
45.33, and Retaliation (Cal. Civ. Code § 1940.35),
 
RULING: Denied.
Plaintiff Marc Bensemhoun moves to compel further responses
to request for production of documents, numbers 1, 2, 10 through 20, 46 through
56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66 through 70, 82, 84, 86, 95, 96, 116, 118, 119
through 122, 130, 131, 134, and 146. Defendant ROHCS Property Management Co. in
opposition maintains the motion is moot as the parties settled the instant
action via a stipulated unlawful detainer judgment. [Declaration of Benjamin
Kiss, Ex. A.] ROHCS additionally challenges the necessity of the items given
the lack of any relationship to the action. Plaintiff in reply denies any
settlement agreement on the instant action; the agreement only applies to the
separate unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff selectively reiterates the basis
for discovery of certain items. 
 
The request was served on July 9, 2023; Responses were
served on August 24, 2023. [Declaration of Michael Yadegari.] The responses
consist of the following: 
 
“Responding party incorporates into this particular response
the General Objections set forth above. Responding party further objects to
each request for production to the extent that it seeks to burden and harrass
answering party and in particular is propounded upon a perjurious declaration
and seeks requests relating to 34 affirmative defenses when there are only 13
and furthermore seems directed to a short term rental such as airbnb which are
not part of Plaintiffs complaint as such are irreleveant and not calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. 
Objection. Demand is overbroad and seeks documents protected
by attorney-client or work-product privileges. It also seeks information from
third parties and information not within its possession, custody, control, or
personal knowledge and seeks to invade privacy and disclosure of non-relevant
financial information and seeks personal records such as time sheets when the
answering party is a Corporation. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing objections, responding party
responds as follows: Responding party will provide documents that relate to the
herein lawsuit.”
 
The motion lacks any separate statement, and otherwise only
offers a generalized statement regarding the lack of a good faith effort to
produce the information. (Cal. Rules Ct., rule 3.1345(a)(3), (c), (d).) The
court may proceed without a separate statement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (b)(3).)
 
The instant motion was filed on January 23, 2024, which is
more than 45 days from the August 24, 2023, date of service. The motion lacks
any proof of extension of the time to file the instant motion. The motion is
therefore untimely. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) The court denies
the motion on this basis.
 
Even if the court considers the motion on the merits, the
court cannot definitively determine the impacts of the settlement of the
unlawful detainer on the instant discovery. Plaintiff denies any impacts in
reply. 
 
The court declines to otherwise address each every of the
identified items—1, 2, 10 through 20, 46 through 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66
through 70, 82, 84, 86, 95, 96, 116, 118, 119 through 122, 130, 131, 134, and
146—for a determination of the sufficiency of the responses simply based on the
conclusive argument regarding insufficient responses. Although Plaintiff in
reply also apparently seeks to compel promised production on number 61, 62,
66-70, 82, 84, 116, 119-122, 134, and 146, nothing in the motion actually
provides a basis of relief to compel enforcement of the represented promise for
production. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).) Plaintiff also adds in
new argument in the reply regarding the insufficient of the failure to account
for the inability to produce or identify documents under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.230. 
 
Notwithstanding the procedural bar to the motion, and partial
lack of cited, articulated support until the reply, to the extent any part of
the motion remains viable and active thereby allowing the court to address the
merits, the court orders Defendant to produce all non-privileged documents as
promised. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).) Defendant may also produce
a privilege log where applicable to be determined in a meet and confer under
Code of Civil procedure section 2031.240, subdivision (c), as well as responses
in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.230. While the court
cannot order the latter part due to the procedural bars on the motion, should
these issues return to the court in a different form, the court will be required
to impose mandatory sanctions for any failure to produce documents, which begin
at $1,000/motion, against the losing party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.050, subd.
(a).)
 
The court will not conduct any informal discovery conferences,
but will consider the meet and confer efforts of the parties. In addition to
the possibility of sanctions, continued multiple motions to compel further
responses involving voluminous amounts of items may also result in the setting
of an OSC re: Appointment of Referee.
 
Sanctions not rewarded in favor of
Plaintiff at this time. The court also declines to impose sanctions in favor of
defendant in opposition. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.050, subd. (c), 2031.310,
subd. (h).)
 
Motions
to compel further responses to admissions, special interrogatories and form
interrogatories scheduled for March 6, 20, and 21, 2024, respectively. 
 
Plaintiff
to give notice.
