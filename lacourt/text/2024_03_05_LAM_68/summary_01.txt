Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for terminating, issue, or evidentiary sanctions brought by the defendants, National General Insurance Company, National General Premier Insurance Company, and Integon Insurance Company against the plaintiffs, Pamela and Clifford Cole. The defendants had sought sanctions due to the plaintiffs' late compliance with prior orders and outstanding responses to a request for production of documents. The judge found that the plaintiffs had provided responses to all outstanding items albeit late, but not incomplete, and denied any prejudice. The judge also noted that the defendants had failed to provide a separate statement, which is statutorily required, but found that the missing statement did not preclude or inhibit consideration of the subject matter. The judge declined to impose any further sanctions based on the failure to pay outstanding sanctions and instead ordered the parties to comply with the court's orders. The trial remains set for May 13, 2024.
