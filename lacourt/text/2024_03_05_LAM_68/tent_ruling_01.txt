TERMIMATING SANCTIONS
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant, National General Insurance
Company, et al.
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs, Pamela and Clifford Cole
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion for Terminating, Evidentiary or Issue Sanctions
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiffs Pamela and Clifford Cole own certain real
property located at 28913 Medea Mesa Rod., Agoura Hills, CA. Plaintiffs
maintain an active fire insurance policy with defendants National General
Insurance Company, National General Premier Insurance Company, and Integon
Insurance Company, at all relevant times. 
 
On November 9, 2018, Plaintiffs home sustained damage
during the Woolsey Fire. Plaintiffs specifically identify damage to a retaining
wall abutting a tributary of Malibu Creek, and a deck at least partially over
the retaining wall. Plaintiffs allege the wall constitutes a covered item under
the “other structure” provision of the policy, with a coverage amount of up to
$226,522, and potentially doubled in case of a brush fire to $453,044.
Plaintiffs also allege a “code upgrade” provision in the policy, whereby any
reconstruction/repair requiring an update to current code provisions, an
entirely new concrete structure in this case, are covered. Plaintiffs maintain
Defendants improperly refuse to pay the contractually due amount for wall
repair and update, as well as for replacement of the damaged deck.
 
On October 19, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a complaint for Breach
of Contract, Tortious Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing,
and Violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. On February 24,
2022, Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint. On April 27, 2022, the
court sustained the demurrer with 10 days leave to amend. On June 17, 2022,
Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint for Breach of Contract, and
Tortious Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing.
 
RULING: Denied.
Request for Judicial Notice: Granted.
The court takes judicial notice of all filed documents,
but cannot take judicial notice of the content of the pleadings for the truth
of the matter asserted. The court also takes judicial notice of the court
orders for purposes of considering the basis of the instant motion.
 
Defendants National General Insurance Company, National
General Premier Insurance Company, Integon Insurance Company collectively moves
for terminating, issue and/or evidentiary sanctions against plaintiffs Pamela
and Clifford Cole, due to late compliance with prior orders compelling
responses, and outstanding responses to a request for production of documents
served on November 7, 2023. [Declarations of Tony Cheng, ¶¶ 13-18, Exhibits.] Plaintiffs
in a one day late opposition contend the motion lacks any valid basis:
Plaintiffs provided responses to all outstanding items albeit late, but not
incomplete. Plaintiffs deny any prejudice. Defendants in a one day late reply
contend the subject motion culminates a “history of discovery abuse” and
prejudices Defendants. 
 
“Discovery sanctions ‘should be
appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’” (Young
v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 118-119 citing Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978)
84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793; Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 608, 613.) A prerequisite to the imposition of the dismissal
sanction is that the party has willfully failed to comply with a court order. (Mileikowsky v.
Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280; Laguna
Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 481, 487
overruled on other grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997)
16 Cal.4th 469, 478, fn. 4.); Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212
Cal.App.3d 96, 114.) Preventing parties from presenting their cases on the
merits is a drastic measure; terminating sanctions should only be ordered when
there has been previous noncompliance with a rule or order and it appears a less
severe sanction would not be effective.  (Link v. Cater (1998)
60 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1326; Department of Forestry & Fire Protection
v. Howell¿(2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191 [“Terminating sanctions are to
be used sparingly because of the drastic effect of their
application.”].) “The trial court may order a terminating sanction for
discovery abuse ‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the]
conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to
the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
the discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez¿(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)  
 
Evidence or issue sanctions may
be imposed only after parties violated discovery orders compelling further
responses, except in exceptional circumstances, including where there was
sufficiently egregious misconduct regarding a failure to respond to discovery,
or a prior discovery order would be futile. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Sup.
Ct. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1428.) “The discovery statutes
thus ‘evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and
ending with the ultimate sanction
of termination.’ (Citation.) Although in extreme
cases a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction as a first
measure (Citations), a terminating sanction should generally not be imposed
until the court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be
unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be
ineffective.” (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566,
604.) To avoid sanctions, the burden of proving
that a discovery violation was not willful is on the party on whom the
discovery was served. (Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66
Cal.App.3d 250, 252- 253.)
 
The motion lacks a separate
statement is statutorily required under California Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a)(7). The court finds the missing statement in no way precludes or
inhibits consideration of the subject matter. The court therefore addresses the
substance of the requested relief.
 
The essence of the motion
appears as a result of delayed responses to previously court ordered discovery,
as well as outstanding responses to an item recently addressed by court (see
2-27-24 order on motion to compel responses to supplemental request for
production of documents). The latter items remain within the ordered compliance
period, and the court therefore finds no violation as of the date of this
order. It remains undisputed, the previously court ordered responses were in
fact provided.
 
On these bases, the court finds
no actual basis for a violation of a court order justifying terminating, issue,
or evidentiary sanctions simply based on either delayed service or a premature
declaration of non-compliance with a pending court order. Additionally, failure
to pay monetary sanctions never supports the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (Newland v. Superior Court (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th
at p. 615.) The court declines to impose any further sanctions based on the
failure to pay outstanding sanctions.
 
Public policy also disfavors
such sanctions simply under the circumstances where the result would lead to an
effective “avoidance of a decision on the merits.” (Rutledge
v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194 accord McGinty
v. Superior Court (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 204, 214 [“On balance, we conclude
that it was excessive and an abuse of discretion for the trial court to impose
the preclusive witness and evidence sanction in this case for Hood's violation
of the authority of another court, where no real harm has been done to Avco,
and where the punishment falls most harshly not on the supposed malefactor but
on the petitioners in their ability to have their case decided on the merits.”]
 
A court can
impose additional monetary sanctions for the costs associated with a valid motion.
(Manlin v. Milner (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th
1004, 1025 [“For a trial court to decline to award any amount of monetary
sanctions when it finds discovery misconduct has occurred is arbitrary and an
abuse of discretion”].) The court finds no justification for this particular
motion simply due to late responses and a lack of a current violation on
pending orders. Nothing in the motion establishes a violation of any prior order,
thereby establishing necessity for another motion. Plaintiffs were already
sanctioned for the prior delayed responses.
 
Motion for summary judgment on March 6, 2024. Trial
remains set for May 13, 2024.
