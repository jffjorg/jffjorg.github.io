  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANT
  METRO’S DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT; 
 
DEFENDANT
  METRO’S MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT



 
Background
Plaintiff Jason Anderson
(“Plaintiff”) filed a “Complaint for Negligence” in this action on January 9,
2024 against Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(“Defendant”).
Defendant now demurs to
the Complaint. Defendant also moves to strike portions of the Complaint. Plaintiff
opposes both. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter,
the Court notes that Defendant’s counsel’s declaration in support of the
demurrer indicates, inter alia, that “[p]rior to the filing of
this Demurrer, Metro’s counsel sent a detailed correspondence regarding this
instant Demurrer. As of the date of the filing of Metro’s demurrer, no
agreement has been reached. Due to the responsive pleading deadline, Metro was
required to proceed with the instant Demurrer pending a further meet and
confer. If a stipulation or agreement is entered, the instant Demurrer will
immediately be taken off calendar.” (Liu Decl., ¶ 2.) In addition, Defendant’s
counsel’s declaration in support of the motion to strike provides, inter
alia, that “[p]rior to the filing of this Motion, Metro’s counsel made a
good faith attempt to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel. As of the date
of the filing of Metro’s Motion, no agreement has been reached. Due to the
responsive pleading deadline, Metro was required to proceed with the instant
Motion pending a further meet and confer. If a stipulation or agreement is
entered, the instant Motion will immediately be taken off calendar.” (Liu
Decl., ¶ 2.) 
The Court notes that Defendant’s
counsel’s declarations do not demonstrate that the parties met and
conferred in person, by telephone, or by video
conference, or that Defendant’s
counsel attempted to do so. Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis
added.) In addition, “[b]efore filing a motion to
strike pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in
person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining
if an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a), emphasis
added.) Such meeting and conferring
must be done in good faith with an effort to try to resolve the issues subject
to the demurrer and motion to strike. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Defendant’s
demurrer and motion to strike is continued to _______________, 2024 at 2
p.m. in Dept. 50. 
Defendant
is¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiff within 10 days of the date of this
order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the
parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, Defendant is to¿thereafter¿file
and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in
compliance with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a)(3) and Code
of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this order.
