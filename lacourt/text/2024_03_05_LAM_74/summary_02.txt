And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to enforce a settlement agreement filed by Plaintiffs Oscar Andrade and Ma Del Refugio Guillen Llamas against Defendants Viridi Construction, Inc. and Javier Suarez. The Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants have not complied with the terms of the settlement agreement. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the Defendants entered into the settlement agreement in the first place, as the attached agreement does not include the Defendants' signatures. Therefore, the Judge denies the Plaintiffs' motion and orders them to give notice.
