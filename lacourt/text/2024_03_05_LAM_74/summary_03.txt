And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the plaintiff's motion to set aside the defaults entered against the defendants. The plaintiff, Brown Strauss, Inc., filed a complaint against Acme Metals & Steel Supply, Inc., et al. on December 29, 2020, and the court entered defaults against Equitable Transition Inc., Acme Metals & Steel Supply, and Acme Metals LLC on May 12 and 19, 2021, respectively. The plaintiff later filed a request for dismissal without prejudice, which was rejected due to the defaults. The court instructed the plaintiff to set aside the defaults before dismissing the complaint. The plaintiff has now filed a motion to set aside the defaults, which the judge has granted. This allows the plaintiff to dismiss the complaint in this action.
