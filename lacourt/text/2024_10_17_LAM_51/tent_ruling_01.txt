STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On November 8, 2023, Plaintiff Keven Theophile (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against Defendant Treehouse Leimert Propco, LLC (Defendant)
with five causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract/Covenant of Quiet
Enjoyment/Warranty of Habitability; (2) Tortious Breach of the Implied Warranty
of Habitability; (3) Private Nuisance; (4) Violation of Unfair Business
Practices; and (5) Constructive Eviction.
 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff was a tenant at 4425
Crenshaw Blvd., Apt. 10, Los Angeles, California 90043 (the Property) owned by
Defendant. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant constructively evicted him
on/around January 4, 2021 due to numerous health and safety violations.
 
On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed Proof of Service of
Summons indicating substituted service on March 12, 2024 with date of mailing on
March 13, 2024.
 
On May 24, 2024, Plaintiff requested entry of default
against Defendant which was entered.
 
On July 2, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to set
aside/vacate the default. As of October 14, 2024, Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect…¿ [The application]¿shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”¿ CCP¿§¿473(b).¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Although a trial court has discretion to vacate the entry
of a default or subsequent judgment, this discretion may be exercised only
after the party seeking relief has shown that there is a proper ground for
relief, and that the party has raised that ground in a procedurally proper
manner, within any applicable time limits.”
¿(Cruz v.¿Fagor¿America, Inc. (2007)
146 Cal.App.4th 488, 495.) “The defendant must … demonstrate a satisfactory
excuse for not responding to the original action in a timely manner.”¿(Id.¿at 504.) Moving parties have the
initial burden to prove excusable neglect by a preponderance of competent
evidence.¿(Kendall v. Barker¿(1988)
197 Cal.App.3d 619, 624.)¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Defendant contends the default should be set aside because
Plaintiff did not serve notice of the request for entry of default on Defendant.
Defendant also contends that default should be set aside because its staff
turnover delayed receipt until well after the responsive pleading deadline and
it did not expect Plaintiff to file suit since he accepted an offer to
voluntarily vacate the Property more than three years ago. Plaintiff did not
file an opposition.
 
“What is a reasonable time in any case depends upon the
circumstances of that particular case” and “whether a party has acted
diligently is a factual question for the trial court.” (Younessi v. Woolf (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 1137, 1145 [internal
citations omitted].) CCP § 473(b) “is construed liberally to further the policy
of adjudicating legal controversies on the merits.” (Id. at p. 1146.) The question is “whether a reasonably prudent
person under the same or similar circumstances would have made the same error.”
(Ibid.) Because the law strongly
favors trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in allowing
discretionary relief from adverse orders for mistake, inadvertence, surprise,
or excusable neglect must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from
default. (Huh v. Wang (2007) 158
Cal.App.4th 1406.) 
 
Here, discretionary relief is warranted. First, Defendant
timely sought to set aside default. Defendant moved to set aside default 39
days after entry of default which is well within six months. Second, Defendant’s
contention that Plaintiff did not serve the request for entry of default
properly is well taken. Indeed, the address on the request for entry of default
that is purportedly for Defendant is the address for the registered process
server on the proof of service of summons Plaintiff filed on March 13, 2024. (March
13, 2024 Proof of Service, item 7.) Mailing to the process server is hardly
notice to the Defendant and the court is not convinced that CCP § 587 precludes
setting aside default for plainly wrong mailing affidavits. Third, Defendant
provides declarations indicating staff turnover impacting the ability to timely
receive mail – including the Summons and Complaint.[1]
(Walker Decl. ¶¶ 4-8.) Indeed, Defendant did not receive the Summons and
Complaint until June 5, 2024. (Walker Decl. ¶ 14.) Defendant immediately
retained counsel and has been diligently engaging with this matter. (Walker
Decl. ¶ 15; Forrest Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8-9; Palpallatoc Decl. ¶ 3.) Finally, there is
no indication that Plaintiff will be prejudiced should the court set aside the
default.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to set
aside/vacate the default entered on May 24, 2024.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.Motion to Set Aside/Vacate the
May 24, 2024 default is GRANTED;
2.Defendant to file its ANSWER
within 5 days of this hearing.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
