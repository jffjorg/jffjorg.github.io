And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by F. Michael Sabzevar, attorney for plaintiff Jeff Dargah, to be relieved as counsel of record. The court may grant this motion if the attorney takes reasonable steps to avoid prejudice to the client's rights and provides adequate notice. Sabzevar has lost contact with his client and served him by mail at his last known address, which was confirmed within the past 30 days. The court requires Sabzevar to provide a completed form MC-053 (Proposed Order) to complete the motion. If he does so at the hearing, the motion will be granted, and the order will take effect upon the filing of proof of service on the client.
