Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel third-party compliance and impose sanctions on Realty Advisors and Asset Managers Inc. (RAAM), Joseph Duerr, and Christopher Duerr. The motion was brought by Plaintiffs Cynthia D. Finerty and RSH Properties I LLC.

The Judge finds that RAAM failed to produce certain responsive documents in native format and failed to comply with the court's order to provide a code-compliant custodian declaration. However, the Judge is not persuaded that RAAM's failure was made in bad faith or willful.

The Judge grants a limited forensic examination of RAAM's work devices and storage for the three property management agreements and the July 2015, certificate. The Judge also orders Plaintiffs and Defendant to split the cost of this limited examination.

The Judge grants partial monetary sanctions of $2,500 against RAAM and their counsel, payable within 30 days. The Judge also requires RAAM to serve a code-compliant custodian declaration for production of documents under the subpoena within 10 days.

The Judge finds that the motion was not entirely successful on the merits and that RAAM's failure was not willful. The Judge therefore grants only partial sanctions rather than the full $20,000 requested by Plaintiffs.
