English text:
The Judge has issued a tentative ruling indicating that the Defendant did not serve a valid objection under CCP § 2025.410 for a defective deposition notice that did not comply with Article 2 (CCP § 2025.210 et seq.). The types of objections contemplated by CCP § 2025.210 et seq. deal with procedural requirements such as when a defendant or plaintiff may serve a deposition notice, the contents required to be included in a deposition notice, to whom notice of the deposition must be given, the location of the deposition, the number of days required to be given in advance of the deposition, and the manner of service upon party deponents.

Before, during, or after a deposition, any party, deponent, or other affected natural person or organization may promptly move for a protective order under CCP § 2025.420(a) & (b). The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense. This protective order may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following directions: that certain matters not be inquired into, that the scope of the examination be limited to certain matters, or that all or certain of the writings or tangible things designated in the deposition notice not be produced.
