And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a deposition notice served by the Plaintiff. The Defendant failed to serve a valid objection to the notice, which did not comply with Article 2 of the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 2025.210 et seq. The court notes that the types of objections contemplated by CCP § 2025.210 et seq. deal with procedural requirements such as the timing and content of deposition notices, to whom notice must be given, and the location of the deposition. The court finds that the Defendant has not shown good cause to object to the deposition notice and may grant a protective order to limit the scope of the examination or to protect the parties from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression. The court will consider the parties' arguments and evidence at the upcoming hearing before making a final ruling.
