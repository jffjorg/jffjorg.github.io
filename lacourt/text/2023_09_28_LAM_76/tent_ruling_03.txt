ANALYSIS 
Motion To Dismiss
Discussion
Defendants Aleks Lewandowski and Nastassia
Posner move for a judgment of dismissal pursuant to the Court’s order of June
23, 2023 sustaining Defendants’ demurrer without leave to amend as to the two
causes of action asserted against Defendants Lewandowski and Posner. 
Civ. Proc. Code, § 581(f)(1)
provides:
 
(f) The court may
dismiss the complaint as to that defendant when:
 
(1) Except
where Section 597[1] applies,
after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained without leave to amend and
either party moves for dismissal.

     (Civ.
Proc. Code § 581(f)(1).)
 
On June 23, 2023, the Court sustained Defendants’ demurrer
to the Second Amended Complaint without leave to amend as to the first and
sixth causes of action as to defendants Lewandowski and Posner, which were the
only causes of action asserted against them. Plaintiff’s request that she be
given additional time to retain counsel so she can properly amend the complaint
is denied. A party represented by counsel would not be given such an
opportunity, and pro per litigants are not entitled to special treatment in
this regard. .  (See Harding
v. Collazo (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 1044, 1056; Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1276,
1284.)
            As such,
dismissal pursuant to Civ. Proc. Code, § 581(f)(1) is proper to Defendants
Lewandowski and Posner. “Judgment in a multiparty case
determining all issues as to one or more parties may be treated as final even
though issues remain to be resolved between other parties.” (Morehart v. Cty. of Santa Barbara (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 725, 740 [bold emphasis
added].)
            The motion
for judgment of dismissal is GRANTED.
