## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendants Lewandowski and Posner's motion for judgment of dismissal. This means the lawsuit against them will be dismissed. 

The Judge's decision is based on their previous ruling where they sustained the Defendants' demurrer (a legal objection) to the Plaintiff's complaint without allowing the Plaintiff to amend it.  

The Plaintiff had requested more time to find an attorney and amend the complaint, but the Judge denied this request, stating that pro se litigants (those who represent themselves) are not entitled to special treatment.

This dismissal only applies to Defendants Lewandowski and Posner. It does not necessarily mean the entire lawsuit is dismissed, as there may be other parties involved.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion for judgment of dismissal. The defendants, Aleks Lewandowski and Nastassia Posner, had filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint, which was sustained without leave to amend on June 23, 2023. The plaintiff, who is representing herself, had requested additional time to retain counsel and amend the complaint, but this request was denied. The Judge found that dismissal pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 581(f)(1) is proper, as the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend and the plaintiff has not shown any grounds for relief. The Judge also noted that a judgment in a multiparty case can be treated as final even if issues remain to be resolved between other parties. The defendants' motion for judgment of dismissal is therefore granted.
