And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Aleks Lewandowski and Nastassia Posner, move for a judgment of dismissal pursuant to the court's order sustaining their demurrer without leave to amend. The court grants their motion. The defendants' demurrer was sustained without leave to amend as to the first and sixth causes of action, which are the only causes of action asserted against them. The plaintiff's request for additional time to retain counsel is denied, as parties represented by counsel would not be given such an opportunity and pro per litigants are not entitled to special treatment. The court finds that dismissal is proper under California Civil Procedure Code section 581(f)(1).
