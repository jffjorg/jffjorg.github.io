And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English:

The Court has denied Plaintiff's motions to compel Defendants to produce documents, as the Defendants have already served amended responses to the Requests for Production of Documents, Set No. One. The Court has also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions, as Plaintiff has not shown that he has incurred any expenses related to the motion. The Court has also denied Defendants' request for sanctions against Plaintiff, as Plaintiff has not engaged in any misuse of the discovery process.
