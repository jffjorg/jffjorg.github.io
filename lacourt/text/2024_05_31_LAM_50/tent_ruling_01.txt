Case No.:


19STCV46503




Hearing Date:


May 31, 2024




Hearing Time:


10:00 a.m. 




ORDER RE:
AMENDED MOTION
  FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER RE: DEPOSITION OF DEFENDANT AARONOFF, AND FOR MONETARY
  SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $4,050




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Defendant Vidala Aaronoff (“Aaronoff”) moves for a protective order
that prohibits Plaintiff Curtis R. Olson from taking Aaronoff’s deposition.
Aaronoff’s motion will be continued to a new
date as set forth below. NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON MAY 31, 2024.    
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court
orders the parties in this case to participate in a meet and confer with the
Court (“Informal Discovery Conference” or “IDC”). Lead or other
designated counsel for the parties with full authority are ordered to
participate in person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel
regarding available dates, Aaronoff must make
a prompt reservation for the IDC using the Court’s online reservation system. Aaronoff
must file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the
department seven days prior to the IDC, and the responding parties may file the
same form in the department setting forth a response three days prior to the
IDC.   
Once Aaronoff has confirmed
an IDC date, Aaronoff must use the Court’s
online reservation system to continue the motion to a post-IDC discovery
hearing date. The parties are ordered to have with them whatever materials are
needed to make the IDC session productive and successful. Prior to the IDC
date, lead or other designated counsel for the parties, with full authority,
are to meet and confer, in person or via telephone in
a further attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before the IDC.
(See CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).) If the parties resolve their
discovery disputes before the IDC date, Aaronoff is ordered to take both the IDC and the motion off calendar
as soon as possible. 
Aaronoff is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
