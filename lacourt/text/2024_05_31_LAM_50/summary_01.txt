Here is the English-text summary:

Judge Teresa A. Beaudet's tentative ruling in the case of Curtis R. Olson vs. Vidala Aaronoff et al. grants defendant Aaronoff's motion to continue the hearing on the amended motion for protective order regarding the deposition of defendant Aaronoff and for monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,050. The court orders the parties to participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) session to resolve their discovery disputes. The IDC session will be scheduled at a later date, and the parties are required to file an IDC form before the session. The court also orders the parties to meet and confer in person or via telephone to resolve their issues before the IDC date. If the parties resolve their discovery disputes before the IDC date, Aaronoff is ordered to take both the IDC and the motion off calendar as soon as possible.
