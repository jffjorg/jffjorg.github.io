JOHN SEPULVEDA 
 
        
  vs.
 
FCA US, LLC 
 


 Case
  No.:  23STCV07157  
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: April 12, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel initial responses is MOOT. Defendant is sanctioned, jointly
and severally with counsel, $350 per motion, for a total of $1,400. 
 
            On
4/3/2023, Plaintiff John Sepulveda (Plaintiff) filed suit against FCA US, LLC,
alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. 
 
            On
12/14/2023, Plaintiff moved to compel Defendant’s initial responses to: (1)
Form Interrogatories, Set One; (2) Special Interrogatories, Set One; (3)
Requests for Admissions, Set One; and (4) Requests for Production of Documents,
Set One (collectively, the “Discovery”).
 
Discussion
 
            As
a preliminary matter, Plaintiff must issue filing fees for four motions, given
that this omnibus motion consolidates four different discovery sets into a
single motion. 
 
            In
opposition, Defendant clarifies that outstanding responses have been provided. However,
Defendant argues that the right to assert objections should not be waived
because the failure to timely respond was the product of “mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect,” depends on the facts of the case. (See
City of Fresno v. Super. Ct. (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1466-1467.) 
 
            Given
that initial responses have been provided, the substance of this motion is
moot. The Court declines to take up Defendant’s contention that it is also
entitled to relief from waiver. As noted by Plaintiff in reply, such a request
requires a separate noticed motion. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300 and 2033.280.) The
Court strongly urges the party to meet and confer and resolve this issue
informally. 
 
Despite
Defendant providing responses, the Court still finds sanctions to be warranted.
Defendant contends that the failure to respond was because “counsel for FCA US
inadvertently overlooked the one single email containing all of the discovery
requests at issue. Amidst the substantial increase in Song-Beverly matters, we
have experienced a substantial increase in emails which contributed to the
oversight. While we do have protocols in place to try to avoid such errors,
this is the type of excusable human error that occurs in life, especially in
light of the increase in emails during the course of the pandemic and remote
work. As a result, the discovery went undetected and the deadline to provide
timely responses lapsed. Given the circumstances, a reasonably prudent person
might well have made the same mistake as counsel.” (Opp., 3: 18-19.) 
 
            However,
in reply, Plaintiff submits evidence which challenges Defendant’s
characterization contention. First, Plaintiff provided two email reminders in
writing: one on September 15, 2023, and another on September 20, 2023. (Xie
Decl. at ¶¶ 5-8, Ex. 2-3). Indeed, Defendant even acknowledged receipt of the
September 20, 2023, correspondence that same day, stating that Defendant would
send responses by October 4, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 8, Ex. 4) Then, on November 7,
2023, Plaintiff again emailed Defendant to request the overdue discovery
responses (Id. at ¶ 9, Ex. 5).
 
As such,
while Defendant’s conduct may still constitute reasonable inadvertence or
excusable neglect for relief purposes, this motion was still necessary and thus
sanctions are warranted.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to compel initial responses is moot. Defendant is
sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $350 per motion. ($350/hr x 1
hr.) 
 
It is so ordered.
