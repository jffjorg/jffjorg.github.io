And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of John Sepulveda vs. FCA US, LLC. The plaintiff's motion to compel initial responses is considered moot since the defendant has provided the requested responses. However, the court still finds sanctions to be warranted due to the defendant's failure to respond in a timely manner. The defendant claimed that the failure was due to "mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect", but the plaintiff disputed this claim. As a result, the court has imposed sanctions of $350 per motion, totaling $1,400.
