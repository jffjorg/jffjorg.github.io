Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has ruled on the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's Complaint's Fifth Cause of Action for Fraud - Fraudulent Inducement - Concealment and the Defendant's Motion to Strike the Plaintiff's claim for punitive damages. The Judge has OVERRULED the Defendant's demurrer and DENIED the Motion to Strike.

The Plaintiff, Jose Luis Velasco, alleges that the Defendant, General Motors, LLC, fraudulently induced him into purchasing a 2017 Chevrolet Colorado with a transmission defect that caused sudden and premature failure. The Judge found that the Complaint contains adequate allegations to support a cause of action for fraud and that the Defendant's arguments that the claim fails to state a claim are without merit.

The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to give notice and has set a deadline of 20 days for the Plaintiff to file an answer. The Defendant's Motion to Strike punitive damages is denied, as the Plaintiff properly alleged a fraud cause of action.
