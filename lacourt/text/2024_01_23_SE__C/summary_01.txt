And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting Ideal Ventures, LLC's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The proposed amended complaint adds new causes of action, including conversion and fraud, and alleges that Tim Childress and other defendants failed to deliver containers to Ideal Ventures, LLC and engaged in fraudulent activities. The judge finds that the amendments are necessary to properly plead the claims and will not prejudice the defendants. The judge also notes that the trial is currently scheduled for September 2024, providing sufficient time for the parties to litigate the additional claims. Finally, the judge allows the defendants to take the deposition of Israel Goldstein and Ideal Ventures, LLC's person most knowledgeable again for the limited purpose of obtaining discovery on the new cause of action.
