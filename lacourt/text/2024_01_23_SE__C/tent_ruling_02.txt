 Case Number:  22NWCV01118    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  C Whittier Citycenter, LLC vs A & A Fabrication and
Polishing Corporation, et al., Case No.: 22NWCV01118
This case was originally filed as an unlawful detainer. In
April 2023, Defendants surrendered possession of the premises, and Plaintiff
subsequently discovered substantial damage to the premises. After Plaintiff’s
unlawful detainer counsel was unable to secure a settlement at the court
ordered MSC, Plaintiff substituted in general civil litigation counsel, as
Plaintiff’s old counsel only handles unlawful detainer cases. Plaintiff seeks
to amend the complaint to: 1) remove the issue of possession; and 2) include
all damages it is entitled to, which includes damages to the premises
discovered after Defendants vacated the premises.
 
A party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual
showing "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis
for granting relief ex parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
 
Plaintiff contends the earliest hearing date available at
the time Plaintiff reserved a hearing date on its Motion for Leave to Amend was
August 20, 2024. There were no hearing dates available for a motion for leave
to amend until after the trial, which is set for April 5, 2024. Without an
earlier hearing date, Plaintiff will not be able to include all damages
available to her, including those damages discovered when Defendants vacated
the premises, which was after Plaintiff filed its First Amended Complaint. As
such, Plaintiff may suffer irreparable harm.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff Whittier Citycenter, LLC’s Ex Parte
Application to ADVANCE the Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint is GRANTED. 
The Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint is ADVANCED from Tuesday, August
20, 2024, to Tuesday, February 20, 2024. Opposition and Reply papers to be filed and served per Code
in accordance with the new hearing date.
