And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by defendants Roy Lee and RL Films2, Inc. to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) due to failure to bring the matter to trial within three years, failure to pay attorneys' fees, and failure to obey court orders. The defendants argue that the court should reinstate its prior dismissal of the SAC. However, the judge finds that the court's fee award has been paid and that an evidentiary sanction applies for the failure to produce documents. The judge decides not to dismiss the SAC at this time and denies the motion to dismiss. The judge encourages counsel to review and submit on the tentative ruling, and notes that counsel may appear via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
