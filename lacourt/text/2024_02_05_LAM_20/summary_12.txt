And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion by Plaintiff Selim Hoxha to compel further responses to his requests for production, which were propounded to Defendant The Regents of the University of California. The defendant argues that the meet and confer process had not ended, as they had promised to provide supplemental responses but needed more time. The plaintiff contends that their meet and confer effort was sufficient, having already granted the defendant multiple extensions to provide supplemental responses. The judge denies the motion without prejudice, given that the defendant is willing to supplement their responses and the trial date is set for June 30, 2025. The parties are ordered to further meet and confer, and the plaintiff may renew their motion if necessary after receiving the supplemental responses. The judge declines to award sanctions at this time.
