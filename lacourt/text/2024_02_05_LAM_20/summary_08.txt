Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the Defendant's Motion for Summary Adjudication and Summary Judgment. The Judge denies the Motion as to the first, second, fourth, and fifth causes of action, and grants the Motion as to the seventh cause of action. The first cause of action is for whistleblower retaliation, and the Judge finds that there are triable issues as to whether the Defendant's actions were retaliatory. The second cause of action is for retaliation under Government Code § 8547, and the Judge also finds that there are triable issues as to whether the Defendant's actions were retaliatory. The fourth cause of action is for FEHA harassment, and the Judge finds that there is evidence of harassment and that the Defendant failed to carry its burden to show that the harassment was not severe or pervasive. The fifth cause of action is for FEHA discrimination, and the Judge finds that there are triable issues as to whether the Defendant's actions were discriminatory. The seventh cause of action is for "damages for inventor's share", and the Judge grants the Motion as to this cause of action because it is not based on a statute.
