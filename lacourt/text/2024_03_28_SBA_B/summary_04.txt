And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by plaintiff's attorney, Mfon Anthony Ikon. The court finds that Ikon and the plaintiff have encountered irreconcilable differences that have made it impossible for Ikon to continue representing the plaintiff. The court also finds that Ikon has satisfied the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, and has shown sufficient reason why the motion should be granted. As a result, the court orders that Ikon is relieved as counsel of record for the plaintiff, effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed "Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel â€“ Civil" form.
