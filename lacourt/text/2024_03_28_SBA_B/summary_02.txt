SIGNIFICANT STATEMENTS:
  "The right to arbitration depends upon contract; a petition to compel arbitration is simply a suit in equity seeking specific performance of that contract."
  "The parties mutually agree to resolve any and all disputes between them or between You and any of Instawork's parents, subsidiaries, affiliates including Partners, successors, assigns, officers, directors, employees, and/or agents exclusively through final, binding, and individual arbitration instead of filing a lawsuit in court."
  "The doctrine of equitable estoppel applies: (1) when the signatory must rely on the terms of the written agreement containing the arbitration clause in asserting its claims against the nonsignatory; or (2) when the signatory alleges substantially interdependent and concerted misconduct by the nonsignatory and a signatory and the alleged misconduct is founded in or intimately connected with the obligations of the underlying agreement."
