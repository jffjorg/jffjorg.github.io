And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the evidence presented and is inclined to rule in favor of the moving defendants. The plaintiff argues that she did not receive the opt-out agreement, but the judge finds that the moving defendants provided evidence of the customary practice for new hires to receive the agreement and acknowledgement form. The judge is also persuaded by the evidence presented, including exhibits and declarations, that the plaintiff did have access to information required to electronically sign the acknowledgement form. The judge disagrees with the plaintiff's argument that the moving defendants did not explain what arbitration was, citing evidence that the plaintiff accessed and viewed a video on arbitration as part of her training. The judge also finds that the moving defendants' requirement that the opt-out form be mailed to Ohio is reasonable, as it protects the employee from their supervisor and others in the workplace from learning they decided to opt-out. The judge notes that the plaintiff relies on two cases that are no longer good law, and that the agreement in question sets out the rules and procedures for arbitration in detail. Overall, the judge is inclined to deny the plaintiff's motion and enforce the agreement.
