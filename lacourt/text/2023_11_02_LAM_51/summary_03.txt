Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by the defendant, Jorge Luis Ravelo, and a motion to set aside default filed by the same defendant. The plaintiff, Saul Marroquin, has brought a lawsuit against the defendant seeking to foreclose on a property. The defendant disputes the service of the summons and complaint, alleging that the service was improper. The court disagrees with the defendant and denies the motion to quash service of summons and complaint.

The defendant also moved to set aside a default that was entered against him in July 2023. The court grants the motion, finding that the defendant has demonstrated good cause for setting aside the default. The court orders the defendant to file a standalone document captioned "Answer" within 10 days of the order setting aside the default.

The defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint is denied, and the plaintiff's motion to set aside default is granted.
