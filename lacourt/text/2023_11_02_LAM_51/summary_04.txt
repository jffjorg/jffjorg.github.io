And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Upinder S. Kalra, has issued a tentative ruling in the case Adi Dweck v. Tesla Motors, Inc. (Case No. 23STCV11097). The case involves a motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendant, Tesla Motors, Inc. The plaintiff, Adi Dweck, has not filed an opposition to the motion.

The Judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration, stating that the defendant has met its initial burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement by attaching a copy of the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement to the motion. The agreement was signed by the plaintiff when he purchased the 2022 Tesla Y, VIN 7SAYGAEE6NF420172, from the defendant. The Judge has also determined that the agreement covers the dispute at issue, which concerns the plaintiff's claim that the vehicle manifested defects and that the defendant failed to service or repair the vehicle.

The Judge has ordered the action to be stayed pending arbitration. The moving party is to give notice, and an order to show cause (OSC) is set for April 16, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.

The Judge's ruling is based on California law and relevant case citations, including Giuliano v. Inland Empire Personnel, Inc., Weeks v. Crow, Titolo v. Cano, California Correctional Peace Officers' Ass'n v. State, Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co., and Bannister v. Marinidence Opco, LLC.
