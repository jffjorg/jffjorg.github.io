And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the moving defendant, Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company. The parties had previously agreed to extend the deadline for the defendant's responsive pleading until July 28, 2023, which the defendant has now done. The judge notes that the trademark "Philadelphia Insurance Companies A member of the Tokio Marine Group" appears on the insurance policy, but it is not the name of the insurer. The plaintiff has failed to provide any authority to support their position, and their opposition is only one paragraph. The judge also questions whether the plaintiff has attached the correct policy, as "Tokio Marine" is not mentioned on any page of the policy. The judge's tentative ruling suggests that the plaintiff's motion may not have merit, and that the defendant's answer may be sufficient.
