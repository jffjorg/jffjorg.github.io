STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
Plaintiffs Jem Community Center and BSD Properties, LLC
(Plaintiffs) filed a complaint on October 24, 2022. Defendants Philadelphia
Insurance Indemnity Insurance Company and Tokio Marine Specialty Insurance
Company (Defendants) filed a Demurrer and Motion to Strike that the court
sustained with leave to amend on May 22, 2023 (motion to strike mooted).
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) on June 13, 2013 with two causes
of action for: (1) Breach of Contract; and (2) Breach of Obligation of Good Faith.
 
The complaint alleges that Plaintiff and Defendants had an
insurance policy whereby Defendants would indemnify Plaintiff for fire damages.
In October 2020, Plaintiffs’ structure suffered damage from a fire. However, in
August 2022, Defendants refused to reimburse Plaintiffs for the damage.
 
Defendant Tokio Marine Specialty Insurance Company (Moving Defendant)
timely filed a Demurrer on July 28, 2023.[1]
 
Plaintiffs timely filed an opposition on October 3, 2023.
 
Defendant timely filed a reply on October 12, 2023.
 
Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Attachment, pursuant to the
court’s order, on October 25, 2023 to attach the insurance policy purportedly
attached to the FAC as Exhibit 1.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
The court grants Defendants’ request for judicial notice as
to Exhibits A. (Evid. Code § 452(c), (h); See Kalnoki v. First American Trustee Servicing
Solutions, LLC (2017) 8
Cal.App.5th 23,37.) However, the court only takes judicial notice of the
foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of
public records and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice
of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App.
5th 389, 400.)¿ 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Prior to filing a demurrer, the demurring party is required
to satisfy their meet and confer obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc.
(CCP) §430.41 and demonstrate that they so satisfied their meet and confer
obligation by submitting a declaration pursuant to CCP §430.41(a)(2) & (3). Here, the parties sufficiently met and conferred via several
email exchanges. (Greer Decl. ¶¶ 2-4.) Therefore, the meet and confer
requirement is met.
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. …. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether
the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a
cause of action.” (Hahn 147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Breach of Contract
 
Moving Defendant contends that it is not a party to the
insurance policy subject to the FAC and, as such, it has no contractual
relationship with Plaintiffs.[2]
 Additionally, Moving Defendant argues it
did not issue the policy and its name does not appear on the policy. Plaintiffs
argue that the phrase “A member of the Tokio Marine Group” is designed to
impart substance and solidity to the insurance being provided.[3]
 
“To establish a cause of action for breach of contract, the
plaintiff must plead and prove (1) the existence of the contract, (2) the
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s
breach, and (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff. [Citation.]” (Maxwell v. Dolezal (2014) 231
Cal.App.4th 93, 97-98.) “A written contract may be pleaded either by its terms
– set out verbatim in the complaint or a copy of the contract attached to the
complaint and incorporated therein by reference – or by its legal effect.
[Citation.] In order to plead a contract by its legal effect, plaintiff must
‘allege the substance of its relevant terms.’” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th
972, 993.) 
 
As a threshold matter, the court does not consider
unpublished opinions in its analysis. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 8.115(a).) Accordingly,
the court disregards Moving Defendant’s authority to the extent it is
inconsistent with this rule.
 
Upon reviewing the FAC and the Insurance Policy Plaintiffs
filed with their Notice of Attachment on October 25, 2023, the court agrees
with Moving Defendant that it is not a party to the subject insurance policy.[4]
Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not pleaded or proved that a contract exists
between themselves and Moving Defendant.
 
Therefore, Moving Defendant’s Demurrer to the First Cause
of Action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
Breach of
Obligation of Good Faith 
 
Because Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of the obligation of
good faith depends on the existence of a contract, it fails without an
underlying contract.
 
Therefore, Moving Defendant’s Demurrer to the Second
Cause of Action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Demurrer
is SUSTAINED in its entirety with 15 days leave to amend.
 
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
