Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Tokio Marine Specialty Insurance Company (Moving Defendant) against the first amended complaint filed by Jem Community Center and BSD Properties, LLC (Plaintiffs). The demurrer seeks to dismiss the complaint for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract and breach of obligation of good faith.

The court finds that the Moving Defendant is not a party to the insurance policy subject to the first amended complaint. Therefore, Plaintiffs have not pleaded or proved that a contract exists between themselves and the Moving Defendant.

As a result, the court sustains the demurrer in its entirety with leave to amend. The court also finds that the complaint does not state a cause of action for breach of obligation of good faith, as it depends on the existence of a contract.

The court grants the Moving Defendant's request for judicial notice as to Exhibits A. The court requires the parties to meet and confer, and to submit a declaration demonstrating that they have met and conferred, prior to filing a demurrer.

The court orders that the demurrer is sustained in its entirety with 15 days leave to amend. The Moving party is to give notice.
