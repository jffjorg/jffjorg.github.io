The Judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the Defendant on June 28, 2024, will be continued to allow the Plaintiff's new attorney to file an opposition and complete the required meet and confer process. The Judge also notes that the demurrer lacks information about the meet and confer process, which is required by law. Additionally, the Judge wants to give the Defendant an opportunity to file a Notice of Related Case in this case and the dissolution case, 23STFL03438, which must be forwarded to Department 1 for review. The Judge will discuss the timing of the continued demurrer hearing with counsel at the hearing on September 11, 2024.
