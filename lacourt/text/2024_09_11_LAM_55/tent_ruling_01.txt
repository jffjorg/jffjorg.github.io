  Case Number:  24STCV12961    Hearing Date:   September 11, 2024    Dept:  55 Espinoza v. Mauss 24STCV12961Defendant filed a demurrer on 6/28/24, which is set for hearing on 9/11/2024. Plaintiff, who filed this case in pro per, recently substituted in an attorney to represent him. The new attorney has requested a continuance of the demurrer to file an opposition. As Plaintiff's counsel points out, the demurrer does not include any information about the required meet and confer that must precede the filing of a demurrer. Thus, the continuance will provide counsel an opportunity to complete that meet and confer process. Moreover, a continuance will give Defendant an opportunity to file a Notice of Related Case in this case and the dissolution case, 23STFL03438. Such a NORC must be forwarded to Department 1 so that Department 1 can rule on whether this case and the dissolution case are related. The Court will discuss the timing of the continued demurrer hearing with counsel at the hearing.
