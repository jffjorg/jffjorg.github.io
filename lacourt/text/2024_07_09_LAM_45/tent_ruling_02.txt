Discussion
Legal Standard
            “If
a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall
apply: (a) The party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4…(b) The party
making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (c)
Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §
2031.300)
            “The
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.” (CCP § 2023.030(a).) “Misuses of the discovery process
include, but are not limited to, the following: (d) Failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010)
Analysis
            Attached
to the moving papers, Defendant provides the Declaration of William A.
Hadikusumo (Hadikusumo Decl.) which states that on July 5, 2023, Plaintiff was
served by Defendant with Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1.
(Hadikusumo Decl., ¶3.) The deadline to provide responses was August 8, 2023
but no responses were provided. On August 9, 2023, Defendant reach out and
provided an extension until September 6, 2023, however, no responses were ever
received. (Hadikusumo Decl., ¶¶5-9.) Therefore, the Motion is granted, and
sanctions are warranted.   
Sanctions
Defense counsel provides the following
calculations:
·        
Counsel’s hourly rate is $240.00
·

instant Motion
·        
Counsel anticipates the hearing

·

$60.00
·

$1,500.00
            Accordingly,
the Court will impose a sanction on Plaintiff, and award said sanction to Defendant
in the amount of $1,500.00.
Conclusion      
            Defendant’s Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set 1), is GRANTED. The Court will impose a sanction on
Plaintiff, and award said sanction to Defendant in the amount of $1,500.00. Responses
and the monetary sanctions are due to Defendant within 20 days of this order.
 
            It
is so ordered.
