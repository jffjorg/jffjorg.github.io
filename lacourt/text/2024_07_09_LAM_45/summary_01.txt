Summary in English:

The Tentative Ruling denies the Plaintiffs' Motion for an Order Awarding Monetary and Terminating Sanctions. The Motion was filed in response to alleged discovery violations by the Defendants. The Court orders the parties to meet and confer regarding the production of WhatsApp messages between Harold Herskowitz and Afton Properties, Inc., as well as the production of all internal emails from Afton Properties, Inc. concerning the subject property and the instant lawsuit. The Court finds that while some documents have been produced, not all requested documents have been provided. The Court also notes that the WhatsApp messages produced are unclear and do not clearly show the parties communicating. The Court's decision is based on the legal standard that misuse of the discovery process includes the failure to respond to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide discovery, and that dismissal is a proper sanction to punish the failure to comply with a rule or an order only if the court's authority cannot be vindicated through the imposition of a less severe alternative.
