And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Counsel (Loyst P. Fletcher) to be relieved as counsel for defendants Capri Coast Capital, Inc and Mary Guidry. The motion is denied without prejudice due to procedural defects. Counsel failed to comply with CRC, Rule 3.1362, which requires specific documentation and service on all parties involved. Additionally, the plaintiff's opposition/declaration is unsigned, which prevents the court from considering it. The judge notes that the court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw as counsel, but only if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
