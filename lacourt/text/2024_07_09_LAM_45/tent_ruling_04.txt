Discussion
Loyst P. Fletcher,
Law Offices of Loyst P. Fletcher (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel of
record for defendants Capri Coast Capital, Inc and Mary Guidry. The court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw and such a motion should be granted
provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the
orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez
v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
CRC, Rule 3.1362
(Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to
be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general
terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under CCP § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a
consent under CCP § 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the
notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have
appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on
the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-053)).
 
Here, Counsel has not
complied with CRC, Rule 3.1362 for either motion. Counsel only filed a Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel (MC-051) but failed to file MC-052 and MC-053. Therefore, the motions are procedurally
defective. On another note, the Court notes that Plaintiff’s
opposition/declaration’s signature space is blank and therefore is unable to be
considered by the Court. 
 
The court
therefore DENIES Counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel without prejudice.

It is so ordered.
