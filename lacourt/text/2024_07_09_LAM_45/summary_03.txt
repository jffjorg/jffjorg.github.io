And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Lidia Pacheco to Plaintiff Monica Gonzalez Sanchez's Complaint. The Court has sustained the demurrer in its entirety, which means that the Complaint has been dismissed. The Court has granted Plaintiff 20 days leave to amend the Complaint.

The Court's ruling is based on several grounds, including the fact that the Complaint fails to properly allege a contract, is vague, and is uncertain and unintelligible. Additionally, the Court found that many of the causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations.

The Court has also stated that Defendant did not meet and confer with Plaintiff before filing the demurrer, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure § 430.41. However, the Court has determined that this failure did not affect the outcome of the demurrer.

Overall, the Court's tentative ruling means that Plaintiff will need to re-file a new Complaint that addresses the issues raised in this ruling.
