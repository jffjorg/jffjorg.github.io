[2] Cross-Defendant filed the
Motion more than 60 days after the cross-complaint was served and did not ask
the Court in a separately filed motion for leave to file it untimely, technically
rendering the Motion untimely. In its moving papers, however, Cross-Defendant did
ask this Court to exercise its discretion to hear the Motion because the
parties were meeting and conferring about it past the deadline. Cross-Complainant
never raised any objection to the Motion for being untimely. Therefore, the
Court will hear the Motion in its discretion.
