And here is the English summary:

The tentative ruling grants defendant Katie DiMattia's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiff's claims of negligence and statutory strict liability. The court finds that the defendant met the burden of proof to show that no triable issue of fact exists as to prior actual or constructive knowledge of the dog's prior viciousness, and that the plaintiff failed to show a triable issue of fact on the negligence claim. Additionally, the court finds that the affirmative defense of primary assumption of risk, which applies to individuals who care for or handle dogs in a commercial capacity, bars the plaintiff's statutory strict liability claim. The court also rules that the plaintiff's expert testimony is insufficient to show a triable issue of fact on the issue of the dog's prior viciousness.
