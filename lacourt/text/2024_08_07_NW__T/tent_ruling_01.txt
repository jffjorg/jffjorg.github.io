  Case Number:  20VECV01216    Hearing Date:   August 7, 2024    Dept:  T 20VECV01216        17701-05 VENTURA BLVD. V AXOS BANKTENTATIVE RULING MOTION FOR PRELIM INJ.Objections to the Geoula declaration are sustained. The court finds persuasive and adopts  the opposition's position in this matter. Plaintiff has not demonstrated  that it is entitled to injunctive relief. The standard for issuance of a  preliminary injunction requires that the moving party “show all of the  following: (1) irreparable injury to the moving party; (2) no harm to the  public interest; (3) no substantial harm to other interested parties; and (4) a  likelihood of prevailing on the merits.’ See, Cal. Prac. Guide, Civ. Pro.  Before Trial, Ch. 9(II)-A, §§9:555- 9:556; Sarale v. Pacific Gas & Elec.  Co. (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 225, 243. A preliminary injunction cannot  be issued unless it is reasonably probable that the moving party will prevail  on the merits. See, San Francisco Newspaper Printing Co., Inc. v. Sup.Ct.  (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 438, 442. "'The ultimate goal of any test to be used  in deciding if a preliminary injunction should issue is to minimize the harm  which an erroneous interim decision may cause."' White v. Davis (2003) 30  Cal.4th 528, 554 (quoting IT Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d  63,73).  Even where the plaintiff may have  an inadequate legal remedy and/or irreparable damage, a preliminary injunction  must not issue unless it is "reasonably probable that the moving party  will prevail on the merits." San Francisco Newspaper Printing Co., Inc. v.  Superior Court of Santa Clara County (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 438, 442.  Plaintiff, as the moving party,  bears the burden of proof in showing all necessary elements. O'Connell v. Sup.  Ct. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1468; Citizens for Better Streets v. Board of  Sup'rs of City and County of San Francisco (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1, 6.  Plaintiff fails to submit any  admissible evidence to support its claims and has not demonstrated that any of  its claims are likely to succeed on the merits.  The declaration of Plaintiff’s  representative does not provide any actual evidence of Defendant’s alleged  breach or cause of Plaintiff’s damages.  "Self-inflicted” injuries  are not considered irreparable. Hurvitz v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co.  (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 918, 930, citing Caplan v. Fellheimer Eichen Braverman  & Kaskey (3d Cir. 1995) 68 F.3d 828, 839 (where insured sought an injunction  to prevent the insurer from settling with a third party because the settlement  would preclude a later malicious prosecution action, court held that because  they contracted with the insurer to authorize it to settle claim and thereby  "acted to permit the outcome which they find unacceptable," the  outcome complained of was "self-inflicted" and "does not qualify  as irreparable [injury].")  Here, Plaintiff is the party that  has defaulted under the Loan, causing the need for Defendant to exercise its  rights to enforce the loan and pursue foreclosure. Further, an injunction  cannot be granted when damages would afford an adequate legal remedy to the  plaintiff. Brownfield v. Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital (1989) 208 Cal. App. 3d  405, 410, 414; Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp. (1967) 255  Cal. App. 2d 300, 306–307; Pellissier v. Whittier Water Co. (1922) 59 Cal. App.  1, 6–7. Here, the real property is commercial, Plaintiff is an LLC entity, and  Plaintiff does not offer any argument or evidence to show that monetary damages  would not be sufficient. Accordingly, the foreclosure of Plaintiff’s commercial  property, resulting solely in economic losses, does not amount to irreparable  harm.  For these reasons, the request  for Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.
