 Case Number:  23VECV00991    Hearing Date:   August 7, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV00991 KAZEMI V CITY
OF LOS ANGELES
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendants Michael Alan Jack and Kimberly
Renee Gordon’s Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement is GRANTED.
Introduction 
Defendants Michael Alan Jack and
Kimberly Renee Gordon (collectively, Defendants) moved for determination of
good faith settlement as to the settlement entered with Plaintiff Fatemeh
Kazemi (Plaintiff).
Discussion 
Defendants provided that they
settled with Plaintiff in the amount of $25,000.00.  If the nonsettling defendants do not oppose
the motion on the good faith issue, a “barebones motion which sets forth the
ground of good faith, accompanied by a declaration which sets forth a brief
background of the case, is sufficient.” 
(City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251,
1261.)  On a motion for determination of
good faith settlement, the burden to show lack of good faith is with the
opposing party.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
877.6(d).)  
Defendants sufficiently presented
facts showing the factors enumerated in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde &
Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488 (Tech-Bilt Factors).  The motion is unopposed and the deadline to
file an opposition, July 25, 2024, passed. 
Without an opposition, there is no showing that the settlement agreement
lacks good faith.  The motion is
persuasive.  
The motion for good faith
settlement is GRANTED.  
The court orders dismissal with
prejudice of the Cross-complaint against Cross-defendants Michael Alan Jack and
Kimberly Renee filed in this action by Cross-Complainant CITY OF LOS ANGELES,
and barring all such further cross-complaints against the moving parties pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 877.6.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
