 Case Number:  22VECV01190    Hearing Date:   August 7, 2024    Dept:  T Forester v.
Reshad 22VECV01190
Tentative ruling: Motion to file Second Amended Answer – Denied.  The court will not allow the filing as there
is an MSJ currently pending.  The MSJ
will be heard based on the state of the pleadings at the time the motion was filed.  As a Second Amended Answer would supersede
the First Amended Answer which was the answer in effect at the time the MSJ was
filed, to allow otherwise would be prejudicial to plaintiff.
