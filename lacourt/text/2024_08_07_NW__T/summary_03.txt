And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by defendant Katie DiMattia. The ruling grants the motion for summary judgment and finds that there is no triable issue of fact as to the first cause of action (COA) for negligence and the second COA for statutory strict liability. The judge also finds that the alternative motion for summary adjudication is moot.

The ruling is based on the fact that defendant DiMattia's dog was involved in an unprovoked bite, and the defendant claimed that the dog had no prior vicious nature. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's expert witness testimony established that the dog had a prior propensity to be aggressive or vicious. The judge also found that the plaintiff, who was caring for the dog as part of his business, was in the best position to take necessary safety precautions to avoid being bitten.

The judge further ruled that the plaintiff's claim for statutory strict liability was barred by the primary assumption of risk (AOR) theory, as the plaintiff was providing a service for a fee and was therefore considered to be in a position of risk. The judge cited several cases, including Priebe v. Nelson, to support this ruling.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and finds that there is no triable issue of fact as to the negligence and statutory strict liability claims.
