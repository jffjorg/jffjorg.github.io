And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent foreclosure of its commercial property. The court found that the plaintiff has not demonstrated that it is entitled to injunctive relief and that the standard for issuance of a preliminary injunction has not been met. The court held that the plaintiff has not shown that it will suffer irreparable harm, and that monetary damages would be an adequate legal remedy. The court also found that the foreclosure of the property would not amount to irreparable harm, as the property is commercial and the plaintiff is an LLC entity. The court noted that the plaintiff's default under the loan had caused the need for the defendant to exercise its rights to enforce the loan and pursue foreclosure.
