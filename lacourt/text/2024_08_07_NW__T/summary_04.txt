And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by defendants Michael Alan Jack and Kimberly Renee Gordon regarding the settlement agreement with plaintiff Fatemeh Kazemi. The settlement amount is $25,000.00. The defendants have satisfied the Tech-Bilt Factors and the non-settling defendants did not oppose the motion. As a result, the court finds that the settlement agreement lacks good faith and grants the motion. The cross-complaint against the defendants is dismissed with prejudice and all further cross-complaints are barred.
