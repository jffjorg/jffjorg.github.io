PROCEEDINGS
 
Donald Katona Sr., et al. v. Torrance
Post Acute, LLC, et al.
            24TRCV00725
1.      Donald Katona Sr., et al.’s Motion for Reconsideration

 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Donald Katona Sr., et al.’s Motion
for Reconsideration is denied.  
 
Background 
            
            Plaintiffs filed the Complaint on March
29, 2024. Plaintiffs allege the following facts. Plaintiffs’ decedent, Donald
Katona Sr., suffered injuries and eventually died (by suicide) while in the
care of Defendants.  Plaintiffs set forth
the following causes of action: 1. Elder Abuse and Neglect; 2. Negligence; 3.
Violation of Patient’s Right; 4. Wrongful Death. 
 
            On August 5, 2024, Defendant’s
petition to compel arbitration and to stay action was granted. On August 20,
2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion for reconsideration of that order.
 
             Motion
for Reconsideration
 
CCP § 1008(a) states: “When an application for an
order has been made to a or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or
granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order
may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of
the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make
application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the
matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.  The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.”  In
addition, the party seeking reconsideration must provide not just new or
different facts, circumstance, or law, but a satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce it at an earlier time. See Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690. 
 
Pursuant to CCP § 1008(a), Plaintiffs move for
reconsideration of the Court’s order of August 5, 2024 granting Defendant’s
petition to compel arbitration and to stay action. The motion is based on
purported new law, namely case law as provided by Hearden v. Windsor Redding
Care Center, LLC (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 1010. As relevant to the facts of
the instant motion, Hearden stated that: “While there may be some
overlap between professional negligence and elder abuse in general […], as
alleged in this case, the primary basis for the wrongful death cause of action
was not medical malpractice or professional negligence. The section 1295
exception to section 1281.2, subdivision (c) does not apply.” Id. at 1019.
 
First, Hearden is not new law as it was decided
on June 28, 2024 and published on July 23, 2024, prior to the hearing date of
August 5, 2024. Thus, because of this fact, there is also no adequate showing
as to why Plaintiffs could not have brought this purported new law at the time
of the hearing. Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674,
690. 
 
In a recently decided case, Holland
v. Silverscreen Healthcare, Inc. (2024) 101 Cal.App.5th 1125, the Court
held that a medical provider’s arbitration provision that complies with CCP §
1295 requires the admittee’s non-signatory heirs to arbitrate their wrongful
death claims. Id. The Court stated that while the Elder Abuse Act allows
a survival action for neglect that is not governed by CCP § 1295, that claim
would belong to the patient – not the heirs. The wrongful death action is a
statutory claim that belongs to the heirs. 
Thus, according to Holland, the heirs’ suit, even if based on
allegations of elder abuse, must be arbitrated. Id. 
 
To the extent that Hearden differs in part with the
holding of Holland, this merely demonstrates a conflict in the law.  Hearden did not overrule Holland.
 Further, the Court notes that the California
Supreme Court has granted petition for review of Holland but stated that
Holland is still citable.  “Pending
review, the opinion of the Court of Appeal, which is currently published at 101
Cal.App.5th 1125, 321 Cal.Rptr.3d 23, may be cited, not only for its persuasive
value, but also for the limited purpose of establishing the existence of a
conflict in authority that would in turn allow trial courts to exercise
discretion[.]”  Holland v.
Silverscreen Healthcare (Cal. 2024) 324 Cal.Rptr.3d 318.
 
Thus, Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration is
denied.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
