Plaintiff’s
MOTION TO SET ASIDE DISMISSAL BASED ON ATTORNEY'S EXCUSABLE NEGLECT
(C.C.P. §473) is GRANTED.

 
Background
 
This case arises from a motor vehicle accident. 
 
On November 10, 2022, Plaintiff filed suit against
Defendants LORI CHEIKOSMAN; EAN HOLDINGS LLC (Ean Holdings); ROSA MARIE
CAFFELLI; GEORGE CASTRO; JEFFREY DAVID DEHARO; OSCAR OCTAVIANO; IRMA LAFORTUNE;
ROBERT WEBSTER CURTIS III; PHILLIP ANDREW NGOC NGUYEN alleging that all
defendants were negligent causing Plaintiff’s injuries. 
 
On May 12, 2023, Phillip Nguyen filed is answer. 
 
On May 22, 2023, Rosa Caffelli and George Castro filed their
answers along with a cross-complaint against the other named Defendants for
indemnity and contribution.
 
On June 21, 2023, Defendants/Cross-Defendants Caffelli and
Castro filed a ‘request for dismissal’ of Ean Holdings, LLC. 
 
On June 21, 2023, Ean Holdings filed a demurrer to
Plaintiff’s complaint, which the court sustained with leave to amend on
8/18/23, requiring an amended complaint to be filed by 9/18/23.
 
On August 4, 2023, Lori filed a cross-complaint Defendants. 
 
On September 26, 2023, the court issued the following minute
order: 
 
“The Court states it has read and
considered the Defendant Ean Holdings, LLC's Ex Parte Application to Dismiss
Plaintiff's Complaint for Failure to Amend After Demurrer Sustained with Leave
to Amend; Memorandum of Points and Authorities; Declarations of Scott D. Miller
and Nicole Peterson filed by Defense Counsel on September 25, 2023. Defendant
Ean Holdings, LLC's Ex Parte Application to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for
Failure to Amend After Demurrer Sustained with Leave to Amend is heard and
GRANTED. The Court orders LORI CHEIKOSMAN, EAN HOLDINGS LLC, ROSA MARIE
CAFFELLI, GEORGE CASTRO, JEFFREY DAVID DEHARO, OSCAR OCTAVIANO, IRMA LAFORTUNE,
ROBERT WEBSTER CURTIS, III and PHILLIP ANDREW NGOC NGUYEN in Complaint filed by
JOSE CARBAJAL on 11/10/2022 dismissed with prejudice.” That same day, the
court dismissed “LORI CHEIKOSMAN, et al.” 
 
On October 13, 2023, Caffelli and
Castro dismissed the cross-complaint against Lori. 
 
On October 17, 2023, Lori
dismissed the cross-complaint. 
 
On December 27, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant motion. 
 
Legal Standard
 
According to CCP section 473, subdivision (d): “The court may, upon
motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in
its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order
directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party,
set aside any void judgment or order.”
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves the court for an order seeking relief from
an Order of Dismissal based on the excusable neglect of their attorney or in
the alternative, for an order Nunc Pro Tunc amending the court’s minute order
of September 26, 2023. (Motion pp. 1-2.)
 
After the court sustained Ean Holding’s demurrer, Plaintiff
did not amend in time and Ean Holdings Inc. pursued a motion to dismiss Ean
Holdings via Ex Parte. Although this motion was pursued by Ean Holdings Inc
only, the Court inadvertently dismissed the entire action.
Effectively, Plaintiff seeks an order nun pro tunc, to reflect that only Ean
Holdings Inc. is dismissed from this action. 
 
Here,
as the court’s intent was to dismiss the case against Ean Holding Inc. only
and not the entire complaint, the judgment may be antedated Nunc Pro Tunc to
correct a clerical error. 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it appears makes references
to the court improperly granting Ean Holding’s ex-parte motion. (See e.g.,
Motion p. 6:19-22 [“The improper Ex Parte pursued by Ean Holdings should not
have been granted, primarily because the Court cannot entertain a motion to
dismiss based on an Ex Parte.”]; see also pp.3-4 [“To make matters worse,
Defendant pursued this with an Ex Parte and did not give proper notice to
Plaintiff. The Ex Parte was inadvertently not calendared and Plaintiff did not
have an opportunity to appear or oppose this application.”].) To the extent
that Plaintiff seeks the court to vacate the dismiss of Ean Holding all
together, that is unclear, and will be clarified during the hearing. 
 
Conclusion[1]
 
Based on the foregoing, the court grants Plaintiff's Motion
to Set Aside the Dismissal and restore this case against all Defendants other
than Ean Holdings in this matter. (Motion p. 8:4-5, ‘Conclusion’ [“IT IS
THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTED THAT this Court grant Plaintiff's Motion to
Set Aside the Dismissal and restore this case against all other Defendant’s in
this matter.”].)
