[1] The parties met and
conferred. (See Reynolds Decl., ¶3 [“On November 30, 2023, I met and conferred
with Plaintiff’s counsel telephonically to discuss Temco’s contentions as laid
out in the meet-and-confer letter. We spoke amicably and at length, but
ultimately this call resulted in an impasse as to the issues described in the
attached Motion to Strike.”].) 


[2] For the most part, the
allegations are not conclusory in that Plaintiff provides what Defendant
did, e.g., Defendant did not inform Plaintiff of his termination. Effectively,
its less of a matter of conclusive allegations but rather whether the
allegations sufficiently allege Defendant’s intent. Thus, the court agrees with
Plaintiff insofar as the specificity requirement is met. (Opp. p. 6.) 


[3] The complaint does
not state Ray’s position. (See ¶21 [“WELCH continued to keep in contact with
TEMPCO’S safety [sic] Ray and his supervisor Moses.”].)
