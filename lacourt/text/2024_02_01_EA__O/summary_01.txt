And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal based on the attorney's excusable neglect. The case arises from a motor vehicle accident and the plaintiff had sued multiple defendants. After the court sustained Ean Holdings LLC's demurrer, the plaintiff did not amend the complaint in time, and Ean Holdings LLC pursued an ex parte motion to dismiss. The court inadvertently dismissed the entire action, rather than just the claim against Ean Holdings LLC. The plaintiff seeks to set aside the dismissal and restore the case against all defendants other than Ean Holdings LLC. The Judge agrees that the court's intent was to dismiss only Ean Holdings LLC, and therefore grants the motion to set aside the dismissal and restore the case against the remaining defendants.
