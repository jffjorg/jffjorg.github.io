```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The parties met and conferred, but were unable to reach an agreement on the issues in dispute. The court has reviewed the allegations made by the plaintiff and finds that they are sufficient in that they specifically state what the defendant did, such as not informing the plaintiff of his termination. However, the court notes that the complaint does not state the defendant's position on the matter. The defendant has filed a motion to strike certain allegations, but the court finds that the allegations meet the specificity requirement. The court will consider the motion further at the upcoming hearing.
