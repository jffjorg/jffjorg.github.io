Tentative
Ruling:      Petitioner Gulf Pine
Closing LLC’s Motion for Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment
Rights is denied.
 

 
On September 3, 2024, Gulf Pine
Closing LLC (“Petitioner”) filed the operative First Amended Petition (“FAP”)
for Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights pursuant to
California Insurance Code Section 10134 et seq.
 
The FAP alleges Jocelyn Ramirez aka
J.R. (“Payee” or “Statutory Interested Party”) has agreed to sell the periodic
sum payments she received in a settlement agreement on a tort claim to
Petitioner. (FAP ¶¶2, 6-9.) Specifically, Payee Ramirez entered into a
Structured Settlement Annuity Contract as follows:
 
Commencing November 26, 2023, Payee
Ramirez would receive the sum of $2,000.00 per month, payable on the 26th day
of each month, until October 26, 2030 (84 Certain Monthly Payments).
 
Commencing November 26, 2030, Payee
Ramirez would receive the sum of $3,475.00 per month, payable on the 26th day
of each month, until October 26, 2040 (120 Certain Monthly Payments).
 
Certain deferred lump sums
payable on the following basis:
 
November 26, 2026 in the amount of
$500,000.00; 
November 26, 2030 in the amount of
$750,000.00; and
November 26, 2040 in the amount of
$875,025.68.
 
(FAP, Ex. F.)
 
            In a prior
transfer, Payee Ramirez transferred a total of $1,325,025.00 in future lump sum
payments as follows to Petitioner in exchange for $525,227.00 at an Annual
Discount Rate (“ADR”) of 10.72 percent:
 
1 lump sum payment of $300,000.00
due on November 26, 2026;
1 lump sum payment of $450,000.00
due on November 26, 2030; and
1 lump sum payment of $575,025.00
due on November 26, 2040.
 
            
 
On July 29, 2024, Petitioner filed
the instant Motion for Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment
Rights. On September 11, 2024, Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of
Nebraska (“Annuity Issuer” or “Non-Party”) filed a Response to FAP. No reply
has been filed. 
 
The proposed Transfer Agreement in
this instant case seeks to transfer the remaining balance of $800,000.68 in
future lump sum payments as follows to Petitioner in exchange for $352,487.25 to
Payee Ramirez at an ADR of 11.61 percent:
 
1 lump sum payment of $200,000.00
due on November 26, 2026;
1 lump sum payment of $300,000.00
due on November 26, 2030; and
1 lump sum payment of $300,000.68
due on November 26, 2040.
 
(FAP, Exs. A-B.)
 
 
Legal Standard
 
“[T]o ensure that a transfer of a structured settlement payment
has no adverse tax impact on any of the persons involved in a factoring
transaction, in January 2002, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code by
adopting section 5891 to expressly sanction a tax-free transfer of structured
settlement payments.” (321 Henderson Receivables Origination LLC v. Sioteco
(2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1059, 1065.)“In California, the court approval process
is governed by the Structured Settlement Transfer Act, (hereinafter SSTA),
which requires: (1) disclosures to the transferor of the structured settlement
payment rights, (2) notice to the Attorney General, and (3) court approval.” (Id.)
“The court-approval process requires the factoring company to file a petition
in the county in which the transferor resides for approval of the transfer,
attaching copies of the petition, the transfer agreement, the disclosure form,
the annuity contract, any qualified assignment agreement and the structured
settlement agreement, a list of the names and ages of the transferor’s
dependents, notice of the court hearing date, and notice of a right to
respond.” (Id. at p. 1066.)
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner contends the terms of
the Purchase, Sale, and Transfer Agreement (“Transfer Agreement”) between Payee
Ramirez and Petitioner is fair and reasonable to the real parties in interest. As
mentioned above, the proposed Transfer Agreement seeks to transfer the
remaining balance of $800,000.68 in future lump sum payments to be paid to
Payee Ramirez from her Structured Settlement Annuity Contract to Petitioner in
exchange for $352,487.25 at an ADR of 11.61 percent. (FAP, Exs. A-B.)  The Amounts Payee Ramirez is transferring to
Petitioner is the right to receive future payments totaling $800,000 as
follows:
 
1 lump sum payment of $200,000.00
due on November 26, 2026;
1 lump sum payment of $300,000.00
due on November 26, 2030; and
1 lump sum payment of $300,000.68
due on November 26, 2040.
 
Petitioner has provided the Transfer
Agreement; disclosure statements for California, Michigan, and Nebraska; Single
Premium Annuity Contract with the Annuity Issuer; and the Petition for Approval
of Minor Compromise granted in 2016 on Payee Ramirez’s behalf. (FAP, Exs. A-B,
F, H.) Petitioner also submitted the Statement of Professional Representation
signed by Payee Ramirez attesting to her waiver of independent professional
representation. (FAP, Ex. C.) Petitioner submits a document signed by Payee
Ramirez attesting to the fact she has no dependents and has never been married.
(FAP, Exs. D-E.) Petitioner’s Director of Funding, Ikewa Nesbeth provided a
signed Affidavit of Due Diligence regarding attempts to locate a copy of any
qualified assignment agreement related to the annuity and a settlement
agreement related to the annuity. (FAP, Ex. G.) 
 
Payee Ramirez declares that she
plans to use the funds from the transfer transaction to buy out her sister’s
interest in the familial home they inherited when their parents died. (FAP, Ex.
I – Ramirez Decl., ¶10.) She avers, without explanation, that Annuity Issuer
has been a “thorn in [her] side,” and she wishes to proceed with Petitioner. (Id.
– Ramirez Decl., ¶11.), Petitioner states that based upon an Appraisal Report
for the familial home, its market value is $890,000.00. (Id. – Ramirez
Decl., Ex. 1.) Finally, Petitioner filed proof of service by mail of the
Motion, FAP, and related documents on Payee Ramirez, Annuity Issuer, Annuity
Obligor BHG Structured Settlement, Inc., and Martin L. Shives. (POS, 7/29/24.)
 
In opposition, Annuity Issuer Berkshire
first raises procedural arguments in regard to the original Petition. For
instance, Annuity Issuer Berkshire contends the original Petition failed to
provide Payee Ramirez’s full name and address as required under Insurance Code
Section 10139.5(c)(1) and had limited exhibits that were heavily redacted. Moreover,
Annuity Issuer Berkshire contends Petitioner amended the caption to the FAP to
include Payee Ramirez’s name and title as “Real Party in Interest” without permission
from the court per California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(d). Berkshire further
argues Petitioner failed to serve the Notice of Case Assignment, Civil Case
Cover Sheet, or Civil Case Cover Sheet Addendum and Statement of Location with
the original Petition. Similarly, Annuity Issuer Berkshire contends Petitioner
failed to file a Notice of Related Cases where there was a prior petition at
the West Covina Courthouse per California Rules of Court, Rule 3.300(b).
Annuity Issuer Berkshire also argues the service of the original Petition was
untimely and does not apprise the public that Payee Ramirez is a party to the
action. Annuity Issuer Berkshire argues the FAP fails to cure the defective
notice to the public or in the Court’s records. 
 
Berkshire does not cite to any case
law supporting its contention that Petitioner must strictly comply with California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(d). A “related case” is defined as “A pending civil
case is related to another pending civil case, or to a civil case that was
dismissed with or without prejudice, or to a civil case that was disposed of by
judgment, if the cases:(1) Involve the same parties and are based on the same
or similar claims; (2) Arise from the same or substantially identical
transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or
substantially identical questions of law or fact; (3) Involve claims against,
title to, possession of, or damages to the same property; or (4) Are likely for
other reasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard
by different judges.” The prior petition was neither dismissed with or without
prejudice nor disposed of by judgment, thus Petitioner was not required to file
a Notice of Related Cases. 
 
Annuity Issuer Berkshire argues the
proposed Transfer Agreement is not in Payee Ramirez’s best interests for
several reasons. Payee Ramirez waived the assistance of independent
professional representation when per Insurance Code Section 10139.5,
subdivision (h), Petitioner is required to pay the first $1,500.00 towards the
cost of independent professional advice for Payee Ramirez. This concerns the
Court as well.  
 
Moreover, Payee Ramirez and
Petitioner already had a prior transfer approved for $1,325,025.00, wherein she
received $525,277.00 – less than 40% – to be 
used to diversify her investment portfolio and unspecified repairs to
the Property. Berkshire points out that Ramirez does not explain how much of
the $525,227.00 was used for investments versus unspecified repairs to her
house, and how much money remains in her investment account. Annuity Issuer
Berkshire also asserts it has a Hardship Exchange Program Option that uses an
Annual Discount Rate (“ADR”) lower than the ADR used by Petitioner. In fact,
Annuity Issuer Berkshire contends under the Hardship Program it could offer
Payee Ramirez the same proposed Transfer of $800,000.68 in exchange for
$485,284.06 to be paid to Payee Ramirez at an ADR of 6.54 percent. Alternatively,
Annuity Issuer Berkshire asserts in exchange for a prorated share of the $800,000.68
lump sum payment in the amount of $581,652.20, Payee Ramirez would receive
$352,487.25 being offered by Petitioner, allowing Payee Ramirez to retain
$218,348.48 in future deferred lump sum payments. Ramirez does not explain why she
finds Berkshire’s proposal disadvantageous. Finally, Annuity Issuer Berkshire
asserts there does not appear to be a deadline for Payee Ramirez to purchase of
her sister’s interest in the familial home. 
 
Pursuant to Insurance Code Section
10139.5(b), “When determining whether the proposed transfer should be approved,
including whether the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in the payee's best
interest, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee's
dependents, the court shall consider the totality of the circumstances,
including, but not limited to, all of the following:
(1) The reasonable
preference and desire of the payee to complete the proposed transaction, taking
into account the payee’s age, mental capacity, legal knowledge, and apparent
maturity level.
(2) The stated
purpose of the transfer.
(3) The payee’s
financial and economic situation.
(4) The terms of
the transaction, including whether the payee is transferring monthly or lump
sum payments or all or a portion of his or her future payments.
(5) Whether, when
the settlement was completed, the future periodic payments that are the subject
of the proposed transfer were intended to pay for the future medical care and
treatment of the payee relating to injuries sustained by the payee in the incident
that was the subject of the settlement and whether the payee still needs those
future payments to pay for that future care and treatment.
(6) Whether, when
the settlement was completed, the future periodic payments that are the subject
of the proposed transfer were intended to provide for the necessary living
expenses of the payee and whether the payee still needs the future structured
settlement payments to pay for future necessary living expenses.
(7) Whether the
payee is, at the time of the proposed transfer, likely to require future
medical care and treatment for the injuries that the payee sustained in
connection with the incident that was the subject of the settlement and whether
the payee lacks other resources, including insurance, sufficient to cover those
future medical expenses.
(8) Whether the
payee has other means of income or support, aside from the structured
settlement payments that are the subject of the proposed transfer, sufficient
to meet the payee's future financial obligations for maintenance and support of
the payee's dependents, specifically including, but not limited to, the payee's
child support obligations, if any. The payee shall disclose to the transferee
and the court his or her court-ordered child support or maintenance obligations
for the court's consideration.
(9) Whether the
financial terms of the transaction, including the discount rate applied to
determine the amount to be paid to the payee, the expenses and costs of the
transaction for both the payee and the transferee, the size of the transaction,
the available financial alternatives to the payee to achieve the payee's stated
objectives, are fair and reasonable.
(10) Whether the
payee completed previous transactions involving the payee's structured
settlement payments and the timing and size of the previous transactions and
whether the payee was satisfied with any previous transaction.
(11) Whether the
transferee attempted previous transactions involving the payee's structured
settlement payments that were denied, or that were dismissed or withdrawn prior
to a decision on the merits, within the past five years.
(12) Whether, to
the best of the transferee’s knowledge after making inquiry with the payee, the
payee has attempted structured settlement payment transfer transactions with
another person or entity, other than the transferee, that were denied, or which
were dismissed or withdrawn prior to a decision on the merits, within the past
five years.
(13) Whether the
payee, or his or her family or dependents, are in or are facing a hardship
situation.
(14) Whether the
payee received independent legal or financial advice regarding the transaction.
The court may deny or defer ruling on the petition for approval of a transfer
of structured settlement payment rights if the court believes that the payee does
not fully understand the proposed transaction and that independent legal or
financial advice regarding the transaction should be obtained by the payee.
(15) Any other
factors or facts that the payee, the transferee, or any other interested party
calls to the attention of the reviewing court or that the court determines
should be considered in reviewing the transfer.”
 
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5(b).)
 
The Court finds that under the
totality of the circumstances, the proposed Transfer Agreement is not fair and
reasonable. Payee Ramirez is an 18-year old full-time Psychology student at Rio
Hondo College, who works as a Nanny making about $4,000.00 per month. (FAP, Ex.
I – Ramirez Decl., ¶3.) She attests the proposed Transfer funds are not
intended to pay for necessary living expenses, future living expenses, or
future medical care. (Id. at ¶¶7-8.) Further, she has completed a prior
transfer transaction, which was approved on February 13, 2024 in Los Angeles
Superior Court case no. 23PSCP00533. (Id. at ¶9.) Payee Ramirez received
$525,227.00, which were used to place with her financial advisor for her
investment portfolios and do repairs to the familial home she inherited. (Id.)
As discussed above, Payee Ramirez’s declaration does not state what type of
repairs were made, how much they costed her, or how much of the previous
transfer funds she used to cover such costs. Moreover, Payee Ramirez states she
is aware of Annuity Issuer Berkshire’s Hardship Program and their position on
the transfer transactions, however, she wishes to proceed with the Transfer
Agreement between her and Petitioner. (Id. at ¶11.) She offers no
logical explanation for this.  Payee
Ramirez is only 18-years old and waived independent professional assistance, even
though she avers that she consulted with her financial advisor and real estate
attorneys regarding using the proposed Transfer Agreement funds to buy out her
sister’s interest in the familial home and got the house appraised. (Id.
at ¶10.)  No declarations from these
advisors were submitted. As mentioned above, Petitioner is required to pay up
to $1,500.00 for independent professional advice, thus Payee Ramirez would not
suffer any financial harm in seeking such advice and would likely benefit from
it. 
 
Payee Ramirez states she will continue
to receive monthly payments (currently $2,000) through October 2040, with
aggregate payments of $565,000. (Id. at ¶13.) Payee Ramirez has no
dependents and is single (never been married), with no child or spousal support
obligations. Despite the previous transfer being approximately seven months ago
and for $1,325,025.00 with Payee Ramirez receiving $525,277.00 of it, Payee
Ramirez does not express any dissatisfaction with the outcome. 
 
Ramirez provides no specifics as to
how much of the previous $1,325,025.00 transfer was invested, where it was
invested, and as Annuity Issuer Berkshire points out, how much remains in said
investment accounts. Depending on the amount in the investment accounts, there
is no telling whether or not it could possibly cover Payee Ramirez’s purchase
of her sister’s interest or that she has considered such option. Similarly,
Payee Ramirez merely states she is a college student but fails to provide any
details as to her tuition and other related expenses, whether she is paying out
of pocket as opposed to receiving scholarships, and whether she is receiving
student loans or has incurred any college debt. 
 
Ramirez’s declaration offers no
facts explaining why receiving the funds from the proposed Transfer Agreement is
urgent, other than her sister’s desire to sell the Property. As previously
mentioned, neither Petitioner nor Payee Ramirez attests to a deadline in
regards to her purchase of her sister’s interest in the Property. In addition,
the proposed Transfer Agreement seeks the remaining balance of Payee Ramirez’s
lump sum payments under the Structured Settlement Annuity Contract, leaving
only her monthly payments of $2,000 until October 26, 2030 and $3,475.00 until
October 26, 2040, for a purported total of $565,000.00 instead of $1,365,000.68
(total remaining nominal value). Lastly, there are no facts suggesting that
Payee Ramirez has considered borrowing the money to purchase her sister’s
interest in the Property at a lower rate than what is being offered in the
proposed Transfer Agreement. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Petitioner
Gulf Pine Closing LLC’s Motion for Approval for Transfer of Structured
Settlement Payment Rights is denied.  The
Court does not find that Payee’s preference and desire to be reasonable.  The Court does not believe the Payee fully
understands the proposed transaction and she should obtain independent legal
and financial advice, at least some of which can be paid for by Petitioner.
