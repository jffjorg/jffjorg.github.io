Background
 
Plaintiff Johanna Cobarrubias (“Plaintiff”) filed this
employment suit against defendant Ventura Park Management, LLC (“VPM”) and Does
1 through 20 on January 3, 2022. On January 15, 2022, VPM filed its answer.
 
Concurrently with its answer, VPM filed a cross-complaint
against cross-defendants Kevin Long Ha (“Ha”), Phuong Pham (“Pham”), and Roes 1
through 10. VPM asserted claims for comparative indemnity and declaratory
relief.
 
On August 30, 2022, VPM filed a proof of service indicating
it personally served cross-defendant Pham on August 6, 2022, at 12250 Baird
Way, Riverside, CA 92505. On September 14, 2022, the clerk entered Pham’s
default on VPM’s cross-complaint.
 
On November 16, 2022, Plaintiff amended her complaint to
name Pham and Ha as Does 1 and 2. On March 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of
service indicating she effected personal service of her summons and complaint
on Pham at the Baird Way address on January 16, 2023. On October 24, 2023, the
clerk entered Pham’s default on Plaintiff’s complaint.
 
On May 1, 2024, counsel informed the Court that the Phuong
Pham named in their proofs of service was not the cross-defendant, but an
unrelated individual with the same name. Counsel “indicate[d] that they need to
serve the correct ‘Phong Pham’ in the complaint and cross-complaint”
(05-01-2024 Minute Order) and informed the Court they would endeavor to serve
Pham jointly.
 
On June 4, 2024, VPM filed a proof of service indicating it
served Pham by substituted service at an address in San Francisco with both the
complaint and the cross-complaint. (See 06-04-2024 POS, ¶ 2(b) [complaint], (f)
[cross-complaint].)
 
VPM’s proof of service indicates a registered process server
attempted to serve Pham several times at an address in San Francisco. Upon the
fourth and final attempt, “an Asian male c[a]me out the door to walk the dog”,
stated “subject [Pham] doesn’t live here”, but “confirmed he is an occupant”.
(06-04-2024 POS, p. 3.) The server stated that “because [the man was] an
occupant [the server was] serving him on behalf of subject [Pham]”; the man
refused to take the papers, and so the server “dropped [them] on the insideof [sic]
the security gate, stated you are served and left.” (Ibid.)
 
On July 24, 2024, VPM requested Pham’s default. The clerk
rejected the request, stating that Pham’s default had already been entered. On
July 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed Requests for Default as to both Pham and Ha. The
clerk rejected the request as to Pham, stating her default had already been
entered. The clerk rejected the request as to Ha for clerical reasons.
 
On August 6, 2024, counsels for Plaintiff and VPM appeared
at a status conference. They informed the Court about ongoing clerical problems
entering Pham’s default. In the interests of efficiency, the Court vacated all
prior defaults and entered Pham’s default upon counsel’s oral request.
(See 08-06-2024 Minute Order.)
 
On August 23, 2024, Pham timely moved to set aside the August
6, 2024 default.
 
On September 11, 2024, Plaintiff and VPM (“Opposing
Parties”) filed separate oppositions to Pham’s motion. On September 17, 2024,
Pham filed her reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b)
provides for either discretionary or mandatory relief from certain prior
actions or proceedings in the trial court. (Luri¿v. Greenwald¿(2003) 107
Cal.App.4th 1119, 1124.)¿¿“ ‘Under the discretionary relief provision, on a
showing of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect,”¿the court
has discretion to allow relief from a “judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against”¿a party or his or her attorney.¿”  (Ibid.; Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.
(b).)¿¿The party seeking such relief must do so “within a reasonable time, in
no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v.
Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than six months had
elapsed from the entry of default, and hence relief under section 473 was
unavailable”] (Rappleyea).) 
 
Discussion
 
Pham is entitled to relief from default on both the
complaint and the cross-complaint, based on Code of Civil Procedure section
473(b).
 
a.    
The
Opposing Parties have not established Pham was aware of the lawsuit prior to
June 4, 2024.
 
The Opposing Parties’ arguments at points depend on the
premise that Pham has been aware of this lawsuit “since at least of [sic]
February 14, 2024, when Pham’s neighbor confirmed that Pham lived at the
address where she was eventually served.” (Pl. Opp., 4:17-20.) VPM argues Pham
was informed as early as July 19, 2022, when counsel received an email from Ha
stating “I have forwarded to Mrs. Pham the information”. (VPM Opp., 6:14-19.) 
 
Eight words in Ha’s July 19, 2022 email are not persuasive
evidence that Pham knew about the lawsuit. The remainder of VPM’s evidence
relies on its communications with Ha. The Court cannot presume Pham has
constructive knowledge of everything communicated to Ha based solely on their
familial relationship.
 
Plaintiff bases her opposition on her proofs of service and
on emails between counsel and its process server reflecting the server’s
difficulties tracking Pham down. 
 
Even if the Court finds Plaintiff’s evidence persuasive, it
does not establish Pham was apprised of the lawsuit. At one point, Pham’s
neighbor purtportedly confirmed the server had the correct address – which is
hearsay upon hearsay upon hearsay that does not confirm Pham received any
papers. Moreover, counsel’s exhibits also reflect that ten days after Pham’s
neighbor confirmed her address, a Dung Pham stated she had moved to Walnut
Creek. (See Guardado Decl., Exh. 6, p. 1.) The former statement is no more or
less credible than the latter. In fact, on April 25, 2024 the server again
encountered a Dung Pham – the Court presumes at the same address – and the
server was again told defendant Pham did not live there. (Id., Exh. 7,
p. 13.) The server took this as evidence that Pham was “being extremely evasive
since [the server] already had contact with someone at that address”. (Ibid.)
Contact with someone at the address does not confirm that person was Pham or
had any relation to her.
 
Plaintiff and VPM have not established Pham knew about the
lawsuit before they served the summons and complaint. 
 
b.    
Pham
has established she is entitled to relief based on Code of Civil Procedure
section 473(b).
 
For the sake of argument, the Court presumes substitute
service was properly effected on June 4, 2024 and default properly entered on
August 6, 2024. Notwithstanding those presumptions, Plaintiff is entitled to
relief under section 473(b).
 
As discussed above, the Opposing Parties have not
established Pham was served or was aware of the lawsuit prior to June 4, 2024. But
they have no evidence contradicting her assertions that she was out of the
country from May through most of July, 2024, that she did not discover the
summons until she retrieved her mail, and that she contacted counsel shortly
afterward. (Pham Decl., ¶ 3, 6-7.) 
 
Pham’s neglect was excusable and she took action to vacate
her default within a reasonable time. She is entitled to have the Court vacate
her August 6, 2024 default.
 
c.    
The
Court imposes penalties on Pham.
 
“Whenever the court grants relief from a default, default
judgment, or dismissal based on [section 473], the court may … impose a penalty
of no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) upon an offending attorney or
party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(c)(1).)
 
The Court imposes a penalty of $1,000.00 on
defendant/cross-defendant Pham, payable to Plaintiff and/or her counsel within
ten (10) days of this order, related to the default on Plaintiff’s complaint.
 
The Court imposes a penalty of $1,000.00 on
defendant/cross-defendant Pham, payable to VPM and/or its counsel within ten
(10) days of this order, relateed to the default on VPM’s cross-complaint.
