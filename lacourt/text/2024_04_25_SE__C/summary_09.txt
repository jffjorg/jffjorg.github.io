Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's petition for relief from Government Code §945.4, which allows a plaintiff to commence and pursue an action against a public entity despite the plaintiff's failure to timely file a claim. The plaintiff, RAUL MOJARRO, alleges that he was injured on August 13, 2022, when he rode his bicycle over a defective sidewalk in Maywood, California. The plaintiff failed to timely file a claim with the City of Vernon, which denied his application for leave to present a late claim. The plaintiff argues that his failure to timely file a claim was due to excusable neglect. The City of Vernon argues that the plaintiff's application was untimely and that the plaintiff failed to undertake a basic investigation to determine the location of the subject incident. The court finds that the plaintiff's failure to present a timely claim was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect and grants the plaintiff's petition. The court orders the plaintiff to file and serve a first amended complaint naming the City of Vernon as a defendant within 30 days.
