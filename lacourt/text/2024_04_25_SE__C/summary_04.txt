```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling states that Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration is MOOT, and Plaintiff's Renewed Motion to Enforce Settlement is DENIED. The judge finds that Plaintiff failed to timely accept Defendant's 998 Offer, which was revoked on August 28, 2023. The judge also finds that the Proposed Judgment submitted by Plaintiff on August 22, 2023 is inconsistent with the Offer, and therefore, the Acceptance and proposed judgment were properly denied by Judge Rosales. The judge concludes that the time to file an Acceptance of Defendant's 998 Offer has lapsed, and where there is no timely Acceptance of Defendant's 998 Offer, the court cannot enforce the parties' attempted settlement under CCP §998.
