 Case Number:  22NWCV00899    Hearing Date:   April 25, 2024    Dept:  C Saylor v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. 22NWCV00899
 
Plaintiff's
Ex Parte Application for an Order Advancing the Hearing on Plaintiff's Motion
to Compel Deposition Attendance of a Person Most Qualified and Custodian of
Records of Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. is DENIED. Opposing
Party to give notice. 
 
This
action was filed on September 27, 2022. Trial is currently set for July 25,
2024. The hearing on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Deposition was filed on April
10, 2024, and is currently scheduled to be heard on August 7, 2024-- after the
trial date. Plaintiff's delay in filing and seeking to advance the Subject
Motion do not establish the "exigency" required for ex parte relief.
There is currently one discovery motion scheduled and two discovery motions
reserved for after the date of trial. The parties are not foreclosed from
seeking a continuance of the trial date in Dept. SE-F, if necessary. Counsel
are encouraged to meet and confer in good faith in an effort to informally
resolve discovery disputes.
