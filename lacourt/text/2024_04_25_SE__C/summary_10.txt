And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge issued a tentative ruling in this "lemon law" action filed by Joseph Rha and Hanna Rha against American Honda Motor Company. The defendants demurred to the fifth and sixth causes of action, alleging that the plaintiff's claims for breach of express warranty and fraudulent inducement were barred by the economic loss rule. The court, however, found that the economic loss rule does not apply to the plaintiff's claim for fraudulent inducement. The court also found that the plaintiff's allegations of concealment of defects and breach of warranty were sufficient to withstand demurrer. The court ruled that the demurrer to the second cause of action for fraudulent inducement was OVERRULED, and the motion to strike punitive damages was DENIED.
