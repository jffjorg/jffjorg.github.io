Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant Natalie Hernandez's Motion to Set Aside Default. The defendant is ordered to file and serve a proposed answer by no later than five calendar days from the date of the court's issuance of this order. The judge's ruling is based on the court's inherent equitable power to set aside a judgment on the ground of extrinsic fraud or mistake. The defendant's motion was pending when the default judgment was entered, and it appears that the default judgment was improperly entered and should be set aside.
