[REVISED TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PETITION TO APPROVE
  MINOR’S COMPROMISE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
June 18, 2024



 
Claimant
Emily Giselle Chazari-Agustin, a minor, by and through her parent and guardian ad
litem, Erick G. Chazari, has agreed to settle her claims against Defendants Mariposa
20 LLC, K3 Manager LLC, K3 Holdings LLC, Nathan Kadisha, Michael Kadisha, Luzelba
Lozano Mansour, and Zaki S. Mansour in exchange for $61,764.80.  Of this amount, $15,441.20 allocated for attorney
fees and $1,106.13 allocated for expenses, leaving a balance of $45,217.47 for Claimant.  If approved, the funds will be invested in a single-premium
deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court.
Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and finds that it is fair and reasonable.  The Court also finds that the attorney fees, which
are 25% of the funds, are fair and reasonable.
Accordingly,
the Petition to Approve Minor’s Compromise is GRANTED.
An
Order to Show Cause Re: Submission of Proof of Annuity Purchase is scheduled
for September 17, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
