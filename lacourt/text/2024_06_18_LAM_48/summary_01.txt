```

The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or in the alternative, summary adjudication. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to establish any new facts, new circumstances, or changes in law to support the motion. The judge also notes that the plaintiff failed to address the court's prior order on the first motion and did not clearly explain or establish any newly discovered facts or circumstances or changes in law.
