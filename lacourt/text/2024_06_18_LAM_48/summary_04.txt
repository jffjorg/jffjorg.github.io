And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel for GC Brothers Entertainment, LLC. The motion was unopposed, and the judge found that the attorney-client relationship has broken down irreparably. The judge has scheduled an order to show cause for August 19, 2024, requiring the defendant to retain new counsel by that date or risk being struck from the case. If the defendant fails to retain new counsel, the court may strike its answer and place it in default.
