  CASE NO.: 22STCV37327
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
June 18, 2024



 
Devon
M. Lyon and Lyon Legal P.C., counsel of record for Defendant GC Brothers Entertainment
LLC, seek to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s
declaration states that there are irreconcilable difference that make representation
impossible, and the client has breached the attorney-client retainer agreement.  Defendant’s representative has instructed him
to refrain from any and all work on this case. 
No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until February 18, 2025, and there
is no prejudice to Defendant.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on GC Brothers
Entertainment LLC and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  Therefore, an Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to Retain New Counsel for GC Brothers Entertainment LLC is scheduled for August
19, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in Department 48 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
GC
Brothers Entertainment LLC must retain new counsel by that date or the Court may
strike its answer and place it in default.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
