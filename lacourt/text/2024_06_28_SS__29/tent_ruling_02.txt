Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request
by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of
Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice and Declaration, but has failed to file the proposed Order to
be Relieved as Counsel.  This is required
under California Rules of Court, rile 3.1362(e).
 
Service of the
notice and declaration appear to be by electronic transmission, which requires
an affidavit from Counsel stating the served email address is the current email
for the client. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d)(2).) 
Counsel has not filed such a declaration.
 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
