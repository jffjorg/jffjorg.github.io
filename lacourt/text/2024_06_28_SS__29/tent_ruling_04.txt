 Case Number:  22STCV24102    Hearing Date:   June 28, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel
Further Deposition Testimony of Plaintiff filed by Defendant Evolution Energy Solutions,
LLC.
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On July 26, 2022, Plaintiff Pamela Maxine Simuel
(“Plaintiff”), filed a complaint asserting causes of action for negligence and premises
liability against Evolution Energy Solutions, LLC
(“Evolution”), 15105 Sherman Way LLC (“Sherman Way”), and Does 1 through
10, arising out of an incident on February 2, 2021, at 15105 Sherman Way in Van
Nuys, in which, Plaintiff alleges, a large overhead metal pipe suddenly fell and
struck her, causing injuries. 
On September 27, 2022, Evolution filed an answer.  
On October 25, 2022, Sherman Way filed an answer and a
cross-complaint against Evolution and Roes 1 through 20.  
On December 5, 2022, Evolution filed an answer to the
cross-complaint and its own cross-complaint against Sherman Way and Moes 1
through 25.
This is not the first motion that has come before the
Court relating to Plaintiff’s deposition. 
On January 4, 2024, the Court granted Evolution’s motion to compel the
deposition of Plaintiff and ordered Plaintiff to appear for her deposition
within 30 days, subject to certain conditions regarding the location and
duration of each session of the deposition.
Plaintiff’s deposition proceeded on January 31 and
February 2, 2024.  (Navarrete Decl., ¶¶ 11-14
& Exhs. 5 [“First Depo.”], 7 [“Second Depo.”].)  During each session of the deposition, Plaintiff
was asked about any prior felony convictions, including for forgery.  Plaintiff’s counsel instructed Plaintiff not
to answer with regard to any convictions that were more than ten years
old.  (First Depo., at 35:16-37:2, 42:13-22,
55:22-57:7; Second Depo., at 169:10-171:25.) 
In written discovery responses served months before the deposition, Plaintiff
stated that she was convicted of felony forgery in approximately 2009 in Los
Angeles.  (Navarrete Decl., Exh. 1, at p.
3; id., Exh. 2, at pp. 2-3; see also First Depo., at 50:4-52:18.)
On March 26, 2024, Evolution filed this motion
to compel Plaintiff’s further testimony on her previous felony conviction for
forgery. Evolution also seeks sanctions. 
Plaintiff filed an opposition on June 14, along with her own request for
sanctions.  Evolution filed its reply on
June 20.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480,
subdivision (a), provides: 
“If a deponent fails to answer any question
or to produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing under the deponent’s control that is specified in the deposition notice
or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an
order compelling that answer or production.
“This motion shall be made no later than 60
days after the completion of the record of the deposition, and shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (b).)
“If the court determines that the answer or
production sought is subject to discovery, it shall order that the answer be
given or the production be made on the resumption of the deposition.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (i).) 
“The court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel an answer or production, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., subd. (j).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.030 provides that the court may impose sanctions “[t]o
the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title.”  Where
a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court
may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
As a threshold matter, the meet and
requirement for this motion is satisfied. 
(Navarrete Decl., ¶¶ 15, 16.)
Evolution seeks further testimony from
Plaintiff regarding her felony forgery conviction.   The conviction occurred approximately 15
years ago.  
Under Evidence Code section 788, prior felony
convictions are generally admissible to attack the credibility of a
witness.  That is particularly true here,
as the Court of Appeal has determined that “forgery is a crime of moral turpitude.”  (People v. Almarez (1985) 168 Cal.App.3d
262, 267.)  Moreover, “Evidence of circumstances
underlying a conviction is admissible to impeach credibility if the proponent
demonstrates that the evidence has any tendency in reason to disprove credibility.”  (People v. Dalton (2019) 7 Cal.5th
166, 214.)
The Court understands that Plaintiff will
seek to exclude this evidence at trial, including under Evidence Code section
352.  The trial court will rule on that
issue.  Perhaps Plaintiff will prevail,
and perhaps not.  It is not appropriate
at this stage of the proceedings to attempt to predict the outcome of any such
challenge; for current purposes, it is sufficient for the Court to conclude
that the evidence, at the very least, “appears reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) 
The Court also overrules Plaintiff’s privacy
objection, which lacks merit and borders on the frivolous.  An adult criminal prosecution is a public
proceeding, and questioning about a criminal conviction in civil litigation under
these circumstances does not infringe upon any recognized privacy right of
Plaintiff.
Accordingly, the motion to compel is granted.
Evolution’s request for sanctions is also granted.  Plaintiff did not act with substantial
justification and the imposition of a sanction under these circumstances is not
unjust.  Counsel’s views on the
admissibility of this evidence at trial, no matter how strongly held, do not
provide a substantial justification for instructing the witness not to answer
the questions at issue in deposition.  
The Court sets sanctions in the amount of $1,440,
calculated based on six hours of total attorney time, multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $240 per hour. 
(See Navarrete Decl., ¶ 22.)
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is denied.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Evolution’s motion to compel.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to appear, within
30 days of notice, for a further session of her deposition and answer questions
regarding the circumstances of her past felony conviction for forgery in Los
Angeles in approximately 2009.  
The Court GRANTS
Evolution’s request for sanctions.
The Court ORDERS
Plaintiff and her counsel Dordick Law Corporation, jointly and severally, to
pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of $1,440 to
Evolution within 30 days of notice.
The Court DENIES
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions.
Moving party to give
notice.
