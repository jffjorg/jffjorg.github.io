And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for spoliation sanctions, finding that Defendant did not engage in the intentional destruction of evidence. The judge notes that while Defendant failed to preserve a document referred to as the "Daily Download", Plaintiff has not made a prima facie showing that the destruction of this evidence had a substantial probability of damaging Plaintiff's ability to establish an essential element of his claim. The judge also denies Defendant's request for sanctions, finding that Plaintiff acted with substantial justification in bringing the motion. Finally, the judge denies Defendant's request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff, finding that the opposition to the motion for spoliation sanctions is not a proper place to seek sanctions for alleged violations of a protective order or other unrelated conduct.
