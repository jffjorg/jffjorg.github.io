  Case Number:  20STCV30194    Hearing Date:   June 28, 2024    Dept:  29 Plaintiff’s Motion
for Spoliation Sanctions 
Tentative
Plaintiff’s motion for spoliation sanctions
is denied.
Defendant’s request for sanctions is
denied.
Background
Plaintiff Sadegh Nabakhteh (“Plaintiff”) alleges that he was
severely injured after he slipped and fell on March 2, 2020, at the front area
of a store in Calabasas.  On August 7,
2020, Plaintiff filed his complaint asserting causes of action for general
negligence and premises liability against Defendant Harbor Freight Tools USA,
Inc. (“Defendant”), and Does 1 through 100. 
Defendant filed its answer on October 14, 2020.
On May 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion
for issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions based on the spoilation of
evidence. Defendant filed an untimely opposition on June 17, 2024, along with
its own request for monetary sanctions. Plaintiff’s reply was filed on June 21,
2024. 
Legal Standard
“The intentional
destruction of evidence is a grave affront to the cause of justice and deserves
our unqualified condemnation.” (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center v. Super. Ct.
(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1, 4.)
“Destroying evidence can
destroy fairness and justice, for it increases the risk of an erroneous decision
on the merits of the underlying cause of action. Destroying evidence can also
increase the costs of litigation as parties attempt to reconstruct the
destroyed evidence or to develop other evidence, which may be less accessible,
less persuasive, or both.” (Id. at p. 8.)
Under the case law,
spoliation is defined to include (among other things) destroying evidence, altering
evidence, or “the failure to preserve evidence for another’s use in pending or
future litigation.” (Williams v. Russ (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1223.) “The
duty to preserve relevant evidence is triggered when the party is objectively
on notice that litigation is reasonably foreseeable, meaning litigation is
probable and likely to arise from an incident or dispute and not a mere
possibility.” (Victor Valley Union High School Dist. v. Super. Ct. (2023) 91
Cal.App.5th 1121, 1133.) The mere existence of a dispute or awareness of an
underlying incident that subsequently gives rise to litigation is not, in and
of itself, sufficient. (Id. at pp. 1153-1154.)
Spoliation, when it occurs,
is a misuse of the discovery process. (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, supra, 18
Cal.4th at p. 12; Williams, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1223.) The remedies
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 for a misuse of the discovery
process include (a) a monetary sanction; (b) “an issue sanction ordering that
designated facts shall be taken as established in the action”; (c) “an evidence
sanction by an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process from introducing designated matters in evidence”; and, in the
most serious cases, (d) “a terminating sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subds. (a)- (d).) The discovery remedies set forth in section 2023.030 “provide
a substantial deterrent to acts of spoliation, and substantial protection to
the spoliation victim.” (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p.
17.)
As with all sanctions under
the Civil Discovery Act, the purpose of sanctions for spoliation is not to
punish. (Newland v. Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v.
Super Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the law. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015)
238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
Terminating sanctions
should be used sparingly. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th
486, 496.) Nonetheless, a terminating sanction may be appropriate in the first
instance, without a violation of a prior court order, “in egregious cases of
intentional spoliation of evidence.” (Williams, supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p.
1223.)
“[A] party moving for
discovery sanctions based on the spoliation of evidence must make an initial
prima facie showing that the responding party in fact destroyed evidence that
had a substantial probability of damaging the moving party’s ability to
establish an essential element of his claim or defense.” (Williams, supra, 167
Cal.App.4th at p. 1227.) Under some circumstances, this may be sufficient to
establish a “prima facie showing of prejudice” from the loss of the evidence
and to shift the burden to the party who has destroyed the evidence to disprove
the prejudice. (Ibid.) 
Discussion
As a preliminary matter, the Court exercises
its discretion to consider Defendant’s opposition, which was filed one day late
(possibly because Defendant failed to take into account a court holiday between
the filing and hearing dates).  It does
not appear that there was any prejudice to Plaintiff from the late filing, as
Plaintiff filed a detailed reply with extensive exhibits.
Plaintiff asserts that Defendant engaged in
spoliation of evidence by failing to preserve a document referred to as the “Daily
Download” from the date of the accident. 
Plaintiff includes in his filing a blank version of this document.  (Jalilvand Decl., Exh. A.)
The accident in question occurred on March 2,
2020.  (Complaint, pp. 4-5.)  Eight days later, Plaintiff’s counsel sent
Defendant a “preservation of evidence” letter. 
(Jalilvand Decl., Exh. B.)  The
Daily Download from the date of the accident was not preserved.  (Id., Exhs. C, D.)  The standard practice at the store, which
appears to have been followed here, was to keep the Daily Download sheets until
the end of the month and then discard them. 
(Id., Exh. E [“Padron Depo.”], at 28:22-30:5, 103:21-24.)  
Plaintiff has shown that Defendant did not
preserve the Daily Download from March 2, 2020. 
But to obtain a spoliation sanction, more is required.  The party seeking a sanction for spoliation must,
as noted above, “make an initial prima facie showing
that the responding party in fact destroyed evidence that had a substantial
probability of damaging the moving party’s ability to establish an essential
element of his claim or defense.”  (Williams,
supra, 167 Cal.App.4th at p. 1227.) 
Plaintiff has not made this showing.
It is important to distinguish here between what
the Daily Download is and what it is not. 
The Daily Download is a four-page form that contains a variety of
information and check lists.  (Jalilvand
Decl., Exh. A.)  The check lists include
cleaning tasks in the morning, before the store opens, and in the evening,
after the store has closed.  (Id., Exh.
A, at p. 4; Padron Depo., at 107:9-108:15, 109:17-111:6; Jalilvand Decl., Exh.
F [“Cebrero Depo.”], at 33:25-34:3.) 
The Daily Download does not provide a check
list for periodic floor checks or sweeps during the day, and it was not used to
record cleaning activities during the operating hours of the store.  (Jalilvand Decl., Exh. A; Padron Depo., at 109:3-10,
111:14-113:3; Cebrero Depo., at 41:25-42:22.) 
Nor does the store keep “sweep logs” or any other written record of
periodic or as-needed inspections or cleanings during operating hours.  (Padron Depo., at 60:25-61:2, 71:6-14, 95:23-96:9;
Cebrero Depo., at 38:25-40:7.) 
Plaintiff’s accident in this matter occurred
in the late afternoon, at approximately 5:30 pm.  (Padron Depo., at 66:15-23.)  Plaintiff has not provided the Court with any
reason to conclude that whether Defendant did or did not perform the morning cleaning
tasks before the store opened, more than nine hours prior to the accident, has any
significant probative value in this case. 
The discarded evidence has not been shown to have had a “substantial
probability” of damaging the ability of Plaintiff to establish any element of
his claim.  
Indeed, far more probative and direct
evidence – a video of the accident – was preserved by Defendant and produced in
discovery.  That video may be viewed and
shown to the jury to enable Plaintiff to show whether there was a dangerous
condition present at the front of the store at the time of the accident, and
how long the condition was present.  The
Daily Download, in contrast, would not contain this information, even if it had
been preserved.
The Court has
considered all of the evidence presented by the parties and all of the arguments
from both sides.  On this record, the
Court finds that no spoliation occurred and that no spoliation sanctions are
warranted.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion is denied.
The Court also denies
Defendant’s request for sanctions.
As to Plaintiff’s unsuccessful pursuit of
spoliation sanctions (and assuming, without deciding, that Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030 authorizes an award of monetary sanctions against a
party who unsuccessfully makes a motion for spoliation sanctions), the Court
denies the request of Defendant for monetary sanctions.  Although the Court has ultimately denied Plaintiff’s
motion, the Court finds that Plaintiff acted with substantial justification in
bringing this motion.
As to Defendant’s
request for sanctions for other alleged misconduct by Plaintiff, the request is
denied without prejudice for procedural reasons.  An opposition to a motion for spoliation
sanctions is not a proper place to seek sanctions against the moving party for alleged
violations of a protective order or any other unrelated conduct; any such
request must be made in a separate motion and must give the opposing party fair
notice and a fair opportunity to respond.
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion for spoliation sanctions is DENIED. 
Defendant’s
request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff is DENIED.
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
