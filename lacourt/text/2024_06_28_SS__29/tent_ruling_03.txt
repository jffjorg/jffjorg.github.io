 Case Number:  21STCV43195    Hearing Date:   June 28, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion to Deem Admitted the Truth of the
Matters Specified in Requests for Admission (Set One)
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On November 24, 2021, Plaintiff Autumn Latour
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Jeffery D. Rawnsley, M.D.,
Daniel Sukat, M.D., and Does 1 through 50 for negligence and medical
malpractice.
 
Defendant
Jeffrey D. Rawnsley, M.D. (“Defendant”) filed his answer on May 5, 2023.
 
On April
17, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for Admission (Set
One).  (Light Decl., ¶¶ 2-3 & Exhs.
A-B.)  Plaintiff did not respond.  (Id., ¶ 6.)
 
On May 31, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion for an order deeming admitted the truth of the matter specified in the requests
for admission. No opposition has been filed. 

 
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests
for Admission (Set One) on April 17, 2024. 
(Light Decl., ¶¶ 2-3 & Exhs. A-B.) 
Plaintiff has not responded.  (Id.,
¶ 6.)
 
Defendant need not show anything more.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to Deem Admitted the Truth of the Matters Specified
in Requests for Admission (Set One).
 
Given the relatively straightforward
nature of the motion, the Court sets sanctions in the amount of $367.50,
calculated based on 1.5 hours of attorney work, multiplied by reasonable
billing rate of $245.00 per hour.  (Light
Decl., ¶ 8.)
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion
for a Deemed-Admitted Order. 
 
The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff AUTUMN
LATOUR is DEEMED TO HAVE ADMITTED the truth of the matters specified in Defendant’s
Requests for Admission (Set One).

The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request
for sanctions.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff AUTUMN
LATOUR is ordered to pay sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act in the amount of
$367.50 to Defendant within 30 days of notice. 
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
