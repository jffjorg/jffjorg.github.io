And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The plaintiff, a minor, filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the defendant, a doctor, and a hospital, alleging damages resulting from undiagnosed and untreated eye disease. The plaintiff seeks to compel arbitration based on an agreement signed by his mother, who did not know what she was signing. The court finds that the plaintiff has sufficiently met its burden of showing the existence of the arbitration agreement and that the defendant has failed to demonstrate any prejudice or waiver of his right to arbitrate. The court also rejects the defendant's argument that the agreement is invalid due to lack of signature or understanding. The court concludes that the plaintiff has not waived his right to seek arbitration and that the case will be stayed until such arbitration has been completed.
