And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Department of Fair Employment and Housing (Department) moves to compel further responses to debtor document requests from Nasiry, the chief executive officer of M&N Financing Corp. Nasiry represents himself. The Department's requests for monetary sanctions are denied without prejudice. The Court finds that Nasiry's appeal of the final amended judgment does not stay the case and bars the Court from hearing the Department's motion, as Nasiry did not post an undertaking. The Court also disagrees with Nasiry's claim that he posted an undertaking. The Court grants the Department's motion to compel further responses to debtor document requests, as Nasiry's responses were identical, boilerplate objections-only responses that did not go to the substance of the requests. The Court orders Nasiry to provide further substantive responses and notes that the requests can be revisited if Nasiry fails to comply with this ruling.
