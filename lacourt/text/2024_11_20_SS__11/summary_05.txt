And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Department of Fair Employment and Housing has moved to compel further responses to debtor interrogatories from Nasiry, who is representing himself as the chief executive officer of M&N Financing Corp. The judge granted the motion, finding that Nasiry's responses to the interrogatories were boilerplate objections-only responses that did not adequately address the substance of the requests. The judge ordered Nasiry to provide further substantive responses, including a privilege log if he contends that any of the requests seek privileged information. The judge also denied the Department's request for a $2,325.00 monetary sanction without prejudice, reserving the right to revisit the request if Nasiry fails to comply with the ruling.
