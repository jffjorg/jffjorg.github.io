And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Department of Fair Employment and Housing has moved to compel further responses to debtor interrogatories from Mahmood Nasiry, who is the defendant in this case. The interrogatories are related to a business that Nasiry and his company, M&N Financing Corp., operated, which purchased retail installment sales contracts from used car dealerships. The business used a formula to determine how much to pay for the contracts, which considered the gender of the car purchaser. The Court of Appeal reinstated the Department's fifth cause of action, which alleged that Nasiry and M&N Financing Corp. engaged in unfair business practices. Nasiry has appealed the final amended judgment, but the Court has ruled that his appeal does not stay the case and bar it from hearing the Department's motion.

The Court has granted the Department's motion to compel further responses to the debtor interrogatories, finding that Nasiry's objections to the requests do not go to the substance of the requests and appear to be based on the same argument that the Court has already rejected multiple times. The Court has also denied the Department's request for a $2,325.00 monetary sanction without prejudice, and has given Nasiry an opportunity to comply with the ruling.
