And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge is inclined to hold an evidentiary hearing with live testimony to determine whether the transportation-worker exception applies. The judge is also inclined to agree with CR and MVP that they can enforce the arbitration agreement, despite not being signatories, because of equitable estoppel and agency theories. However, the judge declines to rule on the unconscionability and enforcement of the arbitration agreement, as the outcome depends on whether the FAA applies.

The judge notes that the plaintiff fails to establish the transportation-worker exception, citing the Ninth Circuit's decision in Ortiz v. Randstad Inhouse Services, LLC (9th Cir. 2024) 95 F.4th 1152. The judge also notes that the FAA exemption for transportation workers is fact-intensive and requires evidence of the employee's duties and the nature of the employer's business.

The judge orders the parties to provide additional evidence to support their claims, including evidence of the plaintiff's duties and the nature of CR's business. The judge also invites the parties to submit written arguments on the issues of unconscionability and enforcement of the arbitration agreement.
