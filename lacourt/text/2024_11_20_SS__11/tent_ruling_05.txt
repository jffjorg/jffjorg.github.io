TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Department’s motion to compel further responses to debtor
interrogatories is granted.
 
The Department’s sanctions request is denied without prejudice.
 
BACKGROUND
 
The second amended
complaint (“SAC”) alleges that M&N Financing Corp. (“M&N”) and Nasiry
“operated a business that purchased retail installment sales contracts [] from
used car dealerships.”  (Department of
Fair Employment and Housing v. M&N Financing Corp. (2021) 69 Cal.App.5th
434, 437 (“M&N”).)[1]  “In deciding how much to pay for the
contracts, defendants used a formula that considered the gender of the car
purchaser.”  (Id. at 437-438.)  “[D]efendants would pay more for a contract
with a male purchaser than for a contract with a female purchaser or female
coborrower[.]”  (Id. at 438.)
 
In late September
2021, following summary adjudication and judgment on the pleadings, the Court
of Appeal reinstated the Department’s fifth cause of action.  (See ibid.) 
It was the only cause of action that the Court of Appeal revived.  (See ibid.; see also id. at 443-444, 446.)
 
On August 31, 2023,
the Department dismissed the fifth cause of action without prejudice.
 
On September 19,
2023, Nasiry’s motion to order the Department to join him to the fifth cause of
action as an indispensable party came on for hearing.  The Court held that it did not have
jurisdiction to hear the motion.  (See
9/19/23 Minute Order, p. 1.)
 
(11/3/23 Ruling
Re: Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, p. 1.)
 
On November 3, 2023,
the Court heard Nasiry’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.  The Court found the motion moot and/or denied
it in full.
 
On December 1, 2023,
the Court entered the final amended judgment (“FAJ”) in the Department’s favor.
 
On January 26, 2024,
Nasiry filed a notice of appeal.
 
A few days later, on
January 30, 2024, Nasiry filed a motion to vacate.
 
(4/10/24 Ruling
Re: Motion to Vacate Final Amended Judgment, pp. 1-2.)
 
On April 10,
2024, the Court denied Nasiry’s motion, and the matter is now on appeal.
 
Here, the Department moves to
compel further responses to debtor interrogatories (set one).
 
DISCUSSION[2]
 
The first issue is whether
Nasiry’s appeal of the FAJ stays the case and bars the Court from hearing the
Department’s motion.  The answer depends
on whether Nasiry posted an undertaking. 
(See Reply, p. 2 [conceding that “[a] valid undertaking does forestall
debtor discovery”].)  Nasiry claims he
did.  (See Opposition, p.  5.) 
The Court disagrees.  As the
Department points out, “Nasiry . . . conflate[s] an abstract judgment recorded
by [the Deparatment] with the undertaking required to be given by [] Nasiry
himself.”  (Ibid. [noting that “[a]n undertaking
given by a judgment debtor stays enforcement of a money judgement during
an appeal . . . whereas an abstract of judgment filed by a judgment creditor
merely creates a lien upon real property of the judgment debtor”], emphasis in
original.)
 
The next issue is whether the
Department’s motion should be granted. 
The answer is yes.  The motion
concerns 32 debtor interrogatories.  Nasiry
responded to each interrogatory with an identical, boilerplate, objections-only
response.  (See Department’s Separate
Statement, pp. 1-206.)  The objections do
not go to the substance of the requests and appear to regard the
indispensable-parties issue that the Court has already rejected multiple
times.  Further substantive responses
must be provided. 
 
To the extent Nasiry contends the
requests seek privileged information, he bears the burden to file a privilege
log with the further responses.
 
The Department’s request for a
$2,325.00 monetary sanction is denied without prejudice.  The request can be revisited if Nasiry fails
to comply with this ruling.
