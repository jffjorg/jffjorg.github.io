This is a tentative ruling by Judge W Joseph Kamkar regarding a hearing on December 9, 2024, in case number 24VECV03617. The case is an unlawful detainer action filed by Joseph Kamkar against Oscar Parada for nonpayment of rent. On July 31, 2024, Kamkar filed the complaint, and on November 6, 2024, Parada filed a Notice of Bankruptcy. However, the bankruptcy was dismissed on November 20, 2024.

Kamkar moved the court to compel Parada to provide complete written responses to his discovery requests, including requests for inspection and copying, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. Kamkar also sought an order deeming the truth of the matters in his requests for admissions to be admitted. Additionally, Kamkar sought monetary sanctions against Parada.

The court granted Kamkar's motions, ordering Parada to provide full and complete verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 5 days. The court also imposed monetary sanctions against Parada in the amount of $1,200, payable within 30 days.
