DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff Joseph Kamkar moves the court for
an order compelling Defendant Oscar Parada to provide complete written
responses, without objection, to Plaintiff’s First Set of Demands for
Inspection and Copying, First Set of Special Interrogatories, and First Set of
Form Interrogatories as well as seeks an order deeming the truth of the matters
in Plaintiff’s First Set of Request for Admissions be deemed admitted.
Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions against Defendant. Plaintiff makes the
motions on the grounds Defendant failed to timely respond to Plaintiff’s
discovery requests. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to
serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may
also move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of
any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On
October 16, 2024, Plaintiff propounded discovery to Defendant including a First
Set of Demands for Inspection and Copying, First Set of Form Interrogatories,
First Set of Special Interrogatories and First Set of Requests for Admissions.
(Block Decl. ¶2, Exh. 1.) As this is an unlawful detainer action, Defendant’s
responses were due seven days later, on October 23, 2024. (Block Decl. ¶3.) On
October 24, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel set a meet and confer letter to Defendant,
stating they would be forced to file motions to compel and seek sanctions if
they did not receive complete responses by end of day on October 29, 2024.
(Block Decl. ¶4, Exh. 3.) To date, Plaintiff has not received any responses
from Defendant. (Block Decl. ¶5.) 

Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion for Order Compelling Responses to
Plaintiff’s First Set of Requests for Inspection and Copying; Motion for Order
Compelling Responses to Plaintiff’s First Set for Special Interrogatories;
Motion for Order Compelling Responses to Plaintiffs’ First Set for Form
Interrogatories; and Motion to Deem Admitted the Facts Set Forth in Plaintiff’s
First Set of Requests for Admissions are GRANTED. 
 
Defendant
is ordered to produce full and complete verified responses, without objections
within 5 days. 
 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff
seeks monetary sanctions against Defendant or Defendant’s counsel in the amount
of $960.00 per motion, or $3,840.00 total. 
 
If a propounding party moves for and
obtains a court order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary
sanctions against the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and
demands for inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c),
2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
The court GRANTS the monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,200,
payable within 30 days.
