Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Number:** 18STCV05562-2

**Plaintiffs:** Marci Higer and Brad Waisbren

**Defendants:** County of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County Flood Control District, and other defendants

**Facts:**

* The 2017 storm event caused flooding on the property, damaging the plaintiffs' stored chattels.
* The defendants argue that the flooding was caused by a 500-year storm event that exceeded the capacity of the flood control facilities.
* The plaintiffs argue that the flooding was caused by the defendants' negligence and breach of duty.

**Procedural Issues:**

* The defendants' motion for summary judgment is procedurally deficient for not separately identifying each cause of action in the separate statement.
* The plaintiffs object to the defendants' evidence, arguing that it is unreliable and lacks foundation.

**Analysis:**

* The defendants argue that the plaintiffs cannot prove causation because the historic, high-intensity 500-year storm event produced flows that exceeded the capacity of the flood control facilities.
* The plaintiffs argue that the defendants' evidence is unreliable and that the storm event was not a 500-year event, but rather a 25-50 year event.
* The court finds that the defendants fail to satisfy their burden of proving no triable issue of fact as to the plaintiffs' claims for inverse condemnation, breach of mandatory duty, and dangerous condition of public property.

**Conclusion:**

* The court denies the defendants' motion for summary adjudication as to the plaintiffs' claims for inverse condemnation, breach of mandatory duty, and dangerous condition of public property.
* The court finds that the plaintiffs have standing to sue under the Public Records Act.
* The court will consider the plaintiffs' evidence and arguments regarding the violation of the Public Records Act.
