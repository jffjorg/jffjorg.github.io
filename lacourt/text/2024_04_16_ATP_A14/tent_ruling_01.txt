  Case Number:  18STCV05562-1    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
Plaintiffs Marci Higer (“Higer”) and
Brad¿Waisbren¿(“Waisbren” and collectively “Plaintiffs”) were tenants at the
storage facility located at 3421 Gillespie in Acton, CA (the “Property”).¿ On
August 03, 2017, a tumultuous rainstorm resulted in flooding on the Property,
damaging Plaintiff’s stored chattels.¿ On February 02, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a
Government Tort Claim with Defendant County of Los Angeles (“COLA”), which was
ultimately denied on May 21, 2018.¿ 
 
¿On November 18, 2018, Plaintiffs filed
their initial Complaint against COLA and Defendants Los Angeles County of
Regional Planning, Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, Los Angeles
County Flood Control District, and Los Angeles County Waterworks District No.
37, Acton, alleging ten (10) cause of action sounding in (1)¿Negligence, (2)
Inverse Condemnation; (3) Public Nuisance; (4) Private Nuisance; (5) Premises
Liability; (6) Premises Liability–Willful Failure to Warn (Civ. Code § 846);
(7)¿ Trespass; (8) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; (9) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress (“NIED”); (10) Dangerous Condition of Public
Property–Gov. Code §§ 830–840.6.¿ Plaintiffs’¿principal¿contention is that the
flooding on the property was caused and exacerbated by the design,
construction, and maintenance of the county’s neighboring roads and flood water
infrastructure, which allegedly carried large amounts of storm runoff directly
to Plaintiffs’ property as a de facto catch basin.¿ 
 
On June 10, 2019, prior to any Answer from
any defendant, Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint (“FAC”), alleging
ten (10) causes of action sounding in (1)¿Inverse Condemnation, (2) Negligence;
(3) Public Nuisance; (4) Private Nuisance; (5) Premises Liability; (6)
Trespass; (7)¿Premises Liability–Willful Failure to Warn (Civ. Code § 846) ;
(8) NIED; (9) Dangerous Condition of Public Property (Gov. Code §§ 830–840.6);
and (10)Violations of the California Public Records Act Request, Gov. Code § 6250¿et
al.¿ Plaintiff named only two of the previously named defendants in the initial
complaint, COLA and Defendant Los Angeles County Flood Control District
(“LACFCD” and¿collectively “Defendants”).¿ 
 
On December 12, 2019, the Court sustained
Defendants’ Demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC, with leave to amend.¿ Plaintiff filed
their Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on January 10,¿2020¿alleging four (4)
causes of action for (1) Inverse Condemnation (2) Risk of Peculiar Kind (Gov.
Code § 815.6); (2) Dangerous Condition of Public Property¿(Gov. Code §§
830–840.6); and Violation of the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §
6250).¿ 
 
¿On July 09,¿2020¿the Court sustained
Defendants’ Demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action, with
leave to amend and overruled the demur as to the fourth cause of action.¿
Plaintiffs filed the Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) on August 03,¿2020¿realleging
four (4) causes of action for (1) Inverse Condemnation (2) Risk of Peculiar
Kind (Gov. Code § 815.6); (3) Dangerous Condition of Public Property¿(Gov. Code
§§ 830–840.6); and (4) Violation of the California Public Records Act (Gov.
Code § 6250).¿ 
 
On October 20, 2020, the Court sustained
Defendants’ Demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action to
Plaintiffs’ TAC, providing Plaintiffs with leave to amend. On April 05, 2021,
Plaintiffs filed the Fourth Amended Complaint realleging four (4) causes of
action for (1) Inverse Condemnation, (2) Violation of Gov. Code § 815.6; (3)
Dangerous Condition of Public Property (Gov. Code §§ 830, 835, 835.2); and (4)
Violation of the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code § 6250). 
 
On July 16, 2021, the Court sustained
Defendants’ Demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action to
Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amended Complaint, providing Plaintiff’s with leave to
amend. On October 14, 2021, Plaintiffs filed the Fifth Amended Complaint
(“5AC”) realleging four (4) causes of action for (1) Inverse Condemnation, (2)
Violation of Gov. Code § 815.6; (3) Dangerous Condition of Public Property
(Gov. Code §§ 830, 835, 835.2); and (4) Violation of the California Public
Records Act (Gov. Code § 6250).

Demurrer with Motion to strike. Subsequently, the Demurrer was overruled and
the Motion to Strike was Denied on January 20, 2022. 
 
On February 18, 2022, Defendants filed their

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Sanctions – Any party may obtain discovery by inspecting,
copying, testing, or sampling documents, tangible things, land or other
property, and electronically stored information in the possession, custody, or
control of any other party to the action. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.010(a).)
Service of a proper¿demand for inspection is required.¿(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.020.) If, after service of¿such a demand, a plaintiff fails to serve a
timely response, a defendant may move for an order compelling response and
compliance. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(b).) If a plaintiff fails then
fails to obey the order compelling response and compliance, “the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7.” (Id. at
(c).)¿In lieu of or in addition to that sanction the court may impose a
monetary sanction. (Id.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Any party may obtain discovery by
propounding to any other party to the action written interrogatories that are
to be answered under oath. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.010.)¿Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. §2030.290 provides that a party may bring a motion to compel responses to
interrogatories, where the responding party failed to serve a timely response.
Unless otherwise agreed, the responding party is required to serve response
within 30 days after service of the discovery demand for production documents.
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2030.290(b).)¿If a plaintiff fails then fails to obey
the order compelling answers, “the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2030.290(c).)¿In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction the court may impose a monetary
sanction. (Id.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Terminating sanctions under Chapter 7
include:¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
(1) An order striking out the pleadings or
parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process.¿¿¿ 
(2) An order staying further proceedings by
that party until an order for discovery is obeyed.¿¿¿ 
(3) An order dismissing the action, or any
part of the action, of that party.¿¿¿ 
(4) An order rendering a judgment by default
against that party.¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§2023.030(d).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Chapter 7 (Sanctions) also provides that
trial courts may impose monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence
sanctions, and terminating sanctions against “anyone engaging in conduct that
is a misuse of the discovery process.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2023.030.) Misuses
of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, failing to respond to
an authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order. (Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. §2023.010.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
“ ‘ “ ‘The power to impose discovery
sanctions is a broad discretion subject to reversal only for arbitrary,
capricious, or whimsical action. [Citations.] Only two facts are absolutely
prerequisite to imposition of the sanction: (1) there must be a failure to
comply . . . and (2) the failure must be wilful [sic]. . .’ ” ’¿ (Vallbona
v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal. App. 4th 1525, 1545 [51 Cal. Rptr. 2d 311].)” (R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal. App. 4th 486,
496.)¿¿¿

Discussion
 
Request for Judicial Notice
– On Reply, Waisbren requests
judicial notice of several documents. The Court does not take judicial notice
of these documents. The salutary rule is that points raised in a reply brief for
the first time will not be considered unless good cause is shown for the
failure to present them before.” (Balboa Ins. Co. v. Aguirre (1983) 149
Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010.) This applies to new evidence as well –
“[t]he general rule of motion practice … is that new evidence is not
permitted with reply papers.” (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th
1522, 1537.) “This rule is based on the same solid logic applied in the
appellate courts, specifically, that ‘[p]oints raised for the first time in a
reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because such consideration would
deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument.’ ” (Id.
at 1538 [citing American Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453; Browne v. County of Tehama (2013) 213
Cal.App.4th 704, 720, fn. 10].) As such, the Court does not consider Waisbren’s
new evidence submitted in the Reply brief. 

 
Application – While
the motions are brought separately, the content is identical. The Court will
address the motions together for the purpose of the judicial economy.
 
Waisbren argues that Defendants
are attempting to circumvent the Court’s order as Defendants have combined
responses and documents within a Dropbox link; that Defendants are violating
the Court Order and California law as the documents have not been taken to FedEx
Kinkos[1]
located at 12101 Ventura Blvd, Studio City, CA 91604 or mailed to Brad
Waisbren, P.O. Box 1928, Studio City, CA 91614l and; ultimately, presents that Defendants
have not produced documents in compliance with Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§2031.280(a). Waisbren next presents that Defendants have all of the documents
and have now started providing them despite an objection to October 16, 2019
propounded discovery in which Defendants included an objection on the basis of attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product doctrine, and deliberative privilege and, as
such, Defendants should be sanctioned for making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery as they have lied to
Plaintiffs and misled the Court. Waisbren cites to statute and caselaw and
presents that the Court (1) may dismiss the action where a party misuses the
discovery process; (2) terminating sanctions are appropriate by “Striking
Defendants Answer and Entering Judgment for Plaintiffs against Defendants or in
the alternative striking Defendants Notice of Motion and Motion for Summary
Judgment, or, Summary Adjudication in the Alternative currently set for hearing
on February 27, 2024 and prohibiting Defendants from re-filing the Motion”
(Motions 15:12-15) for willful violation of a court order; (3) in the
alternative evidentiary sanctions are appropriate for misuse of the discovery
process; (4) the Court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both, pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct; and (5) sanctions are
appropriate as Defendants have refused to provide responses to discovery
propounded in August 2023 despite a court order and should be imposed in the
amounts of $484.54 and $1,000.00 in sanctions against Defendant and each and
every one of their attorneys of record which represents reasonable expenses
incurred. 
 
Defendants present that they
served verified responses and verified supplemental responses, respectively, by
January 11, 2024. (See Opp., Decl. Fond ¶ 6); that the responses indicated that
the responsive documents were to be produced electronically and paper documents
were available for inspection and copying at a county office in Alhambra (id.,
Decl. Fond ¶ 6 and Exh. A); that the Dropbox link was sent on January 17, 2024
(id., Decl. Fond ¶ 7 and Exh. B); and additional documents had been
located and forwarded to counsel three weeks after February 14, 2024 which led
to a March 25, 2024 email to Plaintiffs that contained a new Dropbox link (id.,
Decl. Fond ¶¶ 9-11, Exh. C). Defendants present that, at this time, all the
responsive electric documents have been produced with an index and all paper
copies have been made available by for inspection and copying. (See Opp. 2:9-15.)
Defendants believe that their response on January 11, 2024 satisfies this
Court’s December 12, 2023 Order and that their actions and evidence establish
that they have not disobeyed this Court’s December 12, 2023 Order. Defendants
concede that a party propounding RFPs has an affirmative obligation to specify
a time and place of production that is reasonable under Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§2031.030(c)(2)-(3), but argue that the Studio City FedEx Kinko’s was
unreasonable as it is far removed from where the documents are located, for an
unspecified amount of time, and would require employees or attorneys to
chaperone the documents. Defendants state that no privilege log was necessary
and a joint response is not in violation of the Court’s December 12, 2023 Order.
Defendants believe that there is no prejudice to Plaintiffs as Waisbren has
stated: “ ‘Plaintiff is simply trying to seek the facts, the truth and
information in preparation for a further opposition to Defendants’ Motion for
Summary Judgment and trial.’ ” (Opp. 8:19-22 [citing moving papers].)
Defendants also present that they have gone out of their way to ensure
Plaintiffs have time to minimize or negate any detrimental impact from their
delay by filing an Ex Parte Application to continue the MSJ and Plaintiffs
opposed a continuance, showing that they would rather have a windfall and not
compliance with this Court’s December 12, 2023 order. Defendants further argue:
(1) Plaintiffs have established no grounds for terminating sanctions, (2) the
standards for obtaining terminating sanctions are the same for Plaintiffs as
for parties represented by lawyers, (3) evidentiary sanctions in the form
Plaintiffs seek would be equivalent to terminating sanctions, (4) Plaintiffs
motion to hold Defendants and their attorneys in contempt is unsupported by the
record as Plaintiffs have failed to establish willful disobedience, and (4)
Plaintiffs have not established a right to monetary sanctions in excess of
their court fees for filing the motions as Plaintiffs have conceded that a pro
se litigant “ ‘is entitled to reasonable expenses incurred as a discovery
sanction, but cannot recover attorney fees.’ ” (Opp. 14:19-21 [citing moving
papers].)
 
On Reply, Waisbren argues that
the circumstances support terminating sanctions as they have not complied with
the Court’s Order. Waisbren further argues that the responses are still
incomplete and are not in compliance with Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.280(a)
due to the refusal to provide paper documents and that Defendants do not have
the right to object to the document production location as the Court ordered
responses without objections. Waisbren further presents: (1) Plaintiffs are not
at fault for Defendants disobedience of the Court’s December 12, 2023 Order;
(2) Plaintiffs are not moving for another court order for Defendants to ignore;
(3) Defendants are incorrect in their opinion of the Court’s December 12, 2023
Court Order; and (4) monetary and contempt sanctions should be imposed. 
 
Waisbren seeks to include Higer
in these Motions for Terminating Sanctions. (See Reply, X [“X. BOTH PLAINTIFFS
ARE REQUESTING TERMINATING SANCTIONS”].) To do so would create an issue
surrounding notice. 
 
Waisbren includes an argument
that Defendants do not have the documents to support their MSJ. This is a new
argument as the moving papers only discussed Plaintiffs inability to oppose the
Motion for Summary Judgment. (See Motion for Terminating Sanctions RE: COLA
16:20-23 [“Plaintiff is simply trying to seek the facts, the truth and
information in preparation for a further opposition to Defendants’ Motion for
Summary Judgment and trial. Defendant has taken actions (or in this case not
taken actions) that interfere with the courts ability to administer justice and
have insulted the dignity of the court.”], 18:2-4 [“Defendants’ obstructive
gamesmanship has caused Plaintiffs to incur significant lost time in the
prosecution of their case and have suffered prejudice in their ability to
properly prepare for the opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment and the
trial.”]; See Motion for Terminating Sanctions RE: LAFCD 16:15-17 [“Plaintiff
is simply trying to seek the facts, the truth and information in preparation
for a further opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment and trial.
Defendant has taken actions (or in this case not taken actions) that interfere
with the courts ability to administer justice and have insulted the dignity of
the court.”], 18:25-27 [“Defendants’ obstructive gamesmanship has caused
Plaintiffs to incur significant lost time in the prosecution of their case and
have suffered prejudice in their ability to properly prepare for the opposition
to the Motion for Summary Judgment and the trial.”].) The salutary
rule is that points raised in a reply brief for the first time will not be
considered unless good cause is shown for the failure to present them before.”
(Balboa Ins. Co., supra,149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010.) “This rule is based
on the same solid logic applied in the appellate courts, specifically, that
‘[p]oints raised for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be
considered, because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an
opportunity to counter the argument.’ ” (Jay, supra, 218 Cal.App.4th at 1538
[citing American Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1446,
1453; Browne v. County of Tehama (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 704, 720, fn.
10].) As such, the Court does not consider Waisbren’s new argument
submitted in the Reply brief. 
 
At the very center of the
arguments between the parties is whether the Court’s December 12, 2023 Order
was followed. The answer is no. The Court’s December 12, 2023 Order reads:
 
Plaintiffs Marci Higer and
Brad Waisbren’s Motion to Compel Defendant Los Angeles County Flood Control
District’s Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set Two) is
MOOT. 
 
Plaintiffs Marci Higer and
Brad Waisbren’s Motion to Compel Defendant Los Angeles County Flood Control
District’s Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set Three) is
GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiffs Marci Higer and
Brad Waisbren’s Motion to Compel Defendant County of Los Angeles’ Further
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set Three) is GRANTED,
subject to a privilege log. 
 
The Court orders
Defendants Los Angeles County Flood Control District and County of Los Angeles
to provide responses within 30 days of this Court Order. 
 
The Court declines to impose
sanctions.  
 
(12/12/2023 Order After Hearing
[emphasis added].)
 
The briefing schedule was
included in the December 12, 2023 Minute Order. 
 
The Court ordered the responses
to be produced and set a briefing schedule in relation to when the responses
would be answered. 
 
Waisbren presents that there is a
verification issue. The Court has looked at the exhibits presented. Waisbren
does not provide the January 11, 2024 responses (see Decl. Waisbren for both
motions at ¶ 7 [only email provided in Exh. 3].) Defendants provide only the
first three pages. (See Opp., Exh. A.) The only verifications are found at
Waisbren’s moving papers at Exhibit 8 and Defendants’ Opposition at Exhibit D,
showing a verification from an agent of Defendants executed on March 22, 2024. 
 
While Defendants believe their January
11, 2024 responses are sufficient, they also concede that (1) the January 11,
2024 responses were an announcement of intention to produce responsive
documents (see Opp. 5:21-24; p. 7 fn. 4; Decl. Fond ¶ 6); (2) no electronic
documents were set until January 17, 2024 (see Opp.5-7; Decl. Fond ¶ 7); (3) no
physical documents were produced at the location specified by Plaintiffs (see
Opp. 1:15-18; Exh. A; Exh. D) and (4) additional documents were received
leading to a new Dropbox link on March 25, 2024 with an index (see Opp.
6:24-27, 9:13-16, 15:13-17; Fond Decl. at ¶ 11; Exh. C; Exh. D). Defendants did
not provide any substantive response until January 17, 2024, six days after the
responses were due, and it appears that such responses were served without
verification. (See Opp. 6:23-27 [“That task took until Friday, March 22 to
complete, On March 25, defendants served verified Amended and Supplemental
Responses to RFP3, including the index, which is covered by the verification.
(Fond, Ex. C-D)”];  Exh. D.) It is well
settled that “[u]nsworn responses are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Thus, Defendants did not
provide a response until March 25, 2024, when the responses with verifications
and a new Dropbox link, including documents that were not present in the January
17, 2024 Dropbox link, were served. Further, the paper documents were never
produced, instead Defendants made them available at a location of their choice
despite the concession that a party propounding RFPs has an affirmative
obligation to specify a time and place of production that is reasonable under
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2031.030(c)(2)-(3). 
 
The Court notes that there appear
to be no objections in the March 25, 2024 responses. (See Opp. Exh. D.) 
 
A related issue is whether
Plaintiffs’ request that the documents be brought to the Studio City FedEx
Kinkos was reasonable. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.030(c)(3) provides: “Each
demand in a set shall be separately set forth, identified by number or letter,
and shall do all of the following: . . . (3) Specify a reasonable place for
making the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, and performing any
related activity.” Defendants have presented the following reason for not
producing the paper documents at the Studio City FedEx Kinkos:
 
Plaintiffs continue
to reject defendants’ offer to make their paper documents available for
inspection and copying at county offices. (Fond, ¶¶7, 12, and Ex. B.)
Plaintiffs insist that defendants are obligated to produce documents for plaintiffs’
inspection and copying at the FedEx Office location specified in RFP3.
 
A party propounding
RFPs has an affirmative obligation to specify a time and place of production
that is reasonable. CCP §2031.030(c)(2)-(3). Given the length and breadth of
RFP3, Waisbren’s demand is patently unreasonable. It calls for defendants to
produce their documents at a public location far removed from where the
documents are located, for an unspecified amount of time, while plaintiffs
first review them to decide which documents to copy and then turn over the
documents for copying. Naturally, this requires the personal attendance of one
or more County employees or attorneys to chaperone the documents while
plaintiffs are inspecting them and having them copied.
 
(Opp. 7:5-19.) 
 
Thus, Defendants’ argument for
not producing the documents at the FedEx Kinkos is that the location is
unreasonable, that it would take an unspecified amount of time to review the
documents, and someone would have to watch the documents. There are no statutes
or legal standard cited for the arguments that an unspecified amount of time
and the necessity of a “document chaperone” would prevent production. As such,
the Court does not address these arguments. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2031.030, subdivision (c)(3) (section 2031.030(c)(3)), requires inspection to
occur in a “reasonable place.” It is helpful to look at Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§
2025.250 and 2025.260 for reference in this determination, as these statutes
appear to be in pari materia with the “reasonable place” requirement in section
2031.030(c)(3). “ ‘Statutes are considered to be in pari materia when they
relate to the same person or thing, to the same class of persons [or] things,
or have the same purpose or object. Characterization of the object or purpose
is more important than characterization of subject matter in determining
whether different statutes are closely enough related to justify interpreting
one in light of the other.’ ” (People v. Honig (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th
289, 327.) Here, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.030(c)(3) requires the location of
an inspection demand to be “reasonable,” and section 2025.250 places geographic
limitations on how far away a deposition may be held from a defendant's
residence or place of business. Subdivision (b) of that statute reads: “The
deposition of an organization that is a party to the action shall be taken at a
place that is, at the option of the party giving notice of the deposition,
either within 75 miles of the organization's principal executive or business
office in California, or within the county where the action is pending and
within 150 miles of that office.” One of the concerns of the joint commission
that adopted section 2025.250 was that “ ‘neither parties nor third persons
should be required to travel long distances for a deposition.’ ” (Toyota
Motor Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1107, 1120.) It is
difficult to see how the court could assess the reasonableness of the
inspection without considering the distance that would need to be traveled to
complete discovery, and, in Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.250, the Legislature
placed a limit of 150 miles on how far a business entity that is a party can be
made to travel for its deposition. Both sets of statutes therefore speak to the
same basic “object or purpose.” (Honig, supra, 48 Cal.App.4th at
p. 327.) “When statutes are in pari materia, they should be construed together
as one statute. [Citations.] So interpreted, ‘all parts of a statute should be
read together and construed in a manner that gives effect to each, yet does not
lead to disharmony with the others.’ ” (Ibid.) Here, the documents were
contained at two locations: (1) 900 South Fremont Ave., Alhambra, CA 91803; and
(2) 335A Avenue K-6, Lancaster, CA 93535. (See Opp. Exh. A.) The Court takes
judicial notice of the distance from the addresses of the building that
maintains the documents to the Studio City FedEx Kinkos under Cal. Evid. Code §
452(h). Regarding the Alhambra building, the distance between the two locations
is from 19.7 miles to 20.5 miles, depending on the route taken. (Google Maps, Directions
“900 S Fremont Ave, Alhambra, CA 91803” to “FedEx Office Print & Ship
Center, 12101 Ventura Blvd, Studio City, CA 91604” [as of Apr. 09, 2024].) Regarding
the Lancaster building, the distance between the two locations is from 59.2
miles to 60.6 miles, depending on the route taken. (Google Maps, Directions “335A
Avenue K-6, Lancaster, CA 93535” to “FedEx Office Print & Ship Center,
12101 Ventura Blvd, Studio City, CA 91604” [as of Apr. 09, 2024].) The distances
are reasonable. 
 
The Court turns next to the four
questions in front of it:
 
1.      Are
terminating sanctions appropriate?
2.      Are
contempt sanctions appropriate?
3.      Are
evidentiary sanctions appropriate?
4.      Are
monetary sanctions appropriate?
 
i.                   
Terminating Sanctions
 
The imposition
of terminating sanctions is a drastic measure. (See¿Deyo¿v. Kilbourne¿(1978)
84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793 (“The sanction of dismissal or the rendition of a
default judgment against the disobedient party is ordinarily a drastic measure
which should be employed with caution. [Citation] However, there is no question
that a court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction against a litigant who
persists in the outright refusal to comply with his discovery obligations.
[Citation] The refusal to reveal material evidence is deemed to be an admission
that the claim or defense is without merit. [Citations]”).)¿In general,¿a
terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has
attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the
record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective. (Lopez v.
Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc.¿(2016)¿246 Cal. App.
4th 566, 604-05.) In Lopez, the Court ordered¿Lopez¿to produce documents
and repeated this order over “several subsequent hearings.” (Id. at
605.) However, “terminating
sanctions are to be used sparingly, only when the trial court concludes that
lesser sanctions would not bring about the compliance of the offending party.”
(R.S. Creative, Inc., supra, 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 496.)
Additionally, “ ‘where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse,
and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance
with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.’ [Citations.]” Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174
Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)  
 
When determining if a terminating sanction
is appropriate, trial courts consider the totality of the circumstances:
conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to
the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain
the discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246 [“Lang”].)
Lang provides a review of cases in which trial courts issued terminating
sanctions. “In each case, the offending party spent months avoiding or evading
discovery.” (Ibid.)  
 
Here, the Court’s Order was not adhered to;
however, at this time, the electronic documents have been turned over. Ultimately,
some of the outstanding discovery has been turned over. This case has been
plagued by discovery issues from both parties and there have been a number of
attempts to rectify the discovery issues in front of this Court. However, as to
the underlying specific discovery alone, the Court addressed the issue in the
form of Motions to Compel Further, which led to a new briefing schedule for the
Motion for Summary Judgment, and, now, these motions requesting terminating
sanctions. The Court notes that, pursuant to its Courtroom Rules, IDCs are held
prior to the filing of any motion to compel further. The Court has also
previously only imposed monetary sanctions. As such, it is not appropriate to
impose terminating sanctions. 
 
Accordingly, the requests for orders issuing
terminating sanctions against Defendants is denied.
 
ii.                 
Contempt Sanctions
 
A violation of a discovery order, just like
any other court order, is punishable as a contempt of court, and contempt
sanctions are available against parties, attorneys, and nonparty witnesses to
achieve the objectives of discovery. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §2023.030(e).) A
contempt sanction consists either of the imposition of a fine not exceeding
$1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 5 days, or both. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc.
§1218(a).) In addition, a person adjudged guilty of contempt for violating a
court order may be ordered to pay to the party initiating the contempt
proceeding the “reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred” in connection
with the contempt proceeding. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1218(a).)
 
Case precedent provides that a contempt
sanction is seldom used to enforce discovery orders and is inappropriate in all
but the most extreme situations in which “the court's dignity is truly
compromised and no other suitable penalty can be found.” (In re de la Parra
(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 139, 144-45.) 
 
Contempt sanctions are inappropriate for the
matter before this Court. 
 
Accordingly, the requests for orders issuing
contempt sanctions against Defendants is denied.
 
iii.               
Evidentiary Sanctions
 
The Court notes that a motion for issue or
evidentiary sanctions requires a separate statement and Waisbren has not
complied with the requirement. (See Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345(a)(7).) Defendants
appear to take no issue with this deficiency and has responded via a Memorandum
of Points and Authorities without a separate statement. The Court addresses the
issue on its merits. 
 
To impose an evidence sanction, there must
be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure must be willful. (Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) “Even where
nonmonetary sanctions are called for, they should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Ibid.) “The
sanctions the court may impose are such that are suitable and necessary to
enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he
seeks, but the court may not impose sanctions which are designed not to
accomplish the objects of discovery but to impose punishment.” (Ibid.) 
“[W]hen a party repeatedly and willfully fails to provide certain evidence to
the opposing party as required by the discovery rules, preclusion of the
evidence may be appropriate, even if such a sanction proves determinative in
terminating the plaintiff's case.” (Ibid.) “[A] persistent refusal to
comply with an order for the production of evidence is tantamount to an
admission that the disobedient party really has no meritorious claim.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, there was a failure to comply with
this Court’s December 12, 2024 Order. The actions of Defendants have adversely
impacted the supplemental briefing schedule by the Court. Defendants have
provided substantive responses only after the Court’s deadline. It appears this
failure to provide such information was willful as Defendants provided (1) a
“response” declaring their intent to respond on January 11, 2024, the day the
Court had ordered responses due, and (2) Defendants did not provide a verified
response until March 25, 2024, over a month after their own supplemental reply
brief was due. 
 
The Court is inclined to impose evidentiary sanctions
as to RFPs, Set Three, due to the issues presented. The Court invites oral
argument on this matter. 
 
iv.               
Monetary Sanctions
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a) provides
that “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in
the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or
both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone
as a result of that conduct.” A misuse of the discovery process “include[s] . .
. [d]isobeying a court order to provide discovery.” (Doppes v. Bentley
Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 991.)
 
Defendant concedes that Waisbren is entitled
to reasonable expenses. Defendant believes that the only expenses that are
reasonable are the filing fees, presumed to be $120.00. 
 
While Waisbren requests “$484.54 in
sanctions against Defendant and each and every one of their attorneys of record
which represents reasonable expenses incurred” (Mtn. for Terminating Sanctions
RE: LACFD 18:14-16; Mtn. for Terminating Sanctions RE: COLA 18:19-21) and “per
CCP §2023.050, Defendant and each and every one of their attorneys of record be
sanctioned $1000.00” (Mtn. for Terminating Sanctions RE: LACFD 18:17-18; Mtn.
for Terminating Sanctions RE: COLA 18:22-23), the requested $484.54 “against
Defendant and each and every one of their attorneys of record” which is likely
directed at the four attorneys on Defendants’ header are unsupported. (See Decl.
of Wasibren in both motions at ¶ 16 [“I spent $149.54 for filing fees, $20 for
parking at the Los Angeles County Law Library, $20 for copies at the Los
Angeles County Law Library, $200 Lexis/Nexis Fee and $75 for travel to the Los
Angeles County Law Library and the hearing on this motion and $20 for paper.”]
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.040 requires facts supporting the amount requested
to be set forth. 
 
The Court
notes that the request for sanctions does not identify “every person, party,
and attorney against whom the sanction is sought” as required under Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.040. However, the notice identifies Defendants and “each
and/or all of its attorneys of record.” (See both Motions for Terminating
Sanctions at Notice.)
 
“Reasonable
expenses may include attorney fees, filing fees, referee fees, and other costs
incurred.” (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare REIT, Inc.
(2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 790 (“Cornerstone”).) Cornerstone
discusses three principles surrounding monetary sanctions regarding discovery:
(1) compulsion under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a) –  “[i]f a monetary sanction is authorized ‘the
court shall impose that sanction’ unless the court finds that the person
subject to the sanction either acted with substantial justification or
imposition of sanctions would be unjust under the circumstances;” (2) causation
as defined in Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a) – “[m]onetary sanctions for
engaging in misuse of the discovery process may only be imposed based on
attorney fees and costs ‘incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct;’ and
(3) reasonableness under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a) – “[t]he amount of
monetary sanctions is limited to the ‘reasonable expenses, including attorney's
fees’ that a party incurred as a result of the discovery abuse.” (Id. at
790-91.) “The principle of reasonableness means a trial court has discretion to
reduce the amount of fees and costs requested as a discovery sanction in order
to reach a reasonable award.” (Id. at 791 [internal citations omitted].)
 
Here, the
Court is aware of its processes. Waisbren has expended three motion fees in the
amount of $60.00 for these – (1) two filing fees related to the moving papers,
and (2) an Ex Parte Application to specially set (i.e., shortening) the Motions
for Terminating Sanctions. There are five electronic service fees in the amount
of $2.25 related to these motions. The total filings fees related to the
Motions for Terminating Sanctions is $191.25. As to the other costs, it is not
clear why papers and copies were needed as the motions were electronically
filed and served, and it is unclear whether the $200.00 for access to a legal
database is related solely to these motions. Regarding travel, it the travel
for the hearing and the travel to the Los Angeles Law Library is combined. Parking
relates to the Los Angeles Law Library as well. If the sole purposes for
traveling to the Los Angeles Law Library was copying the Court is not inclined
to allow these as costs. 
 
Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 2023.050 provides, in relevant part:
 
(a)
Notwithstanding any other law, and in addition to any other sanctions imposed
pursuant to this chapter, a court shall impose a one-thousand-dollar ($1,000)
sanction, payable to the requesting party, upon a party, person, or attorney
if, upon reviewing a request for a sanction made pursuant to Section 2023.040,
the court finds any of the following:
(1)
The party, person, or attorney did not respond in good faith to a request for
the production of documents made pursuant to Section 2020.010, 2020.410,
2020.510, or 2025.210, or to an inspection demand made pursuant to Section
2031.010.
(2)
The party, person, or attorney produced requested documents within seven days
before the court was scheduled to hear a motion to compel production of the
records pursuant to Section 2025.450, 2025.480, or 2031.320 that is filed by
the requesting party as a result of the other party’s, person’s, or attorney’s
failure to respond in good faith.
(3)
The party, person, or attorney failed to confer in person, by telephone,
letter, or other means of communication in writing, as defined in Section 250
of the Evidence Code, with the party or attorney requesting the documents in a
reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning
the request.
 
[.
. .]
 
(c)
The court may excuse the imposition of the sanction required by subdivision (a)
if the court makes written findings that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.
(d)
Sanctions pursuant to this section shall be imposed only after notice to the
party, person, or attorney against whom the sanction is proposed to be imposed
and opportunity for that party, person, or attorney to be heard.
 
As
discussed, ante, there appears to be a willful failure to provide discovery responses to RFPs, Set Three,
despite the Court’s December 12, 2024 Order. 
 
The Court, tentatively, imposes sanctions in
the amount of $1,191.25.
