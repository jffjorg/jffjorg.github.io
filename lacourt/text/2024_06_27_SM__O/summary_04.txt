Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled on several motions filed by Santa Monica CDJR, Inc. (CDJR) in response to the complaint filed by David Scott (Scott). The Judge has overruled CDJR's demurrer to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th causes of action, which allege intentional misrepresentation, concealment, and negligent misrepresentation by CDJR. The Judge has also overruled CDJR's demurrer to the 9th cause of action, which alleges a violation of the unfair competition law.

The Judge has found that Scott's complaint has sufficient factual allegations to plead all necessary elements of the fraud-based causes of action and that the causes of action are not duplicative. The Judge has also denied CDJR's motion to strike punitive damages, finding that Scott's fraud claims provide a basis for seeking punitive damages under California Civil Code § 3294(a).

The Judge's ruling is based on the California Civil Code, California Code of Civil Procedure, and California Business and Professions Code, as well as case law from the California Courts of Appeal and the California Supreme Court.
