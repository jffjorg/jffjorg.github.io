TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant
Santa Monica CDJR, Inc.’s Demurrer is OVERRULED in its entirety, and Motion to
Strike is DENIED. Plaintiff alleges all the required elements of the 2nd,
3rd, 4th, and 9th causes of action within the
FAC. Plaintiff’s causes of action are not unnecessarily duplicative. Punitive
damages are allowed under a properly plead claim for a fraud-based cause of
action pursuant to Civ. Code § 3294(a).
 
I.               
Demurrer to 2nd, 3rd and 4th
Cause of Actions for Intentional Misrepresentation, Concealment and Negligent
Misrepresentation—OVERRULED
 
            The elements
of an intentional misrepresentation claim are: “(1) the defendant represented
to the plaintiff that an important fact was true; (2) that representation was
false; (3) the defendant knew that the representation was false when the
defendant made it, or the defendant made the representation recklessly and
without regard for its truth; (4) the defendant intended that the plaintiff
rely on the representation; (5) the plaintiff reasonably relied on the
representation; (6) the plaintiff was harmed; and (7) the plaintiff's
reliance on the defendant's representation was a substantial factor in causing
that harm to the plaintiff.” (Manderville v. PCG&S Group, Inc.
(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1486, 1498.)
 
            “[T]he
elements of a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc.
(2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 310–311, citations omitted; see also CACI 1901)
 
            “In
transactions which do not involve fiduciary or confidential relations,” a duty
to disclose the fact to the plaintiff “may arise in at least three instances:
(1) the defendant makes representations but does not disclose facts which
materially qualify the facts disclosed, or which render his disclosure likely
to mislead;5 (2) the facts are known or accessible only to
defendant, and defendant knows they are not known to or reasonably discoverable
by the plaintiff;6 (3) the defendant actively conceals discovery
from the plaintiff.” (Warner Constr. Corp. v. City of Los Angeles (1970)
2 Cal.3d 285, 294.)
 
            The
elements of negligent misrepresentation are “(1) the misrepresentation of a
past or existing material fact, (2) without reasonable ground for believing it
to be true, (3) with intent to induce another's reliance on the fact
misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation, and (5)
resulting damage. “(National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v.
Cambridge Integrated Services Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50.) “The
essential elements of a count for negligent misrepresentation are the same
[intentional misprepresentation] except that it does not require knowledge of
falsity but instead requires a misrepresentation of fact by a person who has no
reasonable grounds for believing it to be true.” (Chapman v. Skype Inc.
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 217, 231.)
 
            “Each
element of a fraud count must be pleaded with particularity so as to apprise
the defendant of the specific grounds for the charge and enable the court to
determine whether there is any basis for the cause of action, although less
specificity is required if the defendant would likely have greater knowledge of
the facts than the plaintiff.” (Ibid.)
 
            Defendant
Santa Monica CDJR, Inc. (“CDJR”) appears to combine all fraud-based claims, the
2nd through 4th causes of action, under the lone argument
that the causes of action are not plead with sufficient particularity as
required to plead a cause of action for fraud. (See Demurrer, pp. 4–5.) 
 
            Plaintiff
David Scott (“Scott”) pleads the following facts within the FAC:
 
(1) “Specifically, Dealer represented
the following facts were true: (1) the Vehicle was “new;” the Vehicle was under
the manufacturer’s full warranty; and (3) the Vehicle had never had a prior
owner.” (FAC, ¶ 38.)
(2) “The representations of material
fact made by Dealer were false. The representations were made by Dealer’s
authorized representatives, whose identities are known to Dealer or which can
be ascertained from a review of Dealer’s records. The representations were both
oral and written.” (Id., ¶ 39.)
(3) “Dealer knew the representations
were false when it made them or made the representations and omissions of
material fact recklessly and without regard for their truth.” (Id., ¶
40)
(4) CDJR made the representations or
omissions of fact for the purpose of inducing Mr. Scott to rely upon them and
purchase a “new” vehicle (Id., ¶¶ 37-42)
(5) “Plaintiff was unaware of the
falsity of the representations or omissions and reasonably relied upon the
truth of those representations by purchasing the Vehicle.” (Id., ¶ 43.)
(6) “Plaintiff discovered the Vehicle
was not new and had been previously sold. He contacted Dealer about this issue.
Dealer told Plaintiff to contact the Manufacturer. Manufacturer confirmed the
Vehicle had been previously owned, as Plaintiff was not listed as the current
owner in the Manufacturer’s system. In addition, Manufacturer confirmed the
warranty in service date for the Vehicle was December 28, 2021. Thus, the three
year/36,000-mile bumper to bumper warranty expires on December 28, 2024, while
the 5 year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty expires on December 28, 2026.
Plaintiff asked what could be done about this. Manufacturer told Plaintiff to
contact Dealer.” (Id., ¶ 20.)
(7) Scott’s reliance on CDJR’s
representations “was a substantial factor in causing” his harm (Id., ¶
44)
(8) “As a direct and proximate result
of Dealer’s misrepresentations or omissions of material facts, Plaintiff
suffered damages, including actual, consequential, and/or incidental damages,
according to proof of trial.” (Id., ¶ 45
 
            Scott’s FAC includes enough
factual allegations to plead all necessary elements, and heightened pleading
standards, of the fraud-based causes of action. Additionally, Scott has plead
facts with sufficient particularity to give notice of the issues sufficient to
enable preparation of a defense,” given that CJDR is likely to have greater
knowledge of the facts. (Okun v. Superior Court (1981) 29 Cal.3d 442,
458.)
 
            Accordingly, the Demurrer to the 2nd,
3rd and 4th causes of action is OVERRULED.
 
II.            
Demurrer to 9th cause of action for Violation
of Unfair Competition law—OVERRULED
 
            “To bring a
UCL claim, a plaintiff must show either an (1) unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent
business act or practice, or (2) unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.
[citation] Because the UCL is written in the disjunctive, it establishes three
varieties of unfair competition—acts or practices which are unlawful, or
unfair, or fraudulent.” [citation] (Adhav v. Midway Rent A Car, Inc.
(2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 954, 970.)
 
            The UCL
defines “unfair competition” to include “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent
business act or practice.” (De La Torre v. CashCall, Inc. (2018) 5
Cal.5th 966, 974.) “Because Business and Professions Code section 17200 is
written in the disjunctive, it establishes three varieties of unfair
competition—acts or practices which are unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent.”
(Beasley v. Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. (2022) 85
Cal.App.5th 901, 911, review denied (Mar. 15, 2023).) “To prevail on a
claim under the unlawful prong of the unfair competition law, the plaintiff
must show that a challenged advertisement or practice violates any federal or
California ‘statute or regulation.” (Id., at p. 912.)
 
            “[A]ny
person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a
result of the unfair competition” has standing to bring a UCL claim.” (In
re Tobacco II Cases (2009) 46 Cal.4th 298, 320.) It is rare to sustain a
demurrer to a § 17200 “unfairness” claim because a determination of whether a
practice is unfair requires a full factual record. (Motors, Inc. v. Times
Mirror Co. (1980) 102 Cal. App. 3d 735, 740.)
 
            Alleged
violations of Civ. Code § 1770 are sufficient to satisfy the unlawful practice
prong of the UCL. (See Hale v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th
1373, 1383–1384.) When stating a UCL claim based on fraud there is an “actual
reliance” pleading requirement. (Id., at p. 1384 [“[R]eliance is proved
by showing that the defendant's misrepresentation or nondisclosure was “an
immediate cause” of the plaintiff's injury-producing conduct.”].)


            CDJR does
not provide any argument regarding which specific facts are not properly
alleged in Scott’s UCL claim. In the FAC, Scott alleges multiple violations of
the Civ. Code § 1770 including: 
 
(1) misrepresenting the Vehicle’s
status as new or used; (2) misrepresenting the terms of the warranty; (3)
representing the Vehicle was “new” when it was not; (4) representing the
Vehicle was under the manufacturer’s full warranty, when it was not; (5) representing
the Vehicle had never had a prior owner, when it had;
(6) concealing the Vehicle’s status as
new or used; (7) concealing the terms of the warranty”
 
(FAC, ¶ 110.)
 
            Scott
incorporates the previous allegations in the cause of action which include allegations
of reliance “upon the truth those representations by purchasing the vehicle.”
(FAC, ¶¶ 43, 69, 70.) Furthermore, the demurrer appears to be attacking only
the fraud based UCL claims, but the cause of action contains numerous bases for
a UCL claim including violating “(9) violating the Automobile Sales Finance
Act; (10), violating the Song-Beverly Act; (11) violating 16 C.F.R § 455; and
(12) violating the Vehicle Code.” (FAC, ¶ 110.) “A demurrer does not lie to a portion
of a cause of action,” and thus the demurrer to the 9th cause of
action is overruled on this issue alone. (PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682.)
 
            Thus,
Scott states the necessary factual elements to allege a UCL claim within the
FAC. The Demurrer to the 9th cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
III.          
Causes of action in the FAC are not duplicative
- OVERRULED
 
            CDJR argues
the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 9th cause of
action are duplicative of the 1st, 5th and 8th
causes of action and thus should eliminated as it “adds nothing to this claim
and only serve[s] to delay its resolution.” (Demurrer, p. 2–4.)  
 
            The Court
finds this argument unavailing. The CLRA states, “The provisions of this title
are not exclusive. The remedies provided herein for violation of any section of
this title or for conduct proscribed by any section of this title shall be in
addition to any other procedures or remedies for any violation or conduct
provided for in any other law.” (Civ. Code, § 1752; see Flores v. Southcoast
Automotive Liquidators, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 841, 852 [“the remedies
of the CLRA are cumulative and the consumer may assert other common law or
statutory causes of action under the procedures and with the remedies provided
for in those laws.”]


            Additionally,
“[w]here the exact nature of the facts is in doubt, or where the exact legal
nature of plaintiff's right and defendant's liability depend on facts not well
known to the plaintiff, the pleading may properly set forth alternative
theories in varied and inconsistent counts.” (Rader Co. v. Stone (1986)
178 Cal.App.3d 10, 29, citing 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Pleading,
§ 356, p. 411.)
 
            Thus, Scott
is allowed to plead different causes of action under the same core set of
facts. (See Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342,
1382, as modified on denial of reh'g (Feb. 24, 2012) [“The allegations
underlying plaintiffs' CLRA claim [were] essentially identical to those pleaded
in support of their UCL claim.”]
 
            The
Demurrer to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 9th
causes of action as duplicative is OVERRULED. 
 
IV.          
Motion to Strike Punitives
 
            CC § 3294(a)
provides, “In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from
contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the
defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in
addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example and
by way of punishing the defendant.” (Cal Civ. Code § 3294, subd. (a).) 
 
            “A fraud
cause seeking punitive damages need not include an allegation that the fraud
was motivated by the malicious desire to inflict injury upon the victim. The
pleading of fraud is sufficient.” (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 610.)
 
            CDJR moves
to strike Scott’s claim for punitive damages based on Scott’s claims being to
conclusory and do not include substantial damages. (See MTS, pp. 2–4.) However,
Scott’s fraud claims, the 2nd through 4th causes of
action, are properly plead, thus Scott has successfully stated a claim for
fraud. Fraud claims provide for possible punitive damages under CC 3294(a).
When a fraud claim survives demurrer punitive damages are allowed. (See Stevens,
supra, 180 Cal.App.3d at p. 610.)
 
            Thus,
CDJR’s motion to strike punitive damages is DENIED.
