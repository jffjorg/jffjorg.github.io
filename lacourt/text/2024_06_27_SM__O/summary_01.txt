And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's Motion for Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions. The Plaintiff seeks to have the Defendant's conduct declared a misuse of the discovery process, and to have the case terminated or to have the Defendant held in contempt. The Judge has denied the request for terminating sanctions, but has granted the request for issue sanctions, holding that the Defendant's alter ego, Alboorz, LLC, is responsible for any judgment entered in this action against the Defendant. The Judge has also granted the request for monetary sanctions, ordering the Defendant to pay $2,750.00 (5 hours @ $550.00/hr.) within 30 days of the date of notice of this order.
