Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted defendant Sarah Maria Duque Lovisoni's anti-SLAPP motion, which seeks to strike the complaint filed by plaintiff Alessandro Turco. The court finds that Lovisoni has met her burden on the first prong of the SLAPP analysis, showing that the claims arise from protected activity, specifically the filing of a police report and a restraining order request. The court also finds that Turco has not met his burden to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his claims, as he has not submitted any additional evidence beyond his verified complaint to support his claims.

The court notes that the litigation privilege applies to communications made to the police regarding possible wrongdoing, and that Lovisoni's alleged communications to the police regarding Turco's wrongdoings are protected by this privilege. The court further finds that Turco's claims are partially based on Lovisoni's filing of an allegedly false police report, which is also protected by the litigation privilege.

As a result, the court has granted Lovisoni's anti-SLAPP motion and ordered the 1st through 5th causes of action in the FAC struck from the complaint. The court has also ordered Lovisoni to be granted attorney's fees pursuant to CCP § 425.16(c) for prevailing on her anti-SLAPP motion.
