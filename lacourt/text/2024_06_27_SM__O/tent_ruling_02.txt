TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant Sarah
Maria Duque Lovisoni’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons is GRANTED. Defendant
meets her burden to establish Plaintiff’s 1st through 5th
causes of action in the FAC arise from protected activity. Plaintiff does not
meet his burden to demonstrate a probability of success on his 1st
through 5th causes of action in the FAC. 
 
            The Court
orders the 1st cause of action for Defamation (Slander) Per se, the
2nd cause of action for Defamation (Libel) per se, the 3rd
cause of action for False light, the 4th cause of action for IIED,
and the 5th cause of action for NIED struck from the FAC. 
 
            Defendant
is entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to CCP § 425.16(c) for prevailing on
her anti-SLAPP motion, with the amount of fees to be decided in a separate
motion. 
 
 

Preliminary
     Matter – Amended Complaint filed shortly after SLAPP motion filing

 
            “[A]n
amended complaint render[s] moot an anti-SLAPP motion directed to a prior
complaint, with the following caveat: A plaintiff or cross-complainant may
not seek to subvert or avoid a ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion by amending the
challenged complaint or cross-complaint in response to the motion.” (JKC3H8
v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477–478, emphasis added; see Salma
v. Capon (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1275, 1280, 1293–1294; see also Simmons
v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1073, 112.)
 
“Allowing a SLAPP plaintiff leave to amend the
complaint once the court finds the prima facie showing has been met would
completely undermine the statute by providing the pleader a ready escape from
section 425.16's quick dismissal remedy. Instead of having to show a
probability of success on the merits, the SLAPP plaintiff would be able to go
back to the drawing board with a second opportunity to disguise the vexatious
nature of the suit through more artful pleading. This would trigger a second
round of pleadings, a fresh motion to strike, and inevitably another request
for leave to amend. [¶] By the time the moving party would be able to dig out
of this procedural quagmire, the SLAPP plaintiff will have succeeded in his [or
her] goal of delay and distraction and running up the costs of his [or her]
opponent. [Citation.] Such a plaintiff would accomplish indirectly what could
not be accomplished directly, i.e., depleting the defendant's energy and
draining his or her resources. [Citation.] This would totally frustrate the
Legislature's objective of providing a quick and inexpensive method of
unmasking and dismissing such suits.”


            (JKC3H8,
supra, 221 Cal.App.4th at p. 478.)
 
            Defendant
Sarah Maria Duque Lovisoni (“Lovisoni”) filed the anti-SLAPP motion on 6-3-24,
and shortly after, on 6-14-24, Plaintiff Alessandro Turco (“Turco”) filed an
amended complaint (the “FAC”). The FAC contains one new cause of action for
Malicious Prosecution, and two new factual allegation paragraphs which include a
separate Family Court case between the two identical parties referencing a
restraining order decision. (See FAC, ¶¶ 33, 34; Ex. B.) The Family Court
ruling referred to in the FAC does not directly impact the decision making on a
SLAPP motion in a civil trial, and thus the Court does not need to consider
these new allegations in the FAC to decide the SLAPP motion. 
 
            Additionally,
the exact same allegations still exist in the FAC for the 1st
through 5th causes of action that Lovisoni brings her SLAPP motion
against. Overall, it appears from the timing of the FAC filing, and the sparsely
alleged additional facts within the FAC, that Turco is seeking “to subvert or
avoid a ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion by amending the challenged complaint. (JKC3H8,
supra, Id., 221 Cal.App.4th at p. 478.) Thus, the Court
will hear the SLAPP motion on 1st through 5th causes of
action within the FAC.
 

Anti-SLAPP
     First Prong – Defendants Burden of Establishing Claims Arise From
     Protected Activity. 

 
            In the
first prong of the anti-SLAPP analysis, “courts are to consider the elements of
the challenged claim and what actions by the defendant supply those elements
and consequently form the basis for liability.  The defendant’s burden is
to identify what acts each challenged claim rests on and to show how those acts
are protected under a statutorily defined category of protected
activity.”  (Bonni, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1009.)
 
            “First,
the moving defendant must show that the challenged claim or claims arise from
the defendant's constitutionally protected free speech or petition rights. (Ojjeh
v. Brown (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1027, 1035.) A defendant has the “burden of
identifying all allegations of protected activity” on the 1st prong
of SLAPP.”  (Bel Air Internet, LLC v. Morales (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th
924, 936-937.)  Defendant only meets this burden by demonstrating that the
act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action “fits one of the categories
spelled out in section 425.16, subdivision (e).”  (Sprengel v. Zbylut
(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 140, 150.)
 
             “Section 425.16 defines an act of that person
in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech under the
United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,’
... as including statements or writings made before a judicial proceeding or
made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial
body. Thus, statements, writings and pleadings in connection with civil
litigation are covered by the anti-SLAPP statute, and that statute does not
require any showing that the litigated matter concerns a matter of public
interest.” (Kenne v. Stennis (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 953, 965, citing
Code Civ Pro.§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1), subd. (e).)
 
            Lovisoni shows
that Turco’s claims 1st through 5th causes of action for
slander, libel, false light, IIED and NIED are based on Lovisoni allegedly making
a false police report and filing a domestic violence restraining order. (See
Motion, p. 5; see also FAC, ¶¶ 49, 50, 60, 68, 69, 74, 83.) Filing a police
report, including an allegedly false police report, is protected activity under
CCP § 425.16. (See Kenne, supra, 230 Cal.App.4th at p. 966 [“There
is no question that the filing of a civil harassment petition constitutes
protected activity . . . . the making of allegedly false police reports also
can be protected petitioning activity under the first prong of the anti-SLAPP
statute . . .”].) 
 
The Court notes that Turco does include an unprotected
allegation of disseminating alleged false statements on Turco’s Instagram
account, however, “[w]hen relief is sought based on allegations of both
protected and unprotected activity, the unprotected activity is disregarded at
this stage. If the court determines that relief is sought based on allegations
arising from activity protected by the statute, the second step is reached.” (Baral
v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 396.) 
 
Turco argues that Lovisoni fails to meet her burden
to show that the claims arise from protected activity because Turco alleges
that Lovisoni made a false report to the Police including Turco “had threatened
her with a kitchen knife,” and that the Judge in the Family Court hearing found
Turco to be “the more credible of the parties,” thus did not issue Lovisoni’s requested
restraining order against Turco. (Oppo., p. 5:5–16.) Turco includes a
declaration which attaches the verified complaint, Lovisoni’s previous request
for a Domestic Violence Restraining Order, and Judge Joshua D. Wayser’s Ruling
on Defendant’s Request for Restraining Order, but did not request judicial
notice of these documents. (See Lehrmann Decl., ¶ 3–5; Ex. A–C.) 
 
Lovisoni contests the allegations that she filed a
false police report, declaring in her motion:
 
I filed the police report and
requested a restraining order because I genuinely feared for my safety, and my
allegations against Plaintiff are true: Plaintiff threatened [me]; Plaintiff
used a knife to break the lock on our bedroom door while threatening me and
causing me to fear for my safety; Plaintiff violently grabbed and shook me;
Plaintiff caused me to bruise; Plaintiff yelled at me in a manner that caused
me to fear for my safety.
 
(Lovisoni Decl., ¶ 14.)
 
 The Court cannot
take judicial notice to the truth of contested factual findings made by a “judge
who sat as trier of fact in a previous case.” (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992)
6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1551, 1568, modified (June 15, 1992) [“neither
a finding of fact made after a contested adversary hearing nor a finding of
fact made after any other type of hearing can be indisputably deemed to have
been a correct finding.”].) Thus, the factual findings made by Judge Joshua D.
Wayser in the family court matter cannot be used as factual evidence, provide
any basis for factual findings in this case, nor can they be used to find that
Lovisoni’s police report was false. Turco does not submit any additional
evidence to show the police report was falsely made. Furthermore, Lovisoni
contests the allegations of the false police report. 
 
Thus, Turco’s allegations of a false police report
alone, without any evidence to back his claim, are “insufficient to render that
alleged conduct unlawful as a matter of law and outside the protection of
section 425.16.” (Kenne v. Stennis (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 953, 967; see Dwight
R. v. Christy B. (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 697, 712, 151 [“mere allegation
that [the defendant] engaged in unlawful ... activities is insufficient to
render [the defendant's] alleged actions unlawful as a matter of law and
outside the protection of ... section 425.16”]; Chabak v. Monroy (2007)
154 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1512[the defendant's allegedly false report to police
that the plaintiff inappropriately touched her was deemed protected activity
because there was no uncontroverted evidence showing the report to be false]; Siam
v. Kizilbash (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1563, 1569–1570 [defendant's allegedly
false report to school official was protected activity, notwithstanding
plaintiff's allegation of falsity, because no uncontroverted evidence showed
that it was false].)
 
Turco does not dispute that Lovisoni’s request for a
restraining order satisfies the first prong of the anti-SLAPP motion, nor does
Turco allege any false statements were made in the restraining order request in
his opposition. The filing of the restraining order alone is protected activity
under the anti-SLAPP statute. (See Code Civ Pro.§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1), subd.
(e) [“any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,
executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized
by law”].)
 
            The Court
finds that the filing of the police report, and the filing of a request for a
domestic violence restraining order are protected activities under CCP § 425.16,
and thus Lovisoni has met her burden on the first prong of the SLAPP analysis. 
 

Anti-SLAPP
     Second Prong – Plaintiff’s Burden of Demonstrating a Probability of
     Prevailing on their Claims

 
            Once
defendant demonstrates that a cause of action arises from protected conduct,
the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient
and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a
favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited.  (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82,
88–89.)  “Precisely because the statute (1) permits early intervention in
lawsuits alleging unmeritorious causes of action that implicate free speech
concerns, and (2) limits opportunity to conduct discovery, the plaintiff's
burden of establishing a probability of prevailing is not high: We do not weigh
credibility, nor do we evaluate the weight of the evidence. Instead, we accept
as true all evidence favorable to the plaintiff and assess the defendant's
evidence only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff's submission as a matter
of law.  Only a cause of action that lacks ‘even minimal merit'
constitutes SLAPP.”  (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Gradient Analytics, Inc.
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 688, 699.)
 
            “The
second prong of the statute deals with whether the plaintiff has “demonstrated
a probability of prevailing on the claim.  Under section 425.16,
subdivision (b)(2), the superior court, in making these determinations,
considers ‘the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the
facts upon which the liability or defense is based.’ For purposes of an
anti-SLAPP motion, the court considers the pleadings and evidence submitted by
both sides, but does not weigh credibility or compare the weight of the
evidence. Rather, the court's responsibility is to accept as true the evidence
favorable to the plaintiff.  A plaintiff need only establish that his or
her claim has minimal merit to avoid being stricken as a SLAPP.  With
these descriptions in mind, we will not strike a cause of action under the
anti-SLAPP statute unless it lacks even minimal merit.”  (Ralphs
Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 245, 261.)
 
            The
“probability of prevailing” is tested by the same standard governing a motion
for summary judgment, nonsuit, or directed verdict.  Thus, in opposing a
SLAPP motion, it is plaintiff's burden to make a prima facie showing of facts
that would support a judgment in plaintiff's favor.  (Crossroads
Investors, L.P. v. Federal National Mortgage Assn. (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th
757, 785; Taus v. Loftus (2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 714 [a
“summary-judgment-like procedure”].)  “[I]n order to demonstrate a
probability of success a plaintiff “must adduce competent admissible evidence.”
(Fashion 21 v. Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles
(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1138, 1147, as modified on denial of reh'g (May
18, 2004).)
 
A.   
Lovisoni successfully argues the litigation
privilege applies to the 1st through 5th causes of action.
 
            “[T]he
[litigation] privilege applies to any communication (1) made in judicial or
quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized
by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that have some
connection or logical relation to the action.” (Silberg v. Anderson
(1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212, as modified (Mar. 12, 1990); see Kashian
v. Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 913 [“Any doubt about whether the
privilege applies is resolved in favor of applying it.”]; see also Civ. Code, §
47.)
 
            “The
litigation privilege is absolute; it applies, if at all, regardless whether the
communication was made with malice or the intent to harm.” (Kashian, supra,
98 Cal.App.4th at p. 913.) “The privilege in section 47 is “relevant to the
second step in the anti-SLAPP analysis in that it may present a substantive
defense the plaintiff must overcome to demonstrate a probability of prevailing.”
(Rohde v. Wolf (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 28, 38.)
 
            Turco’s 1st
through 5th causes of action are partially based on Lovisoni’s
filing of an allegedly false police report. (See FAC, ¶¶ 49, 50, 60, 68, 69,
74, 83.) The litigation privilege applies to communications made to the Police of
possible wrongdoing (See Williams v. Taylor (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 745,
753 [“a communication concerning possible wrongdoing, made to an official
governmental agency such as a local police department, and which communication
is designed to prompt action by that entity, is as much a part of an “official
proceeding” as a communication made after an official investigation has
commenced,” and thus is protectd by the litigation privilege].) It follows that
Lovisoni’s alleged communications to the police regarding Turco’s wrongdoings,
whether they were made with malice or not, are protected by the litigtation
privilege, and thus the Defamation and false light claims do not have a
probability of success.
 
            Additionally,
the IIED and NIED claims arise out of the same alleged filing of a police
report and thus are also protected by the litigation privilege. (See Silberg,
supra, 50 Cal.3d at p. 212 [“Although [section 47 was] originally
enacted with reference to defamation, the privilege is now held applicable to
any communication, whether or not it amounts to a publication, and all torts
except malicious prosecution.”]
 
            Turco relies
exclusively on his verified complaint and previous court filings and rulings as
evidence of a probability of success on his claims. Turco cannot rely solely on
a verified complaint to meet his burden on the second prong of the SLAPP
motion, and furthermore, the Court cannot take judicial notice to the factual
findings of the previous family court hearings. Thus, Turco has not submitted
any additional evidence other than the verified complaint to demonstrate a
reasonable probability of prevailing on his claims. (See Paiva v. Nichols
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1007, 1017 [“The plaintiff may not rely solely on its
complaint, even if verified; instead, its proof must be made upon competent
admissible evidence.”].) 


            Turco alleges
that Lovisoni sent numerous damaging “messages purportedly from Plaintiff to
several of Defendant’s friends,” via Turco’s Instagram account. (See FAC, ¶¶
41, 60, 74, 83.) However, Turco did not include any evidence of these alleged
Instagram messages within his complaint, or within his opposition including declarations
or evidence to show the existence of the alleged messages. Thus, Turco has not
met his burden to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his Instagram
message claims.  
 
            The Court
finds that Lovisoni has successfully shown the litigation privilege applies to
the 1st through 5th causes of action in the FAC, and
Turco has not met his burden to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on his
claims.
 
            Lovisoni’s anti-SLAPP
motion is GRANTED.
