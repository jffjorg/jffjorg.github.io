Petitioner
William S. Hart Union High School District (“District”) petitions for a writ of
mandate directing respondent Commission on Professional Competence to set aside
its decision not to dismiss real party in interest James Duncan from employment
with the District and to enter a new decision ordering his dismissal from employment.  
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
May 13, 2022 Incident
 
Real
party James Duncan is a physics teacher employed by the District since 1995. (AR
1888 [HT 456:15-23], 1889-90 [HT 457:25-458:3].) On May 13, 2022, shortly after
9:00 a.m., during a break period known as “brunch,” Duncan was walking south on
the campus of Valencia High School. As he passed the multi-purpose room, he
pulled out his cell phone to review an email or text. (AR 682 [Ex. 27, “MPR” on
School Map], 688 [Ex. 30, 0:00-0:35], 1895 [HT 463:3-9], 1897 [HT 465:2-9].) 
 
Duncan
looked up in the direction of a female student, D.S., pulled out his phone, took
a photo of her, and then picked up his walking pace towards her. (AR 688 [Ex.
30, 0:35-1:00], 567 [Photo 1].) Duncan started videorecording, initially
focused on D.S. (AR 688 [Ex. 30, 1:00-1:30]; AR 572 [Video, Ex. 7].) He then walked
past D.S. and pointed the phone toward a circle of female students. (AR 572 [Ex.
7, 0:07-0:13].)
 
A
student looked right at him. (AR 572 [Ex. 7, 0:14-16], 522:3-8 [stills of video],
588 [A.H. Stmt.], 587 [S.Z. Stmt.], 587 [“My friends and I were standing in a
circle when we noticed Mr. Duncan…. [W]e all were looking at him….”]; 586 [K.M.
Stmt.].) Duncan immediately turned, angled his phone towards the ground, and
then faced D.S. (AR 572 [Ex. 7, 0:16-0:20].) Then D.S. “made direct eye
contact” with Duncan. (AR 572 [Ex. 7, 0:16-0:20], 1776-77 [345:18-346:15],
522:13-17 [stills of video].) 
 
Duncan
immediately stopped recording, looked down at his phone, and paused for about eight
seconds. (AR 572 [Ex. 7, 0:21-23], 576 [Ex. 11, 0:25-0:35], AR 688 [Ex. 30,
1:27-1:36].) Duncan then took four photos while pivoting from right to left and
walked away. (AR 688 [Ex. 30, 1:36-2:00]; 568-71 [four photos].)
 
Thereafter,
according to Principal Pete Getz, three to five students went to the
administrative office and reported that there was an older man appearing to
film or follow students with his phone. (AR 1644 [HT 213:9-25], 1701 [HT 270:12-25].)
Getz went outside the office to see what was occurring but did not observe anything.
(AR 1645 [HT 214:1-12].) Getz and the assistant principals immediately
reviewed the school security cameras and determined that it had been Duncan. (AR
1645-46 [HT 214:13-215:9], 1647 [216:5-16].)
 
According
to Duncan, he had noticed two students significantly out of dress code, turned
on his phone camera, and took pictures of students while remaining behind them.
(AR 1895 [HT 463:10-24], 1897 [HR 465:12-17].) Duncan decided to document and
photograph other students that were out of dress code. (AR 1899 [HT 467:4-21].)
From the time he noticed the students, Duncan followed the students for two to two
and a half minutes. (AR 1895-96 [HT 463:25-464:4].) Duncan maintains that he
was not focused on one student but rather multiple students, as he was
attempting to document and highlight students that were out of dress code. (AR 1945-46
[HT 513:5-514:1].) In total, Duncan took about 5 pictures and one purportedly inadvertent
video lasting 20 to 24 seconds. (AR 1899-1900 [467:22-468:7], 1954 [HT 522:7-22],
2040-42 [HT 607:11-609:21].) Duncan explained that he took pictures of students
to gather evidence of dress code violations. (AR 1947 [HT 515:13-25].) 
 
Duncan’s
stated purpose for taking the pictures was to document the dress code
violations to show them to Assistant Principal David Miles, his immediate
supervisor. (AR 1900-01 [HT 468:8-469:7].) Duncan had raised the dress code
issue with Miles before, as it was discussed in monthly department meetings
during the 2021-22 school year. (AR 1900-03 [HT 468:8-470:1; 470:18-471:4].)
While taking the pictures at issue, Duncan did not say anything to the
students, did not make eye contact with the students, did not touch them, and
did not know their identities. (AR 1920-21 [HT 488:24-489:24].)
 
According
to Duncan, after taking the pictures, he headed to the administration office to
find Miles to discuss dress code violations. (AR 1907-08 [HT 475:8-15, 476:6-14].)
Duncan could not find Miles, so he collected his mail and went back to his
class to meet with his 3rd, 4th and 5th period students. (AR 1910 [HT 478:1-24].)
Duncan had planned to return to speak with Miles later during Duncan’s conference
period, when he was not scheduled to teach any students. (AR 1910-11 [HT
478:25-479:6].)
 
J.M.
and D.S were the only students who testified during the administrative hearing
before the Commission on Professional Competence.  Both acknowledged that they observed Duncan
very briefly (for a couple of minutes), did not know who Duncan was and had
ever seen him before; both also stated that Duncan did not say anything to them
or touch them. (AR 1585 [HT 155:3-8], 1590 [HT 160:24-161:1], 1778 [HT 347:7-10],
1789 [HT 358:9-24], 1790 [HT 359:10-15].) J.M. testified that he did not see
what was happening when it occurred. (AR 1586 [HT 156:19-21].) D.S. became
aware of Duncan when she got to some benches and only became aware of Duncan for
less than a minute before he walked away. (AR 1789-90 [HT 358:13-359:3].) D.S.
testified that she felt “creeped out” because she did not know what was
happening or what he was filming and because she had never seen Duncan before. (AR
1776-78 [HT 345:18-347:6].) D.S. first went to the administrative office
because, after the incident, she was cited for a dress code violation by
another teacher and sent to the administrative office, where she was given a
shirt by the school staff to wear over her clothes. (AR 1777-78 [HT 346:16-347:6],
1793 [HT 362:15-24], AR 1794 [HT 363:16-23].) D.S. returned to class, upset
that she had been, in her words, “dress coded” and complained about it to her
teacher, Mr. Albert, explaining to him what happened during brunch. (AR 1795
[HT 364:11-21], 1780-81 [349:15-350:14].) Mr. Albert advised D.S. to speak to
Principal Getz. (AR 1781 [HT 350:7-15].) D.S. then returned to the office,
possibly with J.M., to speak to Getz. (AR 1795 [HT 364:22-25].) D.S. and J.M.
both provided short and brief statements about what had happened during brunch.
(AR 579 [J.M. statement], 580 [D.S. Statement]). D.S. stated that Getz appeared
to be surprised and shocked about the incident and that Getz did not inform her
that a group of students had reported it previously. (AR 1782:3-8, 1798-99 [HT
367:13-368:5].)
 
B.          
May
13, 2022 Meeting with Principal Getz
 
Principal
Getz testified that he sent Duncan an email requesting an explanation, but
Duncan did not respond. (AR 1648 [HT 217:8-22], 1716-17 [HT 285:24-286:7],
1717-18 [HT 286:24-287:3].) Duncan testified that he did not recall receiving
an email from Getz. (AR 1912 [HT 480:7-13].) Because Getz did not receive any
response from Duncan, Getz sent Miles to Duncan’s classroom at 1:00 p.m. to ask
him to come to Getz’s office. (AR 1718 [HT 287:4-17].) 
 
During
the May 13, 2022 meeting, Getz did not go into detail about what the allegations
were and only asked Duncan if he was aware of an adult on campus who was filming
students. (AR 1753 [HT 322:4-12].) Getz also called Gene Truex-Hill into the
meeting as the union site representative for Duncan. (AR 1754-55 [323:20-324:5].)
According to Getz, Duncan did not indicate whether he was willing to proceed
with the meeting and remained on his own accord. (AR 1753-54 [HT 322:13-323:1].)
In his administrative hearing testimony, Getz also denied that Duncan requested
to be represented by Union President John Minkus during the May 13, 2023
meeting. (AR 1753-54 [HT 322:20-323:8].) According to Getz, if Duncan had
requested a specific representative, Getz would have rescheduled the meeting.
(AR 1754 [HT 323:5-8].) By contrast, both Truex-Hill and Duncan testified
that Duncan could request that Union President Minkus be there and that Duncan
did so. [AR 1833-34 [HT 401:18-402:23], 1915 [HT 483:5-24], 1918 [HT 486:3-20].)
According to Duncan, Getz appeared to oppose his request to have President
Minkus be present and instead informed Duncan that he already recommended that
Duncan be placed on administrative leave. (AR 1918-19 [486:21-487:1].) 
 
According
to Getz, the May 13, 20222 meeting lasted 20 minutes, after which he “then
closed [his] door and wrote down bullet points of the important pieces of that
conversation.” (AR 1654-56 [HT 223:23-224:11].) According to Getz’s notes, he
asked Duncan “if he knew anything about anyone, including himself, filming
students on campus.” (AR 581.) Duncan said no. Getz “specifically asked” if
Duncan “had filmed any students on campus during 1st bru[n]ch.” Duncan said no.
When Getz told Duncan that he had a video of Duncan “following one group of students
(one male, two females), filming with his phone,” Duncan said “he knew nothing
about this.” When Getz asked Duncan if he would like to share his phone, Duncan
“declined the opportunity.” Getz, Truex-Hill, and Duncan watched and re-watched
the footage from the security cameras. Duncan “continually questioned the
overall quality of the footage” but acknowledged at several points that it was
him. Also, according to Getz’s notes, while watching the footage, Duncan made
statements like “Yes, that is a bit weird,” “I can see why this would be
concerning,” and “This is odd for sure.” Getz additionally wrote: “At this
point, [Duncan] agreed that he was the teacher following the students with his
phone out.” According to his notes, Getz asked Duncan for an explanation, but Duncan
provided none. Getz then indicated that Duncan would be placed on paid
administrative leave. (AR 581.)
 
During
the administrative hearing, Truex-Hill was asked the following question about
the May 13, 2022 meeting: “[D]uring the meeting, did Mr. Duncan deny that he
had either photographed or filmed students.” (AR 1835 [HT 403:22-24].)
Truex-Hill vaguely responded, “Not in so many words.” (AR 1835 [HT 403:25].)
Getz, Duncan, and Truex-Hill all acknowledged in their hearing testimony that
surveillance videos were shown to Duncan at the meeting. (AR 1755 [Getz, HT 324:12-18],
1836 [Truex-Hill, HT 404:1-6], 1919 [Duncan, HT 487:2-5].) However, while Truex-Hill
testified that Getz showed Duncan the surveillance videos and that Duncan
acknowledged he appeared in the videos, Truex-Hill did not recall Duncan making
comments like “that is a bit weird,” “this is odd for sure,” or “I can see why
that would be concerning.” (AR 1837-38 [HT 405:19-406:5].) Duncan also
testified that he never made such statements. (AR 1922-23 [HT 490:18-491:4].)
Truex-Hill also testified that he understood, by the end of the meeting, that
there would be a follow up meeting that same day if Union President Minkus was
available. (AR 1838-39 [HT 406:20-407:18].) Similarly, Duncan testified that he
was prepared to return for another meeting that day and answer questions with
Minkus representing him; indeed, he returned later that day for such a meeting,
but Minkus had not been contacted, and no subsequent meeting occurred on May
13, 2022. (AR 1920 [HT 488:9-23], 1923 [HT 491:5-23], 1925 [HT 493:9-18].)
 
C.          
May
16, 2022 Meeting and Student Statements
 
On
May 16, 2022, Principal Getz met with D.S. and her parents. (AR 1669 [HT 238:4-8].)
During that meeting, D.S. learned the person involved in the incident was
Duncan, whom she had never met before. (AR 1784 [HT 353:13-20], 1792 [HT 361:10-23].)
D.S. testified that she wrote a more detailed statement after she was shown the
videos, because at the time she wrote the first statement had not fully
comprehended what had happened on May 13. (AR 1785 [HT 354:4-25], 1787-88 [HT 356:24-357:7],
1791 [HT 360:17-24].) After viewing the videos, D.S. testified that she was
“weirded” and “creeped out” because she did not know why Duncan was filming. (AR
1785 [HT 354:20-25].)
 
Principal Getz claimed that an initial
group of students came in right after brunch to tell him that they saw someone
filming on campus. However, he stated that the group was not part of the
initial investigation. (AR 1649 [HT 218:13-19].) Getz testified that after
reviewing security footage of the quad area, his administrative team was able
to identify other students who had been filmed by Duncan. (AR 1649 [HT 218:20-25].)
Getz then stated his administrative team supposedly brought that group of
students into the administrative office to collect statements and conduct
interviews on May 13. (AR 1650 [HT 219:1-3].) 
 
D.          
May
20, 2022 Meeting with Vierra

 
Duncan
met with Assistant Superintendent Michael Vierra and Union President Minkus on
May 20, 2022. The meeting was set by Vierra. District employees Mark Crawford
and Erica Galicia were also present. (AR 1924 [HT 492:16-19], 1932 [HT 500:18-20].)
During the meeting Duncan acknowledged that he had taken five pictures and also
claimed that he inadvertently took a 23- to 24-second video between pictures
one and two. (AR 1935-36 [HT 503:3-504:2].) Duncan provided Vierra with all five
pictures he had of the incident during the meeting. (AR 1937-38 [505:10-506:13];
see also AR 567-71 [five photos].) The video was subsequently emailed to
Vierra. (AR 1951-52 [HT 519:21-520:6].) 
 
At
the meeting, Duncan explained to Vierra that his reasons for taking the
photographs was to document “pervasive dress code violations” and that he had
intended, all along, to share the pictures with Miles. (AR 1955-56 [HT 523:10-524:6].)
Vierra did not say anything to Duncan in response. (AR 1956 [HT 524:7-10].)
With respect to the video, Duncan testified that it was not his intent to
record a video. (AR 572.) Duncan explained that he inadvertently recorded
the video while in the process of attempting to take the pictures. (AR 1899-1900
[HT 467:22-463:7], 1954 [HT 522:7-24], 2040-42 [HT 607:11-609:22].) 
 
Vierra
never told Duncan during the meeting that a dress code was not in effect during
the 2021-2022 school year, and at no point prior to the meeting had Duncan been
advised by the District that there was no dress code in effect. (AR 1956 [HT
524:11-21].) Duncan told Vierra that he did not know the identities of the
students whom he had photographed and videotaped on May 13. (AR 1984-85 [HT 552:21-553:1].)
Duncan reviewed the school surveillance videos and explained what he was doing
in those videos to Vierra. (AR 1982 [HT 550:3-15].) Duncan was aware that the
District had surveillance cameras because there were signs posted and because notification
of the surveillance cameras were sent to students every year. (AR 1985 [HT 553:7-23].)
During the meeting, Duncan answered every single question that was asked of
him. (AR 1983 [HT 551:19-23].) Duncan also took notes on his laptop during the
meeting. (AR 1986 [HT 554:5-21].) Duncan reviewed his notes and made
corrections for grammar after the meeting. (AR 1987 [HT 555:1-13].) He provided
those notes to his attorney, and eventually, the notes were shared with the
District’s counsel. (AR 1987 [HT 555:1-13], AR 683-87 [Ex. 29].)
 
Vierra
testified that he did not speak to any student witnesses. (AR 1516 [HT 86:7-11].)
Vierra stated that the May 20, 2022 meeting lasted about 90 minutes, during
which video clips were shown and displayed on a large monitor. Duncan answered
all of Vierra’s questions cooperatively and did not refuse to answer any
question asked. [AR 1528-29 [HT 98:4-99:25].) Duncan would stand up at times to
point something out on the screen to explain what was happening in the video.
[AR 1528-29 [HT 98:7-99:1].) To Vierra, it appeared that Duncan took the
meeting seriously and was emotional at times; Vierra did not believe that
Duncan had taken the situation as a joke. (AR 1530 [HT 100:1-11].) In his
hearing testimony, Minkus stated that, at that meeting, Duncan discussed the
issues regarding the dress code at Valencia High School, explaining that enforcement
of the dress code was the “whole point” for why Duncan took the pictures. [AR
1851-52 [HT 419:18-420:2]; 1852-53 [HT 420:24-421:1].) 
 
E.          
Dress
Code
 
Duncan
testified that concerns regarding the dress code came up frequently during
monthly department meetings with Miles and at no point did Miles tell Duncan
that there was no dress code in place. (AR 1902-03 [470:18-471:22].) School
administration, including Getz, never informed Duncan that there was no dress
code policy for that year. (AR 1903 [471:18-22].) Further, Miles never told
Duncan that, during the 21-22 school year, the school was easing back on the
dress code and not enforcing it. (AR 1903-04 [471:23-472:3.) Christopher Spann,
a science teacher at Valencia High School during the 2021-22 school year, corroborated
Duncan’s remarks about the dress code. Spann testified that he worked closely
with Duncan, that they discussed the dress code, and that the dress code had
always been an issue at school. (AR 1876 [HT 444:5-19], 1877-78 [HT 445:19-446:24],
1881 [HT 449:9-20].) Spann testified that the issue of the dress code came up
at every department meeting where an administrator (Miles) was present during
the 2021-2022 school year. (AR 1879-80 [HT 447:1-448:15].) Finally, Spann
testified that during the 2021-2022 school year, no administrator ever told him
either orally or in writing that Valencia High had no dress code policy in
place and affirmed that he would have remembered if it had happened. (AR 1875-76
[HT 443:10-444:19].)
 
Getz
testified on direct that, during the 2021-2022 school year, there was no formal
dress code policy in place and no dress code policy would be enforced based on
an agreement of the campus community and a desire to focus on helping students
transition back to in-person learning after the pandemic. (AR 1732-34 [HT 301:1-303:2].)
On cross-examination, however, Getz acknowledged that he had not shared this
understanding with Duncan or Duncan’s union; Getz was not able to affirm that
this understanding was communicated to other teachers on campus either. (AR
1734-36 [HT 303:3-305:1].)  
 
In
contrast to Getz’s testimony, student J.M. testified that, during the 2021-22
school year, the dress code was in place and students were “dress coded” if
they wore things that were considered too revealing. (AR 1599 [HT 169:16-25.)
Getz, however, admitted that D.S. was dress-coded by another teacher, Ms. Loch,
on the same day that D.S. was filmed by Duncan. (AR 1721-23 [HT 290:7-292:5], 1763
[HT 332:7-13].) 
 
F.          
Statement
of Charges
 
In
August 2022, the District served Duncan with a Statement of Charges advising
him that the District had taken action to dismiss him from his employment as a
permanent certificated teacher with the District. (AR 5 [Notice of Intention to
Dismiss].) Thereafter, on September 6, 2022, Duncan timely requested a hearing
and the District submitted a Request to Set Teacher Dismissal Case to the
Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) so that the matter would be heard
before the Commission on Professional Competence (“Commission”). (AR 63 [Request
for Hearing], 1-4 [Request to Set].) The Commission heard the matter on August
21-25, 2023. (AR 2264.) 
 
The
operative pleading addressed by the Commission was the Statement of Charges
dated August 15, 2022. (AR 6-11.) The District alleged that Duncan had
allegedly: “stalked, photographed, and videotaped students at Valencia High
School and elsewhere in the District” by “walk[ing] around campus taking photos
of and videotaping students”; was dishonest in an investigatory meeting
regarding the pictures; “repeatedly sat in [his] car at various swim meets, watching
students”; told a “bizarre story about [him]self”; and “exploited [his]
authority in order to harass students”—all of which was alleged to constitute
“sexual harassment, in violation of Education Code section 200…[and] District
Board Policies and regulations…in contravention of the California Standards for
the Teaching Profession.” (AR 7-9.) Based on these allegations, the District
moved to dismiss Duncan for alleged (1) immoral conduct, (2) dishonesty, (3)
evident unfitness for service, and (4) the persistent violation of or
refusal to obey the school laws and regulations. (AR 9-10.) 
 
G.          
Decision
from Commission
 
On
December 22, 2023, the Commission issued a 35-page decision (“Decision”)
concluding that the District failed to establish by a preponderance of evidence
the causes of (1) immoral conduct, (2) dishonesty, (3) evident unfitness
for service, and (4) the persistent violation of or refusal to obey the
school laws and regulations.  Having
found the District failed to meet its evidentiary burden of proof, the
Commission determined that Duncan could not be dismissed and instead dismissed
the Statement of Charges against him. (AR 2264-98.)
 
More
specifically, the Commission found that: (1) the evidence did not establish
that Duncan engaged in immoral conduct and that Duncan’s conduct was not
indicative of indecency or depravity (AR 2289-90); (2) the evidence did not
establish that Duncan persistently violated school laws and regulations, as the
District failed to present evidence of any school policy or regulation that was
violated (AR 2290-91); (3) the evidence did not establish that Duncan was dishonest
about his concerns about the dress code and thus the dishonesty alleged by the
District was not proven (AR 2291-93); and (4) the evidence did not establish
that establish Duncan’s conduct was caused by a temperamental defect such that
cause for dismissal for evident unfitness was not established (AR 2293-96).
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
February 20, 2024, petitioner filed a verified Petition for Writ of Mandate. On
March 25, 2024, real party Duncan filed an Answer. On July 11, 2024, respondent
Commission filed a Notice of Non-Participation. 
 
            On
September 6, 2024, petitioner filed an opening brief. On October 8, 2024, Duncan
filed an opposition. On October 23, 2024, petitioner filed a reply and Duncan
filed errata to the opposition. The Court has received an electronic copy of the
administrative record and a hard copy of the joint appendix. 
 


III.     Standard of Review
 
            Upon petition, courts may review decisions of the
Commission on Professional Competence in dismissal or suspension proceedings
concerning permanent employees of school districts. (Ed. Code §§ 44932, 44934, 44945.)
“The court, on review, shall exercise its independent judgment on the evidence.”
(Ed. Code § 44945.)
 
Under the independent
judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the administrative record for
errors of law, but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence
disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”
(Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130,
143.) “In exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a
strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and
the party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of
convincing the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the
weight of the evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20
Cal.4th 805, 817, internal quotations omitted.) Nevertheless, courts are “not
bound by the findings of the Commission in exercising its independent judgment
review” and are free to make their “own determination of the credibility of
witnesses in the process.” (Pittsburg Unified School Dist. v. Commission On
Professional Competence (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 964, 977.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
            Permanent employees of school
districts may not be dismissed except for causes enumerated in statute. Two of
those causes include dishonesty and evident unfitness for service. (Ed. Code §
44932(a)(4), (a)(6).)[1]
The standard of proof in dismissal proceedings is preponderance of the
evidence. (Gardner v. Commission on Professional Competence (1985) 164
Cal.App.3d 1035, 1040.) The District challenges only the Commission’s Decision
that Duncan’s dismissal is not warranted due to dishonesty and evident
unfitness for service. 
 
A.          
Dishonesty
 
            Dishonesty “connotes a disposition
to deceive.” (Midway School Dist. of Kern County v. Griffeath (1946) 29
Cal.2d 13, 18.) It “necessarily includes the element of bad faith.” (Hogg v.
Real Estate Com'r (1942) 54 Cal.App.2d 712, 717.) It denotes “an absence of
integrity; a disposition to cheat, deceive, or defraud; deceive and betray.” (Ibid.,
internal citations omitted.) “[W]hether the Legislature intended that all
deception, however slight, should result in dismissal is doubtful.” (Ibid.)
“Dishonest conduct may
range from the smallest fib to the most flagrant lie…. [N]ot every falsehood
will constitute ‘dishonesty’ as a ground for discipline.” (Fontana Unified
School Dist. v. Burman (1988) 45 Cal.3d 208, 220, fn. 12.)
 
            With respect to dishonesty, the
District raises the following grounds: (1) Duncan was purportedly dishonest
about recording and photographs prior to May 13; (2) Duncan suppressed and
destroyed evidence of photos he took of students prior to May 13; (3) Duncan falsely
claimed his recording of students was inadvertent; (4) Duncan was
dishonest about his reason for going to the administration office after
recording students on May 13; (5) Duncan’s stated justification for recording
and photographing students based on the dress code is invalid and illogical;
and (6) Duncan suppressed and destroyed evidence during the underlying
administrative proceedings. 
                        
1.           
Pre-May
13 Recordings and Photographs
 
            As to the first and second grounds, Duncan
is correct that the “basis for dismissal must be raised on allegations in the
[Statement of] Charges.” (Opp. at 14:3-8.) Section 44934 governs the required
notice to be given to employees in dismissal proceedings. School districts may
commence dismissal proceedings upon the formulation of a written statement of
charges by the governing board. (§ 44934(b).) “Any written statement of charges
shall specify instances of behavior and the acts or omissions constituting the
charge so that the employee will be able to prepare his or her defense. It
shall, where applicable, state the statutes and rules that the employee is
alleged to have violated, and it shall also set forth the facts relevant to
each charge.” (§ 44934(c).)  
 
            The first and second grounds were
not set forth in the Statement of Charges served on Duncan by the District. In
the Statement of Charges, the District accused Duncan of “stalk[ing],
photograph[ing], and videotap[ing]” female students at Valencia High School and
“elsewhere in the District.” (AR 7.) This allegation was based on the events of
May 13 with D.S., the meeting with Principal Getz on May 13, and the meeting
with Assistant Superintendent Vierra on May 20. (AR 7-9.) No reference was made
to recordings or photographs made by Duncan prior to May 13, 2022. (AR 6-10.) 
 
In
the reply, the District argues that it attached to the Statement of Charges notes
taken by Getz and Vierra of their respective meetings with Duncan and student
statements. (Reply at 5:4-12.) The Statement of Charges merely states:
“Attached are the 19 pages of documents you requested, relating to the
recommendation.” (AR 9.) From the language of the Statement of Charges, it is
not altogether clear what the 19 pages are and for what purpose they wee
attached.  More to the point, even if
such documents were provided to Duncan along with the Statement of Charges and
such documents reference pre-May 13 recordings and photographs, in order to be
a basis for discipline, the conduct relating to any such recordings and
photographs was required to be specified in the Statement of Charges so Duncan
could prepare a defense. (§ 44934(c).) The District was required to “set forth
the facts relevant to each charge.” (§ 44934(c).) A vague reference that the
documents “relate” to the recommendation to dismiss cannot be said to have
provided Duncan with notice that the dismissal proceedings would be based on
pre-May 13 records in addition to the May 13 recordings and photos. The
District had the opportunity to move to amend the Statement of Charges prior to
the hearing to include allegations concerning pre-May 13 recordings and photos,
but the District did not do so. (See § 44934(d).) 
 
Accordingly,
the District may not seek reversal of the Commission’s Decision based on
Duncan’s purported dishonesty concerning recordings and photos taken prior to
May 13.
 
2.           
Inadvertent
Video of D.S.
 
The
District contends that, during Duncan’s May 20 meeting with Vierra, Duncan
misrepresented that his video recording was inadvertent. (See AR 591
[question 15], 593 [question 29].) In addition to relying on Vierra’s notes, the
District relies on the following finding from the Commission:
 
Respondent
does not dispute that he photographed and videorecorded students during the May
13 incident. At hearing, respondent claimed the 24-second video was taken
inadvertently and accidentally. The Commission did not find respondent’s claim
convincing. In reviewing the 24-second video, the Commission saw no indication
it was recorded accidentally or inadvertently. The 24-second video appears to
have been recorded as respondent held his phone upright in front of him and
pointed it towards students J.M. and D.S. 
 
(AR
2269-70, citing Ex. 7.)
 
            Duncan testified that, while he was
taking pictures, he inadvertently recorded a video between the first and second
pictures that he took. (AR 1935-36 [HT 503:3-504:2]; 567-71 [five photos].) The
Court has reviewed the video Duncan took, as well as the surveillance footage
from the school’s security cameras. (AR Exs. 7, 30.) Duncan kept his phone
upright, with some slight angling of the phone downward, throughout the
entirety of the recording with the phone pointed at students, including D.S. While
Duncan’s keeping his phone upright could be consistent with actively attempting
to video record students, it is also consistent with positioning the camera to
take a series of photos, during which he accidentally pushed “record” video button
instead of the adjacent “take a picture button” to snap a “series of pictures”
quickly and discretely. (See AR 1899-1900 [HT 467-23-468:7].) 
 
            Given the equally plausible explanations
for the existence of the video recording, the Court does not find that the
District proved that it is more likely than not that Duncan was dishonest about
how the recording was created.  (See
Chamberlain v. Ventura County Civil Service Com. (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 362,
369 [preponderance of the evidence is such evidence “as, when weighed with that
opposed to it, has more convincing force, and from which it results that the
greater probability is in favor of the party upon whom the burden rests”].)  Indeed, considering that petitioner
voluntarily provided to the District the video along with the photos as
evidence of what he did on May 13, 2022, it seems less plausible that Duncan
would bother to fabricate a story that the video was accidental while fully
admitting the photos were taken intentionally. 
(See AR 1937-38 [505:10-506:13], 1951-52 [HT 519:21-520:6].)
 
3.           
Duncan’s
Explanation for May 13 Visit to Administrative Office
 
The
District argues that, during his meeting with Vierra, Duncan stated that, after
he took the pictures, he was possibly going to the office but not sure why. (AR
590 [question 12], 594-594 [question 38].) Duncan confirmed in his deposition
that he made such a statement. (AR 2145-46 [HT 711:3-712:23 [reading
deposition].) At the Commission hearing approximately one year later, Duncan testified
that he went to the office to look for Miles and report violations of the dress
code with the pictures on his proof as proof. (AR 1907-08 [HT 475:8-476:14].)
Duncan, however, could not find Miles. (AR 1910 [HT 478:1-8].) 
 
The
District contends Duncan falsely testified that he went to the administrative
office to report dress code violations because the real reason Duncan went to the
office was merely to sign in on a daily attendance sheet. (Opening Br. at 11:13-25;
AR 2156-57 [HT 722:23-733:4] [Getz testified that petitioner signed in on May
13].)  In support of this claim of
deception, the District cites Getz’s testimony that Duncan signed his
attendance sheet on May 13, 2022.  (AR
2156-57.)  This proves little, as Duncan
could have signed the attendance sheet at any time on May 13, 2022, or, more
likely, when he was in the administrative office seeking to show the dress code
violation photos to Miles. 
 
In
reply, the District additionally argues that, when Miles went to Duncan’s
classroom on May 13 to summon him to Getz’s office, Duncan did not inform Miles
of the dress code violations, even though Miles and Duncan walked together to Getz’s
office. (Reply at 7:5-10; AR 2275 [¶ 37 – stating that May 20 was first time
Duncan explained that he took pictures to document dress code violations], 591
[question 15].)   This also proves
little.  Duncan testified that Miles told
him he had to go to Getz’s office immediately. (AR 1912-13 [HT 480:25-481:4].) Given
the urgency with which he was summoned, the fact that Duncan did not raise the
dress code violations to Miles on the way to the urgent meeting with Getz is
understandable, let alone proof of deception.
 
            For the foregoing reasons, the
District fails to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Duncan’s statement
that he went to the administrative office to report dress code violations to
Miles was dishonest. 
 
4.           
Duncan’s
Stated Reason for Recording and Photographing Students
 
The
District contends that Duncan’s stated reason for photographing and recording
students on May 13 based on the dress code is false because it is an illogical
explanation for the following reasons: (1) on May 13, Duncan denied filming
students and offered no explanation after having been shown security footage; (2) Duncan
asserted that dress code violations were getting much worse and were out of
control compared to other schools, but he never went to other schools and had
no evidence of violations at other schools; (3) Duncan never sent students to
the administrative office for a dress code violation; (4) Duncan never raised
dress code issues with Principal Getz; (5) Duncan claimed that he took
photographs due to the “Capturing Kids Hearts” program, but the program was not
about promoting disciplinary enforcement; and (6) it is common knowledge that
teachers were not to photograph students without authorization. 
 
With
respect to the first ground, according to Getz’s notes, Getz asked Duncan on
May 13 if he filmed any students on campus during brunch. (AR 581.) Duncan said
no. (AR 581.) Duncan’s denial is consistent with his testimony that he only
discovered after his meeting with Getz on May 13 that he inadvertently
recorded a video, i.e., “filmed” students. (AR 1935 [HT 503:13-23].)
Further, even though Duncan did not offer any explanation after Getz showed him
security camera footage, Duncan explained that he had asked for the president
of his union, John Minkus, to be present at his meeting with Getz. (AR 1918-19
[HT 486:3-487:12].) Duncan testified that he would not provide any statement or
explanation without Minkus present. (AR 1920 [HT 488:5-8], 1923 [HT
491:17-23].) Under these circumstances, Duncan’s refusal on May 13 to provide
an explanation of the footage was not evidence of dishonesty, but evidence of
his desire to have his preferred union representative to be present at the
meeting. 
 
The
Court recognizes that Getz denies Duncan told him that he wanted Minkus at the
meeting. (AR 1753-54 [HT 322:20-323:8].)  The Court does not credit Getz’s assertion.  Truex-Hill, the union representative, who was
present during the May 13 meeting, testified that Duncan stated on May 13 (1) that
Truex-Hill was not his preferred representative, (2) that Duncan would not make
any kind of statement, (3) and that Duncan wanted a follow-up meeting with
Minkus present. (AR 1833 [HT 401:5-20].) In reply, the District contends that
Truex-Hill should not be believed due his purported bias in favor of Duncan
because Minkus was the union president (AR 1845 [HT 413:18-22]), because Minkus
and Duncan have been friends since 1998 (AR 1848-49 [HT 416:21-417:2]), and
because Duncan served in union positions for years (AR 1929 [HT 497:11-18].) The
District thus argues that “there was significant downward pressure on Truex
because he was the representative at a disciplinary meeting for Duncan, a
longtime friend of the union president.” (Reply at 11:24-12:4.)
 
The
Court finds the District’s argument concerning Truex-Hill’s bias entirely speculative.
The District has no direct evidence of any bias and, more to the point,
proffers no evidence that Truex-Hill may have lied about what occurred during
the May 13 meeting. The District argues that Truex-Hill reviewed Duncan’s notes
to prepare for his hearing testimony, which purportedly biased Truex-Hill’s
testimony. (Reply at 12:5-11; AR 1825-26 [HT 393:24-394:3].) But, the District
entirely ignores the fact that Truex-Hill also reviewed Getz’s notes regarding
the May 13 meeting. (AR 1825-26 [HT 393:24-394:4].) There is thus no basis to
conclude that Truex-Hill’s testimony was biased in favor of Duncan. 
 
Given
that Getz and Truex-Hill clearly testified that Duncan asked for Minkus to be
present, and there being no apparent reason for True-Hill to have testified
falsely or inaccurately, the Court credits Getz’s claim that he asked for
Minkus to be present and would not further participate in the May 13  meeting with Getz without Minkus.  The Court does not find that the Duncan
denied filming students or improperly refused to provide an explanation for his
conduct on May 13.
 
With
respect to the second through sixth grounds stated above, even if the stated
grounds are true, other witnesses support Duncan’s assertion that there was a
problem with dress code violations at Valencia High School. Spann, who taught
during the 2021-22 school year, testified that dress code has always been an
issue at the school. (AR 1876 [HT 444:5-19], 1881 [HT 449:9-20].) Spann also
testified that the dress code issue was raised to Miles during the 2021-22
school year. (AR 1879-80 [HT 447:1-448:15.) Spann testified that teachers had
never been notified that there was no formal dress code in place during the
2021-22 school year. (AR 1875-76 [HT 443:10-444:19].) Indeed, Getz conceded no
such notification took place. (AR 1734-36 [HT 303:3-305:1].) Further, Getz
conceded that D.S. was sent to the administrative office by another teacher,
Ms. Loch, on May 13 for a dress code violation. (AR 1721-23 [HT 290:7-292:5], 1763
[HT 332:7-13].) Thus, Duncan’s stated justification for taking photographs of
students, including D.S., is not “unreasonably farfetched,” as asserted by the
District. (Reply 10:6.)  To the contrary,
D.S. having been “dress-coded” by Ms. Loch is evidence that Duncan was most
likely truthful regarding his reasons for taking the pictures.  To be sure, the taking of photos and recording
of video of students without authorization was inappropriate, but the evidence
is lacking to show that Duncan was dishonest about it.


5.           
Duncan’s
Purported Suppression and Destruction of Evidence During Administrative
Proceedings
 
The
District argues that Duncan destroyed his original handwritten notes and prepared
typed notes. With respect to the May 13 meeting, Duncan testified that he wrote
notes by hand during the meeting, typed the notes, then disposed of the
handwritten notes. (AR 723 [Depo. 118:6-17], 725 [Depo. 147:3-5], 726-27 [Depo.
120:9-17], 729 [Depo. 232:23-233:09], 942-44.) With respect to the May 20
meeting, Duncan testified during deposition that he did not remember whether he
edited his notes the day after the meeting. (AR 726 [Depo. 204:5-8].) During
the hearing, when asked if he could locate the original notes from the May 20
meeting, he testified: “I’m not sure really what that means for original notes.
I merged everything—I didn't save different versions of the—of the notes. Some
things, I typed before the meeting. Some things, I typed during the meeting.
Some things, I typed after the meeting for the purpose of giving them to my
attorney.” (AR 2140 [HT 706:6-20].) Duncan later produced his notes with
certain redactions based on privilege. (AR 683-87, 1450 [HT 20:18-20].) 
 
To
begin with, the destruction of notes did not form the basis for the Statement
of Charges. The District charged Duncan with having been dishonest in
interviews concerning the May 13 incident. (AR 8-9.) The destruction of
evidence was nowhere contained in the Statement of Charges. As noted above with
respect to alleged pre-May 13 photographs, the District could have sought to
amend the Statement of Charges based on purported destruction of evidence but
did not do so. (See § 44934(d).) Accordingly, the District may not rely
on purported dishonesty outside the four corners of the Statement of Charges to
obtain Duncan’s dismissal. 
 
Even
if the Court were to entertain the District’s arguments, they are unavailing.
The District does not demonstrate any bad faith intent to conceal by Duncan.
From the testimony referenced by the District, it appears that Duncan sought to
recapitulate his written notes of the May 13 meeting in electronic form. While
Duncan’s description of his May 20 notes suggests that his notes contain
information outside of what occurred at the May 20 meeting, there is no
indication that Duncan improperly concealed information in his notes. Duncan
redacted the notes based on privilege. 
 
For
the foregoing reasons, the District does not demonstrate by a preponderance of
the evidence that dismissal of Duncan is warranted based on dishonesty due to
purported destruction of evidence.
 
B.          
Unfitness
to Teach
 
            In addition to the purported
examples of dishonesty asserted above, the District asserts three grounds to
demonstrate that Duncan is evidently unfit for service: (1) Duncan took photos
of students prior to May 13 without authorization; (2) Duncan demonstrated
a lack of remorse for his conduct; and (3) Duncan’s claim of retaliation evidences
a lack of accountability and credibility. 
 
            With respect to the first ground, as
stated above with respect to dishonesty, any conduct prior to May 13 was not
specified in the Statement of Charges. (See Section IV.A.1, supra.)
Any pre-May 13 conduct cannot form the basis for discipline. 
 
            With respect to the second ground, the
District argues that Duncan did not express any remorse during the May 13 meeting,
despite having been told by Getz that a “young lady came to the office” and
reported “some creepy dude was following her around filming her” and that “there
have been several students since then reporting that there is some guy on
campus filming girls.” (AR 581 [Getz notes], 942 [Duncan notes].) The District
also argues that Duncan did not express remorse during the May 20 meeting. (AR 597
[questions 51 and 52].) In connection with a preliminary notice of dismissal
and the notice of intention to dismissal, the District argues that Duncan had
an opportunity to explain his conduct and express remorse, but he did not. (AR 1498-1500
[HT 68:17-70:6], 1616-17 [HT 186:12-187:1], 1619 [HT 189:16-25].) 
            
            The Court disagrees with the
District’s assessment of Duncan’s remorse. 
Notably, during the hearing, after witnessing D.S. testify, Duncan
expressed remorse. (See AR 1788 [HT 357:8-11] [D.S. testified she would
feel nervous, uncomfortable, and a little bit scared around Duncan].) Duncan testified:
“[D.S.]’s testimony was really hard for me to hear…. What was hard for me to
hear, and it made so much more sense after hearing her testimony, and then from
Dr. Getz, that it was [D.S.]’s understanding that there is no dress code. So,
there’s absolutely no reason for anybody to be taking pictures of people outside
of that just kind of randomly.” (AR 1994 [HT 562:10-21].) After hearing D.S.
testify to how upset her parents were regarding the incident, Duncan ultimately
expressed regret: “I kind of wish I could somehow communicate with her parents;
say, whoa, I’m sorry. You know, I -- misunderstanding here, so they don’t
worry. Certainly not something I'm, you know -- that I’d do again. I just
didn't see it from the perspective, but it makes -- it makes sense. I could see
how she would be upset. I could see how her family would be upset. You know, I
regret that. Sorry.” (AR 1995-96 [HT 563:21-564:3].) Duncan testified that had
the District given him a directive not to film students again without their
permission, he would “absolutely” comply. (AR 1996 [HT 564:4-9].) 
 
The
Court finds Duncan’s expression of remorse during the hearing to be genuine.
While Duncan ought to have expressed remorse for recording and taking
photographs of students without authorization prior to the hearing, the Court
cannot find that Duncan is “evidently” unfit to serve as a teacher. (§
44932(a)(6).) Duncan’s goal in taking pictures of students was to evidence dress
code violations, not to stalk or otherwise harass students. Although misguided,
Duncan demonstrates that he did not intend to cause discomfort in students.
Duncan now understands the anguish his actions caused. Dismissal is not
warranted. 
 
            With respect to the third ground, Duncan
claimed he had concerns about unfair treatment because he believed Vierra previously
tried to fire him for lacking a certification. (AR 1928-29 [HT 496:25-497:9].) Even
if Duncan’s concerns were invalid, the Court does not find that a misguided
belief that certain school administrators sought to cause him harm renders his dress
code concerns unbelievable or warrant a finding that Duncan refuses to take
accountability. 


 
C.          
Application
of Morrison Factors
 
“In
determining whether the teacher’s conduct thus indicates unfitness to teach the
board may consider such matters as the likelihood that the conduct may have
adversely affected students or fellow teachers, the degree of such adversity
anticipated, the proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct, the type of
teaching certificate held by the party involved, the extenuating or aggravating
circumstances, if any, surrounding the conduct, the praiseworthiness or
blameworthiness of the motives resulting in the conduct, the likelihood of the
recurrence of the questioned conduct, and the extent to which disciplinary
action may inflict an adverse impact or chilling effect upon the constitutional
rights of the teacher involved or other teachers.” (Morrison v. State Board
of Education (1969) 1 Cal.3d 214, 229, footnotes omitted.) The factors set
forth in Morrison also apply in “an attempt to discipline a permanent
employee on grounds of dishonesty.” (Fontana Unified School Dist. v. Burman
(1988) 45 Cal.3d 208, 220, fn. 12.) “[N]ot all Morrison factors need be
examined, only the pertinent ones.” (Governing Board v. Haar (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 369, 384.) 
 
With
respect to whether Duncan’s conduct adversely affected students or teachers,
D.S. and her parents were very upset with Duncan and raised concerns about
student safety on campus. (AR 1675-76 [HT 244:25-245:13], 1776-78 [HT 345:18-347:6],
1784-85 [HT 353:21-354:3], 1785:86 [HT 354:20-355:14].) Getz was also alarmed
with Duncan’s conduct. (AR 1688-89 [HT 257:22-258:14].) 
 
With
respect to the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the motives resulting in
the conduct, Duncan’s concerns about dress code violations were not
unreasonable. But, his conduct in filming students without authorization was
inappropriate and unwarranted. As the Commission found, Duncan could have
notified an administrator during the brunch period about his observation of
dress code violations. (AR 2297 [¶ 27].)
 
With
respect to whether Duncan’s conduct is likely to recur, the District points to
pictures that Duncan may have taken prior to May 13 and destruction of related
evidence. As stated above, pre-May 13 conduct may not form the basis of discipline
because it was not set forth in the Statement of Charges. Moreover, even if
Duncan had taken pictures of students without authorization prior to May 13,
the Court credits Duncan’s newfound understanding that filming students without
authorization is wrong, as he expressed during the hearing. Based on his
testimony, the Court finds that there is minimal or no likelihood that Duncan’s
conduct is likely to recur. 
 
            Based on the foregoing factors, the
Court finds that Duncan is not unfit to teach. Duncan took pictures of students
because of dress code violations, which other teachers also found to be an
issue. The fact that there was no formal dress code during the 2021-22 school
year was not conveyed to Duncan or other teachers. Although Duncan’s means to
enforce the dress code were inappropriate and misguided, his motives were not
unreasonable. 
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), real party in interest James Duncan shall prepare, serve, and
ultimately file a proposed judgment.
