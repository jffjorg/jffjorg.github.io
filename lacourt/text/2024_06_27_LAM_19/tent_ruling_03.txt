 Case Number:  23STCV13686    Hearing Date:   June 27, 2024    Dept:  19 The Hearing on Motion to Confirm Settlement and Consent Judgment (Res. ID: 065462686155) [Filed: 12/11/23] is CONTINUED to July 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 19 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.The Court finds that the signature page of the [Proposed] Consent Judgment lacks the title of each individuals who signed the agreement on behalf of both Plaintiff and Defendant.  The Court therefore cannot ascertain whether the signatories truly had the  authority to bind Plaintiff and Defendant companies to the terms of the agreement,  including Section 13. The parties are to submit an amended proposed  consent judgment that properly identifies the titles and/or authority of the  signatories by July 15, 2024. Counsel for Plaintiff to give notice.
