The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV13686, continuing the hearing on the motion to confirm the settlement and consent judgment to July 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 19 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The Court has found that the signature page of the proposed consent judgment lacks the title of each individual who signed the agreement on behalf of both Plaintiff and Defendant companies, making it unclear whether the signatories had the authority to bind the companies to the terms of the agreement. The parties are required to submit an amended proposed consent judgment that properly identifies the titles and/or authority of the signatories by July 15, 2024.
