RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
(1)  
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
(2)  
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
On August 16, 2023, plaintiff Austin Hammesfahr (“Plaintiff”) filed
the pending           (1) motion to
compel further responses to requests for production of documents from defendant
Tiffany Summer Kjenstad, and (2) motion to compel further responses to requests
for production of documents from defendant Luke Miller Kjenstad. 
On November 14, 2023, the court issued an order advancing the hearing
on Plaintiff’s motions to February 26, 2024. 
(Nov. 14, 2023 Order, ¶¶ 5-6.) 
The court ordered Plaintiff to give notice of the court’s November 14,
2023 order.  (Id., ¶ 6; Nov.
14, 2023 Minute Order, p. 1.)  However, Plaintiff
did not file a notice of ruling or a proof of service stating that he provided
notice of the court’s order to defendants Tiffany Summer Kjenstad and Luke
Miller Kjenstad (“Defendants”).  Thus,
the court finds that Defendants have not been given notice of the new hearing
date on Plaintiff’s motions.
The court therefore exercises its discretion to continue the hearing
on Plaintiff’s motions to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production of Documents to ensure that Defendants receive notice
of the hearing date on these motions. 
The court orders that plaintiff Austin Hammesfahr’s motion to compel
further responses to requests for production from defendant Tiffany Summer
Kjenstad is continued to April 12, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders that plaintiff Austin Hammesfahr’s motion to compel
further responses to requests for production from defendant Luke Miller
Kjenstad is continued to April 12 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The court orders plaintiff Austin Hammesfahr (1) to give notice of
this ruling to defendants Tiffany Summer Kjenstad and Luke Miller Kjenstad, and
(2) to file a proof of service with the court establishing that defendants
Tiffany Summer Kjenstad and Luke Miller Kjenstad have been served with the
notice of this ruling no later than March 11, 2024.  
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  February 26, 2024
