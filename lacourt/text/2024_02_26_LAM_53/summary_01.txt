And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to requests for production of documents from the defendants. The plaintiff had filed the motions on August 16, 2023, and the court had previously ordered the hearing to be held on February 26, 2024. However, the plaintiff failed to provide notice of the court's order to the defendants, which is required by law. As a result, the court has decided to continue the hearing to ensure that the defendants receive notice of the new hearing date. The new hearing date is set for April 12, 2024, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling to the defendants and file a proof of service with the court establishing that the defendants have been served with the notice no later than March 11, 2024.
