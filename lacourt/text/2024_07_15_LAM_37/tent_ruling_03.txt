BACKGROUND 
 
On
July 11, 2023, the Estate of Reginald Humphrey, by and through, Deana Dodd,
individually
and
as Administratrix to the Estate (hereinafter “Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint
against the City of Los Angeles (the “City”); Marco Ramirez; Ronak Shah; Joshua
Rodrogiez; Mathew Lavella; Yeiz Ruiz; Frank Ciezaldo; Paula Davidson
(collectively “Defendants”); and Does 1 to 40.  
 
The
Complaint alleges four causes of action: (1) Civil Rights Violation (Civ. Code,
§§ 51.7, 52.1(b), and 52.1(h));
(2) Assault and Battery (Gov. Code, § 820); (3)
False Imprisonment (Gov. Code, §820); and (4)
Negligence (Gov. Code § 820.)

 
On
January 3, 2024, Defendants filed a Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings (“MJOP”). On March 26, 2024, the court granted MJOP with leave to
amend.
 
On
April 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
alleging the same causes of actions for: (1) Civil Rights Violation (Civ. Code,
§§§§ 51.7, 52.1(b), 52.1(h) 815.2 and 820);
(2) Assault and Battery (Gov. Code, §§ 815.2 and 820); (3) False Imprisonment (Gov. Code §§ 815.2 and
820); and (4) Negligence (Gov. Code
§§ 815.2 and 820.) 
 
Defendants[1] now demurs to the FAC. Plaintiff opposes the motion. The matter
is now before the court. 
 
DEMURRER TO FAC
 
I.         Legal Standard 
 
A.        Demurrer¿ 
¿ 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP, § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint
need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist.
(2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of
the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts
properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th
962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
B.        Leave to Amend¿ 
¿ 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿¿ 
  
II.        Discussion
 
A.        Failure
to Meet and Confer 
 
The court notes that Defendants have failed to comply with
the mandatory requirements of CCP  § 430
which requires the parties to meet and confer before filing a demurrer or
motion to strike. “Any determination by the court that the meet and confer
process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).) As the failure to meet and confer does not
constitute grounds to overrule a demurrer, the court continues to the merits.  
 
B.        Summary
of Allegations in FAC
 
The FAC alleges that on or about July 5, 2022, Reginald Humphrey
(“Mr. Humphrey”) was approached by police officers (“Officers”) Marco Ramirez,
Ronak Shah, Joshua Rodrogiez, Matthew Lavella, Yeiz Ruiz, Frank Ciezadlo, and
Paula Davidson, as they were responding to a report regarding a possible
assault with a deadly weapon. (FAC, ¶ 8.) While patrolling the area, the
officers threatened to hit, grab, and shoot Mr. Humphrey. (FAC, ¶ 11.) Mr.
Humphrey was shot multiple times after Mr. Humphrey allegedly dropped whatever was
in his hands. (FAC, ¶ 11.) The “sheer number of bullets fired suggests the
shooting occurred because of contagious fire; meaning several of the Defendants
fired their weapons merely because other Defendants fired their weapons, and
not because of their independent assessment of the need to use deadly force.” (FAC,
¶18.) 
 
Additionally, the FAC alleges that the officers have never
seen Mr. Humphrey in their lives, and that, “Defendant OFFICERS were then
unaware of any crime Mr. Humphrey was then suspected of committing as they
approached him. These Defendants unlawfully opened fire on Mr. Humphrey merely
following the aggressive actions of their fellow Defendants, but without any
independent legal cause to use deadly force.” (FAC, ¶¶ 10, 13.) The FAC alleges
that Mr. Humphrey was not a threat to anyone and was merely walking on a public
sidewalk. (FAC, ¶ 13.) Mr. Humphrey died after being taken to the hospital, but
the “delayed action in getting medical treatment was a substantial factor
leading to his death.” (FAC, ¶¶ 12, 19.)
 
Moreover, the FAC alleges that Mr. Humphrey was unlawfully detained
and repeatedly shot because he was an African American male. (FAC, ¶ 21.) The “force
under these circumstances was calculated, intentional, excessive, and unlawful,
malicious, oppressive, and/or with a deliberate indifference to Mr. Humphrey’s
rights and safety.” (FAC, ¶ 21.)
 
Defendants now demur to the four causes of action alleged in
Plaintiff’s FAC because they fail to show that Defendants were directly liable in
a manner sufficient to support causes of action for Civil Rights Violations,
Assault and Battery, False Imprisonment, and Negligence. 
 
C.        First
Cause of Action - Civil Rights Violations 
 
Civil Code § 51.7
(the “Ralph Civil Rights Act of 1976”) provides that, “All
persons within the jurisdiction of this state have the right to be free from
any violence, or intimidation by threat of violence, committed against their
persons or property because of political affiliation, or on account of any
characteristic listed or defined in subdivision (b) or (e) of Section 51, or
position in a labor dispute, or because another person perceives them to have
one or more of those characteristics. The identification in this subdivision of
particular bases of discrimination is illustrative rather than restrictive.” (Civ.
Code, § 51.7, subds. (a), (b).)
 
Moreover, Civil
Code § 52.1 (the “Bane Act”) allows an individual to sue for damages if a
person or persons “interferes by threat, intimidation, or coercion, or attempts
to interfere by threat, intimidation, or coercion, with the exercise or
enjoyment by any individual or individuals of rights secured by the
Constitution or laws of the United States, or of the rights secured by the
Constitution or laws of this state….”¿ (Civ. Code, § 52.1, subds. (a),
(b).)¿¿“The essence of a Bane Act claim is that the defendant, by the specified
improper means (i.e.,¿‘threat[], intimidation or coercion’), tried to or did
prevent the plaintiff from doing something he or she had the right to do under
the law or to force the plaintiff to do something that he or she was not required
to do under the law.”¿ (King v. State of Cal. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th
265, 294.)
 
The FAC alleges
that the Officers are not immune from under Civ. Code § 820.2 because they used
excessive force. (FAC, ¶ 29.) Additionally, Civil Code § 815.2 provides that: “A public entity is liable for injury
proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity
within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would, apart from
this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his
personal representative. Except as otherwise provided by statute, a public
entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of an
employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from liability.” (Civ.
Code, § 815.2, subds. (a), (b).)
 
Defendants argue that
Plaintiff fails to state any claim against the City because there are no
statutes which authorize any of Plaintiff’s claims to be asserted directly against
the City and because the claims are, at most, general and conclusory
allegations. Pursuant to the Government Claims Act, Defendants contend that
there is a general concept for immunity for government entities. The Government
Claims Act “permits private tort actions against government entities and
employees where permitted by statute, but otherwise retains the general concept
of immunity for government entities.” (DeJung v. Superior Court
(2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 533, 543.)
Defendants also
argue that because the City can only act through its employees, Plaintiffs’
claims arise under vicarious liability and not direct liability. Defendants argue that “direct tort liability of public
entities must be based on a specific statute declaring them to be liable, or at
least creating a specific duty of care, and not on the general tort provisions
of Civil Code section 1714.” (Munoz v. City of Union City
(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1077, 1112 disproved on another point in Hayes v. County of San Diego (2013) 57 Cal.4th 622.) 
However, Plaintiff does allege a statutory basis for which Defendants
can be held liable, albeit vicariously. Although Civil Code §§ 815.2 and 820 do not permit Defendants to be held
directly liable, they do permit Defendants to be held vicariously liable. “This
‘[v]icarious liability is a primary basis for liability on the part of a public
entity, and flows from the responsibility of such an entity for the acts of its
employees under the principle of respondeat superior.’ ” (San Diego City Firefighters, Local 145 v. Bd. of Admin. of San
Diego City Emples. Ret. Sys. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 594, 611.)
“Thus, Defendant in this matter can be held liable for civil right violations
under Cal. Govt. Code. §§ 815.2 and 820).” (FAC, ¶ 30.) 
In turn, the trier of fact should decide whether the
officers exerted an unreasonable use of force that went beyond the scope of
their duties by shooting Mr. Humphrey given that the FAC claims he did not pose
a threat. (FAC, ¶ 13.) 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the first cause of action is
overruled.
 
D.        Second
Cause of Action - Assault and Battery
 
“The elements of
a cause of action for assault are: (1) the defendant acted with intent to cause
harmful or offensive contact, or threatened to touch the plaintiff in a harmful
or offensive manner; (2) the plaintiff reasonably believed he was about to be
touched in a harmful or offensive manner or it reasonably appeared to the
plaintiff that the defendant was about to carry out the threat; (3) the
plaintiff did not consent to the defendant's conduct; (4) the plaintiff was
harmed; and (5) the defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the
plaintiff’s harm.” (So v. Shin (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 668.) “The
elements of a cause of action for battery are: (1) the defendant touched the
plaintiff, or caused the plaintiff to be touched, with the intent to harm or
offend the plaintiff; (2) the plaintiff did not consent to the touching; (3)
the plaintiff was harmed or offended by the defendant's conduct; and (4) a
reasonable person in the plaintiff's position would have been offended by the
touching.” (Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 879, 890.)
 
Defendants argue that the City
itself cannot commit a battery, assault, or any of the other conduct alleged by
Plaintiffs in this case. However, as explained above, the Officers can be held directly
liable under § 820.2 if the officers used excessive force. The City can be held
vicariously liable under Gov. Code § 815.2 and § 820. (See FAC, ¶ 41.) 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the second cause of action is
overruled.
 
E.        Third
Cause of Action - False Imprisonment
 
“[T]he tort of
false arrest are: defendant arrested plaintiffs without a warrant, plaintiffs
were harmed, and defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the
harm.” (Carcamo v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th
608, 616 (Carcamo).) “False arrest and false imprisonment are the same tort.
False arrest is a way of committing false imprisonment.” (Cox v. Griffin
(2019) 34 Cal.App.5th 440, 446, fn. 6.) “If plaintiffs prove those elements [of
the tort for false arrest/imprisonment], defendant has the burden of persuasion
to prove the arrest was justified.” (Carcamo, at p. 616). “[T]he arrest is
justified if defendant had reasonable or probable cause to believe that each
plaintiff committed a crime in his presence.” (Ibid.)
 
Defendants make
the same argument again, that the City cannot be held directly liable. However,
the City can be held vicariously liable under Gov. Code § 815.2 and § 820.
(FAC, ¶ 49.) 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the third cause of action is
overruled.
 
F.        Fourth
Cause of Action - Negligence
 
The elements of a
cause of action for negligence are well established. They are (a) “a legal duty
to use due care; (b) a breach of such legal duty; [and] (c) the breach as the
proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.” (Ladd v. County of San
Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th 913, 917 [internal quotation marks omitted].) The
existence and scope of a property owner’s duty are legal questions for the
court. (Annocki v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32,
36.) “However, the elements of breach of that duty and causation are ordinarily
questions of fact for the jury's determination.” (Vasquez v. Residential
Investments, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 269, 278.)
 
The FAC alleges that Defendants breached their duty by: 
 
a.     
The
CITY and DOES 21-40’s negligent training and supervision of OFFICERS, although
it was clear, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been
clear that each of the Defendant OFFICERS who was present that day was a
dangerous, unsafe, and poorly trained police officer, who because of inadequate
implicit bias and conflict resolution training, was prone to using unreasonable
force, and recklessly shooting others, especially ethnic minorities like Mr.
Humphrey, as well as violating the rights and safety of citizens with whom they
interacted while on patrol; and/or
 
b.    
The
Defendant OFFICERS negligent investigation into Mr. Humphrey’s presence that
day, and the failure to appreciate that, prior to the use of force, Mr.
Humphrey was not then engaged in any conduct justifying the immediate use of
deadly force; and/or 
 
c.     
The
negligent and careless training the CITY and DOES 21 through 40 provided
OFFICERS concerning the proper use of deadly force, which was inconsistent with
best police practices, as well as the state-mandated policies and procedures as
reflected in the Peace Officers Standards and Training (“POST”); and/or 
 
d.    
Defendant
OFFICERS failure to follow the training they were given concerning the proper
use of deadly force against unarmed nonviolent citizens; and/or 
 
e.     
The
negligent and careless training the CITY and DOES 21 through 40 provided
OFFICERS concerning the proper way of interacting with citizens in public
areas, which was inconsistent with best police practices, as well as the state
mandated policies and procedures as reflected in the Peace Officers Standards
and Training (“POST”) program; and/or
 
f.     
Defendant
OFFICERS negligent, careless, and unintentional discharging of their weapons at
Mr. Humphrey; and/or
 
g.    
The
negligent handling of evidence and witnesses during the course of the Defendant
CITY and DOES 21 through 40’s investigation following this officer involved
shooting.
 
(FAC, ¶ 60.)
 
There is no
statutory basis for declaring a public entity defendant directly liable for
negligent hiring or supervision of officers. (See Koussaya v. City of Stockton (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 909,
943 (Koussaya); de Villers v. County of San Diego (2007)
156 Cal.App.4th 238, 252 (de Villers) [“We find no relevant case law
approving a claim for direct liability based on a public entity's allegedly
negligent hiring and supervision practices.”) 
Accordingly, a negligent
hiring, training, or supervision claim against the City would be “purely
vicarious.” (Koussaya, at p. 943.) 

 
Defendants
fail to explain why the City cannot be held vicariously liable for the
negligence of its employees, including negligent hiring and supervision. “[T]he
general rule is that an employee of a public entity is liable for his torts to
the same extent as a private person (§ 820, subd. (a)) and the public entity is
vicariously liable for any injury which its employee causes (§ 815.2, subd.
(a)) to the same extent as a private employer (§ 815, subd. (b)).” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012)
53 Cal.4th 861, 868.) “As a general rule, the Act makes public entities liable
for injuries proximately caused by their employees in the course of employment
but immunizes the public entity from liability when the employee is immune.” (Leon v. County of Riverside (2023) 14 Cal.5th 910,
918.) 
 
“[P]eace officers
owe a duty to act reasonably when using
deadly force[.]” (Golick v. State of California
(2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 1127, 1138.) Here, whether the Officers used reasonable
or deadly force remains a disputed issue of fact not subject to demurrer. (See Fremont
Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 113-114.)
Similarly, whether the Officers have immunity because they used reasonable
force is a question of fact. Under the Government Tort Claims Act “a police
officer does not have discretionary immunity from liability for the use of
unreasonable force in making an arrest[.]” (Scruggs v. Haynes
(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 256, 267.) The City can be held liable for any negligent
acts committed by the Officers. Accordingly, the demurrer to the fourth cause
of action is overruled.
 
While the court agrees that the FAC fails to allege a
basis for direct liability against the City, a demurrer must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained. (See PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682; Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General
Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.) Therefore, the entire demurrer is
properly overruled. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Defendants’ demurrer is overruled. Defendants are to file an Answer within 10 days.  The Court sets an OSC Re: Filing of Answer
for August 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  Defendants
to give notice.
