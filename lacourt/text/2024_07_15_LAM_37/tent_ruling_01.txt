Background
 
This
action arises in connection with a contract between Johnstone Supply
(“Plaintiff”) and Cubic Air Conditioning, Electric & Solar, Inc. (“Cubic”).
Plaintiff also alleges Defendant Albert Macias (“Macias”), and Cubic are alter
egos and/or successors of one another, and asks this court to pierce the
corporate veil. Plaintiff alleges that, on or about February 17, 2020,
Defendants breached their contract by failing to pay $124,273.73 of the total
invoice for goods provided.  
 
Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges two causes of action: (1) breach of contract and (2) common
counts.  On June 13, 2022, the court entered a default against
Defendants. On August 31, 2022, the court granted default judgment against
Defendants. On February 24, 2023, the court granted Defendants’ motion to
vacate the default but only as to Defendant Macias. 
 
On
August 11, 2023, the court entered judgment pursuant to a stipulation in favor
of Plaintiff and against Defendants jointly and severally. 
 
On
April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs after judgment in the sum
of $18,530.00. On Aril 25, 2024, Defendants moved to tax costs and for an order
requiring the Plaintiff (the “Judgment Creditor”) to file a satisfaction of
judgment of the case pursuant to CCP § 725.050(d). 
 
motion to
file satisfaction of judgment and tax costs
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
CCP § 724.010 states: 
 
(a)
A money judgment may be satisfied by payment of the full amount required to
satisfy the judgment or by acceptance by the judgment creditor of a lesser sum
in full satisfaction of the judgment.
 
(b)
Where a money judgment is satisfied by levy, the obligation of the judgment
creditor to give or file an acknowledgment of satisfaction arises only when the
judgment creditor has received the full amount required to satisfy the judgment
from the levying officer.
 
(c)
Where a money judgment is satisfied by payment to the judgment creditor by
check or other form of noncash payment that is to be honored upon presentation
by the judgment creditor for payment, the obligation of the judgment creditor
to give or file an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment arises only when
the check or other form of noncash payment has actually been honored upon
presentation for payment.
 
CCP § 724.050(a) states: 
 
(a)
If a money judgment has been satisfied, the judgment debtor, the owner of real
or personal property subject to a judgment lien created under the judgment, or
a person having a security interest in or a lien on personal property subject
to a judgment lien created under the judgment may serve personally or by mail
on the judgment creditor a demand in writing that the judgment creditor do one
or both of the following:
 
(1)
File an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment with the court.
 
(2)
Execute, acknowledge, and deliver an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment
to the person who made the demand.
 
In an action or proceeding maintained pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing
party. (CCP § 724.080.) 
 
CCP § 1033.5 sets forth the costs recoverable by the prevailing
party. To recover a cost, it must be reasonably necessary to the litigation and
reasonable in amount. (Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises
(l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.) “If the items appearing in a cost bill appear
to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show
that they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State
Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.) “On the other hand,
if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of
proof is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Id.)¿¿ 
 
II.        Evidentiary
Objections
 
Plaintiff’s objections Nos. 1 to 3 are overruled. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
Defendants
as the judgment debtors assert that since January 2024 it has tried to obtain
information about the full judgment owned. (Campbell Decl. ¶ 4-7.) On April 18,
2024, Defendants went to the Los Angeles Sheriff’s office to ascertain the
payoff amount and paid $58,929.00 in satisfaction of the Judgment on April 19,
2024. (Campbell Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9, Ex. 4; Macias Decl. ¶ 2.) 
 
On
April 22, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel informed defense counsel via email that the
judgment had not been satisfied in full and that $18,530 was still due.
(Campbell Decl. ¶ 11.) Defendants responded by asserting that the $18,530
memorandum of costs was defective because it was filed after the judgment and a
demand to file a satisfaction of judgment had been made. (Id. ¶ 12, Ex.
6.) Plaintiff refused. 
 
Defendants
request that the entire memorandum of costs after judgment be stricken and
pursuant to CCP § 724.080, Plaintiff be ordered to pay Defendants reasonable
attorney’s fees and $100 to Defendants. 
 
Plaintiff
asserts that including the interest, Defendants paid $58,929.00 but that $58,973.80
was owed, therefore Defendants were short $44.80, and the payment has not been
fully satisfied. (Opposition, at p. 3:1-23.) The court notes that the return of
attachment/execution by the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department reflects that
Defendants have paid in full and money is owed. Plaintiff further asserts that
Defendants intended to pay off the debt to cut-off Plaintiff’s right to seek
attorney’s fees and costs. (Opposition, at p. 4:16-18.) 
 
Most
importantly, Plaintiff asserts that the memorandum of costs after judgment is
timely because Plaintiff has not yet been paid as the Los Angeles Sheriff’s
department has not yet disbursed the funds. (Biggins Decl. ¶ 5, Ex. C.) “A
judgment is not satisfied for purposes of postjudgment motions until the
judgment creditor has been paid.” (Wertheim, LLC v. Currency Corp.
(2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 1124, 1134.) “Like Gray1, if they have not yet filed a
motion for postjudgment costs at the time the judgment debtor tenders a
cashier's check in full payment of the outstanding judgment, they are free to
reject the payment and to file a motion for postjudgment costs.” (Gray1 CPB, LLC v. SCC Acquisitions, Inc. (2015) 233
Cal.App.4th 882, 896.) Accordingly, because Plaintiff maintains it has not yet
been paid by the Sheriff’s department, it has the right to reject Defendants’
tender of payment and seek post-judgment costs. 
 
The
court finds that pursuant to Gray1 CPB, LLC v. SCC
Acquisitions, Inc. (2015), Plaintiff may reject Defendants’ tender
of payment and file a postjudgment memorandum of costs, as Plaintiff has done
here. Accordingly, the memorandum of costs is timely and should not be
stricken. 
 
The
court further finds that Lines 1 to 5 seeking costs totaling $2,780 are
allowable costs and necessary to the litigation and supported by the evidence.
(Biggins Decl. ¶¶ 9-12, Ex. A, D.) “A verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of
the propriety of the items listed on it, and the burden is on the party
challenging these costs to demonstrate that they were not reasonable or
necessary.” (Bender v. County of Los Angeles¿(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 968,
989.)
 
Accordingly,
no costs will be taxed. 
 
A.        No
Accrued Interest
 
However,
Plaintiff is not entitled to additional interest on the judgment because
Plaintiff’s made full payment to “the levying officer,” the Sheriff’s
department. (See CCP § 685.030[1].) “Section
685.030 enables a judgment debtor to limit its liability for postjudgment interest
by tendering satisfaction of the judgment, whether or not the creditor chooses
to accept the tender.” (Wertheim, supra, 35 Cal.App.5th at p.
1134.) “The Legislature has declared interest on a judgment ceases to
accumulate on the date a check in the amount of the judgment and accumulated
interest is delivered to the judgment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that
the honoring of the check may take a period of days. (§ 685.030, subd.
(d)(2).)” (Gray1 CPB, LLC, supra, 233 Cal.App.4th at p. 896.) 
 
Accordingly,
no additional interest accrues on the judgment but Defendants are still liable
for postjudgment costs. 


B.        Plaintiff’s
Right to Postjudgment Attorney’s Fees
 
Plaintiff
asserts it is entitled to attorney’s fees because the judgment expressly
awarded attorney’s fees. “‘Attorney's fees incurred in enforcing a judgment
are included as costs collectible under this title if the underlying judgment
includes an award of attorney's fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to
subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.’” (Rosen v. LegacyQuest (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 375, 381
citing CCP § 685.040.) The court notes that CCP § 1033.5(a)(10)(A) only permits
attorney’s fees when authorized by contract. Although Exhibit A of the
Complaint includes a series of invoices, the court found no express provision
permitting attorney’s fees. Yet when the parties entered a stipulated judgment,
attorney’s fees in the amount of $3,300 were awarded. Moreover, Defendants do
not deny that the contract and the judgment permitted plaintiffs to recover
attorney’s fees as the prevailing party. 
 
Therefore, the court finds
that Plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees incurred in trying to collect on
the judgment. 
 
                        a.         Reasonably
Hourly Rates
 
Plaintiff’s counsel and
Defense counsel both have an hourly rate of $750 per hour. (Biggins Decl. ¶ 7;
Campell Decl., ¶ 14.) Based upon the skill required in this case and what the
Court has observed, the Court finds $750/hour excessive and reduces the hourly
rate to $450/hour.   
 
                        b.         Reasonable
Time Spent
 
Plaintiff’s counsel provides an invoice
showing fees incurred for time spent communicating with the Defendants who were
trying to negotiate payment of a lower amount than what they previously agreed
to. (Biggins Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. E.)  The invoice
shows entries for time spent researching tax liens. (Id.) Accordingly,
the 21 hours spent after the judgment was entered, from August 12, 2023, to
March 19, 2024, trying to enforce the judgment was reasonably spent. Had
Defendants paid the judgment sooner rather than try to negotiate a lesser
amount, Plaintiff’s counsel would have incurred fewer fees. 
 
Therefore, no deductions will be made to time
spent and the Court awards $9,450.00 in attorney’s fees sought as costs. 


Plaintiff’s
counsel additionally requests $7,500 in attorney’s fees for opposing this
Motion, for 10 hours of work billed at a rate of $750 per hour. (Biggins Decl.
¶ 6.) 
 
The
court finds that 10 hours spent on this motion is excessive and finds that
opposing Defendant’s motion and preparing for the hearing should have taken
about 3.5 hours or $1,575.
 
The
court finds that Plaintiff’s counsel is entitled to $11,025 in costs plus
$2,625 in attorney’s fees for costs incurred in trying to enforce the judgment.

 
Only
after payment of the above costs will the court enter an order for satisfaction
of the judgment. Moreover, Defendants’ request for attorney’s fees is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’
motion to file satisfaction of judgment and tax costs is denied. Plaintiff is
awarded $11,025 in costs, plus $2,625 in attorney’s fees. Defendants to give
notice.
