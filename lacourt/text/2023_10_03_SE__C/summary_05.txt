**English Summary:**

In this tentative ruling, Judge Mejia addresses two motions filed by defendant General Motors LLC (GM) in a case brought by plaintiff Luis Oscar Guerrero Mejia.

GM demurred to the third cause of action, alleging fraudulent inducement, arguing that it failed to state sufficient facts. However, Judge Mejia overruled the demurrer.

GM also moved to strike the fourth cause of action, alleging fraudulent inducement based on concealment, arguing that the plaintiff failed to adequately plead malicious conduct. The judge denied this motion, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges malicious conduct.

Essentially, the judge believes that the plaintiff has sufficiently stated a claim for fraudulent inducement against GM based on the alleged concealment of transmission defects in the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado purchased by the plaintiff.

English summary:
The tentative ruling is for the case number 22NWCV00942, scheduled for hearing on October 3, 2023, in department C, before judge MEJIA. The plaintiff, Luis Oscar Guerrero Mejia, alleges that the defendant, General Motors LLC, sold him a 2019 Chevrolet Silverado with transmission defects. The defendant demurred to the third and fourth causes of action, but the judge overruled the third and denied the fourth. The defendant is ordered to file and serve its answer within 10 days. The fourth cause of action is for fraudulent inducement, and the plaintiff alleges that the defendant concealed the issues at the time of sale and at the time of repair. The defendant's agents are also alleged to have concealed the issues. The plaintiff presented the vehicle for repairs in June 2021, August 2021, and July 2022, and the dealership told him that the vehicle required no repairs and was operating normally. The court finds that the complaint sufficiently pleads malicious conduct by concealment and corporate ratification.
