Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to demurrer and a motion to strike the 4th cause of action for fraudulent inducement filed by General Motors LLC (GM). The judge has overruled GM's demurrer, finding that the complaint sufficiently pleads a cause of action for fraudulent inducement. The judge has also denied GM's motion to strike the 4th cause of action, finding that the complaint alleges a relationship between the plaintiff and GM that gives rise to a duty to disclose. The judge has ordered GM to file and serve its answer within 10 days.
