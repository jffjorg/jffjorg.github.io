## English Summary

The tentative ruling in this case continues the Defendants' motion for summary judgment until December 19, 2023. The case involves seven promissory notes totaling $2,998,814.00, signed between Plaintiff Olaes and Defendants Kim, RD Restaurant Group, Inc., and Golden Den Corp. between 2002 and 2008.

Defendants argue the statute of limitations has expired on the claims because the lawsuit was filed more than six years after the notes were due. Plaintiff contends the statute of limitations was tolled (paused) because Defendants made monthly payments until August 18, 2020.

Defendants further argue that only Golden Den Corp. made payments, not Kim or RD Restaurant Group, Inc., so the statute of limitations shouldn't be tolled for them. Plaintiff seeks to continue the motion to conduct further discovery to prove that payments made by Golden Den Corp. can be attributed to Kim and RD Restaurant Group, Inc. under an "alter ego" theory.

The judge granted the Plaintiff's request to continue the motion for discovery and ordered the parties to request a trial continuance in another department.

English summary:
The tentative ruling is regarding case number 21NWCV00633, scheduled for a hearing on October 3, 2023, in Dept. C. The ruling concerns a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication made by defendants Kim, RD Restaurant Group, Inc., and Golden Den Corp. The motion is based on the six-year statute of limitations under Commercial Code § 3318(a) and the argument that the plaintiff, Olaes, filed the lawsuit more than 6 years after the notes were due. The plaintiff argues that the statute of limitations was tolled because defendants made monthly payments to the plaintiff up to August 18, 2020. Defendants Kim and RDR argue that they are entitled to summary adjudication because only Golden Den made payments to the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks to continue the motion for summary judgment to obtain additional discovery, which will show that the payments made by Golden Den can be attributed to Kim and RDR under an alter ego theory. The court accepts the attorney's declaration and request to continue the motion for summary judgment/adjudication to obtain necessary discovery. The motion is continued to December 19, 2023, at 10:30 am in Dept. C, and the parties may request a trial continuance in Dept. F.
