And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Olaes v. RD Restaurant Group, Inc., continuing the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication to December 19, 2023. The parties are ordered to request a trial continuance in Dept. F. The defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment based on the six-year statute of limitations, while the plaintiff argues that the statute was tolled due to monthly payments made by Golden Den up to August 18, 2020. The plaintiff seeks to continue the motion for summary judgment to obtain additional discovery, which will show that the payments made by Golden Den can be attributed to Kim and RDR under an alter ego theory. The court has accepted the plaintiff's request to continue the motion and has ordered the defendants to provide notice.
