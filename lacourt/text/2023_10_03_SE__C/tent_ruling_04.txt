TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiffs
Rojas and Sanchez’s motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, and
request for sanctions is MOOT.  Reduced sanctions are imposed against Defendant FCA in the reasonable sum of $1,000.00 payable within 30 days.
 
Moving
Parties to give NOTICE.
 
 
Plaintiffs Rojas and Sanchez moves to
compel responses to form Interrogatories pursuant to CCP § 2030.290.
 
The
Complaint alleges that on October 14, 2022, Plaintiffs entered into a warranty
contract with FCA US LLC regarding a 2018 JEEP Renegade, VIN: ZACCJABB9JPJ19592.
 (Complaint, ¶ 15.)  Plaintiff alleges that the vehicle suffers
from engine, electrical, and exterior defects. 
(Id., ¶ 16.)  Based thereon, the
Complaint asserts causes of action for:
 
1.   
Violation
of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty 
2.   
Violation
of the Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Impled Warranty 
3.   
Negligent
Repair
 
CCP
§ 2030.290(b) allows the propounding party to file a motion to compel responses
to interrogatories if a response has not been received.  If responses are untimely, responding party
waives objections.  (CCP § 2030.290(a).)  
 
Plaintiffs served discovery on January 19, 2023.  (Lopez Decl., ¶ 3.)  Defendant
failed to serve any responses.  (Id., ¶
5.)
 
In opposition, Defendant admits that through a
clerical error, Defendant failed to serve timely responses, and served the
discovery on July 26, 2023.
 
Accordingly, with responses now having been served,
the motion is MOOT.
 
Sanctions:  CCP § 2023.010(d) and 2030.290(c) authorize
the court to impose sanctions for failure to respond to discovery without
substantial justification.   
 
Here,
sanctions are warranted because Defendant’s failure to serve timely responses
necessitated
the
instant
motion.  Defendant argues
that
sanctions
are
not
warranted
because
the
motion
is
moot.  However, the court may award sanctions in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 408-409.) 
The court finds
Plaintiff’s
request
of
$1,635.00 is excessive.  Instead, reduced
sanctions
are
imposed
against
Defendant FCA
in
the
reasonable
sum
of
$1,000.00 payable within 30 days.
