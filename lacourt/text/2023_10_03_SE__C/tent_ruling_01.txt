TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendants Kim, RD Restaurant Group, Inc., and Golden Den Corp.’s motion
for summary judgment or, alternatively, motion for summary adjudication is CONTINUED
to December 19, 2023 at 10:30
am in Dept. C.  The parties are ordered
to request a trial continuance in Dept. F.
 
Opposing Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
Defendants Kim, RD Restaurant Group, Inc.,
and Golden Den Corp. move for
summary judgment or alternatively, summary adjudication pursuant to CCP § 437c.
 
This action arises out of seven promissory notes entered into between 2002 and
2008, between the lender, Plaintiff Olaes and the borrowers, Defendants David
Kim, RD Restaurant Group, Inc. and Golden Den Corp. in the sum of
$2,998,814.00.  (Complaint, ¶¶ 8, 24,
27.)  Based thereon, the
Complaint asserts causes of action for:
 
1.    Breach of Contract
2.    Common Counts
 
Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment
because the promissory notes are subject to the six-year statute of limitations
under Commercial Code § 3318(a), and Plaintiff filed her lawsuit more than 6
years after the notes were due.  Plaintiff
argues that the statute of limitations was tolled because Defendants made
monthly payments to Plaintiff up to August 18, 2020, and it was not until then
that the causes of action accrued.  
 
Defendants Kim and RDR argue in the alternative that they are
entitled to summary adjudication because only Golden Den made payments to
Plaintiff; thus, the statute of limitations was not tolled as to Kim and
RDR.  
 
Plaintiff, in turn, seeks to continue the motion for summary
judgment to obtain additional discovery which will show that the payments made
by Golden Den can be attributed to Kim and RDR under an alter ego theory.  The court accepts Attorney Kit Gardner’s
declaration and request to continue the motion for summary
judgment/adjudication to obtain discovery necessary to oppose the motion.  Defendants failed to respond to certain
discovery, which necessitated Plaintiff’s motions to compel further responses,
set to be heard on October 17, 2023. (Gardner Decl., ¶¶ 2-14.) 
 
 
Accordingly, the motion is CONTINUED to December 19, 2023 at
10:30 am in Dept. C.  The parties may request
a trial continuance in Dept. F.
