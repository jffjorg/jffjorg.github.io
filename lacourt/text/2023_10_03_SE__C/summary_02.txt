Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the 5th-10th causes of action and the motion to strike. The demurrer to the 5th-10th causes of action is OVERRULED, meaning that the Plaintiff's allegations of breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, misappropriation of trade secrets, unauthorized use of computers, computer systems, and data, fraud (concealment), fraud (misrepresentation), and unfair business practices are sufficient to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The motion to strike is GRANTED as to general, special damages, punitive damages, and treble damages in the 6th cause of action, which alleges unfair business practices. The judge has also ordered the Clerk to insert the word "restitutionary" before the word "disgorgement" at paragraph 128.

The judge has SUSTAINED Defendant Lee's demurrer to the 7th-8th causes of action, which allege intentional interference with contractual relationships and prospective economic advantage, without leave to amend. The judge has also denied further leave to amend.

The judge has OVERRULED the demurrer to the 9th and 10th causes of action, which allege fraud (concealment) and fraud (misrepresentation), respectively.
