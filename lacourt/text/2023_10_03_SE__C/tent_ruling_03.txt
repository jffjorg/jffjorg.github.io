Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
 
Defendant Sekero One, LLC moves to
compel responses to form Interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request
for production of documents pursuant to CCP §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300.
 
The operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
alleges a contract for goods (i.e. grains), causing damages of $19,500.00.  The SAC asserts causes of action for:
 
1.    Breach
of Oral Contract
2.    Breach
of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
 
CCP
§§ 2030.290(b) and 2031.300(b) allow the propounding party to file a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories and document demands if a response has not
been received.  If responses are
untimely, responding party waives objections. 
(CCP §§ 2030.290(a) and 2031.300(a).) 

 
Defendant served discovery on January 15, 2023.  (Lu Decl., ¶ 4.)  Plaintiff
failed to serve any responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories,
and document requests.  
 
In opposition, Plaintiff claims that the discovery
is premature because the complaint is not at issue.  However, the “right to discovery generally
does not depend on the status of the pleadings. 
I.e., the case need not be ‘at issue.’” 
(Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before Trial at 8:58; Mattco
Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co. (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436.)
 
Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiff Kim is ordered to serve responses
without objections within 15 days.  
 
Sanctions:  CCP §§ 2023.010(d), 2030.290(c), and
2031.300(c) authorize the court to impose sanctions for failure to respond to
discovery without substantial justification.  

 
Here,
sanctions are warranted because Plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to
discovery. The court finds Defendant’s total request of $2,580.00 is
excessive.  Instead, reduced sanctions are
imposed against Plaintiff Kim in the reasonable sum of $1,500.00 payable within
30 days.
