**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by Plaintiffs Rojas and Sanchez to compel Defendant FCA US LLC to respond to discovery requests. 

The Plaintiffs allege defects in their 2018 Jeep Renegade and filed a lawsuit against FCA, claiming breach of warranty and negligent repair. 

The Plaintiffs initially served discovery on January 19, 2023, but Defendant failed to respond in a timely manner.  As a result, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel responses and requested sanctions.

However, the Defendant ultimately served the discovery responses on July 26, 2023, making the motion to compel moot. 

Although the motion is moot, the court finds that Defendant’s failure to respond to discovery warrants sanctions.  The court reduces Plaintiffs' requested sanctions of $1,635.00 to $1,000.00, payable within 30 days.
