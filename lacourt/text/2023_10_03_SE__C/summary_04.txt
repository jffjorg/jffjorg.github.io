Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion to compel responses to form interrogatories filed by Plaintiffs Rojas and Sanchez against Defendant FCA US LLC. The motion is MOOT since Defendant has now served the required responses. However, sanctions are still warranted due to Defendant's failure to serve timely responses, which necessitated the instant motion. The court finds that a reduced sanction of $1,000.00 is reasonable and payable within 30 days.
