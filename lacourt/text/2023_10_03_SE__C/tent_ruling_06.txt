Opposing Party to give
NOTICE.
 
 
Defendants
WorldMark, The Club, and Wyndham Resort Development Corporation demurs to the 1st
– 2nd causes of action on the ground that the claims fail to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
 
Plaintiff
James Cisneros alleges that Defendants breached a written contract to utilize
certain timeshare units allotted under the January 20, 2004 contract for paid
premiums.  The Complaint asserts causes
of action for:
 
1.   
Breach
of Contract
2.   
Common
Counts
 
Request
for JUDICIAL NOTICE is granted as to Exs. 3-4, and DENIED as to Exs. 1-2.  (Evidence. Code § 452 and 453.)
 
1st
CAUSE OF ACTION
 
BREACH OF CONTRACT:
 The elements for a breach of contract
cause of action are: (1) the contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse
for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach; and (4) resulting damages.  (Reichert v. General Ins. Co. (1968)
68 Cal.2d 822, 830.)  In alleging a
breach of contract cause of action, it is necessary to specify whether the
contract is written, oral or implied by conduct.  (CCP § 430.10(g).)  To plead a written contract, a plaintiff must
do one of the following: (1) set forth the contract in haec verba; or (2) plead the contract’s legal effect by
alleging the substance of its relevant terms. 
(4 Witkin, California Procedure 4th Ed., 479-481.)  In order to plead an oral contract, a
plaintiff must plead its legal effect, i.e., allege the substance of the
contractual terms.  (Id. at 483.) 
 
Defendants
contend that they did not breach the contract because Plaintiff’s account was “suspended
and terminated following discovery of his sexual
assault
conviction for an attempted lewd act upon a child under the age of 14.”  (Demurrer, 3:5-6.)  Although Plaintiff’s conviction is judicially
noticeable, the fact that Defendants suspended Plaintiff’s account due to such
conviction and the Club Guidelines are not facts that are judicially
noticeable.  
 
As
alleged, ¶ BC-1 alleges a written contract; ¶ BC-2 alleges breach; ¶ BC-3
alleges Plaintiff’s performance, and ¶ BECAUSE-4 alleges resulting
damages.  As alleged, the demurrer is
OVERRULED.
 
2nd
CAUSE OF ACTION
 
COMMON
COUNTS:
 
MONEY
HAD AND RECEIVED: The elements are:  1)
Defendant is indebted to plaintiff in a certain sum; and 2) for money had and
received by the defendant for the use of plaintiff.  (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997)
53 Cal. App. 4th 445, 460.)
 
CC-1
alleges money had and received, and the sum of $8,000.00 is due and
unpaid.  As alleged, the demurrer is
OVERRULED.
