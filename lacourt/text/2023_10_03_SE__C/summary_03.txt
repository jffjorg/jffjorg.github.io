And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to compel responses to discovery, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents. The Plaintiff, Kim, is ordered to serve responses without objections within 15 days. The Judge has also imposed reduced sanctions of $1,500.00 payable within 30 days against the Plaintiff for failing to serve timely responses to discovery. The Plaintiff's argument that the discovery is premature because the complaint is not at issue was rejected, as the right to discovery does not depend on the status of the pleadings.
