## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of *Cisneros v. WorldMark, The Club, and Wyndham Resort Development Corporation*.  

The judge overruled the Defendants' demurrer (a legal objection) to the Plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and money had and received.  

The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants breached a written timeshare contract from 2004 by suspending his account. The Defendants claim the suspension was justified due to the Plaintiff's sexual assault conviction.  The judge found that the Plaintiff's allegations sufficiently stated a claim for breach of contract and therefore overruled the demurrer.

The Defendants are now ordered to file their formal responses, called "Answers," to the Plaintiff's complaint within 10 days.
