SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 6/7/21, Plaintiff Phyllis R. Ginolfi, by and through
her Conservator, Christin C. Solis (Plaintiff) filed this action against Right
Choice In-Home Care, Inc. and GMA Management Group, Inc. dba Pacoima Adult Day
Care for dependent adult/elder abuse and negligence.  On 3/15/23, Plaintiff filed a Doe Amendment
naming Defendant Keolis Transit America, Inc. as Doe 1 (Keolis).
 
On 6/1/23, Keolis served the subject discovery on
Plaintiff.  (Tran Decl.).  Plaintiff failed to provide timely
responses.  Id.  On 7/24/23, Plaintiff served responses which
Keolis deemed to be deficient.  Id.  After meet and confer efforts failed to
resolve the issues Keolis had with the responses, on 9/14/23, Keolis filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order compelling Plaintiff to provide
further responses to Keolis’ Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1, Nos. 1-59.  Additionally, Keolis requests sanctions
against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, Steven C.
Gambardella, in the amount of $2,400.00. 
Id.  Plaintiff has not
opposed or otherwise responded to the motion.
 
ANALYSIS
 
On receipt of responses to requests for production of
documents, the propounding party may move to compel further responses, if that
party deems a statement of compliance is incomplete, a representation of
inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete or evasive and/or an objection is
without merit or too general.  CCP
2031.310(a).  Before filing a motion for
further responses, the propounding party must attempt to informally resolve the
discovery dispute and the motion must establish good cause for the production.  CCP 2031.310(b).  
Keolis made adequate attempts to meet and confer to
informally resolve this discovery dispute before filing and serving the instant
motion.  (See Tran Decl.).  Additionally, Keolis has established good
cause for the production as the documents relate to Plaintiff’s allegations and
claims for damages in this action.   
 
Responses to requests for production are due within 30
days after service of the requests.  CCP
2031.260(a).
 
If a party fails to timely respond to a request/demand
for production, that party waives any objection to the demand, including one
based on privilege or on the protection of work product.  CCP 2031.300(a).  Since Plaintiff served responses to the
subject discovery requests well beyond the 30-day deadline, Plaintiff waived
any objections to the requests.  As such,
Plaintiffs responses to requests which include objections (i.e, responses to
Requests 1, 2, 3, 6, 44, 47, 48, 49) are deficient and further responses are
warranted.  CCP 2031.300(a).  
 
CCP 2031.230 provides: 
 
“A representation of inability to
comply with the particular demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent
search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
demand. This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is
because the particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed,
has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The statement shall
set forth the name and address of any natural person or organization known or
believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or
category of item.”
 
In response to certain of the requests (i.e., responses
to Requests 7-9, 15-22, 24-28, 36-43, 46, 53, 57), Plaintiff has responded that
no responsive documents exist without stating that a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry have been made and/or why no responsive documents exist (i.e.,
 they never existed, they were destroyed,
lost, no longer in possession or control of Plaintiff).  CCP 2031.230. 
In response to other requests (i.e., responses to Requests 4, 5, 10-14,
23, 29-35, 45, 50-52, 54-56, 58-59), Plaintiff has failed to adequately
identify responsive documents.  See
CCP 2031.280(a).  
 
Keolis is entitled to an award of sanctions against
Plaintiff and her attorney, Steven C. Gambardella, for their failure to comply
with their discovery obligations.  CCP
2023.010(e), (f), (i); CCP 2023.030; 2031.310(h).  However, the sanctions requested, $2,400.00,
are reduced to $1,200.00 (1 hour to prepare the motion + 2 hours to prepare the
separate statement + ½ hour to prepare for the hearing + ½ hour to appear = 4
hours multiplied by $300/hour).   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Further responses are due and sanctions are payable within 15 days.
