And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion filed by Defendant Keolis Transit America, Inc. (Keolis) to compel further responses from Plaintiff Phyllis R. Ginolfi. Keolis had served discovery requests on June 1, 2023, and Plaintiff failed to provide timely responses. Despite meet and confer efforts, the parties were unable to resolve the discovery dispute, and Keolis filed the motion on September 14, 2023. Plaintiff has not opposed or otherwise responded to the motion.

The court finds that Keolis has established good cause for the production of the documents, as they relate to Plaintiff's allegations and claims for damages in this action. Additionally, the court finds that Plaintiff waived any objections to the requests since Plaintiff served responses to the subject discovery requests well beyond the 30-day deadline.

The court orders that further responses are due within 15 days and sanctions are payable within the same timeframe. The court awards sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney, Steven C. Gambardella, in the amount of $1,200.00.
