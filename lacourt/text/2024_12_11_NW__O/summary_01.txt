And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, sustaining their demurrer with leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff, Timothy Best, has not adequately alleged a cause of action for medical battery against David Auerbach, M.D. The Judge found that Auerbach did not perform the shoulder block procedure without Best's consent, but rather ordered it. The Judge also noted that Best's allegations against Auerbach appear to sound in negligence, rather than battery, and that Best's first cause of action for medical malpractice already alleges Auerbach's negligence. The Judge gave Best leave to amend his Complaint on or before December 31, 2024.
