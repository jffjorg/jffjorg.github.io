I.       INTRODUCTION
This case
arises out of a shoulder injuries Plaintiff Timothy Best (“Plaintiff”)
allegedly suffered after a surgical procedure on his fingers. Plaintiff alleges
the surgery took place at Defendant Center for Orthopedic Surgery (“Center”),
was performed by Defendant David Auerbach (“Auerbach”) of Defendant Southern California
Orthopedic Institute, LP (“Institute”)(in conjunction with UCLA Health, sued as
The Regents of the University of California (“Regents”)). Plaintiff further
alleges Defendant Cassandre Casseus, CRNA (“Casseus”, erroneously served as
Ribeiro), of Defendant SCOI Anesthesia Medical Corporation (“SCOI”), assisted
Auerbach during the surgery by administering anesthesia, including an
infraclavicular shoulder block (“shoulder block”) that Plaintiff did not
consent to and that caused Plaintiff’s shoulder injuries at the heart of this
action. 
On September
4, 2024, the Court sustained Center, Auerbach, and Institute’s (“Demurring Defendants”)
Demurrer with leave to amend.
Demurring
Defendants now demurrer to

III.    LEGAL
STANDARD
A demurrer is a pleading used to test
the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not
fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading
(complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
422.10, 589(a); see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)[1] It
is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the
complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in
the complaint are assumed to be true. (See Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th
at 994.) 
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law. We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and
also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.” (Mitchell v.
California Dept. of Pub. Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007, citation
omitted.) “[T]he facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be. (Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981)
123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.) Allegations are to be liberally construed. (See
Code Civ. Proc. § 452.) A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are
stated to support the cause of action asserted. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
430.10(e).)  
“A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded.” (Id.) In testing the sufficiency of the
complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (See Blank v. Kirwan (1985)
39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence
or other extrinsic matters. (See SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (See
Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court
to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso
v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862
[disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos.
(1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court
record].) Accordingly, “[w]hether the plaintiff will be able to prove the
pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer.” (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609-10.) 
A demurrer can only be sustained when
it disposes of an entire cause of action. (See Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian
Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.) Leave to
amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The
burden is on the complainant to show the Court a pleading can be amended
successfully. (Id.) However, “[i]f there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
IV.     MEET AND CONFER
Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party
who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a),
emphasis added.) A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the
results of the meet and confer process. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a)(3).)
         Demurring Defendants filed
a declaration attesting to the parties’ telephonic meet and confer and
unsuccessful attempt to come to an informal resolution. (See Declaration
of Deena Goodman filed October 11, 2024, ¶¶
4-5.) The
Court therefore finds the parties have fulfilled their meet and confer
requirements.
V.      ANALYSIS  
A.           
Request for Judicial Notice
Demurring
Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice of Plaintiff’s Opposition to Demurring
Defendants’ Demurrer filed on June 26, 2024, is GRANTED, however, the Court takes
judicial notice of the existence of Plaintiff’s Opposition only. (See Request
for Judicial Notice, Ex. A; see also Plaintiff’s Opposition filed August
19, 2024.) The Court cannot take judicial notice of the hearsay statements
contained within Plaintiff’s prior Opposition (such as Exhibit B, attached to
Plaintiff’s Opposition). (See Johnson & Johnson v. Superior Court
(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 757, 768; Williams v. Wraxall (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 120, 130, fn. 7.)
Because
the Court does not take judicial notice of the hearsay statements contained in
Plaintiff’s prior Opposition, the Court will not further address Demurring
Defendants’ or Plaintiff’s arguments concerning Plaintiff’s prior Opposition or
its attachments. 
B.           
Plaintiff Fails to State a Medical Battery Cause
of Action Against Auerbach
The
elements of medical battery are 1) that the defendant either performed a
medical procedure without the plaintiff’s consent, or alternatively, that the
plaintiff consented to one medical procedure, but the defendant performed a
substantially different medical procedure; 2) that the plaintiff was harmed,
and 3) that the defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing the
plaintiff’s harm. (See Cobbs v. Grant (1972) 8 Cal.3d 229, 239; see
also Conte v. Girard Orthopaedic Surgeons Medical Group, Inc. (2003) 107
Cal.App.4th 1260, 1267-1268; see also Saxena v. Goffney (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 316, 324-325; see also CACI 530A [Medical Battery].)
“There
are three elements to a claim for medical battery under a violation of
conditional consent: the patient must show his consent was conditional; the
doctor intentionally violated the condition while providing treatment; and the
patient suffered harm as a result of the doctor’s violation of the condition.”
(Conte v. Girard Orthopaedic Surgeons Medical Group, Inc. (2003) 107
Cal.App.4th 1260, 1269.) 
After
this Court sustained Demurring Defendants’ prior Demurrer to Plaintiff’s eighth
cause of action for medical battery against Auerbach in his Complaint,
Plaintiff added additional allegations to his FAC: (1) “Auerbach ordered the
shoulder block.”; and (2) “Auerbach knew that Best was not informed about the
shoulder block, but none the less, Auerbach ordered the shoulder block. This
uninformed about and unconsented to shoulder block constituted a medical
battery on the part of Auerbach. Auerbach knew this shoulder block, in the
surgery was not necessary. This unnecessary shoulder block was a substantial
factor in causing best’s injuries and damages herein.” (FAC, ¶¶ 13, 71, 72.)
Demurring
Defendants again argue Plaintiff fails to allege Auerbach performed a procedure
without Plaintiff’s consent under either medical battery theory. (See Demurrer,
pg. 7.) Demurring Defendants argue there is no showing Auerbach performed a
procedure that was not consented to by Plaintiff or that Auerbach intended to
deviate from the consent given. (See id. at 7-8.) Demurring Defendants
also argue Plaintiff’s eighth cause of action is duplicative of his first,
which is for lack of informed consent. (See id. at 9.)
Plaintiff
has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for medical
battery against Auerbach. Plaintiff alleged Auerbach did not perform the
unconsented to procedure but ordered it. Battery is an intentional tort. (See
Piedra v. Dugan (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1498.) Plaintiff cannot
maintain a medical battery cause of action against Auerbach because Auerbach
did not perform the shoulder block. Auerbach could, however, be liable for
Casseus’s alleged medical battery misconduct under the “captain of the
ship” vicarious liability doctrine. (See Baumgardner v. Yusuf (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 1381, 1398-1399 (Holding that under the “captain of the ship” (or “derivative
liability”) doctrine, a surgeon is vicariously liable for misconduct by
assistant surgeons, nurses and others).) But, other than a general reference to
agency in paragraph 6 of his FAC, Plaintiff does not detail Auerbach and
Casseus’s relationship at all. It is unclear if the operating room was under Auerbach’s
control and supervision such that he could be held liable for Casseus’s alleged
misconduct. 
As
currently alleged, then, Plaintiff’s allegations against Auerbach appear to
sound in negligence, not battery, and Plaintiff’s first cause of action for
medical malpractice already alleges Auerbach’s negligence for ordering the
shoulder block. (See FAC, ¶¶ 16-22.) “Our high court has made it clear
that battery and lack of informed consent are separate causes of action. A
claim based on lack of informed consent – which sounds in negligence – arises
when the doctor performs a procedure without first adequately disclosing the
risks and alternatives. In contrast, a battery is an intentional tort that
occurs when a doctor performs a procedure without obtaining any consent.” (Saxena
v. Goffney (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 316, 324.) 
Accordingly,
the Court SUSTAINS Demurring Defendants’ Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s eighth
cause of action for medical battery WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
VI.    
CONCLUSION
Based on
the foregoing analysis, the Court
SUSTAINS Demurring Defendants’ Demurrer as to Plaintiff’s eighth cause of
action for medical battery WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.
Plaintiff
has leave to amend his Complaint on or before December 31, 2024.
         IT
IS SO ORDERED.
DATED: ­­­­­December 11, 2024
