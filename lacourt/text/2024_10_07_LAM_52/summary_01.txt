Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to object to the undertaking filed by the defendant/judgment debtors, Hooman Nissani and Babak Sarraf. The plaintiff, American Honda Finance Corporation, objects to the undertaking on three grounds: the surety is insufficient, the amount of the bond is insufficient, and the bond is otherwise insufficient because the supporting affidavit is defective.

The judge finds that the surety is insufficient because it is a single personal surety and because it is a suspended entity, 3170 Cherry Avenue Property, LLC. The judge also finds that the amount of the bond is insufficient, as it does not account for doubling the judgment and does not specify the additional amount that the court may award in attorney's fees and costs.

Finally, the judge finds that the supporting affidavit is defective because it does not separately estimate the value of the real property and does not identify the debts or liabilities. The judge concludes that the bond is insufficient and orders that a new bond with sufficient sureties and in a sufficient amount, at least $3,519,625.64, shall be given within five days.
