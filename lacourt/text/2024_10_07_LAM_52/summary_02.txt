And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint filed by Jamison Services, Inc. and Jamison Properties, Inc. against Universal Protection Service, LP (doing business as Allied Universal Security Services). Universal demurs only to Jamison's sixth cause of action for negligence, alleging that Jamison does not have sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for negligence. The judge agrees, ruling that the economic loss rule bars this claim. The economic loss rule states that there is no recovery in tort for negligently inflicted purely economic losses, and that parties must recover in contract for such losses unless they can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise. In this case, Jamison's allegations of negligent performance of services by Universal do not allege physical damage or property damage, and therefore are barred by the economic loss rule. The judge gives Jamison 20 days to amend its cross-complaint.
