  Case Number:  20STCV13190    Hearing Date:   October 7, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling:    
Plaintiff American Honda Finance
Corporation’s Motion Objecting to Undertaking Filed by Judgment Debtors
Plaintiff/judgment creditor American
Honda Finance Corporation objects under Code of Civil Procedure 995.930 to the
undertaking filed by defendants/judgment debtors Hooman Nissani and Babak
Sarraf.  
Request for Judicial Notice
            Plaintiff
requests judicial notice of four documents. 
The first document is a certificate of status issued by the California
Secretary of State indicating that 3170 Cherry Avenue Property, LLC is
“Suspended – FTB.”  (Sheldon Decl., Ex.
B.)  This document and the underlying
facts are subject to judicial notice as official acts of the State’s executive
branch.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d);
see Belen v. Ryan Seacrest Productions, LLC (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 1145,
1161, fn. 2.)  
            The
other three documents are court records in a bankruptcy proceeding and an
action in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona.  (Sheldon Decl., Exs. C-E.)  The records’ existence and legal effects are subject to judicial
notice.  (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d); Steed
v. Department of Consumer Affairs (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 112, 120.)
            Plaintiff’s requests for judicial notice are granted.
Surety
            Plaintiff
objects that “[t]he sureties are insufficient” (Code Civ. Proc., § 995.920,
subd. (a)) for two reasons.  Judgment
debtors’ notice of undertaking states the surety is “3170 Cherry Avenue
Property, LLC.”
            The
surety is insufficient because it is not an admitted insurer.  “[A] bond shall be executed by two or more
sufficient personal sureties or by one sufficient admitted surety insurer or by
any combination of sufficient personal sureties and admitted surety insurers.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 995.310.)  3170 Cherry Avenue Property, LLC does not
purport to be an admitted surety insurer. 
The declaration in support of the undertaking states it is made “in
accordance with Code of Civil Procedure Section 995.510.”  (Neyssani Decl., ¶ 1.)  That section concerns personal sureties, not admitted
surety insurers.  A single personal
surety is facially insufficient.  
            The
surety is also insufficient because 3170 Cherry Avenue Property, LLC is a
suspended business entity.  (Sheldon
Decl., Ex. B.)  Suspended entities generally
lack the power to participate in legal proceedings.  (Cal-Western Business Services, Inc. v. Corning Capital
Group (2013)
221 Cal.App.4th 304, 310.)  This
suspended LLC may not serve as a surety.
Amount
            Plaintiff
further objects that “[t]he amount of the bond is insufficient.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 995.920, subd. (b).)  An “undertaking shall be for double the
amount of the judgment or order unless given by an admitted surety insurer in
which event it shall be for one and one-half times the amount of the judgment
or order.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 917.1,
subd. (b).)  For this purpose, “[c]osts
awarded by the trial court … shall be included in the amount of the
judgment.”  (Id., subd. (d).)  This computation is “rigidly formulaic.”  (Leung v. Verdugo Hills Hospital
(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 205, 212.)  
            As
required under Code of Civil Procedure section 995.930, subdivision (a),
plaintiff provides an “estimate of the amount that would be sufficient.”  On June 25, 2024, the court entered judgment
of $899,005.42, plus costs to be set by further order.  On July 8, 2024, plaintiff served and filed a
memorandum of costs claiming $26,825.90 in expenses.  On September 17, 2024, the court granted
plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees in part and awarded $833,981.50 in
attorney fees.  The judgment therefore
totals $1,759,812.82.  Plaintiff states
the undertaking must guarantee payment of at least $3,519,625.64.  That is double the judgment.  Plaintiff is correct. 
            Defendants’
undertaking states the surety guarantees payment of “$899,005.42 and such
further additional sum as the Court may award in attorney’s fees and costs.”  It neither specifies that additional sum nor
accounts for doubling the judgment.  The
amount of the undertaking is therefore insufficient.
Other Grounds
            Finally,
plaintiff objects that “[t]he bond, from any other cause, is
insufficient.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
995.920, subd. (c).)  
            Plaintiff
shows the bond is insufficient because the supporting affidavit does not meet
the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 995.520, subdivision
(c).  That subdivision provides that, for
sureties exceeding $5,000, the affidavit must include: “(1) A description
sufficient for identification of real and personal property of the surety
situated in this state and the nature of the surety’s interest therein that
qualifies the surety on the bond.  [¶] (2) The
surety’s best estimate of the fair market value of each item of property.  [¶] (3) A statement of any charge or
lien and its amount, known to the surety, whether of public record or not,
against any item of property.  [¶] (4) Any
other impediment or cloud known to the surety on the free right of possession,
use, benefit, or enjoyment of the property.”
            The
affidavit in support of the undertaking states, “3170 Cherry Avenue Property,
LLC, at the time herein was worth at least $3,000,000 in assets and holds the
real property commonly known as 3170 Cherry Avenue, Long Beach, California
90230.  The value of that real property,
net of any debts and liabilities, exceeds $3,000,000.”  (Neyssani Decl., ¶ 3.)  The declaration purports to summarize the
equity in the property but does not separately estimate the value of the real
property (Code Civ. Proc., § 995.520, subd. (c)(2)) and identify the debts or
liabilities (id., subds. (c)(3) & (4)).  
            Plaintiff
also shows the bond is insufficient because the supporting affidavit is not
true.  On July 26, 2024, 3170 Cherry
Avenue Property, LLC, submitted a summary of its assts and liabilities, and
accompanying schedule forms, in a bankruptcy proceeding.  (Sheldon Decl., Ex. D.)  The summary states the LLC’s assets totaled
$4,451,334.29 and its liabilities totaled $11,011,167.16.  (Id., p. 1.)  The net amount is therefore negative $6.5
million.  Houshang Neyssani executed the
filing under penalty of perjury as the LLC’s managing member.  (Id., p. 24.)  
The affidavit in support of the
undertaking, meanwhile, states the LLC is worth at least $3,000,000.  (Neyssani Decl., ¶ 3.)  That would mean that, in less than two
months, the LLC acquired $9.5 million to offsets its prior net liability of
$6.5 million.  That is not credible.  Judgment debtors fail to show any evidence showing
that occurred.  The court finds 3170
Cherry Avenue Property, LLC does not have sufficient assets to guarantee the
required payment. 
Disposition
            Plaintiff/judgment
creditor American Honda Finance Corporation’s motion objecting to undertaking is
granted.  
The court hereby determines that
the bond defendants/judgment debtors filed on September 18, 2024, is
insufficient.  Under Code of Civil
Procedure 995.960, subdivision (b)(1), the court specifies that the bond is
insufficient because: (I) the surety is insufficient because it is a single
personal surety and because it is a suspended entity, (II) the amount is
insufficient, and (III) the bond is otherwise insufficient because the
supporting affidavit is defective.  The
court hereby orders that a
bond with sufficient sureties and in a sufficient amount, at least
$3,519,625.64, shall be given within five days.
