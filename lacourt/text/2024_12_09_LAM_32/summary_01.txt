And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas' motion for sanctions against Plaintiff Jane Doe. The motion is based on Plaintiff's failure to comply with a court order to provide further responses to discovery requests. However, the judge has denied the motion because Defendant failed to identify the specific discovery requests that are purportedly missing. The judge has previously ordered Plaintiff to provide responses by February 23, 2024, and Plaintiff did not comply. The judge has concluded that a lesser sanction is sufficient to curb the misuse of the discovery process and has denied the motion for sanctions.
