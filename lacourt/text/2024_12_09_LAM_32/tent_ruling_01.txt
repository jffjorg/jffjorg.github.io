  Case Number:  BC561868    Hearing Date:   December 9, 2024    Dept:  32      JANE DOE,                         Plaintiff,             v.   LUIS DIAZ ROJAS,                          Defendant.           Case No.:  22STCV41020   Hearing Date:  December 9, 2024        [TENTATIVE]    order RE: defendant’s motion for sanctions                 BACKGROUND             On December 30, 2022, Plaintiff Jane  Doe filed this action against Defendant Luis Diaz Rojas stemming from an  alleged sexual assault.              On November 6, 2023, the Court  granted Defendant’s motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories  and requests for production, ordering Plaintiff to provide further responses  within 15 days. Plaintiff did not provide responses within 15 days, prompting Defendant  to file a motion for sanctions. The Court denied this motion on January 19,  2024 but ordered Plaintiff to produce responses by February 23, 2024.              On November 12, 2024, Defendant  filed the instant motion for sanctions based on Plaintiff’s purported failure  to abide by the January 19, 2024 order.  LEGAL STANDARD The Court may impose monetary or  nonmonetary sanctions against a party engaging in misuse of the discovery  process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) Misuse of the discovery process is  defined as, among other things, failing to respond to an authorized method of  discovery, making an evasive response to discovery, or disobeying a court order  for discovery. (Id., § 2023.010.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb  misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing misuses of the discovery  process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until the sanction is reached  that will curb the abuse. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174  Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “The penalty should be appropriate to the dereliction,  and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the  party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Wilson v. Jefferson (1985) 163  Cal.App.3d 952, 959.) Generally, two facts are prerequisite to the imposition  of nonmonetary sanctions: (1) there must be a failure to comply with a court  order; and (2) the failure must be willful. (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp.  (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.) Abuse of discovery may additionally be  treated as a contempt of court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030(e).)  DISCUSSION             Defendant contends that Plaintiff  has not served further responses after the Court’s January 19, 2024 order.  (Koorenny Decl. ¶ 6.) However, Defendant fails to identify the specific discovery  requests that are purportedly missing.            CONCLUSION             Defendant’s motion for sanctions is DENIED.
