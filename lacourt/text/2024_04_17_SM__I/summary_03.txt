  - "That is not this court's concern unless there was something unusual and unique about that case."
  - "Any prejudice is of the parties' own making."
  - "The court assumes that 11 of 12 will settle or resolve without trial, and that seems to the court to be realistic."
  - "If the court continues this case for four months, it means that another case—where the parties worked diligently and are ready for trial—will be bumped."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial due to alleged conflicts and lack of preparedness. The judge did not find good cause to continue the trial, citing the plaintiff's counsel's failure to disclose conflicts earlier, lack of diligence in completing discovery and mediation, and failure to explain the exact dollar figure of the lien. The judge also noted that the court's trial calendar is severely congested and that continuing the trial would mean bumping another case. The judge reminded the parties that the FSC and trial dates remain on the calendar and that failure to submit FSC documents on time will result in sanctions.
