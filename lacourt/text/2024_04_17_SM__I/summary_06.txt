And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling holds the defense's fee motion in abeyance until the appellate court rules on the Special Motion to Strike (SMS) order. The court believes it is more efficient to await the appellate court's ruling to determine the amount of fees recoverable, rather than holding a hearing to parse out the fees. The court will set a status conference approximately 270 days from now, which will also be the technical continued hearing date. However, the court is unlikely to decide the motion at that time, and will instead allow the defense to re-file the motion if the court's ruling is changed on appeal.
