And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a demurrer filed by the defendant. The demurrer was filed after the allowed time, and even if the court were to overlook this delay, the demurrer would still be overruled on its merits. The defendant argues that the property is subject to the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, but this is not a demurrer's proper office. The complaint alleges that the property is not subject to the act, and the court cannot go outside the pleadings. Additionally, the defendant argues that the notice was improper, but the complaint alleges that the notice was properly served and attaches a proof of service. The court finds the defendant's arguments unpersuasive. The defendant has five calendar days to answer.
