 Case Number:  23SMCV01468    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for three things: (1) a motion to quash
service on personal jurisdiction basis; (2) an OSC re: Dismissal (Settlement)
as to one defendant; and (3) a CMC as to the remaining defendants.  As to the motion to quash, the court believes
it is mis-calendared, as plaintiff has settled with the moving party.  As to the OSC, the court will inquire.
 
As to the CMC, the matter appears to be at issue and the
court will hold the conference.
