The court appreciates the defendant's willingness to work with the plaintiff on this issue. The court will discuss a new trial date with the parties and is unsure whether fact discovery will continue. If the parties stipulate to continue fact discovery, the court will not intervene. The court will also extend expert discovery deadlines, as the plaintiff may be changing experts.
