 Case Number:  23SMCV03964    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  I The demurrer is OVERRULED and the motion to strike is
DENIED.  As the court said at the last
hearing, the failure to respond to a medical provider’s request for records
when plaintiff is the in ER because the defendant is trying to cover up
malpractice is, if that is true and proven, sufficient to warrant intentional
infliction of emotional distress.  The
court believes that such conduct is indeed outrageous.  Of course, being a demurrer, the court must
assume the allegations to be true.  Those
are serious accusations being made and plaintiff will have to prove them to
recover.  But proof is not required at
the pleading stage.
 
Defendant has 30 days to answer.
 
Although the demurrer was overruled, the court cautions
plaintiff’s counsel.  Counsel filed its
opposition yesterday.  The court has not
read it and it is STRICKEN.  The
opposition to the last demurrer was also untimely.  Plaintiff’s counsel seems to have a habit of
this.  The court, at this point, will
assume this is a tactical decision by counsel to gain an unfair advantage over
the defense.  Accordingly, the court will
be disinclined to give plaintiff’s counsel any leeway over late filings in the
future, including late responses to discovery. 
This is a poor tactic, and if indeed it is counsel’s tactic, it is
unethical.  If further evidence of it is
seen, the court will be forced to take appropriate action.
 
On the other hand, it is possible that counsel simply
mis-calendared the dates (twice).  If
that is the case, then it is an accident that, as it turns out, harmed no
one.  If counsel ups its game to pay more
attention to deadlines, then this problem will not recur and the issue can be
put behind us.  That is the court’s hope.
