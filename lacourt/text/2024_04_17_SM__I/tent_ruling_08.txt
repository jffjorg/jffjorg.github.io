 Case Number:  23SMCV04403    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  I The motion to be relieved is GRANTED.  The court will sign the order, which will be
effective upon filing of the proof of service on the client.  Counsel should take care to assure that the
client is aware that the answer will be stricken eventually if defendant does
not retain new counsel.  While there are
no dates on the calendar until August 2025, the matter remains of some
urgency.
