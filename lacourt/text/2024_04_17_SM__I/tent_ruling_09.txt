 Case Number:  24SMCV00401    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  I The demurrer is OVERRULED. 
First, the demurrer is untimely. 
While a defendant may demur in an unlawful detainer case, the demurrer
must be filed within five days after service of the summons. This demurrer was
filed after that.  However, even were the
court to overlook that delay, the demurrer would be OVERRULED on its
merits.  Defendants claim that the
demurrer is improper because the property is subject to the Tenant Protection
Act of 2019.  But that is not a
demurrer’s proper office.  The complaint
alleges that the property is not subject to that act, and on demurrer, the
court cannot go outside the pleadings. 
(Plaintiff also contends that the allegation is true because the
property in question is a single family home, and such properties are not
covered by the act.)  Defendant also
contends that the notice was improper. 
But the complaint alleges that the notice was properly served and the
complaint attaches a proof of service. 
In short, defendants’ arguments are not persuasive.
 
Defendant has five calendar days to answer.
