And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has ruled that the demurrer is overruled and the motion to strike is denied. The court finds that the defendant's failure to respond to a medical provider's request for records, allegedly to cover up malpractice, is sufficient to warrant intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court believes that such conduct is outrageous. The plaintiff will have to prove these allegations to recover. The defendant has 30 days to answer. The court cautions the plaintiff's counsel for filing oppositions late, and warns that further late filings will not be tolerated.
