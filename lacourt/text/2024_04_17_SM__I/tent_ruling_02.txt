 Case Number:  21STCV07661    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  I The court is relatively tight-fisted when it comes to trial
continuances.  However, plaintiff here
has established good cause given his medical situation.  In light of that, the court is inclined to
GRANT the motion to continue.  The court
appreciates defendant’s willingness to work with plaintiff on this issue.
 
The court will discuss a new trial date with the
parties.  The court is unsure whether the
parties intend to continue fact discovery or not.  The court is inclined not to do so, but if
the parties stipulate that fact discovery should be continued, the court will
not get in the way.  The court
understands that expert discovery deadlines will be continued, in part because
plaintiff might be changing experts. 
(The court says “might be” because the court is unsure whether
plaintiff’s current expert is unavailable forever or only given the current
trial date.  But either way, it appears
that the parties want the expert cut-off to be extended.)
 
On a different note, the court hopes for a good outcome on
the medical front.
