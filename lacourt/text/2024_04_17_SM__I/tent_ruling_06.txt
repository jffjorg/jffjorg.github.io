 Case Number:  23SMCV03553    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for a fee motion brought by the defense
following the partial grant of their Special Motion to Strike (SMS).  Parties bringing a successful SMS are
entitled to fees.  Where the motion is
only partially successful, only fees for the successful part are
recoverable.  That is the case here.
 
However, all parties have appealed the court’s ruling.  The court believes that the best path is to
await the appellate court’s ruling on the SMS order.  At that point, the court and the parties will
know what parts of the motion were ultimately successful and what parts were
not.  That is far more efficient than to
hold a hearing now to try and parse out the proper amount of fees only to risk
having to do it all over again if the appellate court modifies this court’s
ruling.
 
The court suspects that the parties are in agreement with
that approach. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is HELD IN ABEYANCE/CONTINUED.  The court will set a status conference
approximately 270 days from now, which will also be the technical continued
hearing date.  However, the court is
unlikely to decide the motion at that time. 
Even if the appeal is concluded by then, the court would more anticipate
allowing the defense to re-file the motion if the court’s ruling was in any
material way changed, and even if it were affirmed in full, the court would set
a briefing schedule to allow for an opposition and reply.  The CMC is taken off calendar in favor of the
status conference.
