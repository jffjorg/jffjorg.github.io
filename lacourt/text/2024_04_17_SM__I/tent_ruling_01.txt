  Case Number:  21SMCV01627    Hearing Date:   April 17, 2024    Dept:  I This is a request by a judgment creditor—Blaine Holdings—to
advance its motion to require that its lien be satisfied from the proceeds of
any judgment received from the current hearing date of May 23, 2024, to the
current prove-up date of May 7, 2024. 
The court sees no harm in that, and is inclined to GRANT the
request.  However, the court will inquire
as to whether the amount still outstanding is $380,000 in light of the sums
recovered by Vivera through the settlement. 
The court recalls that the parties (other than Girardi) informed the
court that they had settled.  The court
noted that in a minute order.  Blaine
Holdings objected to the settlement, at least to the extent that money went
directly to Vivera, but the settlement never came to the court for
approval.  Rather, the other parties
simply dismissed their actions against one another.  The court does not know if money changed
hands or not and the court has no idea what the settlement’s terms were or
are.  Indeed, it is entirely possible
that upon receipt of Blaine Holding’s objection, the parties simply elected to
forego litigation entirely.  On the other
hand, it could be that Vivera recovered some money and has reached an accord on
the division of that money with Blaine Holdings.  (In fact, that may be why the judgment has
been reduced.)
 
In any event, the court is likely for now simply to advance
the hearing date and make a general inquiry. 
But the court will not spend over-long on the inquiry part.
