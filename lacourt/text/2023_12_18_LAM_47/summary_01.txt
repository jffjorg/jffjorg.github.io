And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motions to compel further responses to form interrogatories from Cross-Defendant Mansour Bennouna and Plaintiff. The motions were filed late and fail to meet the required filing deadlines. The Court has also ordered the defendants to pay an additional $120 in filing fees within 5 days of the date of this order. The Court finds that the defendants' attempts to combine multiple motions into a single filing are improper and unfair, and that the 45-day time limit for filing a motion to compel further responses is mandatory and jurisdictional.
