DISCUSSION:
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses To Form
Interrogatories From Mansour Bennouna
 
            Defendants
move to compel further responses to form interrogatories propounded to
Cross-Defendant Mansour Bennouna. 
 
Multiple Motions
 
Defendant improperly filed a single
motion pertaining to two sets of discovery propounded to Cross-Defendant
Bennouna. 
 
Multiple motions should not be
combined into a single filing.¿(See¿Govt. Code,¿§ 70617(a)(4) [setting forth
the required filing fee for each motion, application, or any other paper or
request requiring a hearing];¿see¿also¿Weil & Brown, Civil Procedure Before
Trial, [8:1140.1] at 8F-60 (The Rutter Group 2011)¿[“Motions to compel
compliance with separate discovery requests ordinarily should be filed
separately.”].) Defendant should have reserved two separate hearings for two
separate motions to compel further responses. 
 
Combining multiple motions under
the guise of one motion with one hearing reservation manipulates the Court
Reservation System and unfairly jumps ahead of other litigants. Moreover,
combining motions to avoid payment of separate filing fees deprives the Court
of filing fees it is otherwise entitled to collect.
 
Accordingly, the Court orders
Defendant to pay an additional $60 in filing fees within 5 days of the date of
this order. 
 
Legal Standards
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to an interrogatory when the
court finds that: “(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete[;] (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section
2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is
inadequate[; or] (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too
general.”
 
The burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure
to fully answer the interrogatories. Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.
 
Timeliness
 
A
motion to compel a further response must be noticed within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental response, or on or before
any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding party
have agreed in writing.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(c),
2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.) Otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel further responses. (Id.) The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.
App. 4th 1403, 1410.)
 
The
proof of service attached to the discovery responses under penalty of perjury
states that Cross-Defendant’s responses were served by mail on September 7,
2023, even though they were not received until September 14, 2023. (Declaration
of Tiffany Scarborough ISO Mot. ¶ 5 Exhs. D-E.) Thus, the deadline to file this
motion, accounting for a five-day extension for mail service under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1013, was Friday, October 27, 2023. There is no
evidence that the parties agreed to any extension of the filing deadline for
this motion, and the motion was not filed until November 3, 2023. This motion
is therefore untimely, and the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear it. 
 
Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motions to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories from
Cross-Defendant Mansour Bennouna are DENIED.

Interrogatories from Plaintiff

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
