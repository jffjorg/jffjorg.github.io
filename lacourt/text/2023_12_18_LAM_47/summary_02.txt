And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Berenice Ceja v. Rahn Industries, Inc., et al. (Case No. 22STCV23140). The case involves an employment discrimination action filed by Berenice Ceja against Rahn Industries, Inc. and others. Ceja alleges that she was subjected to extensive sexual harassment and retaliation for complaining about the harassment, culminating in her termination.

Ceja moves to compel Eligo Rodriguez, one of the defendants, to appear for a deposition and requests sanctions. The Judge has denied Ceja's motion to compel deposition as moot, as the deposition was conducted on November 29, 2023, after the motion was filed. The Judge has also denied Ceja's request for sanctions.

The Judge found that Ceja had satisfied her statutory meet and confer obligations, but determined that imposing sanctions on Rodriguez would be unjust. The Judge noted that the purpose of discovery sanctions is to prevent abuse of the discovery process and correct the problem presented, not to punish or penalize parties. Since Rodriguez provided deposition dates within an hour of the motion being filed and then followed through by sitting for the deposition, the Judge determined that the problem was corrected and imposing sanctions would be unnecessary punishment.

The Judge's tentative ruling will be sent to all parties and may be modified or adopted at the hearing on December 18, 2023.
