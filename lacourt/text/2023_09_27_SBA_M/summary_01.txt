And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) by plaintiffs David Crockett and Tamicka Oliver against defendant PK3C, LLC. The plaintiffs are seeking to add a 10th cause of action for alter ego liability and an 11th cause of action for intentional misrepresentation, and to delete the original prayer and add a new one. The judge finds that the motion is timely and proper, and that the plaintiffs have been dilatory in seeking leave to amend, but that the delay has not caused prejudice to the defendant. The judge also finds that the proposed amendments comply with California Rules of Court and that the defendant has not shown that the amendments would be futile. Therefore, the judge grants the motion and orders that the plaintiffs give notice of the ruling.
