The judge also finds that the proposed amendments comply with California Rules of Court and that the defendant has not shown that the amendments would be futile. Therefore, the judge grants the motion and orders that the plaintiffs give notice of the ruling.

## English Summary

The judge is granting the Plaintiffs' request to amend their complaint.  While the judge acknowledges that the Plaintiffs were somewhat delayed in filing their motion to amend, they found that the Defendant had not been prejudiced by the delay. 

The Plaintiffs are seeking to add two new causes of action: one for "alter ego" liability against the owners and members of the Defendant, PK3C, LLC, and another for intentional misrepresentation. The Plaintiffs argue that these causes of action are necessary because the Defendant has no insurance and has allegedly engaged in deceptive practices.


The judge is allowing the Plaintiffs to amend the complaint despite some potential timeliness concerns.

Summary:
The case concerns a motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) by plaintiffs David Crockett and Tamicka Oliver against defendant PK3C, LLC. The plaintiffs seek to add two causes of action and delete the original prayer. The defendant opposes the motion. The plaintiffs argue that they were not dilatory in seeking leave to amend, while the defendant argues that they were. The defendant also argues that the proposed 11th cause of action is time-barred and that the proposed new defendants are not proper parties. The court finds that plaintiffs' counsel's declaration complies with CRC Rule 3.1324(b), but that plaintiffs have been dilatory in seeking leave to amend. However, the court also finds that defendant has not shown prejudice. The court grants the motion but declines to find that the proposed cause of action for intentional misrepresentation would be futile at this stage.
