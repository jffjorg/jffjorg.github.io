COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:       
Demurrer
  - with Motion to Strike (CCP 430.10)



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
The Demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the Motion to Strike is
denied as moot.


I. BACKGROUND
 
A. Factual
 
The following facts are drawn from the First Amended Complaint (as defined
below).
 
On September 26, 2017, Parvaneh Azmoon (“Plaintiff”) obtained a home equity
line of credit (the “Mortgage”) on her residential real property (the
“Property”) from MUFG Union Bank, N.A. (“MUFG”), of which U.S. Bank National
Association (“Defendant”) became the successor by merger. The Mortgage was
secured by a Deed of Trust, which was recorded in second position against the
Property.
 
In July 2020, Plaintiff applied to MUFG for a loss mitigation modification.
MUFG denied the application, determining that Plaintiff was ineligible because she
did not have sufficient income. Plaintiff appealed. MUFG denied Plaintiff’s
appeal.
 
In October 2021, Plaintiff again applied for a loss mitigation
modification, and again, MUFG denied the application for the same reasons. In
December 2021, MUFG approved Plaintiff for a repayment plan, but the payments
thereunder were “twice as much” as her existing payments.
 
Plaintiff applied two more times for a loss mitigation modification—in
January 2022 and in the summer of 2022. Each time, MUFG determined Plaintiff to
be ineligible therefore and denied the application. 
 
On April 20, 2022, Plaintiff was notified that her line of credit was being
frozen due to unsatisfactory credit performance.
 
On October 17, 2022, Plaintiff was notified that her debt was being
accelerated. At the time, she was less than 90 days delinquent.
 
In December 2022, Plaintiff ran her own credit report, which showed an
average credit score of 719.66.
 
B. Procedural
 
On August 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against MUFG alleging one
cause of action for violations of Business and Professions Code § 17200 et
seq. Defendant demurred and filed a motion to strike. Plaintiff opposed the
demurrer and the motion to strike, and Defendant replied to the opposition to
the motion to strike. 
 
On October 25, 2023, this court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend
and found the motion to strike thereby mooted. 
 
On November 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint (the “First
Amended Complaint” or the “FAC”). On January 11, 2024, Defendant filed a
demurrer (the “Demurrer”) and a motion to strike (the “Motion to Strike”). On
January 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition (the “Opposition”) to the
Demurrer, and on February 5, 2024, Defendant filed a reply to the Opposition.
Plaintiff did not oppose the Motion to Strike.
 
II. MOVING PARTY’S GROUNDS FOR THE DEMURRER 
            
Defendant demurs to the FAC on the grounds that it fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against it. 
            
III. ANALYSIS 
 
The Demurrer
 
                        Demurrers
Generally
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent
on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not
the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab,
Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs.
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
“[T]he pleadings set the boundaries of the issues to be resolved at summary
judgment. A plaintiff cannot bring up new, unpleaded issues in his or her
opposing papers.” (Oakland Raiders v. National Football League (2005)
131 Cal.App.4th 621, 648 (internal citations and quote marks omitted).) The
same is true of pleadings subject to a demurrer. “Because a demurrer challenges defects on
the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside the pleading that are subject to judicial notice.”
(Arce v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471,
482.)
 
                        Cal. Bus.
& Prof. C. § 17200 a/k/a The Unfair Competition Law
 
Cal. Bus. & Prof. C. § 17200 et seq. (the “UCL”) “broadly
prohibits ‘any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and
unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising….’ Because the statute is
framed in the disjunctive, a business practice need only meet one of the three
criteria to be considered unfair competition. Therefore, an act or practice is ‘unfair
competition’ under the UCL if it is forbidden by law or, even if not
specifically prohibited by law, is deemed an unfair act or practice.” (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1359 (internal citations
omitted).) 
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s actions are each of unlawful, unfair, and
fraudulent: unlawful because of its loan modification policies, unfair because
those actions included “negligent servicing and blaming Plaintiff for their own
mistakes,” and fraudulent because MUFG’s failure to "give Plaintiff a
determination for a prolonged period of time” put Plaintiff “reasonably under
the impression that she would be granted alternatives to foreclosure.” (Opposition
p. 5.) 
 
                        “Unlawful”
Criterion
 
“An ‘unlawful’ business practice or act within the meaning of the UCL is an
act or practice, committed pursuant to business activity, that is at the same
time forbidden by law.” (Bernardo v. Planned Parenthood
Federation of America (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 322, 351.) “By proscribing ‘any
unlawful’ business practice, [the UCL] borrows violations of other laws
and treats them as unlawful practices that
the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.”
(Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999)
20 Cal.4th 163, 180.) A plaintiff may “fail[] to meet her burden of stating and
substantiating a legally sufficient claim of unlawfulness” by “fail[ing] to
identify any statutory, regulatory or decisional law that [the defendant]
allegedly violated.” (Bernardo v. Planned Parenthood Federation of America,
supra, at 352 (citing Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82,
88).)
 
Here, Plaintiff fails to meet her burden of stating and substantiating a
legally sufficient claim of unlawfulness because the FAC does not identify any
law that Defendant violated other than the UCL.
 
“Unfair” Criterion
 
As this court held in its October 25, 2023 ruling on the prior demurrer in
this case, “unfair” in the context of consumer cases under the UCL may be
determined by one of three tests: either the narrower test set out by Cel-Tech
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th
163, 186–87, which Defendant urges us to apply, or the broader tests described
by Camacho v. Automobile Club of Southern California (2006) 142
Cal.App.4th 1394, 1401–03. The Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles
Cellular Telephone Co. test requires that “any finding of unfairness to
competitors under [the UCL] be tethered to some legislatively declared policy
or proof of some actual or threatened impact on competition.” (supra,
at 86–87.) In other words, “unfair” “means conduct that threatens an incipient
violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those
laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the
law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.” (Id. at
87.) The first Camacho v. Automobile Club of Southern California test
comprises three factors: “(1) whether the practice, without necessarily having
been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been
established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise—whether, in other words,
it is within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other
established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical,
oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to
consumers (or competitors or other businessmen).” (supra, at fn. 10
(quoting People v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc. (1984) 159
Cal.App.3d 509, 530).) The second Camacho v. Automobile Club of Southern
California test borrows from the factors that define unfairness under
section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and requires “(1) the consumer
injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any
countervailing benefits to consumers or competition; and (3) it must be an
injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.” (Id.
at 1403.) Plaintiff improperly relies on an unpublished case, Zuniga v. Bank
of America, N.A., 2014 WL 7156403 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 9, 2014), to argue for
application here of the second Camacho v. Automobile Club of Southern California
test. (FAC ¶ 49.)
 
Moreover, in its October 25, 2023, this court held that “[a]bsent a legal
duty or statutory duty, [a] complaint does not show that the business practice
is actionable under the unfair[ness] [criterion].” (Notice of Ruling Exh. “A”
p. 2.) And, this court held that, per the California Supreme Court, “a lender
has no statutory duty of care to treat a loan modification with due care for a [home
equity line of credit] loan nor does a lender have any legal duty to ‘process,
review, and respond carefully and completely to Plaintiff's loan modification
applications.’” (Ibid. (citing Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 922, reh'g denied (June 1, 2022)).) However, “a lender
does owe a duty to a borrower to not make material misrepresentations about the
status of an application for a loan modification.” (Lueras v. BAC
Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 68.) “It is foreseeable
that a borrower might be harmed by an inaccurate or untimely communication…about
the status of a loan modification application, and the
connection between the misrepresentation and the injury suffered could be very
close.” (Id. at 69.)
 
The FAC fails to plead any facts that show unfair acts by Defendant under
the UCL under any of the three tests. Plaintiff argues that the FAC pleads “MUFG’S
business acts and practices, includ[ing], but [] not limited to, the following:
(1) prolonged loan modification review to generate unwarranted fees; (2)
seeking to collect, and collecting, various improper fees, costs and charges,
that are either not legally due under the mortgage contract or California law,
or that are in excess of amounts legally due; (3) mishandling borrowers’ loan
documentation, and (4) dual-tracking.” (Opposition p. 5.) However, contrary to
this contention, the FAC does not plead any facts about fees, so we do not
consider those contentions. As far as “mishandling borrowers’ loan
documentations,” the FAC alleges that Defendant denied Plaintiff’s applications
for loan modifications and related appeals multiple times without providing her
sufficient explanation as to why these denials were being made, from which she
infers that the denials were based on “incorrect” grounds and “false numbers” that
“disregard[ed] facts about Plaintiff’s true income and [net present value]
numbers.” (FAC ¶ 28, 37, 44.) The FAC argues that “the information
provided to Plaintiff was certainly misleading and not consistent as to the
status of the loan modification and what she was supposed to do to satisfy the
lender’s demands.” (FAC ¶ 47.) However, the FAC does not plead any facts
to show that Defendant was obligated to provide a more specific explanation for
its denials nor that Defendant was obligated to approve her loan modification
based on the numbers that Plaintiff provides. Plaintiff does not allege any
material misrepresentations of fact made by Defendant, nor a causal
relationship between any untimeliness of her loan modification applications and
her injury suffered. We therefore fail to find that these allegations as pled
meet any of the tests for unfairness under the UCL. “Dual tracking” refers to
the prohibited practice by a mortgage lender of simultaneously proceeding with
a foreclosure while also considering the borrower’s application for a loan
modification or other alternatives to foreclosure. (Valbuena v. Ocwen Loan
Servicing, LLC (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 1267, 1269 (citing Cal. Civ.
C. § 2923.6).) While dual tracking does violate the UCL, Cal. Civ. C.
§ 2923.6 refers only to first lien mortgages. (Cal. Civ. C. § 2923.6;
Majd v. Bank of America, N.A. (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 1293, 1302.) It is
therefore inapplicable here.
 
Moreover, the FAC does not allege any legal duty or statutory duty owed to
Plaintiff by Defendant. 
 
“Fraudulent” Criterion
 
“The “fraud” [criterion] of [the UCL] is unlike common law fraud
or deception.” Podolsky v. First Healthcare Corp. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
632, 647.) “In order to state a cause of action under the fraud prong of the
UCL a plaintiff need not show that he or others were actually deceived or
confused by the conduct or business practice in question.” (Schnall v. Hertz
Corp. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1144, 1167 (quoted by Buller v. Sutter
Health (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 981, 986).) “Instead, it is only necessary to
show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.” (Podolsky
v. First Healthcare Corp., supra, at 648 (emphasis added).) 
 
Here, Plaintiff argues she has pled fraudulent conduct because of her own
reasonable beliefs from and about Defendant’s conduct, but her own belief is
not an element of fraud under the UCL. The FAC does not plead any facts to show
that members of the public are likely to be deceived, so it does not
plead any facts to show fraudulent acts by Defendant under the UCL.
 
                        Standing
 
“[O]nly plaintiffs who have suffered actual damage may pursue a private UCL
action. A private plaintiff must make a twofold showing: he or she must
demonstrate injury in fact and a loss of money or property
caused by unfair competition.” (Peterson v. Cellco Partnership (2008)
164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1590.) To show economic injury from unfair competition, a
plaintiff may, by example, “(1) surrender in a transaction more, or acquire in
a transaction less, than he or she otherwise would have; (2) have a present or
future property interest diminished; (3) be deprived of money or property
to which he or she has a cognizable claim; or (4) be required to enter into a
transaction, costing money or property, that would otherwise have been
unnecessary.” (Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310,
323.) A plaintiff has standing to sue under the UCL when a bank forecloses on
his home while he has a loan modification application pending because the loss
of the home is clear injury in fact and the possibility that the plaintiff
could have proven eligibility to modify his loan is sufficient causation. (Majd
v. Bank of America, N.A., supra, at 1304.) However, a borrower continuing
to make payments on a loan does not constitute detrimental reliance because the
borrower already had the obligation to make those payments. (Lueras v. BAC
Home Loan Servicing, LP, supra, at 79, 82.) Moreover, “[p]laintiffs
cannot establish standing to pursue a UCL claim based on expenses incurred in
order to bring their UCL claim. If they could, the requirement that individuals
show they lost money or property ‘as a result’ of the challenged practice in
order to have standing to sue under the UCL would be meaningless.” (Robinson
v. HSBC Bank USA (2010) 732 F.Supp.2d 976, 988.)
 
Here, Plaintiff fails to show sufficient economic injury to have standing
to sue under the UCL. Plaintiff has not, for example, lost her home through
foreclosure. Rather, Plaintiff alleges that, had she received the loan
modification she applied for and for which she alleges she was wrongfully
denied, she would have paid less in monthly payments and interest, plus she
would have avoided the costs of bringing this suit. (FAC ¶ 48.) However,
her continuing to pay the agreed-to payments and interest on her loan is not an
economic injury. And, Plaintiff cannot rely upon her costs of bringing the suit
to establish standing. Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to show sufficient
economic injury to establish standing under the UCL.
 
                        Leave to
Amend
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the
plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC
(2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) “If there is any reasonable possibility that
the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman
v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245). 
 
Here, we do not see any possibility that Plaintiff can cure her lack of
standing to sue under the UCL.
 
Accordingly, this court SUSTAINS the Demurrer without leave to amend.
 
The Motion to
Strike
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter
inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id. at § 436(b).) The grounds for a
motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper
matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. at § 436.) The grounds for moving to
strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id. at § 437.)
 
Defendant moves to strike Plaintiff’s prayer for monetary damages and
disgorgement of profits on the grounds that such cannot be recovered from a
cause of action for violations of Cal. Bus. & Prof. C. § 17200 et seq.

 
“[T]he remedies available to private individuals for violation of the UCL
are limited to restitution and injunctive
relief; damages cannot be recovered.” (Graham v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 609–10.) Disgorgement of profits
is only available as a remedy under the UCL to the extent that it is
restitutitonary and the plaintiff has an ownership interest in the money it
seeks to recover from defendants. (Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.
(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1147–49.)
 
The monetary damages and non-restitutionary disgorgement of profits that
Plaintiff seeks are therefore not available remedies to Plaintiff in this
action. However, because we have sustained the Demurrer, the Motion to Strike
is rendered moot.
 
Accordingly, this court DENIES the Motion to Strike as moot. 
 
III. Conclusion
 
Therefore, the Demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, and the Motion
to Strike is denied as moot.
