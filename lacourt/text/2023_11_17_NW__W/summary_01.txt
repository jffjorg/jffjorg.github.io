And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to change the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to Ventura County. The defendant, Marilyn Dishell, argued that the incident occurred in Ventura County and that she resides in San Bernardino County, not Los Angeles County. The judge agreed with the defendant, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 397, which allows for a change of venue when the court designated in the complaint is not the proper court. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's alleged injuries occurred in Ventura County, which further supports the defendant's motion. The case will now be transferred to the Superior Court of Ventura County, California.
