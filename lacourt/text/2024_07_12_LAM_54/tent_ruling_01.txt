BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff Spring Towers, LLC filed this unlawful detainer action against
Defendant Jacob Carlson on April 22, 2024.
 
On May 28, 2024, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s application to serve the summons and complaint by posting
it at the subject premises and mailing it to the same address. Plaintiff later
attested that it effected service by posting on June 5, 2024. 
 
On June 18, 2024, Defendant
filed a motion to quash service, claiming Plaintiff failed to serve the summons
and complaint in the manner required by the Code of Civil Procedure. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not
been proper service of process. (Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 801, 808.) Compliance with the statutory procedures for service of
process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction. (Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) The filing of a proof
of service creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper, but
only if the proof of service satisfies relevant statutory requirements. (Id.,
at 1441-1442.) 
 
“A summons in an action for unlawful detainer of real
property may be served by posting if upon affidavit it appears to the satisfaction
of the court in which the action is pending that the party to be served cannot
with reasonable diligence be served ... other than [by] publication” and that
certain other requirements are satisfied. (Code Civ. Proc., § 415.45(a).) 
 
The Court granted Plaintiff’s application to serve by
posting. The Court found that Plaintiff had shown reasonable diligence in attempting
to serve Defendant by other means. 
 
If publication is ordered, “[t]he court shall order the
summons to be posted on the premises in a manner most likely to give actual
notice to the party to be served and direct that a copy of the summons and of
the complaint be forthwith mailed by certified mail to such party at his last
known address.” (Id., subd. (b).)
 
Defendant concedes he received the summons and complaint in
the mail, but he argues Plaintiff did not post it on the premises as required. Defendant
declares: “I never found a copy of the summons and complaint at the premises.
No[ ]one has appeared at my home in an attempt to serve me with anything.”
(Carlson Decl., 1:11-13.)
 
Plaintiff’s proof of service, accompanied by the
declaration of a registered process server, establishes a presumption that
service was properly effected. (Evid. Code § 647; Rodriguez v. Cho
(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 742, 750.) Defendant cannot rebut this presumption by denying
knowledge of service; he must offer some affirmative evidence that service did
not take place in the manner Plaintiff claims. (See Louis & Diederich,
Inc. v. Cambridge European Imports, Inc. (1987) 189 Cal. App. 3d 1574, 1591
[no finding can be predicated on the absence of evidence].)
 
Defendant has not rebutted the sworn statement by Plaintiff’s
process server in the proof of service. Defendant’s motion is denied.
