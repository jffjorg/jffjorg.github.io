And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to serve the summons and complaint in the manner required by law. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's proof of service, accompanied by the declaration of a registered process server, establishes a presumption that service was properly effected. The defendant has not rebutted this presumption by offering affirmative evidence that service did not take place in the manner claimed by the plaintiff. As a result, the judge has denied the defendant's motion and ordered the defendant to file an answer to the complaint within 5 days.
