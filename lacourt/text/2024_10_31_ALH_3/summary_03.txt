This is a tentative ruling by Judge William A. Crowfoot regarding a motion for order by plaintiff Lucinda Sky demanding that defendant County of Los Angeles (erroneously sued as Foothill LAPD) provide surveillance camera footage from the Foothill Police Station. The motion was filed on October 8, 2024, and the plaintiff alleges that she was injured as a result of crimes committed by a drug trafficking ring. The defendant opposes the production of the footage, citing a lack of a proper demand as required by California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.010, 2031.020, 2031.030, and 2031.040. The Court has denied the motion due to the lack of a proper demand and has invited the plaintiff to review templates for requesting discovery in civil lawsuits.
