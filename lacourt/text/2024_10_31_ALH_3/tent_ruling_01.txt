 Margarian of The Margarian Law Firm seeks to be relieved as counsel of
record for plaintiff PCH Fuel Inc. (“Plaintiff”) on grounds that
there
 is a conflict in the attorney-client relationship. Absent a showing of
resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted. (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
Counsel’s Motion complies with
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The Court notes that trial in this
matter is not yet set and no prejudice will result from granting this motion.
Accordingly, this unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon
filing a proof of service showing service of the signed order, filed on October
4, 2024, on Plaintiff and all parties who have appeared. 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 31st
day of October 2024
