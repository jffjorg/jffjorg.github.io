And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants (GLENN MARQUART and Dansk Investment LLC) to Mintwood Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s cross-complaint. The cross-complaint alleges that Cross-Defendants failed to maintain the security of the premises, allowing criminal activity to occur in vacant spaces adjoining Mintwood's leased space. The Judge has ruled that the cross-complaint is sufficiently pleaded, as it alleges that Cross-Defendants' failure to secure the premises constructively forced Mintwood out of business. The Judge has also found that the lease agreement between Mintwood and Cross-Defendants requires Cross-Defendants to maintain the structural parts of the building, including the exterior walls, which includes securing the premises from criminal activity. The demurrer is therefore overruled.
