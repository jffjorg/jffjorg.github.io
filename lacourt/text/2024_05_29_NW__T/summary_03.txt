And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to consolidate the two cases without prejudice. The defendants, Valley Regenerative & Pain Clinic and Rain Surgical Centers, moved to consolidate the case with Ardalan Chiropractic Corporation dba Atlas Health Center v. Valley Regenerative & Pain Clinic (Super. Ct. Los Angeles County, pending, 24STLC01879) (Related Case). The judge finds that the two cases do not share common questions of fact or law, and therefore, consolidation is not necessary. The two cases involve different corporate entities, different agreements, and different facts and law. The judge notes that the defendants failed to demonstrate a sufficient showing of common questions of fact or law, and therefore, the motion is denied.
