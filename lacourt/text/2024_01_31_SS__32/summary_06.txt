And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Kecia Covington. The motion was filed by Plaintiff's current counsel, Elina Shakhbazyan, who claims that there has been a breakdown in communication and she is unable to contact the Plaintiff. The Court has reviewed the motion and finds that the methods used to notify the Plaintiff were reasonable, but notes that Counsel has not included information about future proceedings in the motion. The Court has conditionally granted the motion, pending Counsel's filing and service of an updated proposed order that includes this information. The Court orders Counsel to file the updated order within 5 calendar days and serve it within 10 days. Counsel will remain the attorney of record until the updated order is filed and served.
