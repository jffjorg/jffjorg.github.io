```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies Defendant Glendon-Monica HOA's Motion for Summary Judgment/Adjudication. Defendant argues that it is not liable for Plaintiff Earl Gibson's injuries under the Privette doctrine, which holds that a hirer of an independent contractor generally has no liability for the contractor's employees. Defendant asserts that each unit owner is a member of the Glendon-Monica HOA and therefore the doctrine applies "equally to the actual hirer as it does to agents, independent contractors and others in privity." However, Defendant fails to provide evidence regarding the delegation of a duty involving the air conditioning unit to the unit owner. The Court finds that Defendant has not met its burden to show that it hired Plaintiff for purposes of the Privette doctrine. Therefore, the motion is denied.
