And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion of Plaintiff's counsel, Jasdeep S. Ahluwalia, to be relieved as counsel due to lack of communication with the client, Amritpal Kaur. The motion was filed because the client has stopped communicating with the counsel for five weeks, despite multiple attempts to reach out. However, the Judge notes that a notice of settlement was filed on January 30, 2024, which suggests that counsel has been able to communicate with the client after all. The Judge also points out that the proposed order filed by counsel is incomplete and does not include the necessary information. Therefore, the motion is denied, and counsel will be required to provide notice of the Court's ruling.
