And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants. The plaintiff, United Bridge Trucking Corp., alleges breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and negligence against the defendants, Tommy Wang, Pin Pin Kao, and Anna Zhang.

The judge rules that the economic loss rule does not bar the plaintiff's causes of action for conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud during contract formation. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent concealment and intentional misrepresentation are sufficient to withstand demurrer.

The judge overrules the demurrer filed by the defendants on the plaintiff's fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth causes of action. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's cause of action for conspiracy survives.

The judge orders the defendants to file their answers within 20 days and to give notice.
