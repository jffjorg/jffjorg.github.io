Bridge Trucking Corp. v. Wang et al. 
Defendants Tommy Wang, Pin Pin Kao,
Anna Zhang’s Demurrer
 
BACKGROUND  
            On
January 25, 2023, plaintiff United Bridge Trucking Corp. (Plaintiff) filed a
complaint alleging breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and
negligence. 
            On
February 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (Complaint)
against defendants Tommy Wang (Wang), Pin Pin Kao (Kuo), Anna Zhang (Zhang), WA
Transportation (WAT), C Lion (C Lion) and all persons claiming a legal or
equitable right to the property (collectively Defendants). 
            Plaintiff
alleges ten causes of action: (1) Breach of Oral Contract, (2) Conversion, (3)
Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (4) Constructive Fraud under Civil Code § 1573, (5)
Fraudulent Concealment, (6) Conspiracy, (7) Intentional Misrepresentation, (8)
Accounting and Constructive Trust, (9) Partition and Accounting, and (10)
Dissolution.  
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE
Granted. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Demurrer
As
a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the
face of the pleading or through proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal. App.4th 968, 994.)  “A demurrer
tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.”  (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs.
(2007) 153 Cal. App. 4th 1308, 1315.)  As
such, the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or
implied factual allegations.  (Id.)
 The only issue a demurrer is concerned
with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th
740, 747.)
Where
a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal. 3d
335, 348.)  The burden is on the
plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Id.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC
(2015) 244 Cal. App. 4th 118, 226.)  But
“[i]f there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good
cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.”  (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal. 2d 240, 245).   
 
DISCUSSION
Economic
Loss Rule                                                                                                                           
            Defendants
argue that the economic loss rule precludes recovery on the Second, Third,
Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Causes of Action. 
The economic loss rule prohibits recovery of tort damages in breach of
contract cases where the tort depends on the breach of a contractual duty.  (Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana
Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 988.) Resting on principles of tort law, a
tortious breach of contract alleges violation of a duty independent of the
contract.  (Erlich v. Menezes
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 543, 551.)  Examples of
independently tortious breach of contract is when one party commits a fraud
during the contract formation or commits conversion.  (Robinson Helicopter Co. 34 Cal.4th at
pp. 990 (citing Elrich, supra, 21 Cal.4th at pp. 551-55).)  
            Plaintiff’s
Second Cause of Action for Conversion alleges the independent tort of
conversion.  Under Robinson Helicopter
Co., Inc., because Plaintiff alleges conversion, the economic loss rule
does not bar the Cause of Action.  (Robinson,
supra, 34 Cal.4th at 990 (citing Elrich, supra, 21 Cal.4th
at pp. 553-554).)
            Plaintiff’s
Third Cause of Action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty alleges that Defendants
breached their fiduciary duty to Plaintiff. 
In Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the Court found that a
fiduciary duty, even if arising from the contract, gives rise to an
extra-contractual duty.  (Sheen v.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 926-27.)  Given that the fiduciary duty itself creates
an independent duty, the Economic Loss Rule does not bar Plaintiff’s Third
Cause of Action.  
Plaintiff’s
Fourth and Seventh Causes of Action allege the independent tortious breach of
contract of fraud during contract formation. 
(Complaint ¶¶ 69, 86.)  Under Robinson
Helicopter Co., Inc., because Plaintiff alleges fraudulent inducement in
the creation of the contract, the economic loss rule does not bar the Causes of
Action.  
Plaintiff’s
Fifth Cause of Action for Fraudulent Concealment alleges that Defendants
breached their fiduciary duty by concealing material facts from Plaintiff with
the intent to defraud and mislead Plaintiff. 
(Complaint ¶ 74-75.)  
The
Court overrules Defendants’ demurrer to the extent it relies on the economic
loss rule.  
 
Fails to State a Cause of Action
            Defendants
argue that the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh and Ninth fail as a matter of law for
failure to state a claim. 
            When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally.  (MKB Management, Inc. v. Melikian
(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 796, 802.)
            Constructive
Fraud – Fourth Cause of Action
            Defendants
allege that Plaintiff failed to plead fraud with sufficient specificity.  
            The
elements of Constructive Fraud are (1) a fiduciary, confidential or special
relationship, (2) breach (e.g. nondisclosure), (3) intent to deceive, (4)
reliance, (5) causation, and (6) damage. 
(Younan v. Equifax Inc. (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 498, 516, 517, fn. 14.)  Additionally, fraud must be pleaded with
particularity, describing “how, when, where, to whom, and by what means that
representations were tendered.”  (Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220
Cal.App.3d 59, 73.)   
            Plaintiff
alleges that (1) a fiduciary duty exists between Plaintiff and Defendants
(Complaint ¶ 67); (2) Defendants made purposefully misleading statements to
plaintiff, including: (a) Around September 2022, defendants Wang and Kuo
refused to provide access to books and records and (b) Wang, Kuo and Zhang
formed C Lion as a direct competitor to WAT (Complaint ¶¶ 33, 38.); (3)
Defendants intended to deceive Plaintiff (Complaint ¶ 69); (4) Plaintiff relied
on Defendants (See Complaint ¶¶ 18, 67); (5) the breach caused Plaintiff’s
injury (Complaint ¶ 70); and (6) Plaintiff was damaged. (Complaint ¶ 71.)  Plaintiff also includes several WeChat
messages in the complaint to support the Fraud Causes of Action.  
Defendants
challenge the sufficiency of the damage allegations.  Defendants do not cite authority that
Plaintiff must plead damages with heightened specificity.  Plaintiff alleges its financial interests
were damaged, which is sufficient to withstand demurrer.
The
Court finds that Plaintiff pleaded the Fourth Cause of Action with sufficient
particularity. The demurrer is overruled as to the Fourth Cause of Action. 
            Fraudulent
Concealment and Intentional Misrepresentation – Fifth and Seventh Causes of
Action
            Defendants
allege that Plaintiff fails to plead fraudulent concealment with sufficient
specificity.  
            The
elements of fraud are (1) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment
or nondisclosure); (2) knowledge of falsity (scienter); (3) intent to defraud;
(4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage.  (Conroy
v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1244, 1255.)  Additionally, fraud must be pleaded with
particularity, describing “how, when, where, to whom, and by what means that
representations were tendered.”  (Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220
Cal.App.3d 59, 73.)  When alleging
fraudulent concealment, however, a plaintiff need not specifically plead how,
when, to whom, and by what means.  (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement
System & Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384.)  
            As
noted above, Plaintiff meets the pleading requirements for fraudulent
concealment.  Plaintiff alleges (1)
Defendants concealed and misrepresented business dealings (Complaint ¶¶ 28-43,
86); (2) Defendants had scienter (Complaint ¶¶ 74, 86); (3) Defendants intended
to defraud plaintiff (Complaint ¶¶ 75, 87); (4) Plaintiff relied on the claims
(Complaint ¶¶ 18, 67, 87, 88); and (5) Plaintiff was damaged (Complaint ¶¶ 76,
90.)
                        Misrepresentations
            Defendants
challenge the sufficiency of the misrepresentations.  Defendants identify four separate
representations about the following: (1) 50% shares in WAT; (2) Real Property;
(3) Real Property Income; and (4) Diversion of Business to C Lion.  Defendants allege that their statements
regarding the transfer of the 50% shares in WAT to Plaintiff is not an
actionable misrepresentation because the statement regarded a future
event.  (Cansino v. Bank of America
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.)  
Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants made the promise to transfer the 50% shares in exchange
for Plaintiff’s investments.  In Cansino,
defendant’s representations of the future condition of the real estate market
were not actionable misrepresentations because they represented opinions.  Here, Defendants statements are about
concrete actions they intend to take once a condition is met.  Therefore, Defendants’ misrepresentations are
not forecasts of future events, but rather a statement about existing material
facts regarding their intent.  Defendants’
misrepresentations regarding the transfer of shares is sufficient to support
Plaintiff’s Fraudulent Misrepresentation cause of action. 
Given
that Defendants’ statements regarding the shares is sufficient to withstand
demurrer, the Court overrules Defendants’ demurrer to the seventh cause of
action without assessing the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s other allegations of
misrepresentation.  (Kong v. City of
Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1047 [“a
demurrer cannot rightfully be sustained to [only] part of a cause of action or
to a particular type of damage recovery”].)
            Partition
and Accounting of Real Property    
            Defendants
allege that Plaintiff cannot bring a Cause of Action to partition the Real
Property because California’s Corporations Code allows for partitioning
property only if the corporation is dissolved. 
(Capuccio v. Caire (1932) 215 Cal. 518, 522.)  Plaintiff’s Cause of Action for both
partition and dissolution follow from Plaintiff’s other Causes of Action.
Because Plaintiff moves for dissolution, plaintiff may also at the pleading stage
seek partition.  The Court overrules
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Ninth Cause of Action. 
 
Independent
Cause of Action             
            Defendants
allege that Plaintiff’s sixth cause of action for conspiracy fails to state an
independent cause of action.  Because the
Court overrules the demurrer to Plaintiff’s tort causes of action, Plaintiff’s
Conspiracy Cause of Action survives.  
            
CONCLUSION
            The
Court overrules the demurrer.
            Defendants
to file their answers within 20 days. 
            Defendants
to give notice.
