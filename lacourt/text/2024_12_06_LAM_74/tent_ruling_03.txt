 Case Number:  23STCV27920    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  74 Opendoor
Property Trust I v. Vickers et al. 
Plaintiff Opendoor Property Trust I
Motion to Compel Discovery 
 
BACKGROUND  
            This
motion to compel discovery arises out of a property dispute and quiet title
claim. 
            Plaintiff
Opendoor Property Trust I (Plaintiff) seeks to compel initial responses to the
request for production of documents and inspection of items propounded on
defendant Fred Wendell Vickers in his capacity as the Trustee of the Fred and
Beverly Vickers Family Trust (Defendant). 
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290(b), 2031.300(b).)  Moreover,
failure to timely serve responses waives objections to the requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a).)  
The
Court may impose sanctions against a party who unsuccessfully makes or oppose a
motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(c).)
 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
propounded discovery on Defendant on March 13, 2024.  As of October 14, 2024, when the motion was
filed, Defendant has not served answers. 
Defendant has not opposed this motion.
 
            Plaintiff
requests $892.00 in sanctions.  Plaintiff
filed three motions to compel discovery and requests sanctions for all three
motions divided by three.  Plaintiff’s
counsel requests 4.2 hours for preparing the motions and anticipates an
additional 5.5 hours in preparing replies and attending hearings.  The court awards 4.2 hours for preparing the
motions, and an additional two hours for attending the hearings.  Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is $260.00.  The court awards $537 in sanctions for this
motion.
 
CONCLUSION
The
court grant’s Plaintiffs motion to compel initial responses from defendant Fred
Vickers as Trustee to Request for Production of Documents and Items for
Inspection and Copying, Set One.  Defendant
must provide code compliant responses without objections within 10 days.  The court awards $537 in sanctions payable to
Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days.
