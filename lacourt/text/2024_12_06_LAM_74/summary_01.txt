And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted in part and denied in part the defendant's motion to strike certain allegations in the complaint. The court has granted the motion to strike paragraphs 74 and 20, line 28, which relate to punitive damages. However, the court has denied the remainder of the motion to strike. The court has also ruled that the plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts to support punitive damages, including allegations of willful and conscious disregard of their rights and safety. The court has also ruled that the plaintiffs' allegations of interference with their right to quiet enjoyment and possession are sufficient, but notes that the plaintiffs have not supported their request for punitive damages under this cause of action.
