  Time:    2:00 p.m. 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
DEMURRER TO
  COMPLAINT;
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
  PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES
 



            
Background
On October 3, 2023,
Plaintiff Marita Valdez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Gregory
Nicolaysen, a Professional Law Corporation and Gregory Nicolaysen (jointly,
“Defendants”). The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) hostile work
environment harassment in violation of FEHA, and (2) failure to prevent
harassment in violation of FEHA.
Defendants now demur to both causes of action of the Complaint and
move to strike portions of the Complaint. Plaintiff opposes both. 
Discussion
As an initial matter, Plaintiff asserts that the demurrer and motion
to strike were untimely served. Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), “[u]nless
otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting
papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. The
moving and supporting papers served shall be a copy of the papers filed or to
be filed with the court. However, if the notice is served by mail, the
required 16-day period of notice before the hearing shall be increased by five
calendar days if the place of mailing and the place of address are within
the State of California…” (Emphasis added.) 
Here, the demurrer and motion to strike were
originally noticed for hearing on November 17, 2023. The Court notes that Defendants
did not appear to file any proof of service with the demurrer or motion to
strike. However, Plaintiff’s counsel states that “Defendants mail served their
demurrer and motion to strike late on October 23, 2023.” (Zamora Decls., ¶ 2,
Exs. A.) 
Sixteen court days prior to November 17, 2023 (the original hearing
date) is October
25, 2023. Five calendar days prior to October 25, 2023 is October 20, 2023.
However, Defendants filed the instant demurrer and motion to strike on October
23, 2023. In addition, as discussed, Plaintiff’s counsel indicates that
“Defendants mail served their demurrer and motion to strike late on October 23,
2023.” (Zamora Decls., ¶ 2, Exs. A.) Plaintiffs’ counsel states that “our
offices did not receive Defendants demurrer and motion to strike until October
26, 2023.” (Zamora Decls., ¶¶ 2.)[1]
In their consolidated reply, Defendants do not appear to dispute that
the demurrer and motion to strike were untimely filed and served. Defendants do
not show that Plaintiff was provided adequate notice of the demurrer and motion
to strike under Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b). The Court is
thus inclined to continue the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike so
that Plaintiff has adequate time to respond. 

Conclusion 
In light of the foregoing, the Court continues the hearing on Defendants’
demurrer and motion to strike to
_______________, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. in Dept. 50. 
Plaintiff
may file and serve new opposition papers that will supersede any previously
filed opposition papers. Any opposition and reply papers must be filed and
served per Code of Civil Procedure section
1005, subdivision (b) with courtesy copies delivered to
Dept. 50 on the same date as the filing. Defendant did not previously provide a
courtesy copy of the demurrer and motion to strike. Defendant must deliver a
courtesy copy to Dept. 50 by January 19, 2024.
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this Order.
