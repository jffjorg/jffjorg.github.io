And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering the demurrer to the Complaint and motion to strike portions of the Complaint filed by the defendants. The demurrer and motion to strike were initially noticed for hearing on November 17, 2023, but were filed and served late, on October 23, 2023. The Court finds that the defendants did not provide adequate notice of the demurrer and motion to strike to the plaintiff. Therefore, the Court decides to continue the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike to a later date, allowing the plaintiff additional time to respond. The defendants are ordered to provide a courtesy copy of the demurrer and motion to strike to the Court by January 19, 2024.
