And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by Judge Beaudet sets forth her disclosure of a potential conflict of interest, stemming from her personal experience with a pickup truck purchased by her and her husband 24 years ago. The truck developed electrical problems and was eventually refunded by the manufacturer and dealer. Judge Beaudet does not believe this experience will cause her to be biased in this case, but if a party believes otherwise, they may file a verified statement of disqualification by January 24, 2024. The hearing on the Case Management Conference is continued to March 11, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
