And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

"In this case, the plaintiff argues that the failure to provide a copy of the arbitration rules to which the employee would be bound constitutes procedural unconscionability. The court has previously held that such a failure supports a finding of procedural unconscionability. However, in Baltazar v. Forever 21, Inc., the California Supreme Court noted that the plaintiff's unconscionability claim depended on the arbitration rules in question. The court will consider this issue further at the upcoming hearing."
