Rules was “no trifling matter. The rules extend over 26 single-spaced pages” (Id.
at 393.) However, in Baltazar v. Forever 21, Inc. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1237, the California Supreme Court addressed this exact

itself and in each of the Court of Appeal decisions cited therein, the
plaintiff's unconscionability claim depended in some manner on the arbitration
rules in question.:” (Baltazar v. Forever 21, Inc. (2016) 62 Cal.4th
1237, 1246.)
