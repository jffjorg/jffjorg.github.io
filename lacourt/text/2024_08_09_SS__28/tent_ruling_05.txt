 Case Number:  22STCV29029    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers, the Court rules as
follows. 
BACKGROUND 
          On September 7, 2022, Plaintiffs Jose Preciado and Aline
Preciado filed this action against Defendants San Gabriel Transit, Inc. (“Transit”),
Access Services (“Access”), Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, Steve Ly (“Ly”), and Does 1-50 for negligence, negligent infliction
of emotional distress, negligent hiring, training, retention, and supervision,
vicarious liability, dangerous condition of public property under Government
Code section 835, and loss of consortium. 
          On November 28, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a first amended
complaint against the same defendants. 
In the first cause of action, Plaintiffs asserted claims for negligence,
negligent infliction of emotional distress, and vicarious liability.  In the second cause of action, Plaintiffs asserted a claim for loss of consortium. 
          On December 29, 2022, Transit and Access filed an answer. 
On
January 4, 2023, Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority dba Metro (erroneously sued and served as Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, a public entity) (“Metro”) filed an answer.  On November 21, 2023, the Court dismissed
Metro with prejudice at Plaintiffs’ request. 
On September
7, 2023, Ly filed an answer. 
On
November 1, 2023, the Court found that this case (22STCV29029) and case number 22STCV33187
are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a).  Case number 22STCV29029 became the lead case.  The cases were assigned to Department 31 at the
Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes.  The cases were later assigned to Department 28 at the Spring Street Courthouse.
On
June 7, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel Access’s further responses to
requests for production of documents and things, set two, and for
sanctions.  The motion was set for
hearing on July 8, 2024.  On June 24,
2024, Access filed an opposition and request for sanctions.  On June 28, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a reply.  The Court continued the hearing to August 9,
2024.  
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
A.      Informal Discovery Conference 
The
Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts
Effective October 10, 2022 (Filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub
Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery
until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Discovery.” 
The
parties participated in IDCs on February 21, February 27, March 7, March 8,
June 4, and July 5, 2024. 
B.       Timeliness of motions 
A
notice of motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of
the service of the verified responses, or any supplemental verified responses,
or on or before any later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].)  Failure to file a motion by this deadline
constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses. 
Access
does not dispute the timeliness of Plaintiffs’ motion. 
C.   Meet and confer 
A
motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or interrogatories
must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2016.040.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd (b)(2) [demand for inspection].) 
“A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts
showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each
issue presented by the motion.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
Plaintiffs
have provided a meet and confer declaration. 
D.      Separate statement 
With
exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is
warranted. 
Plaintiffs
have filed a separate statement. 
APPLICABLE LAW 
A.      Untimely responses Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides in part: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. . . .” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subds. (a), (b).)  
B.      Motion to compel further responses Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 provides in part: 
“(a) On receipt of a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an
order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems
that any of the following apply: 
“(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete. 
“(2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 
“(3) An objection in the response is without merit or
too general. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
each of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(3) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party
and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any
right to compel a further response to the demand. 
* * *
  “(h) Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1031.310,
subds. (a), (b), (c), (h).) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Plaintiffs’ motion to compel Access’s
further responses to requests for production of documents and things, set two 
Served:
                           July 24, 2023                            Responses:                       September 30, 2023          Further responses:           April
25, 2024                Motion filed:                   June 7, 2024
          Plaintiffs argue that Access’s responses to Plaintiffs’
requests for production of documents and things, set two, were untimely, waiving
Access’s right to assert objections to the requests.  According to Plaintiffs, Access’s responses were due on September 29, 2023 as the
result of Plaintiffs’ agreement to extend the time for Access to respond.  (See, e.g., Plaintiffs’ exhibit D [Access’s
counsel acknowledges that the deadline for Access’s responses is September 29, 2023].)  Because Access served its responses on
September 30, 2023, Plaintiffs argue, Access waived any objections it might
have asserted. 
Access does not dispute Plaintiffs’ contention that Access
served its responses one day late. 
Instead, Access argues that the discovery requests are overbroad,
disproportionate to the value of the case, violate the attorney-client privilege
and work product protections, and are objectionable in other ways.  Access has waived these arguments. “If a party
to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed
fails to serve a timely response to it, . . . [¶] [the] party . . . waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010).”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  Therefore, the Court will not consider Access’s
objections. 
In Access’s further responses to requests for
production numbers 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, and 81, Access
promised to provide responsive documents. 
(See Plaintiffs’ Separate Statement, further responses to requests for
production numbers 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, and 81.)  Plaintiffs, however, argue that Access broke
these promises and did not provide the requested documents.  (See, e.g., Plaintiffs’ Separate Statement
pp. 35-36.)  Access does not respond to
this argument.  The Court concludes that
Access has not provided the documents responsive to these requests. 
Access argues that the Court should not order it to
produce further responses to request for production number 87 because “Defendants
will have produced responsive documents by the time of the motion hearing.”  (Defendants’ Separate
Statement p. 39.)  Access also argues
that it has already produced documents responsive to request for production number
94. (Defendants’ Separate Statement p. 39.)  Access has not provided a declaration or
other evidence to support these assertions. 
Access’s further response to request for production
number 72 does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.230. 
The
Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion and orders Access to
provide further verified, code-compliant responses to requests for production of
documents and things, set two, numbers 71, 72, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81,
82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, and 94 and to produce the documents, electronically
stored information, and/or other things requested within 30 days of the hearing
on this motion. 
B.   Plaintiffs’ sanctions request 
          Plaintiffs request $3,711.65 in sanctions based on eight
hours of attorney time at a rate of $450.00 per hour, a $61.65 filing fee, and
$50.00 to send the Court a courtesy copy of the motion.  Counsel spent five hours to draft the moving
papers and anticipated spending two hours to draft the reply and one hour to
attend the hearing. 
          The Court awards $811.65 in sanctions based on three hours
of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per hour and one filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS the motion of Plaintiffs Jose
Preciado and Aline Preciado to compel Defendant Access Services’s further
responses to requests for production of documents and things, set two.  The Court orders Defendant
Access Services to provide further verified, code-compliant responses to requests for production of documents and things, set two, numbers 71, 72, 74, 75, 76,
77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, and 94 and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
within 30 days of the hearing on this motion. 
The
Court GRANTS the request for sanctions of Plaintiffs Jose Preciado and Aline
Preciado and orders Defendant Access Services and its counsel to pay Plaintiffs Jose Preciado and Aline Preciado $811.65
within 30 days of the date of the hearing on this motion. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
