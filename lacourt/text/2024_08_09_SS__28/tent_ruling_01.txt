  Case Number:  19STCV18412    Hearing Date:   August 9, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
May 28, 2019, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Derick Carcamo (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for subrogation.  The complaint demanded $31,138.99. 
On
October 17, 2019, Defendant filed an answer. 
On
August 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On
December 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Stipulation
for Dismissal With Reservation to Vacate and Enter Judgment Upon Breach under
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  Based on the stipulation, the Court dismissed
the case without prejudice and retained jurisdiction under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6. 
On
June 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal and enter
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.  Plaintiff did not file an opposition. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant for
$8,084.50. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part: 
“(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
“(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed
by a party if it is signed by any of the following: 
“(1) The party. 
“(2) An attorney who represents the party. 
“(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is
authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subds. (a), (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff
and Defendant stipulated that the Court would dismiss the action without
prejudice.  In return, Defendant agreed to
make specified monthly payments to Plaintiff until Defendant paid the amount he owed Plaintiff. 
Defendant’s
insurance carrier made a payment of $8,888.57 but Defendant then defaulted on his
payment obligation.  Plaintiff’s counsel
sent a default payment letter to Defendant on April 23, 2024 advising Defendant that
he was in default.  Defendant has failed
to bring his payments current. 
Because
Defendant did not cure the default, Plaintiff asks the Court to enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor for $8,084.50,
consisting of $16,388.57, less the payment of $8,888.57, plus costs of $584.50.  The Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company’s motion to vacate the dismissal and enter
judgment.  The Court vacates the December
7, 2023 dismissal and awards Plaintiff State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company $8,084.50 against Defendant Derick Carcamo. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
