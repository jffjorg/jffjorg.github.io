DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) has filed three
motions requesting that the court impose terminating sanctions against
defendants Midland Hardware Company No. 4 (“Midland”) and Kittrich Corp.
(“Kittrich”) (collectively, “Defendants”), or alternatively, imposing issue or
evidence sanctions against Defendants, all of which are pending before the
court.[1]  The court discusses the three motions
together in the interest of efficiency. 
If a party engages in a misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.030.)¿ Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 provides, in relevant
part, that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to,
the following: . . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery. . . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.”¿¿¿¿ 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’”¿ (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th
377, 390, quoting Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)¿
“Generally, ‘[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.¿
But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the
evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the
discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate
sanction.’”¿ (Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390
[citation omitted].)¿¿¿ 
“Under this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating
sanctions when parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.”
(Los Defensores, supra, 223 Cal. App. 4th at p. 390, citing Lang,
supra, 77 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 1244-1246 [discussing cases]; see, e.g., Collisson
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 1611, 1617-1622
[terminating sanctions imposed after defendants failed to comply with one court
order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange
(1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 481, 491, disapproved on other grounds in Garcia v.
McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 469, 478, n. 4 [terminating sanctions imposed
against plaintiff for failing to comply with a discovery order and for
violating various discovery statutes].)¿¿¿ 
In connection with its three pending motions for sanctions, Plaintiff
has submitted evidence showing that (1) defendant Midland has not complied with
three court orders compelling it to provide discovery, and (2) defendant
Kittrich has not complied with two court orders compelling it to provide
discovery.  
A.   
Defendants’ Failure to Comply with
Court Orders Compelling Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
On January 26, 2023, the court issued an order granting Plaintiff’s
motion to compel Midland’s initial responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Production, ordering Midland to serve written responses and produce responsive
documents within 20 days of the date of service of the order.  (Jan. 26, 2023 Order, p. 2:15-22.)  Plaintiff served a notice of the court’s
January 26, 2023 ruling on Midland by electronic service and certified mail on
February 1, 2023.  (Feb. 1, 2023 Notice
of Hearing, Proof of Service.)  As of the
date that Plaintiff filed the September 5, 2023 motion for sanctions, Plaintiff
had “not received responses to Requests for Production, Set One,” from
Midland.  (Yeroushalmi Decl., ¶ 12.)  
Similarly, on February 2, 2023, the court issued an order granting
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Kittrich’s initial responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production, ordering Kittrich to serve written responses and
produce responsive documents within 20 days of the date of service of the
order.  (Feb. 2, 2023 Order, p.
2:16-22.)  Plaintiff served a notice of
the court’s February 2, 2023 ruling on Kittrich by electronic service and
certified mail on April 17, 2023.  (April
18, 2023 Notice of Ruling, Proof of Service.) 
As of the date that Plaintiff filed the September 5, 2023 motion for
sanctions, Plaintiff had “not received responses to Requests for Production,
Set One,” from Kittrich.  (Yeroushalmi
Decl., ¶ 12.)
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has shown that Defendants each
violated one court order compelling them to produce responses to Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production of Documents. 
The court further finds that Defendants’ failure to serve full and
complete written responses and to produce responsive documents is prejudicial
to Plaintiff, because the requests demand information central to Plaintiff’s cause
of action for violation of Proposition 65.  For example, the Requests for Production of
Documents request information regarding Defendants’ sale of the subject bath
mats, including, specifically, documents relating to the location of DINP in or
on the bath mats (numbers 16-18, 20); documents relating to any tests performed
on the bath mats to detect the presence of any Proposition 65-listed chemical, or
Defendants’ efforts to ensure that their products comply with Proposition 65 (numbers
19, 33); documents that include any warnings that the bath mats contained a
Proposition 65-listed chemical (number 21); and documents relating to any
recall initiated by Defendants or directed by another entity of the bath mats
(number 22).  (Yeroushalmi Decl., Ex. A,
Requests for Production to Midland, p. 7, ¶ 15 [defining Test], p. 8, ¶ 20
[defining Product 1], pp. 11:4-12:3, 13:10-12; Yeroushalmi Decl., Ex. B,
Requests for Production to Kittrich, p. 7, ¶ 15 [defining Test], p. 8, ¶
20 [defining Product 1], pp. 11:4-12:3, 13:10-12.)  These requests are central to Plaintiff’s
claim that Defendants “knowingly and intentionally exposed California consumers
and users of [the subject] Bath Mat, which Defendants manufactured,
distributed, or sold . . ., to DINP [Diisononyl Phthalate], without first
providing any type of clear and reasonable warning of such to the exposed
persons before the time of exposure[,]” in violation of Proposition 65.  (Compl., ¶ 28.) 
B.   
Defendant Midland’s Failure to Comply
with Court Order Compelling Its Responses to Form Interrogatories
On January 24, 2023, the court issued an order (1) granting
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Midland’s initial responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and (2) ordering Midland to serve responses within 20
days of the date of the order.  (Jan. 24,
2023 Order, p. 2:13-18.)  Plaintiff
served a notice of the court’s January 24, 2023 order on Midland by electronic
service and certified mail on February 1, 2023. 
(Feb. 1, 2023 Notice of Hearing.) 
As of the date that Plaintiff filed its August 29, 2023 motion, Midland
had not served its responses on Plaintiff. 
(Yeroushalmi Decl., ¶ 7.)  
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has shown that Midland violated a
court order compelling it to serve responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One.
The court further finds that Midland’s failure to serve full and
complete written responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, is
prejudicial to Plaintiff, because the interrogatories request information
central to Plaintiff’s cause of action for violation of Proposition 65.  For example, interrogatory numbers 12.1 and
12.2 request the identification of individuals who witnessed, were interviewed,
or who provided a written or recorded statement about the subject incident
(here, defined to be the manufacture, distribution, importation, and/or sale of
the subject bath mat).  (Yeroushalmi
Decl., Ex. A, pp. 5, Nos. 12.1-12.3, 9, Sec. 4(a)(2) [defining the term
“incident”].)  Further, interrogatory
number 15.1 requests the identification of Midland’s denial of each material
allegation and each special or affirmative defense in the pleadings, which is
necessary to apprise Plaintiff of the defenses that Midland intends to assert
and the facts that it intends to dispute. 
(Id., p. 6, No. 15.1.) 
C.   
Defendants’ Failure to Comply with
Court Orders Compelling Responses to Special Interrogatories
On January 23, 2023, the court issued an order (1) granting
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Midland’s responses to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and (2) ordering Midland to serve its responses on
Plaintiff within 20 days of the date of service of the order.  (Jan. 23, 2023 Order, p. 2:13-18.)  Plaintiff served Midland with a notice of the
court’s January 23, 2023 order on February 1, 2023, by electronic service and
certified mail.  (Feb. 1, 2023 Notice of
Hearing.)  On January 31, 2023, the court
issued an order (1) granting Plaintiff’s motion to compel Kittrich’s initial
responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, and (2) ordering
Kittrich to serve its responses on Plaintiff within 20 days of the date of
service of the order.  (Jan. 31, 2023
Order, p. 2:13-19.)  Plaintiff served
Kittrich with a notice of the court’s January 31, 2023 order on April 17, 2023,
by electronic service and certified mail. 
(April 18, 2023 Notice of Ruling re: Hearing on Motion to Compel
Kittrich to Provide Responses to Special Interrogatories.)  However, as of the date that Plaintiff filed
its August 30, 2023 motion for sanctions, Plaintiff had “not received responses
to Special Interrogatories, Set One, from Defendants[.]”  (Yeroushalmi Decl., ¶ 12.) 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff has shown that Defendants each
violated one court order compelling them to serve responses to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories. 
The court further finds that Defendants’ failure to serve full and
complete written answers is prejudicial to Plaintiff, because the
interrogatories request information that is central to Plaintiff’s cause of
action for violation of Proposition 65. 
For example, the Special Interrogatories request information relating to
the types of the subject bath mats purchased and sold during the relevant
period (numbers 2-4), the manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of the
subject bath mat (numbers 16-18), the tests that Defendants conducted on any
version of the subject bath mat to determine whether any Proposition 65-listed
chemicals or DINP were present and the results of those tests (numbers 23-24), and
Defendants’ screening processes for DINP in the subject bath mat and the
person(s) most qualified to testify as to that process (numbers 36-37).  (Yeroushalmi Decl., Ex. A, Special
Interrogatories to Midland, pp. 7:1-9, 8:24-9:5, 9:18-24, 11:15-20; Yeroushalmi
Decl., Ex. B, Special Interrogatories to Kittrich, pp. 6:23-7:3, 8:19-27,
9:12-18, 11:7-12.)  These interrogatories
seek information that is central to Plaintiff’s claim that Defendants
“knowingly and intentionally exposed California consumers and users of [the
subject] Bath Mat, which Defendants manufactured, distributed, or sold . . .,
to DINP [Diisononyl Phthalate], without first providing any type of clear and
reasonable warning of such to the exposed persons before the time of
exposure[,]” in violation of Proposition 65. 
(Compl., ¶ 28.)
D.   
Conclusion
Based on the evidence presented, and in light of the fact that
Defendants did not file opposition papers in connection with any of Plaintiff’s
three motions for sanctions, the court finds that (1) defendant Midland has
engaged in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process by (i) willfully
disobeying the court’s January 23, 2023, January 24, 2023, and January 26, 2023
orders to serve responses and produce responsive documents to discovery, and
(ii) failing to respond to authorized methods of discovery (Plaintiff’s
Requests for Production of Documents, Form Interrogatories, and Special
Interrogatories), and (2) defendant Kittrich has engaged in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process by (i) willfully disobeying the court’s January
31, 2023 and February 2, 2023 orders to serve responses and produce responsive
documents to discovery, and (ii) failing to respond to authorized methods of
discovery (Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents and Special
Interrogatories).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subds. (g), (d).)  
The court has also concluded that Defendants’ failure to serve answers
and produce responsive documents to the subject sets of discovery is
prejudicial to Plaintiff, since the discovery requests at issue go to the heart
of Plaintiff’s claim that Defendants violated Proposition 65 by failing to
provide a clear and reasonable warning of the presence of DINP to California
consumers and users of the subject product as set forth above.  (Compl., ¶ 29.)  Further, the evidence shows that the less
severe sanction of monetary sanctions issued by the court against Midland in
the court’s January 23, 2023, January 24, 2023, and January 26, 2023 orders and
against Kittrich in the court’s January 31, 2023 and February 23, 2023 orders
has not produced compliance by Defendants with the discovery rules or the
court’s orders.  Finally, Defendants have
not filed opposition papers or other evidence with the court disputing their
failure to comply with the court’s orders. 
The court therefore finds that it is appropriate, and exercises its
discretion, to impose terminating sanctions against Defendants pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (d).
The court denies Plaintiff’s alternative requests for the imposition
of issue and/or evidence sanctions as moot.
