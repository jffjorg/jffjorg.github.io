[Tentative]
  Order RE:
 
defendants’ motion to stay



 
MOVING PARTIES:
            Defendants Religious
Technology Center, Church of Scientology International, and Bridge
Publications, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Jane Doe
Motion to Stay
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendants Religious Technology Center, Church of Scientology
International, and Bridge Publications, Inc. (“Defendants”) move the court for
an order staying this action, filed by plaintiff Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”),
pending resolution of Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration, which
Defendants filed[1] on
September 18, 2023 and is set for hearing on May 30, 2024.  
“If an application has been made to a court of competent jurisdiction,
whether in this State or not, for an order to arbitrate a controversy which is
an issue involved in an action or proceeding pending before a court of this
State and such application is undetermined, the court in which such action or
proceeding is pending shall, upon motion of a party to such action or
proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until the application for an order to
arbitrate is determined . . . .”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)  Code of
Civil Procedure section 1281.4 “is clear and unambiguous: it requires that the
trial court stay an action pending before it while an application to arbitrate
the subject matter of the action is pending in a court of competent
jurisdiction.”  (Twentieth Century Fox
Film Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 188, 192.) 
Because Defendants have filed a motion to compel arbitration, the
court is required to stay Plaintiff’s action against them until the court rules
on their motion to compel arbitration. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.) 
The court therefore grants Defendants’ motion.  
ORDER
            The court grants defendants
Religious Technology Center, Church of Scientology International, and Bridge
Publications, Inc.’s motion to stay. 
            The court orders that this action,
as filed by plaintiff Jane Doe against defendants Religious Technology Center,
Church of Scientology International, and Bridge Publications, Inc., is stayed
pending the court’s resolution of defendants Religious Technology Center,
Church of Scientology International, and Bridge Publications, Inc.’s motion to
compel arbitration. 
            The court orders that the hearing on
defendants Religious Technology Center, Church of Scientology International,
and Bridge Publications, Inc.’s motion to compel arbitration is advanced from
May 30, 2024, to February 16, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders defendants
Religious Technology Center, Church of Scientology International, and Bridge
Publications, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  October 27, 2023
