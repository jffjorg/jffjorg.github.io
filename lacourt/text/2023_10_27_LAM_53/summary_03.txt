And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to stay the plaintiff's action pending the resolution of the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The defendants, Religious Technology Center, Church of Scientology International, and Bridge Publications, Inc., filed the motion to stay, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4, which requires the court to stay the action if an application to arbitrate is pending in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Judge finds that the defendants have filed a motion to compel arbitration and therefore must stay the plaintiff's action until the court rules on the motion. The Judge orders that the action is stayed pending the court's resolution of the motion to compel arbitration and advances the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration from May 30, 2024, to February 16, 2024.
