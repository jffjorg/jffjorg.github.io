And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc., granting their motions for terminating sanctions against defendants Midland Hardware Company No. 4 and Kittrich Corporation. The defendants have failed to comply with court orders and discovery requests, despite warnings and penalties. The court finds that the less severe sanction of monetary sanctions has not produced compliance, and therefore, terminating sanctions are appropriate. The court orders the stricken of the defendants' answer, a request for entry of default, and an order to show cause for default judgment.
