Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint with leave to amend. The plaintiff, Alfonzo Star, alleged that the defendant, San Fernando Valley Community Mental Health Center, Inc., made false representations to a judge regarding his participation in a diversion program, resulting in his incarceration. The defendant demurred to the complaint on grounds of lack of sufficient facts, procedural defects, and litigation privilege.

The judge found that the complaint is procedurally defective due to its failure to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 2.112, which requires each cause of action to be headed with a brief description of the claim and the defendant(s) against whom the claim is being asserted. The judge also found that the complaint is uncertain due to its failure to state which facts apply to which causes of action.

The judge granted the defendant's demurrer and gave the plaintiff 30 days to file an amended complaint. The judge's ruling is subject to change after the plaintiff files the amended complaint.
