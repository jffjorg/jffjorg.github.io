  Case Number:  20SMCV00872    Hearing Date:   June 26, 2024    Dept:  I The court is in receipt of plaintiff’s status conference
statement and supplemental statement.  The
parties to the action told the court that they had reached a deal in principal
in October 2022.  The deal was signed as
of May 3, 2023—over a year ago.  It
contemplated a prompt sale or, if there was no such sale, then an auction to
occur in November 2023.  It is now late
June 2024.  Promise of purchase after
promise of purchase has been made, but none seem to materialize.  Plaintiff is entitled to enforce the
settlement agreement and the court agrees with plaintiff’s position.  The auction will occur on August 3,
2024.  If a firm deal is reached prior to
that time, plaintiff indicates it will support the deal and cooperate in taking
the auction off calendar, and this court would very likely support such a
request.  But it is time for the works to
be sold and the case to end.  The court
simply lacks confidence in any of the promises that there is a better deal
actually to be had.
