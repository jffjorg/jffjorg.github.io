Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge has reviewed the information presented and has made a tentative ruling on the case. The demurrer is OVERRULED, and the motion to strike is DENIED. The plaintiff alleges that they rented property from the defendant, paid a security deposit, and made repairs to the property after the lease was terminated. The defendant refused to return the security deposit, leading the plaintiff to sue for breach of contract, violation of Civil Code section 1950.5, unfair competition, and fraud.

The Judge found that the plaintiff's pleading is sufficient to move forward with the case, as it is clear that the security deposit must be returned to the tenant unless damage was caused to the property. The Judge also found that the pleading is sufficient for fraud, as taking a security deposit with no intention to return it at the conclusion of the lease is fraud in the inducement.

The motion to strike the punitive damages allegations is without merit, as the fraud cause of action will support the punitive damages prayer. The defendant has 14 calendar days to answer.
