And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has reviewed the plaintiff's status conference statement and supplemental statement. The parties had reached a deal in principal in October 2022 and signed it on May 3, 2023. The deal contemplated a prompt sale or an auction in November 2023. However, despite promises of purchase, no sales or auction have materialized. The Judge agrees with the plaintiff's position that they are entitled to enforce the settlement agreement. As a result, the auction will take place on August 3, 2024. If a firm deal is reached before then, the plaintiff will support the deal and cooperate in taking the auction off calendar. However, the Judge lacks confidence in the promises of better deals and believes it is time for the works to be sold and the case to end.
