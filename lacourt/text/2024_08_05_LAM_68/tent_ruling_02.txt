SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
March 11, 2022,, Defendant Jeff Kern, et al. entered into an agreement with
Plaintiff APB Properties, Inc. for the purchase of certain commercial property
located at 6342 Pacific Bl., Huntington Park. The purchase price was
$2,050,000, with a 90-day escrow period. Kern deposited $60,000. Subsequent
negotiations based on requests for repair led to a reduction in price, with
escrow closing date remaining May 31, 2022. Plaintiff buyer failed to follow through
on the purchase. APB Properties, Inc. seeks the $60,000 deposit as liquidated damages.
 
On
February 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of Written Contract

Contract and Declaratory Relief on April 13, 2024, with the answer filed on
April 14, 2023. Kern alleges APB Properties, Inc. withheld material information
on the condition of the property, thereby breaching the purchase contract. 
 
On
May 19, 2023, the court granted the motion to compel arbitration. On December
27, 2023, the court terminated the arbitration order and lifted the stay. APB
Properties, Inc. answered the cross-complaint on December 28, 2023.
