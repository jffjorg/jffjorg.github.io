And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Defendant, RLoom, LLC fka OneWorld Apparel, LLC, to serve the Cross-Defendant, Catherine Yan, with the operative cross-complaint individually via email service. The Defendant argues that due to the "arduous" process in Mainland China, it is seeking alternative means for a shorter wait period.

The judge denied the motion without prejudice, finding that the plain language of the statute (Code of Civil Procedure section 413.30) does not provide for service of a foreign national via email. The judge also cited established case law and the Hague Service Convention, which requires compliance with specific rules for service abroad.

The judge noted that the Defendant admitted the binding requirements of the Hague Service Convention but requested an alternative means of service due to the difficulty in serving a foreign national in Mainland China. The judge declined to disregard the plain language of the statute and the Hague Convention treaty, even if the Defendant had actual notice of the lawsuit.

The court allowed the Defendant to potentially seek leave to apply for service by publication, which is a method of service that does not require the transmission of documents abroad and does not implicate the Hague Service Convention.
