Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the defendants and has made a tentative ruling. The defendants demurred to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, alleging that they held a valid lease, that the plaintiff's eviction was defective, and that the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance applies to the subject properties.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action with 10 days' leave to amend, finding that the allegations of the complaint are uncertain and do not state a cause of action. The court has overruled the demurrer to the second and third causes of action, finding that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim.

The court has also considered the defendants' motion for a protective order, which was filed in a separate civil action involving the same parties. The court has denied the motion, finding that the discovery requests are not duplicative or overly broad.

The court has scheduled a hearing to review the tentative ruling and has asked the parties to meet and confer to discuss any outstanding issues.
