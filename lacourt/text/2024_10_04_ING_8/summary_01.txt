And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 24TRCV02286, denying Plaintiff Alan Richard Vasquez's motion to relate the small claims action 23IWSC01008 and the fraudulent conveyance case, and also denying Plaintiff's request for waiver of notice. The judge finds that the court lacks jurisdiction over Defendant Yanira Yvette Covarrubias because Defendant was not served with the summons and complaint, and therefore, the court cannot rule on the related cases or waive Defendant's right to notice. The judge notes that Plaintiff has made diligent efforts to serve Defendant, but these efforts are not sufficient to waive Defendant's right to notice. The judge orders Plaintiff to demonstrate further diligence in serving Defendant and, if Plaintiff is unable to serve Defendant, to apply to the court for service by publication.
