And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by defendants Eric Chen and Ying Xu to the complaint filed by plaintiffs George Rappard, M.D., and Los Angeles Minimally Invasive Surgery Center, LLC. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to pay the amounts owed under medical liens for treatment provided to defendant Yuan Luo. The defendants argue that the liens only require them to withhold settlement funds, rather than actually pay the amounts owed.

The judge has ruled that the demurrers are OVERRULED in their entirety. The judge found that the language in the Lien Assignments, which was signed by all parties, including the defendants, indicates that the defendants are responsible for paying the amounts owed under the liens. The judge also found that the defendants' argument that they only needed to withhold the amounts owed, rather than actually pay them, defies common sense and is not supported by the language of the Lien Assignments.

The judge has also ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the fifth cause of action, which alleges intentional interference with prospective economic relations, is OVERRULED. The judge found that the plaintiff has alleged intentional acts by the defendants, in that they failed to pay the liens despite knowledge of an existing obligation to do so.

Finally, the judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the sixth cause of action, which alleges conversion, is OVERRULED. The judge found that the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants converted the liens by failing to pay the amounts owed, despite having knowledge of the plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the liens.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file an answer to the complaint within 21 days of this ruling.
