And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns the motions of Defendants Vartanian and Patatanyan to have matters in their Requests for Admission (Set One) deemed admitted. The case arises from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on October 15, 2022, at the intersection of Baldwin Avenue and Stanford Drive in Arcadia, California. Plaintiff Leus has claimed personal injuries as a result of the accident.

The parties conducted initial written discovery, and on July 9, 2024, Defendants served their respective Requests for Admission on Plaintiff. However, Plaintiff failed to respond to the requests, despite the fact that a response was due on August 13, 2024. As a result, Defendants have moved to have the truth of the matters specified in the requests deemed admitted.

The Court has reviewed the evidence and finds that the motions are GRANTED. The Court notes that the Code of Civil Procedure allows the requesting party to file a motion to deem admissions admitted if the responding party fails to serve a response that is in substantial compliance before the hearing. Since Plaintiff failed to respond to the requests for admissions, the Court has granted the motions.

The moving parties are ordered to give notice of the tentative ruling.
