And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of LKQ Pick Your Part's motion to compel Patris Sobouti's responses to their interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents (RFPD). The judge finds that Sobouti failed to timely respond to the discovery demands and that the responses provided were unverified. The judge grants the motion and orders Sobouti to provide valid responses within 30 days. Additionally, the judge awards sanctions against Sobouti in the amount of $750, which is to be paid within 30 days. The judge notes that Sobouti's failure to oppose the motion and provide timely responses constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.
