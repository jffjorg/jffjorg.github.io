Summary:

The tentative ruling is a response to the Los Angeles Unified School District's demurrer to the complaint filed by Terri Milner, the mother of a minor child, alleging racial harassment by an LAUSD employee. The Court finds that the plaintiff's causes of action for General Negligence and Intentional Tort are deficient and sustains the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court also notes that the plaintiff's claims may be barred by the Government Claims Act and that the plaintiff's capacity to sue and representation of her minor child are disputed issues that may require further clarification.
