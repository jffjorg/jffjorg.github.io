```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for a preliminary injunction filed by Victor Shaw and Elsa Shaw against George Maida and Samia Maida. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants have been trespassing on their property and engaging in willful and negligent conduct, causing damage to their property and emotional distress.

The judge is weighing the likelihood of the plaintiffs prevailing on the merits and whether irreparable harm would occur if the injunction is denied. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits and that irreparable harm could occur if the defendants continue to trespass on the plaintiffs' property.

The judge also finds that the balance of equities weighs in favor of the plaintiffs, as they will be injured if the injunction is denied, whereas the defendants will not be harmed if the injunction is granted. The judge concludes that the motion for a preliminary injunction should be granted, but notes that no bond will be required.

The judge will issue a final ruling after considering the evidence presented at the hearing.
