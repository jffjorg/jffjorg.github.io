And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the motion for attorney fees in the amount of $407,367, which is a reduction from the originally requested amount of $619,675. The judge determined that the fees actually incurred were $543,156, and reduced the requested fees by 25% due to excessive billing for certain tasks. The judge considered the factors from Church of Scientology v. Wollersheim (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628 in determining the reasonableness of the fees, including the amount of money involved, the nature of the litigation, the skill required, the attention given, the success of the attorneys, and the time consumed. The judge also considered the objections raised by the defendants, including the argument that the fees were excessively inflated. The judge awarded the reduced amount of $407,367, which includes the fees actually incurred and a 25% reduction for the excessive billing.
