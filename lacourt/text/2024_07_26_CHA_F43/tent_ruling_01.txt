SUMMARY OF
ACTION
Plaintiff Hamid
Reza Mirshojae (Hamid) and Defendant Ahang Zarin Mirshojae (Ahang) were formerly
married and were engaged in extensive litigation against each other prior to
2017. The assets in dispute were in excess of $20 million. At mediation, Hamid
and Ahang entered a complex settlement agreement. Immediately after, Hamid
alleges that Ahang breached the settlement agreement, and he was forced to
incur attorney fees to enforce various terms of the agreement. Eventually,
Hamid filed the current suit to enforce the settlement agreement on October 12,
2021.
 
Ahang accused
Hamid and his counsel of inducing her to sign the settlement agreement and sued
him for $7 million in damages. This Court eventually struck Ahang’s complaint
based on Plaintiffs’ anti-SLAPP motion and determined that Ahang was a
vexatious litigant. After this ruling, Ahang attempted to disqualify Hamid’s
lead counsel, though that motion was rejected. Hamid alleges that he has
incurred significant legal fees over the course of this litigation.
 
Finally, after
two years of litigation, the parties settled via a 998 Offer on November 17,
2023. The 998 Offer required Defendants to pay Plaintiffs $270,000 and
reasonable fees and costs as determined by the Court. Plaintiffs are requesting
attorney fees pursuant to the part of the 998 Offer that allows for reasonable
fees to be paid.
 
Plaintiffs are
requesting $619,675 in attorney fees from Defendants. Plaintiffs argue in their
motion that the attorney fees and hourly rates are reasonable. Plaintiffs’
evidence in support of their request for attorney fees included a declaration
from their attorney, Christopher Beatty, and billing statements (with some
redactions) that show which attorney worked on a task, what the task was, and
how much time was spent on the task. (Beatty Decl., Ex. H.) The Beatty
Declaration also includes a table which shows the hourly rates of the attorneys
who worked on the case and their hourly rates at different times. (Beatty
Decl., ¶ 35.)
Christopher
Beatty’s hourly rates were $950 (for 2.5 hours in 2021), $975 (for 19.2 hours
in 2022), and $1,300 (for 1.5 hours in 2022 and 71.6 hours in 2023). Tami K.
Sims’ hourly rate was $1,115 (for 83.4 hours in 2023). Trevor T. Garney’s
hourly rate was $955 (for 87.8 hours in 2023). Arron J. Pak’s hourly rate was
$705 (for 277.3 hours in 2023). Minh-Van Do’s hourly rates were $795 (for 0.5
hours in 2021) and $840 (for 76.1 hours in 2022). Benjamin Mandel’s hourly rate
was $595 (for 89.6 hours in 2022). Finally, Scarlet Speakmore’s hourly rate was
$350 (for 38.8 hours in 2022).
 
The total
lodestar was calculated by multiplying each of these attorney’s hourly rate by
their hours worked then adding them all together. The total hours worked for
the attorneys totaled 748.3. The total lodestar amount, as previously noted, is
$619,675.
 
Plaintiffs have
also requested costs in the amount $17,036.01. However, costs are awarded
pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700. If Plaintiffs wish to
request costs, Plaintiffs should file a memorandum of costs at the appropriate
time.
 
Defendants’
Evidentiary Objections to the Declaration of Keith M. Maziarek:
            Sustained: Entire Declaration
(irrelevant), Paragraph 11
            Overruled: None
 
Plaintiffs’
Evidentiary Objections to the Declaration of June D. Coleman and the
Declaration of Raffi Kassabian: The individual evidentiary objections presented
by Plaintiffs to these two declarations are not consecutively numbered.
Typically, when written objections to evidence are filed, the “written
objection must be number consecutively.” (See Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1354
(applies to written objections to evidence for summary judgment motions).)
While Plaintiffs listed them by paragraph number from the declarations, this is
not necessarily effective, because in some instances Plaintiffs objected to
different sentences from the same paragraph and listed them separately with the
same paragraph number. The Court will not rule on the individual evidentiary
objections based on this procedural deficiency. Plaintiffs have objected to the
entire Coleman Declaration on the basis that it is improper expert testimony
because Coleman has not shown any special knowledge, skill, etc., related to
billing for these types of cases pursuant to Evidence Code § 720. The Court has
determined that Coleman has sufficiently demonstrated her special knowledge as
a fee expert with this declaration and her recently submitted supplemental
declaration. Plaintiffs’ objection to the entire Coleman Declaration is
overruled.
 
On April 9,
2024, a hearing was held on Plaintiffs’ motion for attorney fees. That same
day, the Court issued a ruling on the submitted matter requesting that the
parties submit additional briefing and that Plaintiffs submit invoices that do
not redact the lawyers’ hourly rates or the amounts billed, along with
supplemental points and authorities supporting their fee requests in light of
that information.
 
On May 24,
2024, Plaintiffs submitted their supplemental brief. In their brief, Plaintiffs
argue that the Court should award standard hourly rates and that the fees
sought for all tasks are reasonable. Plaintiffs submitted new billing records that
still contain some redactions, but they do not redact the lawyers’ hourly rates
or the amounts billed.
 
On June 25,
2024, Defendants submitted their supplemental opposition brief. Defendants
argue that the Court should significantly reduce the fees requested by
Plaintiffs. Defendants also argue that the Court should consider Defendants’
expert declaration. Defendants also acknowledge that Plaintiffs conceded that
the actual hourly rates and amounts billed are not privileged.
 
ANALYSIS
A prevailing
party is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees when authorized by contract,
statute, or law. (See CCP § 1033.5(a)(10); Cal. Civ. Code § 1717(a).) “A
successful party means a prevailing party, and [a party] may be considered
prevailing parties for attorney’s fees purposes if they succeed on any
significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties
sought in bringing suit.” (Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2005) 131
Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)
 
Plaintiffs are
the prevailing party by virtue of the fact that the parties settled in
Plaintiffs’ favor via the 998 Offer. Plaintiffs have requested a total of $619,675
in attorney fees.
 
Defendants previously
opposed Plaintiffs’ motion on the basis that Plaintiffs agreed only to recover
fees actually incurred and according to proof in the 998 Offer, and Defendants
argued that Plaintiffs have not provided this proof. However, this argument was
resolved with Plaintiffs’ supplemental brief, as Plaintiffs have now provided
unredacted hourly rates and amounts billed.
 
Plaintiffs’
attorney Christopher D. Beatty acknowledges in his supplemental declaration
that the actual amount charged to the client was $543,156. (Beatty Supp. Decl.,
¶ 5.) Defendants argue in their supplemental opposition that this should be the
baseline from which any reductions in the requested amount should be made.
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs should only be able to recover fees actually
incurred because that is what the 998 Offer between the parties allowed. (See San
Dieguito P’ship, L.P. v. San Dieguito River Valley Reg’l Open Spake Park Joint
Powers Auth. (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 910, disapproved on other grounds by PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084.) The Court agrees. Plaintiffs
should only recover the fees actually incurred, which in this case is, at a
maximum, $543,156.
 
Next,
Defendants contest the reasonableness of the fees incurred by Plaintiffs.
 
In determining
the reasonableness of fees, courts look to the factors from Church of
Scientology v. Wollersheim (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628, disapproved on other
grounds by Equilon Enters. v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53,
68 n.5. The factors from Wollersheim are (1) the amount of money
involved in the litigation; (2) the nature of the litigation and its difficulty
and the intricacies and importance of the litigation; (3) the skill required
and employed in handling the litigation, the necessity for skilled legal
training and ability in trying the case, and counsel’s education and experience
in the particular type of work involved; (4) the attention given to the case; (5)
the success of the attorneys efforts; and (6) the time consumed by the
litigation. (Id.)
 
Plaintiffs
argued in the initial motion that they met all of these factors. First,
Plaintiffs argue that large amounts of money were involved in this litigation
because of Ahang’s cross-complaint for $7 million and the fact that the
original settlement agreement divided the parties’ assets that were valued in
excess of $20 million. Next, for the second factor, Plaintiffs argue that the
nature of this case was an emotional case between two ex-spouses and business
partners with significant assets at issue, and Ahang had been determined by the
Court to have engaged in fraud. For the third factor, Plaintiffs argued that
this was a complex case that required an experienced legal team to handle it,
and Beatty’s team were the logical ones to handle it because Beatty had handled
the cases that led to the settlement agreement. For the fourth factor, Plaintiffs
argued that their counsel had to devote significant attention to this case. For
the fifth factor, Plaintiffs argued that their counsel had success throughout
the case in prevailing on the anti-SLAPP motion and defeating the attempt to
disqualify Beatty, as well as being the prevailing party for the 998 Offer.
Finally, for the sixth factor, Plaintiffs argued that this case consumed
considerable time and went on for two years and would have gone on much longer
if Hamid had not accepted the 998 Offer.
 
Defendants
argue that the attorney fee award should be reduced as the hours billed are
excessively unreasonable. “A fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is
a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny
one altogether.” (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970,
990-991(citing Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635).)
 
This Court
previously acknowledged in its tentative ruling the apparent excessive billing
for several of Plaintiffs’ motions: the Anti-SLAPP Motion (160.5 hours),
Opposition to Motion to Disqualify (96.5 hours), Demurrer (90.2 hours), Motion
for Attorney fees re Anti-SLAPP Motion (49 hours), and Motion to Quash Summons
(38.6 hours). This Court also suggested reducing the time spent on those
motions by 25%. Defendants argue that they should be reduced by at least 60%
because they are beyond excessive.
 
Other specific
tasks that Defendants argue were excessively billed were the 4.0 hours for a
half-page notice of continuance; 12.1 hours for a subpoena with 8 document
requests; 14.7 hours spent on two identical subpoenas with 6 document requests;
22.3 hours spent on 3 page ex parte application and 2 page declaration to advance
a hearing date; 18.3 hours preparing for and drafting a mediation brief; and
10.3 hours on generic case analysis over 48 entries. Defendants argue that the
Court should also take into account all of these minor issues in awarding the
attorney fees. 
 
Defendants also
argue that the at least 209.5 hours spent in relation to the Anti-SLAPP motion
was beyond excessive and should be reduced by more than 25%. Defendants cite a
case where the Court of Appeal affirmed a reduction in attorney fees and costs
related to an Anti-SLAPP motion from $112,288.63 to just $23,000, with the
Court of Appeal stating that “claiming 200 hours of work” … “seems excessive”
and that such “a motion should not have been such a monumental undertaking.” (Maughan
v. Google Technology, Inc. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1248-1252.)
Defendant 
 
Finally,
Defendants argue that the Court should consider Defendants’ expert declaration
because it would be admissible because the experts declaration included
descriptions of her experience as a fee expert. (See Coleman Decl., ¶¶ 3-10,
14, and 15.) The Court previously sustained Plaintiffs’ objections to the
Coleman Declaration, but in light of Defendants’ arguments and Coleman’s
supplemental declaration, the Court will consider Coleman’s declaration.
 
In light of all
of the foregoing, the Court believes that some reduction of the requested fees
is necessary. Both the previously indicated major issues and the minor issues
that Defendants have brought to the attention of the Court should be reduced.
 
The amount that
the Court will start with is $543,156 in fees actually incurred. The Court
previously considered reducing certain fees by 25%. Defendants request an
across the board reduction of 60%, which would be $217,262 in fees awarded.
Alternatively, Defendants request that the Court do an across the board
reduction of 25%, since that percentage is what the Court previously found was
appropriate. Based on both the major and minor issues with the billing records,
the Court agrees that an across the board reduction is appropriate. The Court
also finds that an across the board reduction of 25% is reasonable. That would
make the fee award $407,367.
 
The Court will
award this amount. Plaintiffs have demonstrated that their attorneys’ hourly
rates are rates are reasonable. Furthermore, this was a complex class requiring
a lot of motion practice, particularly where the Anti-SLAPP motion is concerned.
Plaintiffs have provided proof of the amount of time spent on the case through
the now-unredacted billing statements.
 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiffs’
motion for attorney fees is granted in the amount of $407,367.00. Costs should
be requested in a memorandum of costs.
