Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment entered in 2019. The defendant claims that the judgment was the result of his attorney's gross negligence and seeks time to get new counsel to contest the validity of the judgment. However, the judge finds that the defendant has not met the elements for extrinsic fraud or mistake and has not demonstrated a meritorious case.

The judge has also denied the defendant's motion to quash the subpoena, citing that there is no basis for quashing the subpoena and that the defendant has not provided any substantive evidence to support his claims. The judge notes that a motion to quash subpoena is not the appropriate means to contest the validity of a judgment.

The judge concludes that the defendant's motions to vacate the judgment and quash the subpoena are denied.
