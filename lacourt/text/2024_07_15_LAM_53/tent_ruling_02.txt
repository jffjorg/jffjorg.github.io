Order
  RE:
 
plaintiff’s ex parte application for leave
  to file or in the alternative ost iso motion for reconsideration of petition
  for injunctive relief and sanctions
 



 
 
On July 12, 2024, Plaintiff
filed “Plaintiff’s Notice and Ex Parte Application for Leave to File or in the
Alternative OST ISO Motion for Reconsideration of Petition for Injunctive
Relief and Sanctions,” which is set on the court’s calendar for July 15, 2024. 
            First,
Plaintiff filed two previous ex parte applications seeking a preliminary
injunction, which were presented to and denied by the court on June 18 and July
2, 2024.  Plaintiff’s ex parte
application for reconsideration of those orders is not based on new or
different facts, circumstances, or law, as required by Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, subdivision (a).    
Second, the court finds that
plaintiff has not satisfied the requirement of California Rules of Court, rule
3.1202, subdivision (c), that an applicant for an ex parte order must make an
affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based
on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory
basis for granting relief ex parte.
Courts may, in ruling on a
request for injunctive relief, take into consideration a plaintiff’s delay in
determining the existence of imminent irreparable injury.  (O’Connell v. Superior Court (2006)
141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481 [noting that “the urgency with which the trial court
was forced to decide plaintiffs’ motion may have been, to some extent, of
plaintiffs’ own making—a fact that the trial court, as a court of equity,
should have taken into account in determining what weight to give plaintiffs’
claim of imminent irreparable injury”]; Lusk v. Krejci (1960) 187
Cal.App.2d 553, 556 [“Long delays in assertion of rights can be the basis of
denial of mandatory injunctive relief”].) 
Here, Plaintiff has filed ex parte applications for preliminary
injunction based on (1) an alleged illegal lockout and wrongful eviction that
occurred on December 22, 2021, and (2) an alleged violation that occurred on or
about November 14, 2022.  (Plaintiff’s Ex
Parte Application, filed July 1, 2024, p. 2:20-26; Plaintiff’s Ex Parte
Application filed July 12, 2024, p. 2:19-23.)
Third, the court does
not find good cause to grant Plaintiff’s request for an order shortening time
on the hearing on the relief requested in the ex parte application or to
prescribe shorter times for the filing and service of papers than the times
specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300, subd.
(b).) 
The court therefore denies Plaintiff’s ex parte application for leave
for OST or in the alternative ex parte hearing of his request for reconsideration
of the court’s June 18 and July 2, 2024
orders denying Plaintiff’s ex parte applications for preliminary injunction.  
            The court orders Plaintiff to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  July 15, 2024
