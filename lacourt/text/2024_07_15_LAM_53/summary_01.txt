And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mary Erickson vs. Intercity Fellowship Hall, et al., setting aside the hearing on the Order to Show Cause re why Defendant's answer should not be stricken because it is a corporation not represented by counsel. The Judge finds that the Defendant is improperly representing itself in propria persona and has not retained counsel. The Judge grants its own motion to strike the Defendant's answer to the Plaintiff's Complaint and orders the Plaintiff to file a Request for Entry of Default and default judgment documents. The Judge also sets a new hearing date for the entry of default and default judgment.
