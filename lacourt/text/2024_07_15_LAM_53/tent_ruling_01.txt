Order to Show Cause re Why Defendant Intercity Fellowship Hall’s Answer
Should Not be Stricken Because it is a Corporation Not Represented by Counsel
            On March 22, 2024, the motion to be
relieved as counsel for defendant Intercity Fellowship Hall (“Defendant”),
filed by attorney Zachary McCready, came before the court.  The court issued an order on that date (1) noting
that Defendant filed, on March 6, 2024, a “Substitution of Attorney – Civil”
form, stating that Defendant is substituting in as counsel to represent itself
in this action in place of counsel, (2) finding that the motion to be relieved
as counsel was therefore moot, and (3) setting an Order to Show Cause re why
Defendant’s answer should not be stricken because it is a corporation not
represented by counsel for hearing on June 10, 2024.  (Mar. 22, 2024 Order, pp. 1:20-28, 2:5-8.)  The court further ordered plaintiff Mary
Erickson (“Plaintiff”) to give notice of that ruling. 
On June 10, 2024, the court issued an order finding that Plaintiff did
not serve a notice of the court’s March 22, 2024 ruling on Defendant.  (June 10, 2024 Order, p. 2:5-8.)  The court therefore exercised its discretion
to continue the hearing on the Order to Show Cause to July 15, 2024.  (Id. at p. 2:9-13.)  The court further ordered that any response
to the Order to Show Cause shall be filed no later than nine court days before
the hearing.  (Id. at p. 2:14-15.)

            First, the court finds that
Plaintiff has given Defendant notice of the pending Order to Show Cause re why
Defendant’s answer should not be stricken as a corporation unrepresented by
counsel.  (June 10, 2024 Notice of
Ruling, p. 7 [proof of service by certified mail to Defendant at 5881 Cherry
Avenue, Long Beach, California]; March 6, 2024 Substitution of Attorney,
MC-050, ¶ 2 [listing Defendant’s address to be 5881 Cherry Avenue, Long Beach,
California].) 
            Second, the court finds that
Defendant is improperly representing itself in this action. 
            “[U]nder a long-standing common law rule
of procedure, a corporation, unlike a natural person, cannot represent itself
before courts of record in propria persona, nor can it represent itself through
a corporate officer, director or other employee who is not an attorney.¿ It
must be represented by licensed counsel in proceedings before courts of
record.”¿ (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120
Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.)¿¿ 
            Defendant is a corporation.  (Mot. to be Relieved as Counsel, MC-051, ¶ 4,
subd. (b) [Defendant is a corporation]; Def. Answer, ¶ 5 [“Admitted that INTERCITY
FELLOWSHIP HALL, is a California corporation”].)  Thus, Defendant is required to be represented
by counsel in this action.  (CLD
Construction, Inc., supra, 120 Cal.App.4th at p. 1145.)  However, on March 6, 2024, Defendant filed a
“Substitution of Attorney” form (Judicial Council form MC-050), stating that it
was substituting in to represent itself in this action in place of attorney
Zachary McCready.  (Def. March 6, 2024
Sub. of Attorney, MC-050, ¶¶ 1-2.) 
Defendant has not (1) filed another Substitution of Attorney form
stating that it is now represented by counsel, or (2) filed a response to the
Order to Show Cause or other evidence with the court establishing that it has
since retained counsel. 
            Thus, the court finds that Defendant
is improperly representing itself in propria persona and therefore grants its
own motion to strike Defendant’s answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b) [court
may, at any time in its discretion, strike a pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state].)
 
            The court orders that “Defendant
Intercity Fellowship Hall’s Answer to Plaintiff Mary Erickson’s Initial
Complaint; Jury Trial Demanded,” filed by defendant Intercity Fellowship Hall
on June 2, 2023, is stricken. 
            The court orders plaintiff Mary
Erickson to file a Request for Entry of Default (Judicial Council form CIV-100)
as to defendant Intercity Fellowship Hall no later than 10 days from the date
of this order. 
            The court orders that trial, set for
April 16, 2025, is vacated. 
            The court orders that the final
status conference, set for April 4, 2025, is vacated. 
            The court sets an Order to Show
Cause re entry of default and default judgment for hearing on November 4, 2024,
at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders plaintiff Mary
Erickson to file default judgment documents required by California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800 (including a proposed judgment on JUD-100) no later than
September 26, 2024.   
            The court orders plaintiff Mary
Erickson to give notice of this ruling. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  July 15, 2024
