And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's ex parte application for leave to file or in the alternative OST ISO motion for reconsideration of petition for injunctive relief and sanctions. The court finds that the application is not based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a). Additionally, the court finds that the plaintiff has not satisfied the requirement of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c), that an applicant for an ex parte order must make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte.

The court also considers the plaintiff's delay in determining the existence of imminent irreparable injury, which may be taken into account in ruling on the request for injunctive relief. The plaintiff has filed two previous ex parte applications seeking a preliminary injunction, which were denied.

Based on these findings, the court denies the plaintiff's ex parte application for leave to file or in the alternative OST ISO motion for reconsideration of petition for injunctive relief and sanctions. The court orders the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
