  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion for issue, evidence, or
  terminating sanctions against plaintiff
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:             Defendant Alexandra R. McIntosh,
APC, joined by defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc., and Andrew Salas on
June 20, 2024  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Emilio Reyes
Motion for Issue, Evidence, or Terminating Sanctions Against Plaintiff
The court
considered the moving, joinder, opposition, and reply papers filed in
connection with this motion. 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court rules on defendant
Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC’s evidentiary objections, filed on July 8, 2024, as
follows:
Objection No. 1 is sustained. 
            The
court overrules plaintiff Emilio Reyes’s objection to defendant Alexandra R.
McIntosh, APC’s reply papers because they were filed at least five court days
before the hearing on this motion.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
            The
court notes that plaintiff Emilio Reyes has also objected to “Defendant
Lorraine Ann Escobar’s Notice of Joinder and Joinder to Defendant Alexandra R.
McIntosh, APC’s Motion for Terminating, Etc., Sanctions, and Objection to
Plaintiff’s Declaration; [and] Declaration of Aidan W. Butler[.]”  (Pl. Objections, p. 2, ¶ 2.)  However, the court has not received any
filings from defendant Lorraine Ann Escobar joining the pending motion.  Thus, the court does not rule on this
objection.
DISCUSSION
Defendant Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC (“McIntosh”) moves the court for
an order imposing issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions against plaintiff
Emilio Reyes (“Plaintiff”) on the grounds that Plaintiff (1) failed to respond
or submit to authorized methods of discovery, and (2) disobeyed a court order
to provide discovery by refusing to answer questions at his deposition.  Defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc.,
and Andrew Salas (the “Los Indios Defendants”) filed a joinder to McIntosh’s
motion on June 20, 2024, asserting that the bases of McIntosh’s motion apply
equally to them. 
If
a party engages in a misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose
monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.030.)¿ Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010 provides, in relevant
part, that “[m]isuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to,
the following: . . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery. . . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.”¿  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).)  “The trial court
may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the
totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the
actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of
formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’”  (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)
First, the court denies McIntosh’s request for issue or evidence
sanctions because McIntosh did not request, in its notice of motion or
supporting memorandum, the imposition of specific issue or evidence sanctions
that it contends are warranted and tailored to the harm caused by Plaintiff’s
failure to respond to its questioning at his deposition.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (b)
[authorizing issue sanctions that (1) designated facts be taken as established
or (2) prohibiting any party from supporting or opposing designated claims or
defenses], (c) [authorizing evidence sanction prohibiting party from
introducing designated matters into evidence]; Lopez v. Watchtower Bible
& Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604
[court should select a sanction that is tailored to the harm caused by the
withheld discovery].) 
Second, the court finds that McIntosh has not justified its request
for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff.  
On May 1, 2024, the court issued an order (1) granting Los Indios
Defendants’ motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff, and (2) directing
Plaintiff to attend and testify in person at a deposition to be taken and
recorded by counsel for Los Indios Defendants on May 8, 2024.  (May 1, 2024 Order, pp. 3:26-4:4.)  On May 2, 2024, the court issued a minute
order modifying its May 1, 2024 order to order Plaintiff to appear for
deposition on May 30, 2024.  (May 2, 2024
Minute Order, p. 2.)
Plaintiff appeared for his deposition on May 30, 2024.  (Sisson Decl., ¶ 2.)  Prior to deposition, counsel for the named
defendants agreed that counsel for Los Indios Defendants would question
Plaintiff for four hours, counsel for McIntosh would question Plaintiff for one
and one-half hours, and counsel for nonmoving defendant Lorraine Escobar would
question Plaintiff for the remaining one and one-half hours.  (Sisson Decl., ¶ 3.)  However, at his deposition, Plaintiff asserted
that he was not given notice of McIntosh’s intent to question him and therefore
refused to submit to questioning by its counsel.[1]  (Def. Appendix of Evid., Ex. Z, Pl. Dep. pp. 211:3-20
[“Because I have no proper notice I am not answering any of your questions”], 212:25-213:11.)
Plaintiff contends that he did not refuse to attend his deposition and
was required only to submit to questioning by counsel for Los Indios
Defendants.  The court disagrees.  Plaintiff was required to allow counsel for
McIntosh (and nonmoving defendant Lorraine Escobar) to examine him at his
deposition.  Although the court’s May 1,
2024 order, in ruling on the motion filed solely by the Los Indios Defendants,
ordered Plaintiff to attend and testify at a deposition to be taken by counsel
for Los Indios Defendants, the law requires Plaintiff to submit to examination
by other parties at his deposition.  Moreover, there is no language in the court’s
May 1, 2024 order that precluded McIntosh (or nonmoving defendant Lorraine
Escobar) from questioning Plaintiff pursuant to such law.[2]

Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.610 and 2025.290, any
natural person, including a party to the action, may not be deposed more than
once, except upon a showing of good cause, and “a deposition examination of the
witness by all counsel, other than the witness’ counsel of record, shall
be limited to seven hours of total testimony.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.610, subds. (a) [no party “may take a
subsequent deposition of that deponent” once any party has taken the deposition
of any natural person], (b) [court may grant leave to take subsequent
deposition for good cause shown], 2025.290, subd. (a) [emphasis added].)  “This applies both to depositions by the party
who took the first depo[sition] and to any other party served with the
deposition notice.  I.e., all parties
are expected to examine the deponent during the first deposition.”  (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ.
Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 8:478 [emphasis in original].)  
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.330 provides that the “[e]xamination
and cross-examination of the deponent shall proceed as permitted at trial under
the provisions of the Evidence Code.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.330, subd. (d); Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2024) ¶ 8:709 [“All parties
present at the deposition have the right to cross-examine the deponent, just as
at trial”].)  At trial, a witness is
subject to the examination of all parties. 
(Evid. Code, §§ 711 [“At the trial of an action, a witness can be heard
only in the presence and subject to the examination of all the parties to
the action, if they choose to attend and examine [emphasis added], 773, subd.
(b), 776, subd. (b).)  Plaintiff was
therefore required to submit to examination by counsel for all defendants,
including McIntosh. 
Thus, the court finds that Plaintiff (1) violated the court’s May 1,
2024 order to attend and testify at a deposition, and (2) failed to respond or
submit to an authorized method of discovery. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (g), (d).)  The court further finds that McIntosh has
demonstrated that it has been prejudiced by Plaintiff’s conduct because
McIntosh did not have the opportunity to question Plaintiff regarding his
ability to establish the elements of each cause of action alleged against it,
the existence of an attorney-client relationship between McIntosh and
Plaintiff, and Plaintiff’s federal action. 
(Sisson Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.)
However, the court finds that McIntosh has not made a sufficient showing
to support terminating sanctions because, based on the record presented, McIntosh
has not presented argument or evidence showing (1) that Plaintiff’s actions
were willful, (2) the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery, or (3) that Plaintiff’s misuse of the discovery process set forth
above was preceded by a history of abuse. 
(Los Defensores, Inc., supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390.)  Moreover, the court finds that the less
severe remedy of directing Plaintiff to appear for a further session of his deposition
is an appropriate remedy to address the prejudice suffered by McIntosh as a
result of Plaintiff’s misuse of the discovery process.  (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.) 
The court therefore denies McIntosh’s request for terminating
sanctions, without prejudice to McIntosh’s filing a new motion for appropriate
monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions in the event that Plaintiff
does not comply with the order to complete his deposition and to permit, and
respond to, examination by counsel for McIntosh and the other defendants in
this action set forth below. 
Third, the court denies Los Indios Defendants’ joinder to McIntosh’s
motion.  Los Indios Defendants did not
present sufficient argument or evidence establishing that Plaintiff’s refusal
to submit to questioning by counsel for McIntosh harmed or prejudiced them,
such that the imposition of terminating sanctions in their favor and against
Plaintiff is warranted.  (Lopez, supra,
246 Cal.App.4th at p. 604 [sanctions must be tailored to the harm caused by
withheld discovery and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to, but denied, discovery].)  
ORDER
The court denies defendant Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC’s motion for
issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions, without prejudice to defendant
Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC’s filing a new motion for monetary, issue, evidence,
or terminating sanctions if plaintiff Emilio Reyes does not comply with the
court’s order set forth below.

person at a further session of deposition to allow counsel for defendant
Alexandra R. McIntosh, APC, and counsel for other defendants, to examine

10:00 a.m., at the following location: ___________________________________________________________________________.

            The court orders defendant Alexandra
R. McIntosh, APC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
