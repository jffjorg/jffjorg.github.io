And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, which involves a dispute over the ownership and possession of a commercial property. The Plaintiff, Norma Salceda, has filed a complaint alleging that the Defendant, Kelly Pelton, et al., have failed to comply with their obligations under a promise to transfer the property to Salceda.

The Judge has sustained the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's complaint, but has granted the Plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to address the statute of limitations arguments. The Judge has also consolidated the instant action with the Pasadena unlawful detainer action, and has stayed the unlawful detainer proceeding pending adjudication of the action.

The Judge has found that the allegations of the complaint sufficiently support a claim for disputed title, and has therefore granted the motion to consolidate the actions. The Judge has also stayed the unlawful detainer proceeding pending adjudication of the action, and has transferred the case to this department.

The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to give notice of the consolidation and stay, and has scheduled a Case Management Conference to be conducted concurrently with the consolidation.
