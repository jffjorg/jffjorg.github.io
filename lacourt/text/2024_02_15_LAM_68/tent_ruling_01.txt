SUMMARY
OF ACTION
In
October, 2001, Plaintiff Norma Salceda, commenced leasing 13672 Van Nuys Blvd.,
Pacoima, for operation of an OB/GYN medical practice on the premises. The
premises were owned by Nance Malmrose. Plaintiff and Malmrose were also
personal friends.
 
In
2010, Plaintiff offered to purchase the property from Malmrose. Two weeks
later, Malmrose rejected the purchase offer, and instead promised to bequeath
the property to Salceda at the time of death in to be reflected in an updated
will/estate plan. Following the promise, Plaintiff suggested conversion of the
property into a community healthcare center instead of continuing as an OB/GYN
clinic. Malmrose agreed. Plaintiff subsequently engaged in plans to convert the
premises, and began investing funds for the remodel plus working with
government agencies.
 
On
January 23, 2019, passed away intestate with no spouse or offspring. No will
was ever found, and Plaintiff accuses a private nurse to Malmrose, Ken Preston,
with absconding it. 
 
On
October 12, 2022, Ginger Brandenburg (Ginger), child of decedent’s “late
husband” Earl Malmrose (stepdaughter of Malmrose?) was awarded “100% of
Malmrose’s” estate valued at approximately “11 million dollars” (19STPB09601).
Ginger Brandenburg however passed away on September 24, 2022, two weeks before
the award. Ginger’s surviving husband, Joe Brandenburg, was designated trustee.
Joe subsequently resigned as trustee, thereby leading to the designation of
Kelly Brandenburg Pelton (Pelton) as successor trustee. A later probate
proceeding (23STPB00795) facilitated the transfer of all assets into the Brandenburg
family trust.
 
Plaintiff
alleges that prior to Ginger being awarded the estate, Plaintiff nevertheless
informed Ginger Brandenburg about the purported agreement to leave the
commercial premises for the community clinic. The wish of the property was
confirmed by a third party “financial advisor” affiliated with the Malmrose
estate. Ginger purportedly assured Plaintiff that the property would be
transferred in accordance with Malmore’s wishes upon appointment as
administrator. 
 
Plaintiff
elected to forego making any claim with the probate court (presumably in the
19STPB09601 action), though nothing in the operative complaint alleges any
actual forbearance agreement with any identified person. 
 
Plaintiff
also later met with counsel for Ginger in December 2020, Richard Hoefflin, who
also purportedly acknowledged the agreed upon transfer of the clinic.
Notwithstanding the purported “agreement,” Hoefflin informed Plaintiff that as
counsel for Ginger, representation was solely limited to the interests of
Ginger, and specifically disclaimed any representation of the interests of
Plaintiff in any capacity. Hoefflin also purportedly told Plaintiff that any
statute of limitations on a probate claim lapsed either way.
 
On
February 6, 2021, Ginger demanded a rental payment from Plaintiff. Plaintiff
subsequently began paying rent. Following other communications, the parties
entered into a seven month lease for the premises beginning on May 1, 2022, and
ending November 30, 2022. Following the death of Ginger, and assumption of
trustee duties by Pelton, a notice of termination of the lease was later
delivered stating that a month to month tenancy now existed on the property as
of June 30, 2023 (notwithstanding the lapse of the actual lease on November 30,
2022).
 
On
October 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Quasi Specific
Performance/Constructive Trust, Promissory Estoppel, and Unjust Enrichment, and
Elder Financial Abuse. On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Related
Cases for the instant action with Pasadena unlawful detainer action,
23PDUD02724. On October 24, 2023, the court declined to find the complaints
related. On October 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint for Quasi
Specific Performance/Constructive Trust, Promissory Estoppel, and Unjust
Enrichment. On December 14, 2023, Department 1 deemed the unlawful detainer
action related to the instant complaint. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Request
for Judicial Notice: Granted in Part/Denied in Part.
·        
The
court takes judicial notice of the request for dismissal. 
·        
The
court takes judicial notice of the Department 1 order for the existence of the
order deeming the cases related, but not any factual findings. (Kilroy v. State of California (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 140, 147-148; Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
·        
The court denies judicial notice of the Declaration of Richard Hoefflin.
 
Plaintiff
Salceda moves to stay the related unlawful detainer action or alternatively
consolidate the cases. Plaintiff moves for relief on grounds both cases involve
claims regarding ownership and possession of the property. Defendant in
opposition challenges the motion on grounds the instant action and the pending
unlawful detainer complaint lack common questions of law and fact. Defendant
specifically relies on the concurrently scheduled demurrer in support of the
argument, as well as a claim of prejudice. Defendant concludes that any stay
requires a preliminary injunction and posting of an undertaking. Plaintiff in
reply reiterates the propriety of consolidation. Plaintiff denies the necessity
of any application for preliminary injunction. 
 
“Trial courts generally have the inherent
power to stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote judicial
efficiency.” (Freiberg v. City of
Mission Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.) “Code of Civil
Procedure section 1048 grants discretion to the trial courts to consolidate actions
involving common questions of law or fact.” (Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 976, 978.) The section states in relevant part:
 
“(a)
When actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.
“(b)  The court, in furtherance of convenience or
to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and
economy, may order a separate trial of any cause of action, including a cause
of action asserted in a cross-complaint, or of any separate issue or of any
number of causes of action or issues, preserving the right of trial by jury
required by the Constitution or a statute of this state or of the United
States.”
 
“Consolidation is not a matter of right; it rests solely within the
sound discretion of the trial judge.” (Fisher
v. Nash Bldg. Co. (1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 397, 402.) There are two types of
consolidation under §1048: “a consolidation for purposes of trial only, where
the two actions remain otherwise separate; and a complete consolidation or
consolidation for all purposes, where the two actions are merged into a single
proceeding under one case number and result in only one verdict or set of
findings and one judgment.” (Hamilton v.
Asbestos Corp. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147.)
 
The court finds the allegations of the complaint sufficiently
support a claim for disputed title, thereby supporting a basis for consolidation.
“Because of its summary character, an unlawful
detainer action is not a suitable vehicle to try complicated ownership issues
involving allegations of fraud.” (Mehr
v. Superior Court (1983)
139 Cal.App.3d 1044, 1049; Vella v. Hudgins (1977) 20 Cal.3d 251, 255 [“For our present purpose, it is sufficient to note that
the proceeding is summary in character; that, ordinarily, only claims bearing
directly upon the right of immediate possession are cognizable”]; Cheney v. Trauzettel (1937) 9 Cal.2d 158,
159; Martin-Bragg v. Moore (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 367, 385.) The
arguments in opposition in fact affirm the inability of the UD court to address
the title issues, thereby prompting consolidation without any finding of
collateral estoppel. (Ayala v. Dawson (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 1319,
1326-1327.)
 
The court finds no basis for denial of
consolidation simply based on the pending demurrer. The issues regarding
ownership and possession remain to be adjudicated. The court therefore grants
the motion to consolidate.
 
Given the consolidation of the actions,
the court stays the unlawful detainer proceeding pending adjudication of the
action. The court also finds no basis of necessity for any request under Code
of Civil Procedure section 526, including the posting of an undertaking, given
the authority of this unlimited jurisdiction court to stay the action. (Asuncion v. Superior Court (1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 141, 146.)

The unlawful detainer case is therefore transferred from the unlawful detainer
court to this department. The two cases will now be captioned
under one case number, with the unlimited case number serving as the lead
number. All dates in the Unlawful Detainer Court are
now vacated.  All documents filed going
forward shall only be filed using the lead case number.
 
The court, however, will consider requests for
the continued payment of rent on the premises pending adjudication of the
underlying action. Nothing in the consolidation and stay pending adjudication
of the property right claims in any way relieves any current rent obligations
for use of the premises.
The court will also concurrently conduct the Case Management Conference.
