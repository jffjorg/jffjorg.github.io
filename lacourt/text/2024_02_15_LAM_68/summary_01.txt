And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Norma Salceda's motion to consolidate the instant action with the related unlawful detainer action, 23PDUD02724. The court finds that the allegations in the complaint sufficiently support a claim for disputed title, which is a basis for consolidation. The court also stays the unlawful detainer proceeding pending adjudication of the action. The court has transferred the unlawful detainer case to its department and will caption the two cases under one case number, with the unlimited case number serving as the lead number. The court will consider requests for continued payment of rent on the premises pending adjudication of the underlying action. The court will also concurrently conduct a Case Management Conference.
