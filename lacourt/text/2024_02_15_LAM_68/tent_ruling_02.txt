GOOD FAITH SETTLEMENT
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants, Sherman Escrow, et al.
RESPONDING PARTY: Unopposed/Defendants, Quinn Real
Estate, LLC, et al.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Linda Martinez befriended defendant Oscar
Parada through routine work interactions. In the routine course of
conversation, Plaintiff mentioned a home in Tulare County on the verge of
condemnation and requiring rehabilitation work. Parada subsequently offered to
connect Plaintiff with “property developers and loan officers” in order to tear
down the home and rebuild. 
 
Plaintiff alleges a 2016 arranged $150,000 cash out
refinance on her home in Los Angeles to be subsequently used for the Tulare
County home with defendants Sherman Escrow, Anabel Aguilera, Koko Polosajian,
Hong Tang, Joel Sanchez and Arthur Boyadzhyan. According to Plaintiff, the
purported loan was in fact “fraudulent and forged,” whereby Defendants utilized
their access to Plaintiff’s personal identification and financial information
in order to execute a series of smaller loans secured against the properties.
The secured loans led to foreclosures of one or both properties. 
 
On May 31, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for
Conversion, Fraudulent Deceit, Breach of Contract, Fraud/Intentional
Misrepresentation, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and Elder Abuse. On September 27,
2023, the clerk entered a default as to Parada. 
 
On November 15, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer of
Sherman Escrow with leave to amend. On December 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
first amended complaint for Conversion, Fraudulent Deceit, Breach of Contract,
Fraud/Intentional Misrepresentation, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Negligence, and
Elder Abuse. On December 26, 2023, and January 16, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed
Brenda Camacho and Hong Tang. On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Luis
Rivas and Mercene Bonilla. 
 
RULING: Continued.
Defendants Sherman
Escrow, Inc., Anabel Aguilera, Joel Sanchez, and Ingrid Sheikh, move
for a determination of good faith settlement with plaintiff Linda Martinez.
Moving parties and Plaintiffs agree to a $10,000 settlement of all claims. The
court electronic filing system shows no opposition or reply at the time of the
tentative ruling publication cutoff. Moving defendants filed three separate
proofs of service filed all showing either electronic or mail service on
January 11, 18 and 19, 2024.
 
The
proof of service on Quinn Real Estate, LLC, Nadel & Associates,
Russell J. Nadel, Koko Polosajian, Hong Tang, Luis D. Rivas, Absolute Law
Group, Brenda M. Gonzalez Camacho, Arthur Boyadzhyan, and Wegman &
Associates was filed on February 5, 2024, and indicates service by mail on
January 19, 2024. Monday February 12, 2024, is a court holiday, and therefore
cannot count towards the 16 court days for determining timely service. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 12a, 12b, 12c.) The motion was served by mail exactly 16 day and
four calendar days before the hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd.
(b).) 
 
The court
therefore finds the motion untimely served, and continues the hearing until Friday
March 22, 2024. Moving parties must serve new notice of the hearing on all
parties. Monday February 19, 2024, is also a court holiday for purposes of
determining the next planned service date should counsel wait until the last
day possible for service of the new hearing date.
