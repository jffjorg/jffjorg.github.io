Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Sherman Escrow, et al., have moved for a determination of good faith settlement with the plaintiff, Linda Martinez. The moving parties and the plaintiff have agreed to a $10,000 settlement of all claims. However, the motion was served by mail, but was deemed untimely. The court finds that the motion was served 16 days and 4 calendar days before the hearing date, which is outside the allowed time frame. Therefore, the court continues the hearing until March 22, 2024, and orders the moving parties to serve new notice of the hearing on all parties.
