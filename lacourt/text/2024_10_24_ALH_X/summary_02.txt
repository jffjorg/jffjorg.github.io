And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Honda's motion for summary judgment, which sought to dismiss the plaintiff's claims under the Song-Beverly Act. Honda argued that the plaintiff could not bring a claim under the Act because the vehicle was purchased used with a portion of the original manufacturer's warranty remaining. However, the judge found that there is a split of authority on this issue, with the Second District Court of Appeal in Stiles v. Kia Motors America, Inc. holding that a used vehicle can be considered a "new motor vehicle" under the Act if it was sold with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's new motor vehicle warranty. The judge is inclined to follow this holding and has denied Honda's motion for summary judgment. The judge has also noted that the California Supreme Court has accepted review of the Stiles decision and has granted review of the Rodriguez v. FCA US LLC decision, which reached a contrary conclusion. As a result, the judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a stay pending the Supreme Court's decision.
