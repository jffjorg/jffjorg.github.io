And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

**Tentative Ruling**

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by the specially appearing defendants, MX2 Productions Inc. and Daniel Reardon. The defendants contend that the court lacks jurisdiction over them due to insufficient contacts between them and the forum state, California.

The judge finds that the defendants have not consented to jurisdiction in California, and therefore, does not have personal jurisdiction over them. The judge also finds that the minimum contacts analysis does not support the exercise of specific jurisdiction over the defendants.

The judge orders that the defendants give notice of the ruling.
