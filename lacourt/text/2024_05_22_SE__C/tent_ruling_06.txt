Defendants
Homer P. Coster, trustee of the Coster Family Trust dated July 19, 1989; Homer
P. Coster; and Brabant Realty and Management allegedly own and operate a single-family
residential home located at 6342 Arbutus Avenue, Huntington Park, California
90255. Plaintiffs are tenants in the building. Plaintiffs allege they have
experienced various problems with the building, rendering it uninhabitable. 
 
Defendants move to compel initial
discovery of Special Interrogatories, Set One from Plaintiffs Irma Adriana
Portillo, Destiny Gonzalez Portillo, and Paulina Gonzalez. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b) allows the propounding
party to file a motion to compel responses to interrogatories if a response has
not been received.  If responses are
untimely, the responding party waives objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (a).)  
 
Discussion
 
Defendants served each plaintiff with special
interrogatories on November 7, 2023, by electronic mail. (Decl. Winter, ¶ 3,
Ex. A.) Responses
were due on or before December 11, 2023. (Id., ¶ 3.) Defendant granted an extension to January 1, 2024,
January 15, 2024, January 22, 2024, and January 26, 2024. (Id., ¶¶ 4-7.) Defendant granted a further extension to
March 8, 2024. (Id., ¶ 9.) Despite these extensions, Defendant has not
received responses. (Id., ¶ 10.)   
 
Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiffs are ordered to serve responses
without objections within 30 days.  
 
Sanctions  
 
Discovery
sanctions may not be imposed under Section 2023.030, even together with Section
2023.010, absent another provision of the Discovery Act that authorizes the
imposition of sanctions. (City of L. A. v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 500.) Sanctions with respect to interrogatories
are only authorized against a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel responses. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c).) 
 
Here, sanctions
are denied because the motions are unopposed.
