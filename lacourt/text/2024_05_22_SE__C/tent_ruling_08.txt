 Case Number:  BC710923    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  C Jose
Manuel Choy vs Susy Salsberg et. al, Case No. BC710923 
This is a
personal injury action. Plaintiff moves ex parte for a motion to advance the
motion for non-monetary and monetary sanctions for abusive litigation practices
and misuse of the discovery process and for an order tolling the five-year
statute of limitiations. 
A party may
seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
Plaintiff
contends the first available hearing date on the Defendant District's Motion is
February 18, 2025, and there is a May 28, 2024 trial setting conference to
determine a trial date. The Court finds that Plaintiff would be irreparably
harmed by not having the motion heard on its merits prior to trial. 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s ex parte application to advance the Motion for Terminating
Sanctions and tolling of the five-year statute of limitations is GRANTED.
Plaintiff’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions and Tolling of the five-year
statute of limitations is advanced from Tuesday, February 18, 2025 to this date
and CONTINUED to Thursday, August 22, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Department SE-C. 
Plaintiff to
give notice.
