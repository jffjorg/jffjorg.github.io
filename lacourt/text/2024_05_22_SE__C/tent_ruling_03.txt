Legal
Standard
 
A party against whom a cause of action has been
asserted in a complaint can file a cross-complaint against a codefendant or
third person not yet a party to the action only if the cause of action asserted
“(1) arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or
occurrences [set forth in the complaint] … or (2) asserts a claim, right, or
interest in the property or controversy which is the subject of
the cause [of action] brought against him.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 428.10, subd. (b).)
Leave may be granted in the interest of justice at any time during the action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50.) 
 
Leave
to File Cross-Complaint
 
Here,
Defendant asserts
breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing in the proposed cross-complaint arising out of the underlying action.
(Decl. Yuen, ¶ 4, Ex. A.) Plaintiffs argue that Defendant cannot maintain an
action for breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing. 
 
Because
the causes of action asserted arise out of the same occurrence as the original
action, the Court grants leave to file the cross-complaint. Plaintiffs’
argument is based on an incorrect standard to apply in a motion for leave to
file cross-complaint. 
 
The
motion is GRANTED. Defendant is to file the cross-complaint within 10
days.
