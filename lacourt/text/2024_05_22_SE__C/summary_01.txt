And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Pacific Southwest District of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, moves to compel further responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The defendant, Peace Lutheran Church, objects to these requests, claiming that some of the questions are vague or overly broad.

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories, Set Two, numbers 15.1 and 17.1. The court also grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, Set Two, numbers 5, 6, and 7. The court finds that the term "communion" is not vague and that Peace Lutheran Church's assertion that it was unable to locate any documents inadequate.

The court finds that the requests for production of documents, Set Three and Four, are moot. The court declines to award monetary sanctions to either party.
