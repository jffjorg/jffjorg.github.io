Pacific Industrial CA Reit Owner 1 LLC vs Overseas Food Distribution, LLC, Case
No. 24NWCV00144
This is an
unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff BPP Pacific Industrial CA REIT Owner 1 LLC
moves ex parte for an order by the Court entering judgment in the favor of
Plaintiff. 
 Pursuant
to CCP section 664.6: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing
signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the
court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may
enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the
parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the
settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.”   “Section
664.6 was enacted to provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a
settlement contract without the need for a new lawsuit.”  (Weddington
Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793,
809.)    
Plaintiff moves
the Court to enforce the settlement and for possession of the Premises, and
$191,181.67. Plaintiff contends Defendant remains in possession of the premises
and is not making the payments as agreed upon. 
Given that
Defendant has not vacated the premises the Court finds that there is
irreparable harm. 
Here, Plaintiff
contends that the parties have entered into a signed stipulation and Defendant
has not upheld its end of the agreement. Under the Agreement, the terms state
that “the parties stipulate and agree to reclassify this matter to unlimited
jurisdiction or otherwise if necessary to enter the judgment referenced herein.”
