And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a dispute between the Portillo family (Plaintiffs) and Homer P. Coster, trustee of the Coster Family Trust, and Brabant Realty and Management (Defendants). The Plaintiffs are tenants in a single-family residential home located at 6342 Arbutus Avenue, Huntington Park, California 90255. The Plaintiffs have experienced various problems with the building and have allegedly been exposed to hazardous conditions.

The Defendants have served the Plaintiffs with special interrogatories on November 7, 2023, but the Plaintiffs have failed to respond. The Defendants have granted several extensions for responses, but the Plaintiffs have still not responded.

The Court has granted the Defendants' motions to compel responses to special interrogatories, ordering the Plaintiffs to serve responses without objections within 30 days. The Court has denied the Plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions.

This case involves the application of California Civil Procedure Code sections 2030.290 and 2023.030, which govern the discovery process and the imposition of sanctions. The Court has followed the legal standard set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b), which allows the propounding party to file a motion to compel responses to interrogatories if a response has not been received.
