TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiffs Savannah Haynie and Porfirio Hernandez’s motion to compel
further responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One is CONTINUED.

 
Moving Party to give NOTICE. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiffs
Savannah Haynie and Porfirio Hernandez sue American Honda Motor Company, Inc.
for breach of express warranty and breach of implied warranty. 
 
Plaintiffs move to compel further responses to
request
numbers 18-20, 22-23, 45-46, and 48-49 served on defendant American Honda Motor
Company, Inc. Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 allows a party to
file a motion compelling further responses to document requests if the party
finds that the response is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive, or an objection
is without merit or too general.  
 
Timeliness

 
Notice of the motion to compel further must be
provided within 45 days of service of the verified response or on or before any
specific later date to which the parties have agreed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (c).) This 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is
served and is extended for service by mail in accordance with Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4) and 1013, subdivision (a). Failure
to timely move to compel within the specified period constitutes a waiver of
any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)

 
On April 11, 2023, the defendant
served unverified responses to Plaintiff’s first set of requests for production
of documents. (Decl. Tran, ¶ 6, Ex. B.) Responses consisted of both factual
responses and objections. (Decl. Tran, ¶ 6, Ex. B.) The 45-day clock runs only
upon service of verified responses, and responses consisting of both factual
responses and objections must be verified. (Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc.
v. Super. Ct. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 136.) Neither party has submitted
evidence that Defendant has served verifications. Thus, the clock has not run. 
Meet
and Confer
 
The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion
shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
 
For purposes of
determining whether a motion to compel discovery was preceded by a reasonable
and good faith effort to meet and confer, such an attempt at informal
resolution requires something more than bickering with opposing counsel;
rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the matter over, compare
their views, consult, and deliberate. (Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.) 
 
Based on Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
declaration, the Court finds that the parties did not sufficiently meet and
confer. (Decl. Tran, ¶¶ 10-13.) Plaintiff’s counsel sent a detailed
meet-and-confer correspondence, but the parties did not talk the matter over,
compare their views, consult, and deliberate. (Decl. Tran, ¶ 10, Ex. D; ¶ 11,
Ex. E.)
 
The parties
are ordered to meet and confer again. If court intervention is still necessary,
the parties are ordered to submit a joint statement in 20 days regarding the
specific items of discovery still at issue. 
 
The motion is CONTINUED to July 17, 2024,
at 9:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
