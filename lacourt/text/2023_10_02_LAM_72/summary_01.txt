Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in a case brought by the plaintiff, Kay Adams, against Weiss Accountancy Corporation, Weiss Accountancy LLP, and Scott Weiss. The plaintiff had alleged various causes of action, including disability, sex, and national origin discrimination, sexual harassment, and wrongful termination. The defendants argued that the parties had agreed to arbitrate disputes through an arbitration agreement that the plaintiff had signed as part of her employment with Weiss. The court found that the agreement was valid and enforceable, and that the defendants had not unreasonably delayed in seeking arbitration. The court also found that the plaintiff had not been prejudiced by the delay and that the defendants' conduct had not been inconsistent with their right to arbitrate. The court did not apply the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 to the case, as the plaintiff's claims did not arise after the effective date of the statute. As a result, the court granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings, pending resolution of the arbitration proceedings.
