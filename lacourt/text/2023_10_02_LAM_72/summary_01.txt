Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings in a case brought by the plaintiff, Kay Adams, against Weiss Accountancy Corporation, Weiss Accountancy LLP, and Scott Weiss. The plaintiff had alleged various causes of action, including disability, sex, and national origin discrimination, sexual harassment, and wrongful termination. The defendants argued that the parties had agreed to arbitrate disputes through an arbitration agreement that the plaintiff had signed as part of her employment with Weiss. The court found that the agreement was valid and enforceable, and that the defendants had not unreasonably delayed in seeking arbitration. The court also found that the plaintiff had not been prejudiced by the delay and that the defendants' conduct had not been inconsistent with their right to arbitrate. The court did not apply the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 to the case, as the plaintiff's claims did not arise after the effective date of the statute. As a result, the court granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings, pending resolution of the arbitration proceedings.

## Tentative Ruling Summary 

**Case Number:** 23STCV01601
**Hearing Date:** October 2, 2023

**Plaintiff:** Kay Adams
**Defendant:** Weiss Accountancy Corporation, Weiss Accountancy LLP, Scott Weiss 

**Summary:**

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings. This means Plaintiff's case will be decided through arbitration, not in court.

**Key Points:**

* **Arbitration Agreement:** Plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement as part of her employment with Weiss. This agreement covers all claims arising from her employment, including those related to discrimination, harassment, and wage and hour violations.
* **Waiver:** The judge found that Plaintiff did not demonstrate that the defendants waived their right to compel arbitration.  The defendants promptly raised the arbitration clause in their answer and made efforts to locate the agreement. The judge also found that there was no evidence of prejudice to the Plaintiff because of the delay.
* **Ending Forced Arbitration Act:** Plaintiff briefly mentioned a federal law that prohibits forced arbitration in sexual assault and harassment cases. However, the judge found that this law does not apply to Plaintiff's case because her alleged claims arose before the law's effective date.

**Next Steps:**

A status conference is scheduled for June 28, 2024, to discuss the progress of the arbitration proceedings.
