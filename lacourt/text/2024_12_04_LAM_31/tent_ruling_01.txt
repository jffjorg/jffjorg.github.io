Lynwood Del Capri, L.P. and Positive Investments, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Brandon
Hoxey
 
 
I.          Background
 
On May 12, 2022, Plaintiffs Brandon Hoxey, Monique Rogers,
Kamara Murray, and Amari Compton (collectively, Plaintiffs) commenced this
action against defendants Icehouse Ventures V, LLC and Mashcole Property
Management alleging various breaches of the warranty of habitability at the real
property located at 111 W. Del Amo Blvd., Long Beach, California 90805 (the
“Property”).  Trial was scheduled for
August 21, 2023.
 
On March 9, 2023, the court continued the trial date on its
own motion to March 4, 2024.
 
On August 29, 2023, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to add
Lynwood Del Capri L.P. and Positive Investments, Inc. as defendants to this
action.  Lynwood Del Capri L.P. and
Positive Investments, Inc. (hereafter, Defendants) filed their answer to the
complaint on December 13, 2023.
 
On January 9, 2024, the parties stipulated to continue the
trial date to January 13, 2025.
 
On November 5, 2024, Defendants filed this motion to
continue the trial date.  Defendants seek
a trial continuance to June 2, 2025, or any date thereafter.
 
            On November
20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition.
 
            No reply
was filed.
 
Trial is currently scheduled for January 13, 2025.  This is the first request for a trial
continuance.
 
II.        Discussion
& Legal Standard 
 
            Defendants
move the court for an order continuing the trial date to June 2, 2025 and to
set all related trial dates to the proposed date.  In support, Defendants explain its lead
counsel has a scheduling conflict. 
Counsel has two trials set for January of 2025 which conflict with the
trial in this case, one of which has been pending for over five years and will
thus not be continued.  Defendants
further explain that the parties have agreed to mediate this matter.  Mediation is currently scheduled for January
8, 2025—just five days before the present trial date.  (See Finck Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.)  For the reasons, Defendants argue good cause
exists to grant a trial continuance to June 2, 2025. 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b) outlines that “a
party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial, whether contested or
uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must make the request for a
continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte application under the rules in
chapter 4 of this division, with supporting declarations.¿ The party must make
the motion or application as soon as reasonably practical once the necessity
for the continuance is discovered.”¿ 
 
Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c), the court
may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring
the continuance.  Circumstances that may indicate good cause include “a
party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other
material evidence despite diligent efforts.”¿ The court should consider all
facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as proximity of the
trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice are served.¿
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)¿ 
  
            Here, Defendants demonstrate good
cause exists to continue the trial date. 
A trial continuance will allow the parties to meaningfully participate
in mediation and ensure defense counsel will be available for the trial
date.  This is the first request for a
trial continuance.  
 
In opposition, Plaintiffs contend good cause does not exist
to continue the trial date.  Yet,
Plaintiffs acknowledge mediation has yet to take place, and further, Plaintiffs
accept that if defense counsel is unavailable, the trial in this matter will be
continued.  Plaintiffs also point out
that discovery has still not been completed. 

 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
The motion is GRANTED.  The Final Status Conference scheduled for December
16, 2024 is CONTINUED to July 21, 2025 at 9:00 AM.¿ The Jury Trial scheduled
for January 13, 2024 is CONTINUED to August 4, 2025 at 10:00 AM.¿ All discovery
cut-off dates, all pretrial deadlines including discovery, expert, and motion
cut-off dates are continued to the new trial date of August 4, 2025.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
