And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The plaintiff alleges that he was attacked by the defendant's dog on two occasions, and the defendant failed to take adequate precautions to prevent the second attack. The judge finds that these allegations are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, as they show that the defendant acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the plaintiff's safety. The judge also rejects the defendant's argument that the plaintiff was aware of the dog's alleged vicious nature and still chose to come into close proximity with it, as this is an affirmative defense. The judge orders the defendant to file and serve an answer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint within 10 calendar days and to provide proof of service within 5 calendar days.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike certain allegations in the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. The defendant had sought to strike the plaintiff's requests for punitive damages, arguing that the complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to support these claims. However, the judge found that the complaint did contain sufficient allegations, including the fact that the defendant's dog had previously attacked the plaintiff and that the defendant had promised to prevent future attacks. The judge also found that the defendant's argument that the plaintiff was aware of the dog's alleged vicious nature but still chose to come into close proximity with it was not a sufficient basis for striking the request for punitive damages. The judge ordered the defendant to file and serve an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 10 days and to provide proof of service within 5 days.
