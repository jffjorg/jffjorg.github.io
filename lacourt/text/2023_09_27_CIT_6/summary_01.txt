## English Summary 

The Judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion filed by Defendant's attorney, Gary E. Mastin, to be relieved as counsel. The reason for the motion is that Defendant has failed to pay attorney fees and there has been a breakdown in communication. The Judge notes that the attorney's declaration only listed one future hearing date, even though it was filed after the Case Management Conference had already occurred. To resolve this, the Judge requires the attorney to submit a revised proposed order with all future hearing dates.
