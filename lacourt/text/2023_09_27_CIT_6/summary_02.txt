**English Summary:**

The judge ruled in favor of Emanate Health, dismissing the lawsuit filed by Thomas Weeber.  

The judge found that Weeber's medical malpractice claim is time-barred under California law. Although Weeber claimed he lacked mental capacity to file a lawsuit until January 2022, the judge ruled that this incapacity does not toll the statute of limitations for medical malpractice claims under California law. 

Because the lawsuit was filed over a year after the alleged injury occurred, the judge dismissed the case without allowing Weeber to amend his complaint.

```

Here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer of Emanate Health is sustained without leave to amend. This means that the plaintiff's claim for medical malpractice is time-barred under California Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5. The judge has concluded that the plaintiff knew of his alleged injury on July 15, 2021, but did not file suit until December 27, 2022, more than one year after the injury occurred and was discovered. The judge has also rejected the plaintiff's argument that his alleged mental incapacity tolled the statute of limitations. As a result, the plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint fails to state a cause of action for medical malpractice.

english:
The tentative ruling in the case of Thomas Weeber v. Emanate Health Intercommunity Hospital, et al. sustains the demurrer of Defendant Emanate Health without leave to amend. The case involves a medical malpractice claim by the plaintiff, Thomas Weeber, against Emanate Health Intercommunity Hospital and Emanate Health Medical Care Foundation. The defendant argues that the claim is time-barred under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5, which sets a three-year limit for actions against health care providers for professional negligence. The plaintiff argues that his claim is not time-barred because he lacked mental capacity between the time of the incident and approximately January 1, 2022. However, the court rules that Code of Civil Procedure section 352, which tolls the statute of limitations for persons under the age of majority or lacking legal capacity, does not apply to MICRA actions governed by section 340.5. Therefore, the plaintiff’s alleged incapacity is irrelevant and does not toll the statute of limitations. The court also rules that the Notice of Intent to Sue did not toll the statute of limitations for 90 days because it was not served within the last 90 days of the one-year statute of limitations of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5. As such, the Second Amended Complaint fails to state a cause of action for medical malpractice and the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
