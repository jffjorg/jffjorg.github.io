This tentative ruling by the judge denies the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, University Promenade CRF3, LLC, is seeking a default judgment against the defendants, Check Solution, Inc. dba Tacos Super Gallito and Sergio Barraza, for breach of contract and failure to pay rent. The judge notes several defects in the plaintiff's application, including the failure to dismiss certain parties, provide a brief summary of the case, and submit a Statement of Account. The judge also reduces the attorney's fees sought by the plaintiff from $8,947.90 to $4,182.06. The lease agreement references a security deposit of $7,139.94, but the plaintiff has failed to advise whether it was applied to the outstanding balance owed by the defendants or returned to them. The judge directs the plaintiff to submit a new default judgment packet that addresses these defects.
