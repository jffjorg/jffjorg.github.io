And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a default judgment application filed by Plaintiff Na Jiang against Defendant Chen and other defendants. The plaintiff alleges that Chen and other defendants failed to pay an outstanding balance of $1,320,000.00, which was loaned to Fu Bang Group Corp., USA, under a written contract. The plaintiff also alleges breach of personal guarantee by Dos Lagos and Bo Chen. The judge has deferred ruling on the default judgment application as to Chen until the conclusion of the trial, citing a California case that allows for separate judgments against defaulting defendants who have independent defenses not involving the defaulting defendants. The judge has also deferred ruling on the application for default judgment against Fu Corp. and Dos Lagos, as they have raised 26 affirmative defenses.
