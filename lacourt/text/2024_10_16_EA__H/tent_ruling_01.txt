I.        Background
In
this breach of contract case, Plaintiffs Zia Abhari and Amir Shamloo (together,
“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows:
On May 2, 2020, Gordes Hospitality, Inc. (“Gordes”),
through Ganyu Huang aka Gary Huang, and Shamloo, with Abhari serving as a
silent partner, entered into an “Asset Purchase Agreement” and a “Security
Agreement” with Gordes for the transfer of ownership of Hamilton’s Steakhouse
(“Hamilton”) from Gordes, as seller, to Plaintiffs, as buyers. On June 18,
2020, LVGEM Hotel Corporation (“LVGEM”), through Huang, and Shamloo, with
Abhari serving as a silent partner of Shamloo, entered into a “Lease Agreement”
for the lease of the property upon which Hamilton is located. Gordes, LVGEM,
and Huang have refused to transfer the existing liquor license for Hamilton to
Plaintiffs, failed to provide Plaintiffs with the insurance information and
have undertaken efforts to deprive Plaintiffs of their real estate leasehold
possessory interest in the premises upon which the Hamilton is located.
Plaintiffs’
Second Amended Complaint asserts 10 causes of action against Gordes, LVGEM, and
others, including for breach of contract, tortious breach of implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing, fraud in the inducement, negligent
misrepresentation, and fraud by false promise.
Gordes
and LVGEM have filed a Cross-Complaint, asserting 14 causes of action against
Abhari, Shamloo, and others, including for conversion, money had and received,
fraud based on intentional misrepresentation, fraud in the inducement, unjust
enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duties.
Pending
before the Court are eight discovery motions filed by either Gordes or LVGEM. For
the reasons stated herein, the Court denies the motions as moot except as to
sanctions and orders sanctions in the amount of $510 per motion. 
 
II.      Legal Standard
Responses
to requests for admission, interrogatories, and requests for production of
documents are due 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2033.250, subd.
(a), 2030.260, subd. (a), 2031.260, subd. (a).) If
timely responses are not served, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling responses or deeming matters admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2033.280, subd. (b), 2030.290, subd. (b), 2031.300,
subd. (b).)
As
to requests for admissions, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction . . . on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated [a] motion.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
As to interrogatories and requests for production of
documents, “[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories [or a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c), 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
III.     Discussion
Gordes has filed five discovery motions against either
Abhari or Shamloo. In these motions, Gordes seeks: (1) an order that the truth of all specified matters and the genuineness of
all specified documents in Gordes’ Requests for Admission, Set Two propounded
to Abhari be deemed admitted (“Motion 1”); (2) an order compelling Abhari to respond to
Gordes’ Form Interrogatories, Set Two (“Motion 2”); (3) an order that the truth of all specified matters and the genuineness of
all specified documents in Gordes’ Requests for Admission, Set Two propounded
to Shamloo be deemed admitted (“Motion 3”); (4) an order compelling Shamloo to respond to Gordes’
Form Interrogatories, Set Two (“Motion 4”); and (5) an
order compelling Shamloo to respond to Gordes’ Request for Production of
Documents, Set Two (“Motion 5”). 
LVGEM has filed three discovery motions against
Shamloo, seeking: (1) an order that the
truth of all specified matters and the genuineness of all specified documents
in LVGEM’s Requests for Admission, Set One propounded to Shamloo be deemed
admitted (“Motion 6”); (2) an order compelling Shamloo to respond to
LVGEM’s Form Interrogatories, Set One (“Motion 7”); and (3) an order compelling
Shamloo to respond to LVGEM’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One
(“Motion 8”).
In support
of the motions, Gordes and LVGEM’s counsel Caixing Ma (“Ma”) represents as
follows:
On March 21, 2024, Gordes and LVGEM served Abhari
and Shamloo with their discovery requests seeking the discovery at issue in the
instant motions. (Ma Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. 1.) Written responses were due on April
23, 2024. (Id., ¶ 4.) Neither Abhari nor Shamloo served responses on
April 23, 2024, or requested an extension of time to provide responses. (Id.,
¶ 5.) On May 28, 2024, the parties attended an Informal Discovery Conference
(“IDC”) to address the discovery disputes. (Id., ¶ 6.) During the IDC,
Abhari and Shamloo agreed to provide all responses by June 7, 2024. (Id.)
From June 7-11, 2024, Gordes and LVGEM agreed to two extension requests made by
Abhari and Shamloo, such that responses were due by June 17, 2024. (Id.)
Neither Abhari nor Shamloo provided responses by June 17, 2024 or requested a
further extension. (Id.)
Gordes and LVGEM filed the instant motions on June
21, 2024. After the motions were filed, the requested discovery was provided on
either June 21, 2024 or June 25, 2024. (Vafaei
Decl., ¶ 2; Reply Briefs, p. 1.)
Abhari
and Shamloo oppose the motions as moot since the requested discovery has since
been produced. While Gordes and LVGEM acknowledge having received the requested
discovery, they contend that sanctions are still appropriate because the
belated responses did not vitiate the need for the motions to be filed. The
Court agrees. Accordingly, the motions are denied as moot, except as to
sanctions.
