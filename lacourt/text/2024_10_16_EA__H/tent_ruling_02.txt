v. Fu Bang Group Corp., USA, et al., Case No. 23PSCV01959

ORDER RE DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION
Background
Plaintiff Na Jiang (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
          In or around July 1, 2018, Plaintiff
and Fu Bang Group Corp., USA (“Fu Corp.”) entered into a written contract,
wherein Plaintiff agreed to loan Fu Corp. $1,320,000.00 at 5% per annum for a
one-year term. Dos Lagos Center 2, LLC (“Dos Lagos”) signed as a guarantor for
the contract. Bo Chen (“Chen”) later signed as a guarantor. Defendants have
failed to pay the outstanding balance.
On
June 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against
Fu Corp, Dos Lagos, Chen and Does 1-10 for (1) breach of contract and (2) breach
of personal guarantee.
On
February 14, 2024, the Clerk entered default against Chen.
A
Case Management Conference and an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment are
set for October 16, 2024. For the reasons stated herein, the Court will defer
ruling on the default judgment application as to Chen until the conclusion of
the trial.
 
Discussion
“There are certain cases where default judgments were
taken against defaulting defendants who were claimed to be jointly and severally liable with the answering
defendants. There, however, they set up independent defenses not involving the defaulting defendants. Under
such circumstances the courts held that a separate judgment against such
defaulting defendants may be entered before the issue is tried as to the
appearing defendants.” (Mirabile v. Smith (1953) 119 Cal.App.2d 685,
688.)
Co-Defendants
Fu Corp. and Dos Lagos filed an answer on October 17, 2023 raising 26
affirmative defenses. Here, in light of the defenses raised in that answer, the
Court will defer ruling on Plaintiff’s application for default judgment as to
Chen until after trial of Co-Defendants Fu Corp. and Dos Lagos.
