And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The ruling is based on several defects in the application, including the failure to dismiss certain parties, failure to provide a brief summary of the case, and failure to provide information about the security deposit. The judge also reduced the amount of attorney's fees sought by the plaintiff from $8,947.90 to $4,182.06. The plaintiff is directed to submit a new default judgment packet addressing these defects and to provide a Statement of Account, if one exists.
