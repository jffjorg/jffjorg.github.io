 Case Number:  23PSCV03378    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2024    Dept:  H Plaintiff
University Promenade CRF3, LLC’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED
without prejudice.
Background
In this breach
of contract case, Plaintiff University Promenade GRF3, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges
that its tenant, Defendant Check Solution, Inc., dba Tacos Super Gallito
(“Check Solution”), and the guarantor, Defendant Sergio Barraza (“Barraza”), breached
a lease agreement for the commercial property located at 962 E. Alosta Avenue
in Azusa, when Check Solution failed to pay rent.
On January 17,
2024, the Clerk entered default against Check Solutions and Barraza.
An Order to
Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is set for October 16, 2024.
Discussion 
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defects are noted: 
1.       Plaintiff has only dismissed Does 1-10
without prejudice. Plaintiff has failed to dismiss Does 11-20 or to submit “an
application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil
Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment,”
pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7). 
2.       Plaintiff has failed to submit “a brief
summary of the case identifying the parties and the
nature of plaintiff’s claim,” pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(1).
3.       Plaintiff seeks attorney’s fees of
$8,947.90. It appears to the Court that attorney’s fees should be reduced to
$4,182.06, pursuant to Local Rule 3.214(a).
4.       The lease agreement references a
$7,139.94 security deposit. Plaintiff has failed to
advise whether the security deposit was applied to the outstanding balance owed
by Defendants or returned to them.
5.       Plaintiff is directed to provide the Court
with a Statement of Account, to the extent one
exists.
Accordingly,
the Court denies Plaintiff’s Application without prejudice and directs
Plaintiff to submit a new default judgment packet that addresses the aforementioned
defects.
