And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike presented by Defendant Babak Manesh, D.D.S. The demurrer challenged the second and third causes of action in the Complaint, which alleged medical battery and intentional misrepresentation. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations in the Complaint sufficiently plead a substantially different treatment and intent to commit the alleged wrong. The judge has also granted the motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the Plaintiff failed to obtain leave of court to allege punitive damages and did not present any argument in support of the request. The ruling is tentative and subject to revision until the hearing on September 10, 2024.
