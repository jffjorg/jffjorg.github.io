[1]
Defendants Tom Deghionno, Audrey Deghionno, and Laura Deghionno share the same
surname. The Court addresses each individually by their respective first names
for the purpose of clarity. No disrespect is intended. 


[2]
As discussed more fully infra.


[3]
For these purposes, the Court will strike the First Cause of Action for
Negligence pursuant to its own authority in Code of Civ. Proc. §436, as the
First and Second Causes of Action are duplicative. Alternatively, as the legal
issues are identical, the Court adopts its Premises Liability analysis, infra,
for the First Cause of Action as discussed for the Second Cause of Action.


[4]
Pl.’s Exh. 4, Deposition of Tom, discusses Tom’s incident report after
Plaintiff was attacked. (Pl.’s Exh. 4 106:3-11; 135:14-137:16; 137:23-139:15;
143:16-20.) Tom expressly refutes knowledge of the first incident in this
exhibit. (128:21-5.) Further, as mentioned ante, the incident report in
Request for Judicial Notice Exh. 1 does not show knowledge of dangerous
propensity. 


[5]
There is a mislabeling of the Arabic numerals in the Complaint which consists
of two paragraph 3s and two paragraph 4s. The Court will use the Arabic numbers
as listed, unless it is addressing one of these two paragraphs where the Court
will notate the mislabeled paragraphs it is referring to.
