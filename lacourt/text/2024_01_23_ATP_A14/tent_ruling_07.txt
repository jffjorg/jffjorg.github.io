 Case Number:  23AVCV00744    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a
wrongful foreclosure action. Plaintiffs Jason Sawicki (“Jason”[1])
and Jennifer Sawicki (“Jennifer” and collectively “Plaintiffs”) allege that
they are the rightful and lawful owners of real property commonly known as 4032
Vahan Court, Lancaster, California, 93536 (the “Property”) and on August 17,
2007, they obtained a mortgage loan on the Property from m Homecomings
Financial, LLC in the amount of $283,000, memorialized by a Deed of Trust with
the maturity due date of September 01, 2037. Plaintiffs further allege: (1) a
subsequent string of assignments led the Deed of Trust to be purportedly
assigned to Defendant U.S. Bank Trust National Association, solely as trustee
of the Truman 2021 SC9 Title Trust (“U.S. Bank”); (2) on August 30, 2022, a
Notice of Default and Election to Sell Under Deed of Trust was recorded in the in
the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office; (3) on December 02, 2022, a Notice of
Trustee’s Sale was recorded in the in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office;
(4) the Property sold on January 03, 2023; and (5) on February 10, 2023, a
Notice of Trustee’s Sale was recorded in the in the Los Angeles County
Recorder’s Office. Plaintiffs contend that the sale was not a bona file sale
because (1) buyer Sam Ostayany (“Ostayany”) did not file the Trustee’s Deed
Upon Sale until February 10, 2023, 38 days from the sale when a trustee has to
record the Trustee Deed Upon Sale no later than 18 days of the sale pursuant to
Cal. Civ. Code § 2924h[2];
(2) there are issues with the 2018 assignment; (3) there are issues with the
2022 assignment to Defendant Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC
(“Rushmore”); (4) Plaintiffs submitted loan modifications over several years,
but were told they were missing documents every time and no alternative to
foreclosure was offered to them; and (5) SC9 failed to advise Plaintiffs in
writing within 30 days that their Deed of Trust was transferred or assigned to
a third party, and that it is the new owner or assignee of the debt is illegal
in violation of Title 15 U.S.C. § 1641(g).
 
On July 17, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed their Complaint alleging six causes of action for: (1) Violation of Cal.
Civ. Code § 2923.5; (2) Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2924(a)(1); (3) Violation
of Cal. Civ. Code § 2924.9; (4) Wrongful Foreclosure; (5) Unfair Business
Practices, Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.; and
(6) Cancellation of Written Instruments, Cal. Civ. Code § 3412. 
 
On August 14, 2023, Rushmore and U.S.
Bank (collectively “Defendants”) filed a Demurrer with Motion to Strike,
subsequently sustained in part with leave to amend as to the First Cause of
Action (Violation of Cal. Civ. Code§ 2923.5), Fourth Cause of Action (Wrongful
Foreclosure), and Fifth Cause of Action (Unfair Business Practices, Violation
of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et sq.) with leave to amend;
sustained in part as to the Sixth Cause of Action (Cancellation of Written
Instruments (Cal. Civ. Code § 3412)) without leave to amend; overruled in part
as to the Third Cause of Action (Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2924.9); and
moot as to the Second Cause of Action (Violation of Cal. Civ. Code §
2924(a)(1).) The Motion to Strike was subsequently granted with leave to amend.
 
On October 25, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed their First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging four causes of actions
for: (1) First Cause of Action (Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.5); (2)
Third Cause of Action (Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2924.9); (3) Fourth Cause
of Action (Wrongful Foreclosure); and (4) Fifth Cause of Action (Unfair
Business Practices, Violation of Cal. Bus. 
Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.).
 
On November 13, 2023, Defendants
filed a Demurrer to the FAC with Motion to Strike.

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Demurrer – A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn v.¿Mirda¿(2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) ¿When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context.¿ (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)¿ In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.¿ (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.30(a).)¿A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.¿ (SKF Farms v.
Superior Court¿(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.)¿ Therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.¿¿(Ibid.)¿¿The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.¿ (Hahn,¿supra,¿147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
A general demurrer admits the truth of all
factual, material allegations properly pled in the challenged pleading,
regardless of possible difficulties of proof.¿¿(Blank v. Kirwan
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿ Thus, no matter how unlikely or improbable,
plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as true for the purpose of ruling on
the demurrer.¿¿(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.¿(1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)¿ Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations
expressing mere conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits
to the complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.¿¿(Vance
v. Villa Park¿Mobilehome¿Estates¿(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.)¿A general
demurrer does not admit contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the complaint; facts impossible in law; or allegations contrary to
facts of which a court may take judicial notice.¿¿(Blank,¿supra,
39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Pursuant to¿Code Civ. Proc.¿§430.10(e), the
party against whom a complaint has been filed may object by demurrer to the
pleading on the grounds that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.¿ It is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer
without leave to amend if there is a reasonable probability that the defect can
be cured by amendment.¿¿(Schifando¿v. City of Los Angeles¿(2003) 31
Cal.4th 1074, 1082,¿as modified (Dec. 23, 2003).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
----- 
 
Standard for a Motion to Strike – The court may,
upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems
proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The
grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false, or
improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id.
§ 436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the
pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id. § 437.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
-----¿¿ 
¿¿ 
Meet and Confer Requirement– Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 430.41 and
435.5.) The Court notes that counsel for Defendants, Jana Logan (“Logan”)
indicates that she has satisfied this requirement. (See Declaration of
Demurring or Moving Party RE: Meet and Confer, Demurrer; Declaration of
Demurring or Moving Party RE: Meet and Confer, Motion to Strike). However,
Logan has not signed the declaration. A determination by the court that the
meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or
sustain a demurrer or motion to strike. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§
430.41(a)(4), 435.5(a)(4). The Court addresses the Demurrer and Motion to
Strike on their respective merits.

Discussion
 
Application – 
 
      
i.         
Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”)
 
All requests for judicial notice
are recorded in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office. Some are also
incorporated into the Complaint, discussed infra. Documents recorded by
a county recorder are considered official acts of the executive department
under Cal. Evid. Code § 452(c). (See Cal-American Income Property Fund II v.
County of L.A. (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 109, 112 fn. 2.) Further, such
documents are “not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate
and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable
accuracy.” (Cal. Evid. Code § 452(h).) The Court has looked through each
exhibit for the recorded documents. The Court takes judicial notice of documents
requested under Cal. Evid. Code §§ 452(c)-(d), and 453.
 
    
ii.         
Demurrer
 
Defendants demur to the First Cause
of Action (Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.5); Fourth Cause of Action
(Wrongful Foreclosure), and Fifth Cause of Action Unfair Business Practices,
Violation of Cal. Bus.  Prof. Code §
17200, et seq.) within the Complaint.
 
As an initial matter, while the
FAC indicates exhibits, no exhibits have been attached. However, the exhibits
appear to evidence the same exhibits that were incorporated in the Complaint. The
sham pleading doctrine provides a court with discretion to disregard “sham”
amendments. An amended pleading may be “sham” if it omits or contradicts
harmful facts pleaded in the original pleading, absent a showing of mistake or
other sufficient excuse for changing the facts. Without such a showing, the
amended pleading may be treated as a sham. (Vallejo Develop. Co. v. Beck
Develop. Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 929, 946; State of Calif. ex rel.
Metz v. CCC Information Serv., Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 402, 412.) The
Court believes that, due to the sham pleading doctrine and Plaintiffs’ previous
complaint, the Plaintiff is bound by the exhibits that were attached to the
Complaint as the FAC alleges that the exhibits show the same as those attached
to the Complaint. As such, the Court treats the exhibits within the Complaint
as the exhibits that Plaintiffs are referencing within the FAC. 
 
The Court had previously put
together timeline of the documents incorporated within the Complaint and
provides it here for the parties:

a. First Cause of Action
(Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.5)
 
Defendants present that Cal. Civ.
Code § 2923.5 requires a servicer to attempt to contact a
borrower, to assess their
financial situation and explore options to avoid foreclosure, at least 30 days
before a notice of default is recorded, and, if the servicer is unable to with
the borrower, it may satisfy the outreach requirements by sending and making
three telephone calls. Defendants argue that the Complaint only alleges that
Plaintiffs did not receive letters, but this does not show that a violation
occurred as the statutory requirement is to send out letters, not confirm that
the letters are received. Defendants present that the factual allegations for
this cause of action were not changed from the Complaint and the deficiencies
remain. Defendants further argue that (1) Plaintiffs contradict themselves as
they allege that they submitted loan modifications and were denied at least
once and so the First Cause of Action (Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.5 is
disingenuous; (2) Plaintiff has not shown that the violation is material; and
(3) there are no allegations that Plaintiff changed their actions due to the
purported Homeowner’s Bill of Rights (“HBOR”) violations or that, absent the
alleged violations, the Property would not have gone into foreclosure. 
 
Plaintiffs emphasize that HBOR
requirements mandate that a servicer may not record a notice of default until
30 days after contacting the borrower to discuss alternatives to foreclosure
and that, here, Plaintiff was available by phone and mail and never received either
a phone call from Rushmore or any written notifications and, despite this,
Rushmore recording a Notice of Default and notice of Sale on December 02, 2022.

 
Defendants argue, in reply, that
the claim under Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.5 fails due to the wording of the FAC
which was not changed from the Complaint. Defendants reiterate that (1)
alleging a violation under Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.5 with the basis that they
were never notified of options to explore avoiding for closure is disingenuous
as Plaintiffs have admitted that they applied numerous times for a loan
modification and were denied at least once; (2) Plaintiff has not alleged that
the statutory violation was material; and (3) there are no allegations that
Plaintiffs changed their actions due to the purported HBOR violations or that,
absent the alleged violations, the Property would not have gone into
foreclosure. 
 
The Court first addresses the
argument regarding conflicting allegations as it has the potential to affect
the FAC in its entirety. Plaintiff provides no argument. The Court notes that
the allegations at issue were present in the Complaint. (Compare Complaint ¶ 20
and First Cause of Action to FAC ¶ 20 and First Cause of Action.) However, this
argument was not raised previously and, as such, was unaddressed until this
Demurrer. The allegation at issue reads: 
 
PLAINTIFFS submitted
loan modifications over and over again, only to be told that they were missing
documents every time. This occurred over several years. During the time that
New Rez, LLC, Select Portfolio Services, Inc. and RUSHMORE, PLAINTIFFS were only
denied at least once. The file was closed out several times, and as he recalls
it was during the transfer period when PLAINTIFFS were not notified until they
got mortgage statements from the new servicer.
 
(FAC ¶ 20.) 
 
The Court believes this is
contradictory to the allegations in the FAC that allege that (1) Plaintiffs
were never contacted, and (2) Plaintiffs were not offered foreclosure
alternatives. 
 
It is undisputed that the code
requirement is to state the facts, not theories:  a statement of the facts constituting the
cause of action, in ordinary and concise language. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 426; Manti
v. Gunari (1970) 5 Cal. App. 3d 442, 449-50 (“Manti”).) While
inconsistent theories of recovery are permitted, a pleader cannot blow hot and
cold as to the facts positively stated, regardless of whether the pleading is
verified. (Manti, supra, 5 Cal. App. 3d 442, 449, 450.) In reference to
the antagonistic allegations in the single cause of action the court is
required to take as true the averments in the complaint which bear most
strongly against the pleader. (Manti, supra, 5 Cal. App. 3d at
450.) As paragraph 20 bears most strongly against the pleader, the Court must
take it as true. Thus, this appears to be an issue on the face of the
pleadings. 
 
With this addressed, the Court
need not delve into the remaining arguments as Plaintiff has conceded that they
did attempt loan modifications with Rushmore, alleged to be the current loan
servicer, and were denied at least once. (See FAC ¶¶ 2, 20.)
 
The Demurrer to the First Cause
of Action (Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.5) is SUSTAINED.
 
b. Remaining Causes of
Action Demurred To – Fourth Cause of Action (Wrongful Foreclosure), Fifth
Cause of Action (Unfair Business Practices, Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof.
Code § 17200, et sq.)
 
The foundation of Plaintiffs’ remaining
claims, Fourth Cause of Action (Wrongful Foreclosure) and Fifth Cause of Action
(Unfair Business Practices, Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et
sq.) is the alleged HBOR violations. That is, the Fourth Cause of
Action (Wrongful Foreclosure) focuses on the failure to notify Plaintiffs (see
FAC ¶¶ 42-43) and the Fifth Cause of Action (Unfair Business Practices,
Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et sq.) focuses on the
same (see FAC ¶¶ 62, 64). 
 
These allegations are
contradicted by the allegation in paragraph 20. 
 
Accordingly, the Demurrer as to these
causes of actions is SUSTAINED. 
 
c. Third Cause of Action (Violation
of Cal. Civ. Code §2924.9, Failure to Provide Homeowner with Foreclosure Alternatives)
 
This cause of action has not been
demurred to. The Court believes this is due to its previous ruling. However, as
mentioned, ante, the argument regarding contradictory allegations was
not raised previously. 
 
Considering Defendants’ new
argument, this cause of action is affected as the basis is the failure to
provide Plaintiffs with notification. (See FAC ¶ 33.) 
 
The Court intends to strike this
cause of action as it is now improper and not drawn in conformity with the
Court’s intended ruling. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 436 [“The court may, upon
a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and
upon terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading
not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or
an order of the court.”].)
 
The Court inquires at the
hearing. 
 
  
iii.         
Motion to Strike
 
Defendants’ Motion to Strike rendered
MOOT due to the Court’s analysis of and ruling on the Demurrer.
 
-----
 
Leave to Amend
 
Leave to amend must be allowed where there
is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy¿(1976),
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) While under California law leave to amend is liberally
granted, “leave to amend should not be granted where, in all probability, amendment would be futile.” (Vaillette
v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. (1993), 18 Cal. App. 4th 680, 685).¿ “A trial
court does not abuse its discretion when it sustains a demurrer without¿leave
to amend¿if either (a) the facts and the nature of the claims are clear and no
liability exists, or (b) it is probable from the nature of the defects and
previous unsuccessful attempts to plead that the plaintiff cannot state a
claim.” (Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp.¿(1992)¿4 Cal.App.4th 857, 889.)¿¿¿¿ 
 
Here, the issue with the causes of actions
in Plaintiff’s FAC is due to the contradictory allegation in
paragraph 20. Rectification would mean an omission of the allegation, which
would go against the sham pleading doctrine. (See ante.) Accordingly, an
amendment would not rectify the deficiencies within the FAC.
 
Leave to Amend is DENIED as to
the First Cause of
Action (Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2923.5), Fourth Cause of Action (Wrongful
Foreclosure), and Fifth Cause of Action (Unfair Business
Practices, Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.).
 
-----
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants Rushmore Loan
Management Services, LLC; and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, solely as
Trustee of the Truman 2021 SC9 Title Trust’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend.
 
The Court strikes the Third Cause
of Action (Violation of Cal. Civ. Code § 2924.9) as a matter that is improper
and not drawn with conformity with this Court’s order. (See Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 436.)
 
Defendants Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC; and
U.S. Bank Trust National Association, solely as Trustee of the Truman 2021 SC9
Title Trust’s Motion to Strike is MOOT.
