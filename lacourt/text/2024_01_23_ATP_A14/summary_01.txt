Case Number: 21AVCV00905
Hearing Date: January 23, 2024
Dept: A14
Background:
  - This is a personal injury action
  - Plaintiff Cristina Mondy alleges that on May 21, 2020, she was bitten by two large pit bull mix dogs owned by Defendants Tom Deghionno, Audrey Deghionno, and Laura Deghionno
  - Plaintiff filed a Complaint alleging two causes of action for Negligence and Premises Liability on November 09, 2021
  - Moving Defendants filed an Answer on October 28, 2022
  - Laura was served on January 23, 2023, and has neither answered nor been placed in default

Legal Standard:
  - The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial
  - The Court must grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence and uncontradicted by other evidence, show that there is no triable issue of fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law

Discussion:
  - Moving Defendants present that Plaintiff has served factually devoid discovery responses where she concedes to not have sufficient information to admit or deny that Moving Defendants owned the two dogs as alleged in her Complaint or that the two dogs had ever bitten or attacked any person before May 21, 2020
  - Moving Defendants argue that they do not have a special relationship with Plaintiff that would lead to a duty to perform reasonably careful inspections at reasonable intervals to learn of dangers not apparent to the eye
  - Moving Defendants argue that a landlord has no general duty to periodically inspect non-common areas of their leased premises
  - Moving Defendants
