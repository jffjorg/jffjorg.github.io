Summary:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Mohill Holdings, LP in a wrongful eviction action. The plaintiff, Mary Therese Detevis, alleges that she was wrongfully evicted from a property in Palmdale, CA, and seeks to recover damages. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims are insufficient and seeks to dismiss the complaint.

The court finds in favor of the plaintiff on the demurrer, overruling the defendant's objections to the first three causes of action, including the allegations of illegal lockout, trespass, and violation of LAMC. The court also denies the defendant's motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the allegations of malice and conscious disregard are sufficient to support the claim.

The court notes that it has addressed the emergency argument and directs the parties to the discussion on page seven. The court also declines to discuss the LAMC arguments and directs the parties to its analysis of the LAMC and its applicability.
