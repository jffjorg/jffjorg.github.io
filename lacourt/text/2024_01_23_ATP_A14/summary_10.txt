And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a case involving Craig Van Dam and Marta Van Dam, who are suing an unnamed defendant. The ruling notes that the relevant statute in Paul (California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16) was the version applicable in 2002, but has since been revised. The judge cites various statutory revisions from 2005 to 2022, highlighting the changes made to the statute over time. The ruling does not appear to address any specific disputes, acts, or agreements between the parties, but rather provides context for the court's consideration of the case.
