Summary:

The Judge has written a tentative ruling in a case involving a lemon law action brought by the plaintiffs, Peggy Howard and Steven Howard, against Hyundai Motor America, Inc. The plaintiffs purchased a new 2019 Kona vehicle with an express limited warranty period, but the vehicle had various defects and/or nonconformities in the battery system. The defendant argues that the arbitration agreement in the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) applies to the dispute and that the plaintiffs' claims arise from the condition of the subject vehicle. The defendant also argues that it has standing to enforce the arbitration agreement under Felisilda v. FCA US LLC. The plaintiffs argue that the arbitration provision is unconscionable and that the defendant has waived its right to arbitrate by participating in the discovery process. The Judge concludes that the defendant has waived its right to arbitrate by participating in the discovery process and denies the defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
