And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling regarding a future court hearing. The case involves the Deghionno family members, Tom, Audrey, and Laura, who are being sued by a plaintiff. The Judge has decided to strike the first cause of action for negligence, citing duplication with the second cause of action and referencing Code of Civil Procedure section 436. The Judge will instead use the premises liability analysis for both causes of action. The ruling is based on evidence presented, including an incident report and deposition testimony from Tom Deghionno, which showed that Tom did not know about the first incident. The Judge will use Arabic numerals as listed in the complaint, taking note of the mislabeling of two paragraphs.
