 Case Number:  23AVCV00212    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background This is a lemon law action. Plaintiffs Peggy Howard (“Peggy”)[1] and Steven Howard (“Steven” and collectively “Plaintiffs”) allege that on or about February 25, 2019, they purchased a new 2019 Kona, vehicle identification number KMBK53AG8KU022259 (the “Subject Vehicle”), and, as part of the sale, Defendant Hyundai Motor America, Inc. (“Defendant”) gave Plaintiffs an express limited warranty period of 5 years of 60,000 miles, whichever came first, and an express limited power train warranty covering 10 years or 100,000 miles, whichever came first. Plaintiffs present that the Subject Vehicle had various defects and/or nonconformities in the battery system, including an inability to take a charge; that these defects were present at the time of sale; and, at the time of sale, Defendant and the selling dealership were aware of the problems in the Subject Vehicle, but did not disclose them to Plaintiffs, leading to damages. On February 23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint alleging one case of action for Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. On April 06, 2023, Defendant filed its Answer. On December 18, 2023, Defendant filed this Motion to Compel Arbitration. On January 08, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their Opposition. On January 16, 2024, Defendant filed its Reply. ----- Legal Standard Standard for Compelling Arbitration – California law incorporates many of the basic policy objectives contained in the Federal Arbitration Act, including a presumption in favor of arbitrability. (Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 971-72.) Cal. Code¿Civ.¿Proc.¿§ 1281.2 permits a party to file a motion to request that the Court order the parties to arbitrate a controversy. Under Cal. Code¿Civ.¿Proc.¿section 1281.2, the Court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that:¿¿¿ ¿¿¿ (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or¿¿¿ (b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.¿¿¿ (c) A party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action or special proceeding with a third party, arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact. For purposes of this section, a pending court action or special proceeding includes an action or proceeding initiated by the party refusing to arbitrate after the petition to compel arbitration has been filed, but on or before the date of the hearing on the petition. This subdivision shall not be applicable to an agreement to arbitrate disputes as to the professional negligence of a health care provider made pursuant to Section 1295.¿¿¿ ¿¿¿ (Cal. Code¿Civ.¿Proc.¿§ 1281.2.)¿¿¿ ¿¿¿¿¿ Doubts as to whether an arbitration clause applies to a particular dispute are to be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration.¿(See United Transportation Union v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 804, 808-809; Engineers & Architects Assn. v. Community Development Dept. (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 644, 652; California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State of California (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 198, 205; San Francisco Police Officers' Assn. v. San Francisco Police Com. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 676, 683.)¿The Court should order them to arbitrate unless it is clear that the arbitration clause cannot be interpreted to cover the dispute.¿(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §1281.2 [“. . .unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement”].)¿Unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court, not the arbitrator.¿(Id.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿¿¿¿ The right to arbitration depends upon contract; a petition to compel arbitration is simply a suit in equity seeking specific performance of that contract.¿(Id.)¿There is no public policy favoring arbitration of disputes which the parties have not agreed to arbitrate.¿(Id.)¿¿¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿¿¿¿ The party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by the preponderance of the evidence.¿(Giuliano v. Inland Empire Personnel, Inc.¿(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284.)¿The trial court first decides whether an enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the parties and then¿determine whether the plaintiff’s claims are covered by the agreement.¿(Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co.¿(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)¿¿¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿¿¿¿ The party opposing the petition to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.¿(Giuliano v. Inland Empire Personnel, Inc.,¿supra,¿at¿1284.)¿In these summary proceedings, the trial court sits as a trier of fact, weighing all the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary evidence, as well as oral testimony received at the court’s discretion, to reach a final determination.¿(Id.)¿  ----- Discussion Application – Defendant presents that there is an arbitration agreement included with the Retail Installment Sales Contract (“RISC”), titled “Retail Installment Sales Contract–Simple Finance Charge (With Arbitration Provision)” and that the entire action is based upon transactions covered by the Arbitration Agreement. (Decl. Jordan A Willette ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’ warranty claims arise out of and relate to the RISC, that goods such as automobiles are governed by Cal. Comm. Code which treats a breach of warranty as a breach of the sales contract, and Defendant’s express warranty was integral to the purchase of the Subject Vehicle. Defendant next argues that it has standing to enforce the arbitration agreement under Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486 (“Felisilda”). Defendants believe no grounds exist for revocation of the arbitration agreement as it is neither procedurally nor substantively unconscionable. Defendant emphasizes that the matter must be stayed while the Motion to Arbitrate is pending and that Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 (commonly referred to as Ochoa v. Ford Motor Co.) is not binding as review has been granted. Plaintiffs argue that Defendant does not meet its initial burden to establish that it is a party to the arbitration agreement as Felisilda has been rejected in Ford Motor Warranty Cases; Montemayor v. Ford Motor Company (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958 (“Montemayor”); Kielar v. Superior Court (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th 614 (“Kielar”); and Yeh v. Superior Court (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 264 (“Yeh”). Plaintiffs highlight that while Ford Motor Warranty Cases in pending review, the Court may choose which case to follow as the California Supreme Court has stated that Ford Motor Warranty Cases “may be cited not only for its persuasive value, but also for the limited purpose of establishing the existence of a conflict in authority that would in turn allow trial courts to exercise discretion under Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d. 450, 456, to choose between the sides of any such conflict.” (Ochoa v. Ford Motor Co. (In re Ford Motor Warranty Cases) (2023) 2023 Cal. LEXIS 4235/ 2023 WL 4630837.) Plaintiffs emphasize that their Complaint does not allege that Defendant breached any obligations in the RISC and that the implied warranty of merchantability arises by an operation of law under a statutory scheme that is distinct and separate from the RISC. Plaintiffs next argue that the arbitration provision is unconscionable as (1) there is a high degree of procedural  unconscionability as the arbitration agreement not only stems from a contract of adhesion, but also contains oppression as no negotiations were held and surprise; and (2) there’s a high degree of substantive unconscionability as there is a lack of mutuality, plaintiffs are limited to individual injunctive relief, the arbitration agreement and the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)’s rules allow an arbitrator to award the costs of arbitration and attorney’s fees to a prevailing defendant, and the AAA’s rules do not provide for adequate discovery to enable Plaintiffs to enforce their Song-Beverly rights. Plaintiffs further argue that the arbitration clause cannot be saved through severance and Defendant has waived its right to arbitrate because it did not demand arbitration until November 03, 2023, constituting unreasonable delay. In Reply, Defendant argues that Felisilda is controlling as Plaintiffs’ breach of warranty and lemon law claims “arise from the condition of the subject vehicle” and the RISC at issue here “was the source of the warranties [and “resulting relationships”] at the heart of this case.” (Reply 1:28-2:2.) Defendant presents that Plaintiffs’ reliance on Ford Motor Warranty Cases and its progeny is inapt as (1) all trial Courts are bound by all published decisions of the Court of Appeal so long as the relevant point in the appellate decision has not been disapproved by the California Supreme Court and is not in conflict with another appellate decision; (2) due to the conflict between Ford Motor Warranty Cases and Felisilda, the Court is not bound by Ford Motor Warranty Cases and its progeny; (3) Ford Motor Warranty Cases and its progeny are under review; (4) Plaintiffs’ other argument does not distinguish Felisilda; (5) Plaintiffs would not have bought the Subject Vehicle if it did not come with manufacturer warranties which are part of the RISC. Defendant reiterates that the arbitration agreement is independently enforceable by Defendant due to equitable estoppel, citing Felisilda and other cases, the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable, and Felisilda is the better reasoned decision and the Court should follow Felisilda and not Ford Motor Warranty Cases. As an initial matter, Defendant cites to various superior court decisions, including tentative decisions, in its Reply brief and attaches them as exhibits. The Court declines to consider these arguments as other superior court decisions are not binding on this Court. (See People v. Sons (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 90, 100 [“Trial court judges are required to follow the United States and California Constitutions, California statutory law, the law as declared by the appellate courts of this state (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal. Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937]) as well as any “law of the case” as declared by the appellate court. . . Trial court judges are independent judicial officers. They have both the right and the duty, consistent with their oaths of office, to exercise their best judgment, not to abandon it to previous trial court rulings.”].) The Court addresses the timeliness of this motion as it must determine whether Defendant waived its right to arbitrate. The standard for waiver is as follows: When an arbitration agreement does not specify the time within which arbitration must be demanded, a reasonable time is allowed; a party who does not demand arbitration within a reasonable time is deemed to have waived the right to arbitration. (Sawday v. Vista Irrigation Dist. (1966) 64 Cal.2d 833, 836 [52 Cal.Rptr. 1, 415 P.2d 816] (Sawday); see also Davis v. Blue Cross of Northern California (1979) 25 Cal.3d 418, 425-426 [158 Cal.Rptr. 828, 600 P.2d 1060]; A. D. Hoppe Co. v. Fred Katz Constr. Co. (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 154, 161-162 [57 Cal.Rptr. 95, 25 A.L.R.3d 1162] (A. D. Hoppe Co.); Meyer v. Carnow, supra, 185 Cal.App.3d at pp. 174-175 & fn. 2.) "[W]hat constitutes a reasonable time is a question of fact, depending on the situation of the parties, the nature of the transaction, and the facts of the particular case.  [Citations.]" (Sawday, supra, 64 Cal.2d at p. 836.) Among the facts a court may consider is any prejudice the opposing party suffered because of the delay. (See A. D. Hoppe Co., supra, 249 Cal.App.2d at pp. 161-162.) (Spear v. California State Auto. Assn. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1035, 1043.) The Court takes judicial notice of its records pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code § 452(d) as it is pertinent to this pending motion. The Court provides the information and its sources, infra, to be made part of the record and this tentative to afford each party reasonable opportunity to meet such information before judicial notice of the matter may be taken. (See Cal. Evid. Code § 455.) Here, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on February 23, 2023. Defendant filed its Answer shortly after on April 06, 2023. The Court conducted a Case Management Conference on July 10, 2023 in which counsels for both parties appeared and scheduled the non-jury trial for May 31, 2024. (See 07/10/2023 Minute Order.) Only on December 18, 2023 did Defendant file this motion. Leading up to this hearing, the an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) was noticed and a joint statement was filed by the parties. The Court held an IDC on January 02, 2024; however, the parties stipulated to a continuation. The Join Statement filed by the parties indicates that the discovery process had begun. Defendant indicates that it responded to Plaintiff’s discovery requests and included objections as to preserve its right to compel arbitration, conceding that participating in discovery is seen as a party acting inconsistent with its right to arbitrate. (See Joint IDC Statement 8:5-18.) Despite this, Defendant has served Requests for Productions upon Plaintiffs. (See Decl. James S. Kostas, Exh. D.) The Court highlights the standard that Defendant has presented in the Joint IDC Statement: See e.g., Burton v. Cruise (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 939, 945-946 (noting that a defendant can waive arbitration by for example, acting “inconsistent with the right to arbitrate.”); see also, St. Agnes Med. Ctr. v. PacifiCare of Ca. (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1187, 1204 (noting that waiver can occur by the party’s participation in the judicial discovery process). (Joint IDC Statement 8:9-12.) Defendant has conceded that a legal standard exists where a party waives its right to arbitration by participating in discovery and, despite this, Defendant has participated in the discovery process. Further Defendant has been aware of the upcoming trial date of May 31, 2024 since July 10, 2023 and did not bring this motion until December 18, 2023.  Accordingly, based on the facts of this particular case, Defendant has waived its right to arbitration. The Motion to Compel Arbitration is DENIED. ----- Conclusion Defendant Hyundai Motor America, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Arbitration is DENIED.
