Summary in English:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's anti-SLAPP motion to strike the complaint. The defendant, Lucy Faddoul, published a comment on Facebook alleging false statements and injurious allegations about the Van Dam family in connection with a divorce and custody proceeding. The defendant argued that the comment is protected by the anti-SLAPP statute, which prohibits lawsuits aimed at chilling free speech. However, the court found that the comment does not meet the requirements for protected speech under the statute. The court also declined to award attorney's fees and costs to the defendant, finding that the motion was not frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.
