And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Elliot Tishbi and the production of documents. The plaintiff cancelled the deposition twice without providing a valid objection, and the court finds that the plaintiff has failed to appear for examination. The defendants have made a sufficient showing of a failure to appear, and the motion complies with all procedural requirements. The court orders the parties to meet and confer on a new deposition date within 10 days, with the deposition to be completed no later than 20 days from the date of the order. If the parties are unable to agree, the defendants may unilaterally pick a date and attempt to conduct the deposition. The court also grants the defendants' motion for sanctions in the amount of $1,000, payable within 30 days.
