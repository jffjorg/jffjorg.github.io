to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff Elliot Tishbi and Production of Documents
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Elliot Tishbi alleges an oral agreement with
defendants Kamran and Ramin Rahimi in May 2021, whereby if Plaintiff found a
tenant to enter into a one year minimum lease for premises located at 794-796
Stanford Avenue, Los Angeles, Defendants would pay Plaintiff a $50,000 fee. Plaintiff
alleges the placement of a tenant for a three year lease term. No fee was ever
paid. 
 
On January 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach
of Oral Contract, Fraud, and Violation of Penal Code section 496, subdivision
(a). On July 5, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the complaint. On
August 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint for Breach of Oral
Contract, Fraud, and Violation of Penal Code section 496, subdivision (a) on
August 1, 2023. On December 11, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer to the
breach of contract cause of action, and sustained the demurrer to the remainder
of the first amended complaint with 20 days leave to amend. On December 29,
2023, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint for Breach of Oral Contract,
and Fraud.
 
On February 8, 2024, the court sustained the demurrer to the
second cause of action for fraud without leave to amend. Defendants answered
the complaint on February 21, 2024.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendants Kamran and Ramin Rahimi moves to compel the
deposition of Plaintiff Elliot Tishbi, including the production of documents.
After numerous attempts to schedule a deposition beginning in December 2023,
the parties agreed to a deposition date of March 12, 2024. On March 11, 2024, Plaintiff
cancelled the deposition, and never followed up on new dates. The court
electronic filing system shows no opposition or reply on file at the time of
the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
A party may file a motion to compel deposition upon a
non-appearance of the noticed party. “If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action … without having served a valid objection … fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it … the party giving the notice may
move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony…” (Code
Civ. Proc., §2025.450, subd. (a).) A party must object to a deposition no less
than three calendar days before deposition date. (Code Civ. Proc., §2025.410,
subd. (b).)
 
The motion lacks a copy of any certificate of non-appearance
though given the notice of intended non-appearance the day before the scheduled
date, the court finds a sufficient showing of a failure to appear. The motion
includes a declaration regarding the meet and confer efforts to reschedule the
deposition after the first non-timely cancellation. The deponent continues to
not cooperate. [Declaration of David Youssefyeh.] (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (b).) The court finds the unopposed motion sufficiently complies with all
procedural requirements. The motion is granted.
 
The court orders to meet and confer on a new deposition
within 10 days of this order, with the deposition to be completed no later than
20 days from the date of this order. If the parties are unable to agree, Defendants
may unilaterally pick a date, attempt to conduct the deposition, and take a
subsequent notice of non-appearance, if applicable. If deponent fails to appear
again after the setting of the date, again, Defendants may take a certificate
of non-appearance. Any non-appearance may constitute grounds for an
evidentiary, issue or even terminating sanction of the action. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (h).)
 
Given the apparent unwillingness of Plaintiff to cooperate,
the court additionally grants the motion in order to compensate Defendants for
the prior non-appearance and lack of cooperation. Sanctions in the amount of
$1,000. (Code Civ. Proc., §2025.450, subd. (g).) Sanctions entered against both
Plaintiff and counsel of record joint and severally. Payable within 30 days.
 
Trial remains set for January 27, 2025.
