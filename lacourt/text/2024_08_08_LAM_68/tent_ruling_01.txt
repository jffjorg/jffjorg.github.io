SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On August 20, 2021, plaintiff Claudia Salazar began
employment with Defendants Oceanside Laundry LLC dba Emerald Los Angeles, LLC,
a Delaware Limited Liability Company, and Emerald Textiles Services, Northern
California, LLC, as a Laundry Worker in Defendants city of Commerce facility.
Plaintiff informed Defendants of her pregnancy. Plaintiff maintains Defendants
offered no notice of any rights, such as a request for accommodation to avoid
certain strenuous duties and pregnancy leave time. Notwithstanding, Plaintiff
subsequently requested an accommodation upon the advice of her medical
provider, limiting any lifting to no more than 20 pounds. No accommodation was
made, and Plaintiff alleges the work strain caused a miscarriage at six months.
Plaintiff was subsequently terminated in December 2022.

Gov. Code § 12940(a)) 2. Retaliation in Violation of The FEHA and Pregnancy
Disability Leave Law (Gov. Code §§ 12940, et seq.) 3. Interference in Violation
of the Pregnancy Disability Leave Law (Violation of Gov. Code § 12945) 4.
Violation of California Sick Leave Laws (Labor Code §§ 233, 246, 247.5, and 248

Discrimination (Violation of Gov. Code § 12940(k)) 8. Wrongful Discharge in
Violation of Public Policy 9. Declaratory Relief, and 10. Injunctive Relief.
 
RULING: Denied
Defendants Emerald Los Angeles, LLC and Emerald
Textiles Service Northern California, LLC move to compel arbitration on the
complaint filed by Plaintiff Claudia Salazar. Defendants maintain all claims
are subject to arbitration under the terms of the agreement, the agreement in
no way presents unconscionable, and Emerald Northern California may also
enforce the agreement as a non-signatory party. Plaintiff in revised
opposition challenges enforcement of the agreement on grounds of the lack of an
ability to enforce the agreement with a non-signatory party, and unconscionable
practices due to the failure to present a Spanish language copy of the
agreement and engagement of the onboarding process in Spanish. Defendants in
reply challenges the 22 page (seven pages too long) opposition as establishing
any defense to enforcement of the agreement. Defendants maintain the agreement
is authentic and establishes the relationship between all parties. Defendants
also deny any unconscionability, including a third party beneficiary
relationship. Defendants include new, and additional deposition testimony in
the reply, as well as a purported copy of the Spanish language arbitration agreement.
 
The
court first considers the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). “The FAA shall govern
the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement. If the FAA is held not to
apply to this Agreement for any reason, and the state or district in which Employee
is employed recognizes the enforceability of this Agreement and the arbitration
award, then this Agreement and the arbitration award or decision are
enforceable under the laws of the state or district in which Employee is
employed.”
 
Defendants
represent engaging in interstate commerce and therefore contend FAA rules
govern. [Declaration of Steven Beach.] Plaintiff offers no challenge. Barring a
conflict supporting a preemption of a specific provision under FAA, the court
adheres to the California standard for compelling arbitration in that FAA and
California adhere to the same standards for review of arbitration agreements.
The court finds no conflict with the FAA under the terms of the agreement. (Volt Information Sciences, Inc.
v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University (1989) 489 U.S.
468, 477–479; Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman
Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 346; see Adolph
v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, 1119; Viking River Cruises, Inc. v.
Moriana (2022) 142 S.Ct. 1906.) 

 
“A written
agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy
thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such
grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.) “On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the
existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party
thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the
petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines
that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines
that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or
(b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
 
The
law creates a general presumption in favor of arbitration. In a motion to compel arbitration, the moving party must prove by a
preponderance of evidence the existence of the arbitration agreement and that
the dispute is covered by the agreement. “‘Under “both
federal and state law, the threshold question presented by a petition to compel
arbitration is whether there is an agreement to arbitrate.”’” (Long v. Provide Commerce, Inc. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th
855, 861.) “Private arbitration is a matter of
agreement between the parties and is governed by contract law. (Platt Pacific, Inc. v. Andelson (1993)
6 Cal.4th 307, 313.) In a motion to compel arbitration, the moving party must prove by a
preponderance of evidence the existence of the arbitration agreement and that
the dispute is covered by the agreement. The burden then shifts to the
resisting party to prove by a preponderance of evidence a ground for denial
(e.g., fraud, unconscionability, etc.). (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin'l
Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413-414; Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 158, 164–165; Hotels
Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr., Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 754, 758.) Any challenges to the formation
of the arbitration agreement should be considered before any order sending the
parties to arbitration. The trier of fact weighs
all evidence, including affidavits, declarations, documents, and, if
applicable, oral testimony to determine whether the action goes to arbitration.
(Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr., Inc., supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at
p. 758.)
 
Defendants present a English copy of the
arbitration agreement which includes signature on August 24, 2021. [Beach Decl, Ex. A.] The court finds the declaration of
Beach sufficient to establish the existence of the executed agreement. [Ibid.]
The subject matter of the instant action as covered within the scope of the
arbitration clause also remains undisputed. The Spanish language copy of the
agreement is neither signed by any party, nor accounted for as ever presented
to Plaintiff. Other than acknowledging the document as presented due to a
response to a discovery request, the court declines to consider the existence
of the agreement. 
 
The English language agreement lists the parties
as employee and Oceanside Laundry, LLC (“Company”). Defendants concede
Plaintiff was only employed by Oceanside Laundry, LLC (Oceanside), a company
purportedly no longer in existence and only previously operating as a dba for
or successor to Emerald Los Angeles, LLC. [Beach Decl.] Plaintiff specifically challenges
Defendants’ lack any evidence regarding any relationship between Emerald Los
Angeles, LLC and identified contracting party Oceanside. Plaintiff additionally
challenges the admitted lack of any contractual relationship and establishment
of any relationship between Emerald Northern California and Oceanside. 
 
Notwithstanding the successor/dba discussion in
the points and authorities, the only supported position itself relies on a
representation that all Defendants operate under common ownership through Wash
Encore Holdings, LLC (Wash Encore). [Beach Decl.] Defendants specifically rely
on the language of the agreement which provides: “Any reference to Company includes
the entity or entities that actually employs or has employed you, or that you
have applied for employment with, including, but not limited to any of the
Company’s parent or subsidiary entities, and all predecessors, successors and
assigns of any entity included in this definition of Company.” Again, the language, including the term
“Company” remain undisputed. 
 
“Every California case
finding nonsignatories to be bound to arbitrate is based on
facts that demonstrate, in one way or another, the signatory's implicit
authority to act on behalf of the nonsignatory.” (Jensen v. U-Haul Co. of
California (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 295, 304; Harris v. Superior Court (1986) 188 Cal.App.3d
475, 478–479; Rowe v. Exline (2007)
153 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1290.) “A nonsignatory can be compelled to arbitrate when
a preexisting relationship existed between the nonsignatory and one of the
parties to the arbitration agreement, making it equitable to compel
the nonsignatory to arbitrate as well.” (JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th
1222, 1240.) “Examples of the preexisting relationship include agency, spousal
relationship, parent-child relationship and the relationship of a general
partner to a limited partnership. (Citations.) In the
absence of such a relationship, or third party beneficiary status, courts will
generally not compel a nonsignatory to arbitrate.” (Crowley Maritime Corp. v. Boston Old Colony Ins. Co. (2008)
158 Cal.App.4th 1061, 1070.) “A nonsignatory plaintiff can be
compelled to arbitrate a claim even against a nonsignatory party, when the
claim is itself based on, or inextricably intertwined with, the contract
containing the arbitration clause.” (JSM
Tuscany, LLC v. Superior Court, supra,
193 Cal.App.4th at p. 1241.)
 
Defendant depends on a finding of a parent subsidiary relationship
and unsupported successor interest, as the basis to compel arbitration among
the parties not otherwise identified in the agreement. Defendant introduces the
new beneficiary argument in the reply. The court finds no specific support for
an estoppel or third party beneficiary claim, especially given the repeated
claim of a successor acquisition, which disregarding any existing third party
beneficiary basis. The court therefore only considers the parent subsidiary
argument. [Beach Decl., ¶ 2.]
 
The parent subsidiary argument itself also
lacks any factual support other than a statement of the existence of a parent
company. Nothing in the declaration of Beach in any way addresses operational
protocols regarding employee disputes and arbitration, such as whether claims
remain within the subsidiary or are in fact addressed by a single parent
entity. (See Waste Management, Inc.
v. Superior Court (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th
105, 110; Sonora Diamond Corp. v.
Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th
523, 548.) The motion additionally lacks any specific support for an agency
argument, if Defendants are possibly alternatively suggesting such a
relationship. (See Hernandez v. Meridian
Management Services, LLC
(2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 1214, 1220.) The reply and new deposition testimony
submitted with the reply lacks an apparent basis of support. (Plaintiff also
submits purported questions and answers regarding operations, but opposition
lacks a declaration attesting to the time, place and source of the purported
testimony.) The court otherwise declines to make the arguments for Defendants.
 
The
court therefore finds no contractual basis for arbitration as to either
defendant for purposes of the instant motion. The motion to compel arbitration is
denied on this basis. 
 
Even if the court accepted the succession of Emerald Los Angeles,
as the successor in interest to Oceanside, the court still lacks sufficient
support for Emerald Northern California. Again, the motion and reply lacks
establishment of a relationship binding the parties. 
 
The
court, as a matter of policy, avoids potential piecemeal adjudication of cases,
and maintains all parties either participate in arbitration or remain with the
court. “On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the
existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party
thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the court shall order the
petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines
that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines
that: … (c) A party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending
court action or special proceeding with a third party, arising out of the same
transaction or series of related transactions and there is a possibility of
conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact...” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.2.) 
 
The right of a trial court to refuse arbitration on the
possibility of conflicting rulings remains an upheld statutory rule. (Whaley
v. Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th
479, 485-486; Henry v. Alcove Investment, Inc. (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d
94, 101-102.) The
court finds no conflict with FAA provisions. (Cronus Investments, Inc. v. Concierge Services (2005) 35 Cal.4th 376, 394.) The motion is
therefore denied on this basis as well, due to the inability to determine the
basis for compelling all parties to arbitration.
 
Plaintiff finally
challenges the arbitration agreement on grounds of unconscionability. Unconscionability
claims have both a “‘procedural’” and “‘substantive’” element. (Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc. (1997) 51
Cal.App.4th 1519, 1531.) “‘Procedural unconscionability’” concerns the manner
in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties at
that time. (Kinney v. United HealthCare
Services, Inc. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1322, 1329.) “‘The procedural
element focuses on two factors: “oppression” and “surprise.”  “Oppression” arises from an inequality of
bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of
meaningful choice. “Surprise” involves the extent to which the supposedly
agreed-upon terms of the bargain are hidden in the prolix printed form drafted
by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.’” (Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc., supra, 51 Cal.App.4th at p. 1532.)
“Substantive unconscionability” involves contracts leading to “‘“overly
harsh”’” or “‘“one-sided”’” results.’” … “[U]nconscionability turns … on an
absence of ‘justification “for it…” [and therefore] must be evaluated as of the
time the contract was made.’” (Ibid.) 
 
In
the employment context, a mandatory arbitration agreement
is enforceable, if it “(1) provides for neutral arbitrators, (2) provides for
more than minimal discovery, (3) requires a written award, (4) provides for all
of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court, and (5) does
not require employees to pay either unreasonable costs or any arbitrators’ fees
or expenses as a condition of access to the arbitration forum.” (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 102.) Required execution of an
arbitration agreement as a condition of employment may constitute an
unconscionable provision, where the contract lacks mutuality and/or imposes a
disadvantage on the employee. (Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc., supra, 24 Cal.4th at pp.
114-118; Little v. Auto Stiegler, Inc. (2003)
29 Cal.4th 1064, 1071-1072.) A showing of procedural
unconscionability will not invalidate an arbitration clause, but can lead to
greater scrutiny under the substantive standard, thereby supporting
invalidation. (Davis v. TWC Dealer Group, Inc. (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 662, 674 accord OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho (2019) 8
Cal.5th 111, 129-130.)
 
Cases addressing
unconscionability offer guidance on the standard of the employment adhesion
contract—an agreement substantively presented as “take or it leave it” the
circumstances of which potentially impose a disadvantage on the employee. “With
respect to preemployment
arbitration contracts, we have observed that ‘the economic pressure exerted by
employers on all but the most sought-after employees may be particularly acute,
for the arbitration agreement stands between the employee and necessary
employment, and few employees are in a position to refuse a job because of an
arbitration requirement.’” (OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho, supra,
8 Cal.5th at pp. 126-127 accord Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc., supra, 24 Cal.4th at
p. 115; Hasty v. American Automobile Association of Northern California,
Nevada & Utah (2023) 98 Cal.App.5th 1041, 1055-1056; Serafin
v. Balco Properties Ltd., LLC (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 165,
179-181; see Grand Prospect Partners, L.P. v. Ross Dress for Less, Inc.
(2015) 232 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1351; Serpa v. California Surety
Investigations, Inc. (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 695, 705; see also Ramirez
v. Charter Communications, Inc. (Cal.,
July 15, 2024, No. S273802) 2024 WL 3405593, at *4.)
 
While
the basis of review exists, the burden still remains on the challenging party
to establish the defense. (Rosenthal v. Great
Western Fin'l Securities Corp., supra,
14 Cal.4th at pp. 413-414; Gamboa
v. Northeast Community Clinic, supra, 72 Cal.App.5th
at pp. 164–165; Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr., Inc., supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 758.) Plaintiff
essentially relies on a assertion of unconscionability based on a failure to present
and review the agreement in Spanish.
 
Cases
addressing unconscionability continues to offer guidance on the standard in the
case of employment adhesion contract—an agreement substantively presented as a
“take or it leave it” agreement imposing a potential disadvantage on the
employee. “With respect to preemployment arbitration
contracts, we have observed that ‘the economic pressure exerted by employers on
all but the most sought-after employees may be particularly acute, for the
arbitration agreement stands between the employee and necessary employment, and
few employees are in a position to refuse a job because of an arbitration
requirement.’” (OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho, surpa, 8 Cal.5th at p. 127 accord Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc., supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 115; Hasty v. American Automobile Association of
Northern California, Nevada & Utah (2023) 98 Cal.App.5th 1041 [317 Cal.Rptr.3d 295, 309-311]; see Grand Prospect Partners, L.P. v. Ross Dress
for Less, Inc. (2015) 232 Cal.App.4th
1332, 1351.)
 
The
subject circumstances depend on the lack of any Spanish copy or explanation.
Again, the court finds no support that the Spanish language copy was ever
presented given the lack of any executed copy, and the lack of any evidence
attesting to Spanish language onboarding. The argument in favor of
unconscionability therefore finds support due to the circumstantial imposition
of a lack of mutuality from the English language presentation. (Carmona v. Lincoln Millennium Car Wash, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 74, 84-86.) The court
finds the English language agreement and context created an unconscionable
position. The court denies the motion to compel on this basis as well. 
 
The motion is therefore
denied in its entirety. This order is appealable. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1294, subd.
(a).)
 
The court will concurrently conduct the case management
conference.
