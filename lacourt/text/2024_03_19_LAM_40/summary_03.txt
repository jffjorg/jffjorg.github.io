Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel deposition and request for monetary sanctions filed by the Defendants, Khowsrow Benji and Anna Benji, against the Plaintiff, Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio. The Plaintiff has objected to the deposition notices served on her, and the Defendants have requested monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff and her attorneys of record.

The Court has granted the Defendants' motion to compel deposition, but only in part, as the Plaintiff is ordered to appear at a deposition within 30 days of the order. The parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding a mutually agreeable deposition date.

The Court has denied the Defendants' request for monetary sanctions, as well as the Plaintiff's cross-request for monetary sanctions. The Court has also denied the Defendants' request to compel the production of documents, as the motion was not properly briefed.

The Judge has stated that parties have the right to depose one another in matters relevant to the action between them, and that counsel should not attempt to delay a deposition for dilatory purposes. The Judge has also stated that if a motion under subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
