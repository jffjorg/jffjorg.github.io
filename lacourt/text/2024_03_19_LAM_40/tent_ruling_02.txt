 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff North
  Mariposa Solutions, L.P.’s Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters Specified in
  Requests for Admission - Set One as Admitted and Request for Order Awarding
  Monetary Sanctions Against Defendant and Defense Counsel in the Sum of
  $1,500.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff North Mariposa Solutions
L.P. (North Mariposa) sues Defendant Derrick Paine and Does 1 through 10
pursuant to a March 30, 2022, Complaint alleging claims of (1) Breach of
Contract, (2) Unjust Enrichment, (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and (4) Common
Counts.
The claims arise from allegations
that, while performing property management duties on behalf of Plaintiff—e.g.,
collecting rent from properties owned by Plaintiff and managed by
Defendant—Defendant Paine withheld and kept for himself $32,870.58 in monies he
should have turned over to Plaintiff North Mariposa.
B. Relevant Procedural History
On October 26, 2022, Plaintiff
North Mariposa served Defendant Paine with Request for Production of Documents
(RPDs), Set One, Form Interrogatories (FROGs), Set One, Special Interrogatories
(SROGs), Set One, and Requests for Admission (RFAs), Set One.
Defendant Paine did not provide
verified responses within the permissible timeframe.
On December 13, 2022, Defendant
Paine served responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for
Admission, Set One. Such responses contained various objections and/or
statements of compliance indicating that Defendant Paine would produce
responsive documents as they were found to exist and/or that Defendant Paine
reserved the right to supplement, amend, or alter his responses.
On January 10, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel reached out to Defendant Paine’s counsel, seeking out to inquire via
voicemail as to when actual responses to the discovery would be provided.
On January 12, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel received an email from Defendant Paine’s counsel indicating that
despite numerous attempts, Defendant Paine’s counsel had had no contact with
its clients for quite some time.
On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel set a meet and confer letter to Defendant Paine’s counsel, seeking
supplemental responses to the discovery requests by January 20, 2023.
On January 25, 2023, Plaintiff’s
counsel called Defendant Paine’s counsel’s office one last time seeking an
update on supplemental responses, with Defendant Paine’s counsel indicating
that Defendant Paine had not responded to his counsel’s attempts to contact
him.
That same day, Plaintiff North
Mariposa filed a motion to compel further responses and/or production to RPDs,
SROGs, FROGs, and RFAs, Set One, as well as for monetary sanctions.
On February 8, 2023, Tom Roddy
Normandin, Esq.—counsel for Defendant Paine—filed a motion to be relieved as
counsel, citing a complete breakdown in communications with Defendant Paine,
who refused to communicate with counsel in any fashion.
On March 24, 2023, the Court
granted Mr. Normandin’s motion, which was to be effective only upon filing of a
proof of service of the order relieving counsel on Defendant Paine. The record
fails to reflect any such proof of service—an issue the Court addresses in the
Conclusion.
C. Motion Before the Court
On December 27, 2023, Plaintiff
North Mariposa filed a motion to deem RFAs, Set One, admitted. 
The motion and its attached
Alexander declaration do not contain proof of service of the motion on
Defendant Paine or on Tom Roddy Normandin, Esq.
No opposition appears in the
record.
Plaintiff North Mariposa’s motion
is now before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted and Request for
Sanctions
A. Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted:
DENIED.
1. Legal
Standard
The discovering party can make a
motion to deem as admitted any unanswered requests for admission or any
requests answered in a late or unverified response. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a) [RFA responses must
be signed by responding party under oath]; see Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no
response].) These requests are not automatically deemed admitted; the discovery
party must make the motion. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
To establish this ground, a movant
must show:
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.070);
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subds. (a), (b)); and
(3) That (a) the responding party
served no response (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b)), (b) the
propounding party served a late response (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(b)); or (3) the responding party served an unsworn response (see Appleton
v. Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at p. 636 [unsworn response
to RFAs is treated like no response]).
A court must deny a motion to
compel initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of
discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12,
19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of discovery].)
2. Analysis
Here, the Court DENIES Plaintiff
North Mariposa’s motion.
As made clear by Plaintiff’s
January 25, 2023, motion to compel further responses to RFAs, Set One, on
December 13, 2022, Defendant Paine served objection-only responses to RFAs, Set
One, which need not be verified or sworn because they are objections. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.240, subd. (a), (c); see 1/25/23 Mot., Alexander Decl., Ex.
9 [Dec. 13, 2022, RFAs, Set One, responses].)
As a result, a motion to compel
further discovery responses as to RFAs, Set One, is the only relief available
as to that discovery. Such relief was pursued on January 25, 2023, and granted
on August 21, 2023. At this point, Plaintiff North Mariposa needs to move to
enforce the Court order—for the moment, a moot exercise, as the Court will
direct compliance with its own orders below in the Conclusion—or move for issue
or evidence sanctions against Defendant Paine. However, deeming RFAs admitted
is a procedural remedy foreclosed as of December 13, 2022.
Plaintiff’s motion is thus DENIED.
B. Request for Sanctions: DENIED.
1. Legal
Standard
The Court must award sanctions when
a party’s response is untimely, and the discovering party makes a motion to
deem the requests admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see Stover
v. Bruntz (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 19, 31-32; see e.g., Appleton v.
Superior Court, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at pp. 635-636 [sanctions are
mandatory].)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
2. Analysis
Here, because the motion to deem
RFAs, Set One, admitted was denied, the request for monetary sanctions is
likewise DENIED.
 
III. Conclusion
A. Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted
and Request for Sanctions
Plaintiff North Mariposa Solutions,
L.P.’s Motion to Deem the Truth of Matters Specified in Requests for Admission
- Set One as Admitted and Request for Order Awarding Monetary Sanctions Against
Defendant and Defense Counsel in the Sum of $1,500 is DENIED.
B. Other Orders
1. Defense
Counsel Tom R. Normandin, Esq.
An attorney remains the attorney of
record until a substitution of counsel form is filed with the court, or the
court has otherwise granted its permission for the attorney to withdraw from
the representation. The attorney can still bind his or her client if the other
side does not know about the change in counsel. (See, e.g., Reynolds v.
Reynolds (1943) 21 Cal.2d 580, 584 [service of papers on former attorney,
after final judgment of divorce, in proceeding to increase support award, held
proper]; Sherman v. Panno (1954) 129 Cal.App.2d 375, 379 [notice of
entry of judgment for plaintiff, mailed to defendants’ former counsel before
notice of substitution received by counsel for plaintiff, held effective to
start statutory time running on court’s power to grant new trial].)
The Court ORDERS Tom R. Normandin,
Esq. to file proof of service of the March 24, 2023, order on Defendant Paine within
15 days of notice of this order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(4).)
2. Defendant
Derrick Paine
To the extent that he has not
already done so, the Court ORDERS Defendant Derrick Paine to comply with this
Court’s August 21, 2023, order within 30 calendar days of notice of this order.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(4).)
