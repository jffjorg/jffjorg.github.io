And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff North Mariposa Solutions, L.P.'s motion to deem Requests for Admission, Set One, admitted and request for order awarding monetary sanctions against Defendant Derrick Paine and defense counsel Tom Roddy Normandin, Esq. in the sum of $1,500.

The judge found that Defendant Paine served objection-only responses to the requests for admission, which need not be verified or sworn. Therefore, a motion to compel further discovery responses as to the requests for admission is the only relief available.

The judge also denied the request for monetary sanctions, as the motion to deem the requests for admission admitted was denied.

Additionally, the judge ordered defense counsel Tom R. Normandin, Esq. to file proof of service of the March 24, 2023, order on Defendant Paine within 15 days of notice of this order.

Finally, the judge ordered Defendant Derrick Paine to comply with the court's August 21, 2023, order within 30 calendar days of notice of this order.
