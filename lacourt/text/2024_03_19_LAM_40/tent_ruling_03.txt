  Compel Dep[o]sition of Plaintiff and Request for Monetary Sanctions Against
  Plaintiff and Her Attorneys of Record; and
Plaintiff Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco Bucio’s Opposition

I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Aidee Jacqueline Tinoco
Bucio sues Defendants Khowsrow Benji, Anna Benji, and Does 1 through 100
pursuant to an August 2, 2023, Complaint alleging 21 counts involving Fair
Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Labor Code, assault and battery, and other
claims.
B. Motion Before the Court
Once on September 12, 2023, and again
on December 26, 2023, Defendants Khowsrow Benji and Anna Benji (the Benji
Defendants) served deposition notices on Plaintiff Tinoco Bucio—with the
proposed depositions set to have taken place on October 10, 2023, and January
30, 2024, and including 77 document production requests—to which Plaintiff has
objected or otherwise declared unavailability on the date of the noticed
depositions.
On February 22, 2024, the Benji
Defendants filed a motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff and for
monetary sanctions in the amount of $8,025 against Plaintiff and her attorneys
of record.
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff Tinoco
Bucio filed an opposition to the Benji Defendants’ motion.
On March 12, 2024, the Benji
Defendants filed a reply to Plaintiff’s opposition.
On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff Tinoco
Bucio filed an evidentiary objection to a supplemental declaration from counsel
attached to the Benji Defendants’ reply.
The Benji Defendants’ motion is now
before the Court.
 
II. Evidentiary Objections
A. Plaintiff’s Objection to
Benji Defendants’ Reply’s Supplemental Kroll Declaration
Objection No. 1:
(1) OVERRULED in part, ¶¶ 1-5 [identification,
personal knowledge, and reducing moving papers’ monetary sanctions request from
$8,025 to $7,957.50]; and
(2) SUSTAINED in part, ¶¶ 6-7 [Lydig
Constr., Inc. v. Martinez Steel Corp. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 937, 944
[declarations must contain relevant facts, not ultimate facts commonly found in
pleadings; evidence must be admissible and not objectionable]; Brown v.
Ransweiler (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 516, 529 [declarations must be limited to
evidentiary facts and should not contain legal arguments or conclusions or
ultimate facts], quoting Hayman v. Block (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 629,
638-639; In re Marriage of Heggie (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 28, 30, fn. 3
[“The proper place for argument is in points and authorities, not declarations”].)
 
III. Motion to Compel Deposition and Request for Monetary
Sanctions
A. Motion
to Compel Deposition and Production: GRANTED in part [as to deposition];
DENIED in part [as to production in deposition notices].
1. Legal
Standard
If, [1] after service of a
deposition notice, [2] a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, [3] without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, [4] fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with
it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, [5] the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a) [Arabic numerals
added for clarity].)
The motion shall set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1).)
The motion shall also be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when
the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(b)(2).)
If the proposed deponent made some
response to the deposition notice, then a separate statement must accompany any
motion to compel deposition attendance or production. (See Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1345(a)(4), (b).)
2. Analysis
a. Preliminary
Notes
The Court reminds counsel of their
obligations under Appendix 3.A of the Los Angeles Local Rules to communicate civilly
and courteously, with the purposes of the Discovery Act firmly in mind.
The opposition largely paints the
moving papers’ as misrepresenting the record, while the moving papers frame
Plaintiff’s counsel as dilatory in serving deposition notices on Defendants
while simultaneously demanding that the depositions of all relevant witnesses
take place at the same time, thus delaying the rightful taking of Plaintiff’s
deposition.
The Court finds some merit to Plaintiff’s
argument that the Benji Defendants’ counsel has favorably colored the meet and
confer record in their favor and failed to sufficiently address the fact that
Plaintiff’s counsel’s final February 6, 2024, email—sent two weeks before this
motion was filed and referenced in the moving papers—offered early March 2024
dates for Plaintiff’s deposition. (See Mot., Kroll Decl., Ex. 17.)
The Court also finds merit to the
position that Plaintiff’s counsel has not acted diligently to proceed with
discovery by putting the Benji Defendants in a difficult position: (1) have the
Benji Defendants offer dates for their own depositions prior to a February 23,
2024, MSC, when Plaintiff (a) has failed to submit to a properly noticed
deposition since at least October 2023, (b) refuses to be deposed subject to
all witnesses being deposed at the same time, and (c) has not filed deposition
notices for Defendants’ deposition, unilateral or otherwise—though Plaintiff’s
counsel did request available dates (see, e.g., Mot., Kroll Decl., Ex. 14, Jan.
15, 2024 Email]); or (2) wait until after the MSC passes to secure a deposition
of Plaintiff, i.e., after an opportunity has passed to use all available
information, including depositions, to determine whether the parties can reach
an agreement resolving the case.
Ultimately, as discussed below,
parties have the right to depose one another in matters relevant to the action
between them. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2017.010, 2025.010.)
Moreover, counsel should not
attempt to delay a deposition for dilatory purposes but only if necessary to
meet real scheduling problems (Super Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, appen, §
3.A., subd. (e)(4)), and here, the Court is not entirely clear on the grounds
for Plaintiff’s and counsel’s last-minute unavailability, which undercut the
timing of Plaintiff’s objections to the deposition notices. (Mot., Kroll Decl.,
¶ 10, Ex. 4 [objections four days before scheduled deposition, stating not
available for noticed deposition among other objections] & ¶ 22, Ex. 15
[objections five days before scheduled deposition, stating not available for
noticed deposition among other objections]; cf. Opp’n, Akhavan Decl., ¶ 12
[sparse record in favor of October 2023 unavailability, and no mention of
January 25, 2024 objections in declaration generally].) If Plaintiff wished to
proceed with the Benji Defendants’ depositions earlier, it behooved Plaintiff
to pursue such relief. Such delay cannot be a reason to delay the Benji
Defendants’ rights however—production requests aside, further discussed below.
With these notes in mind, the Court
moves to the procedural requirements and substantive merits of the arguments.
b. Procedural
Requirements
i. Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2)
Here, the parties extensively
detail their meet and confer efforts prior to and following the filing of this
motion, thus satisfying this statutory requirement. (Mot., Kroll Decl., ¶¶
6-25, Exs. 1-17; Opp’n, Akhavan Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, 9-30, Exs. A-R.)
c. Substantive
Discussion
i. Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a)
Here, the record is clear between
both parties: Despite the Benji Defendants [1] serving two deposition notices
[2] on Plaintiff between September 12, 2023, and December 26, 2023, with the
proposed depositions to have taken place on October 10, 2023, and January 30,
2024, [3] Plaintiff Tinoco Bucio did not proceed with the noticed depositions based
on unavailability and other objections. (Mot., Kroll Decl., ¶¶ 6-25, Exs. 1-17;
Opp’n, Akhavan Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, 9-30, Exs. A-R.)
Thus, for the Benji Defendants to
have standing to bring this motion, Plaintiff cannot have raised valid
objections to the deposition itself or the production requests attached
thereto.
For the purposes of this
discussion, the Court relies on the Benji Defendants’ December 26, 2023,
deposition notice, and Plaintiff’s January 25, 2024, objections to that notice and
the 77 production requests. (Mot., Kroll Decl., Exs. 11, 15.)
ii. Determination
on Merits of Objections and Deposition
Here, the Benji Defendants are
clearly entitled to a deposition of Plaintiff Tinoco Bucio. (Code Civ. Proc.,
2025.010 [“Any party may obtain discovery within the scope delimited by Chapter
2 (commencing with Section 2017.010), and subject to the restrictions set forth
in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 2019.010), by taking in California the
oral deposition of any person, including any party to the action. The person
deposed may be a natural person, an organization such as a public or private
corporation, a partnership, an association, or a governmental agency.”].)
The fact that the Benji Defendants
served their first deposition notice at the same time as serving an
acknowledgment of receipt is not improper. (Opp’n, p. 2; Opp’n, Akhavan Decl.,
¶¶ 9-10.) Subject to inapplicable provisions, a defendant may serve a
deposition notice without leave of court at any time after that defendant has
been served or has appeared in the action, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.210.)
And though the Benji Defendants
have twice served deposition notices by unilaterally setting dates (Mot., Kroll
Decl., ¶¶ 6, 19, Exs. 1, 11), the extensive meet and confer efforts between the
parties show that “[i]n scheduling” at the very least the January 30, 2024,
deposition, “reasonable consideration [was] given to accommodating schedules
o[f] opposing counsel and of the deponent, where it is possible to do so
without prejudicing the client’s rights.” (Super Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, appen,
§ 3.A., subd. (e)(2).) This is because the parties had already extensively
discussed the timing of Plaintiff’s deposition and seemingly could not agree on
whether Plaintiff’s deposition should take place before the parties’ February
23, 2024, mandatory settlement conference (MSC) -- Benji Defendants’ position
(Mot., Kroll Decl., Ex. 14, Jan. 9, 2024, Email) -- or should proceed as to all
witnesses or wait until after the MSC so that all depositions could take place around
the same time -- Plaintiff’s position. (Mot., Kroll Decl., Ex. 14, Jan. 15, 2024,
Email.) (See Mot., Kroll Decl., ¶¶ 6-25, Exs. 1-17; Opp’n, Akhavan Decl., ¶¶
2-3, 9-30, Exs. A-R [discussions involving depositions of Plaintiff, two
Plaintiff-related witnesses, and two Defendants].) After waiting more than
several months to agree on a specific date—between September and December
2023—the unilateral setting of a January 30, 2024, deposition, juxtaposed
against the ongoing meet and confer efforts, satisfied the civility guidelines,
undercutting Plaintiff’s objection based on unilateral setting of deposition.
(See Opp’n, Kroll Decl., Ex. 15, p. 2.) 
Plaintiff’s attorney-client and
work-product objections are not sufficiently elaborated as to a deposition and
are thus not availing. (Opp’n, Kroll Decl., Ex. 15, p. 2.) No separate
statement exists to elaborate this argument, nor are privileges raised in the
opposition points and authorities.
Plaintiff’s objection that the
December 26, 2023, deposition notice seeks a multi-day deposition is unfounded
where a review of the deposition notice only lists January 30, 2024, as the
deposition date at issue. (Opp’n, Ex. 11, pp. 2-3 & Ex. 15, p. 2.) No
separate statement exists to elaborate this argument, nor does the opposition
state that Plaintiff has previously been deposed, only that Plaintiff would not
consent to more than one day of deposition. (Opp’n, Kroll Decl., Ex. 15, p. 2.)
The Court does note, however, that the rule is simply that non-expert
depositions are limited to seven hours subject to additional time needed to fairly
examine the deponent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.290.)
No valid objections thus exist to
the Benji Defendants taking Plaintiff’s deposition.
The Benji Defendants’ motion is therefore
GRANTED as to compelling a deposition of Plaintiff Tinoco Bucio.
iii. Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1)
However, the Benji Defendants’
motion is DENIED insofar as it seeks to a court order compelling compliance
with the deposition notice’s 77 production requests.
Quite simply, the failure to attach
a separate statement has hindered this Court’s ability to properly assess
arguments made in relation to the 77 production requests in the deposition
notice for Plaintiff, undercutting the good cause required here. (Mot., Kroll
Decl., Ex. 11.) Plaintiff has objected to each of those requests. (Mot., Kroll
Decl., Ex. 15.) But the Benji Defendants have not filed a separate statement
explaining why responses to the production requests should be ordered produced
by this Court. A separate statement is a separate document filed and served
with the discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to
understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that are at issue.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).) The separate statement requirement was
designed to streamline adjudication of discovery motions, and a failure to
attach a separate statement where one is required is a sufficient basis for the
Court’s exercise of its discretion to deny a motion to compel discovery. (Mills
v. U.S. Bank (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 871, 892.) The Court exercises that
discretion here.
The Benji Defendants’ motion is
thus DENIED as to compelling the production requested in the September 12,
2023, and December 26, 2023, deposition notices served on Plaintiff Tinoco
Bucio.
B. Request for Sanctions: DENIED
[as to Benji Defendants and Plaintiff].
1. Legal
Standard
If a motion under subdivision (a)
is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the
deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated,
unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
2. Analysis
a. Benji
Defendants’ Request for Sanctions
Here, given the limited success of
the Benji Defendants’ motion—essentially, a 1/88th victory—the request for
sanctions has limited basis.
The Benji Defendants’ request for
sanctions is thus DENIED.
However, the Court notes that the
Benji Defendants are clearly entitled to a deposition of Plaintiff Tinoco Bucio,
as discussed above and provided by the Discovery Act. (Code Civ. Proc.,
2025.010.)
b. Plaintiff
Tinoco Bucio’s Cross-Request for Sanctions
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s
cross-request for sanctions because imposing sanctions on the Benji Defendants
would be unjust where they are seeking to enforce their statutory discovery
rights to a deposition of Plaintiff, which has been granted. Even if the motion
has been denied as to the production requests, such a denial was based on lack
of proper briefing, not a lack of merit to the production requests, a topic
that could not be discussed based on the record.
