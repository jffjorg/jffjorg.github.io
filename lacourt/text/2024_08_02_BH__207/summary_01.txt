The judge denies the plaintiff's request for a default judgment against the defendants, Xpressguards and Xpressguards LLC. The plaintiff is seeking $129,460.81 in damages, which includes $100,000 in damages, $28,321.26 in prejudgment interest, and $1,139.55 in costs. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not substantiated the requested damages and that the calculation of prejudgment interest is improper. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not provided adequate evidence to support the requested damages. The judge does grant the plaintiff's request for costs, as the plaintiff is the prevailing party in this action.
