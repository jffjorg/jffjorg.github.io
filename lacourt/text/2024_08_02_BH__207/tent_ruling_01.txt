MATTER


Request for Entry of Default Judgment



 
Plaintiff James Bram (“Plaintiff”) requests for default judgment
against Defendants Xpressguards and Xpressguards LLC (“Defendants”)
in the amount of $129,460.81, which is composed of damages in the amount of $100,000;
prejudgment interest in the amount of $28,321.26; and costs in the amount of
$1,139.55.
 
            a.         Damages 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges fifteen causes of action for (1) Failure to Provide Meal
Periods; (2) Failure to Provide Rest Breaks; (3) Failure to Pay Overtime Wages;
(4) Failure to Furnish Accurate Itemized Wage Statements; (5) Failure to Pay
All Wages Owed; (6) Failure to Pay Waiting Time Penalties; (7) Failure to
Provide Complete Access to Employee Personnel File and Payroll Records in
Violation of Labor Code §§ 226, 432, and 1198.5; (8) Retaliation in violation
of FEHA; (9) Retaliation in Violation of Labor Code § 1102.5; (10) Retaliation
in violation of Labor Code § 98.6; (11) Retaliation in violation of Labor Code
§ 6310; (12) Failure to Prevent Retaliation in Violation of FEHA; (13) Unfair
Business Practices: (14) Wrongful Termination in violation of FEHA; (15)
Wrongful Termination in violation of public policy.  
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint seeks only $4,000 for violations of Labor Code, § 226, subd. (e)
(Complaint ¶ 47); $750 for violations of California Labor Code, § 226, subd.
(f) and § 1198.5, subd. (k) (Id. at ¶¶ 58-59); and $10,000 for
violations of Labor Code, § 986 (Id. at ¶ 6), for a total of $14,750.  The operative Complaint does not specify the
amount of damages sought for lost wages or emotional distress.
 
            Plaintiff
did serve a Statement of Damages, indicating $150,000 in damages, composed of
general damages of $50,000 for emotional distress, and special damages of
$100,000 for loss of earnings ($75,000) and for loss of future earning capacity
($25,000.)  
 
            Defendants
were served with a copy of the summons, complaint, and statement of damages via
substitute service on January 26, 2023. Default was entered against Defendants
on October 12, 2023.  The Doe Defendants
were dismissed on November 28, 2023.  Plaintiff’s
Statement of Damages also sets forth a claim of $20,000 in punitive damages.
 
            Plaintiff’s
Statement of Damages seeks $150,000 in damages, composed of general damages of $50,000
for emotional distress, and special damages of $100,000 for loss of earnings ($75,000)
and for loss of future earning capacity ($25,000).  
 
            However,
a plaintiff may rely on a statement of damages to satisfy the due process
requirements in personal injury and wrongful death cases only.  (Sporn v. Home
Depot USA, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th
1294, 1302 and Cal. Judges Benchbook, Civ. Proc. Before Trial § 16.16, p. 1924
[noting a statement of damages pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 425.11 may
satisfy the due process requirements to put Defendant on notice of the amount
at issue before a default is taken in personal injury and wrongful death cases
only].)  Otherwise, the amount of damages sought cannot exceed those
specified in the Complaint.  (Yeung
v. Soos (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 576, 582 [“a default judgment is void when
the damages are in excess of the damages specified in the complaint or the
statement of damages”].)  
 
            This
is not a personal injury or wrongful death case.  Therefore, the
court cannot award the requested $100,000 in damages, as it exceeds the $14,750
demanded in the Complaint.  
 
            Further, Plaintiff has not
adequately provided an accounting of the requested $14,750.  For example, in the briefing, Plaintiff
indicates:
 
Defendants failed to
provide Plaintiff accurate wage statements as required by Labor Code §§ 226(a).
The wage statements provided to Plaintiff did not include all hours worked, all
applicable overtime rates, wages for missed meal and rest periods.
Consequently, the wage statements included incorrect gross and net wages
earned. Under Labor Code § 226(e), Plaintiff is entitled to collect $50 for the
first pay period of a § 226(a) violation, and $100 for violation in each
subsequent pay period, up to a maximum of $4,000. To date, Plaintiff has not
received accurate wage statements and therefore is owed $4,000.00.
 
(Default Judgment Packet, July 2,
2024, at p. 6) but Plaintiff has not provided an evidence that he
did not receive accurate wage statements, much less evidence
about what was incorrect about the wage statements and why, or how many
problematic wage statements are at issue.
 
            Similarly,
Plaintiff’s briefing indicates:
 
Plaintiff and Plaintiff's
counsel, requested Defendants provide Plaintiff a copy of or access to his
employee personnel file and payroll records, and Defendants did not provide
Plaintiff a copy of or access to all his personnel file and payroll records in
violation of the above-described statutes. As such, Plaintiff is entitled to
$750.00.
 
(Default Judgment Packet, July 2,
2024 at pp. 6-7.)  But there is no evidence
in the record that Plaintiff or counsel ever requested Plaintiff’s personnel
file or payroll records.  
 
            Plaintiff
originally supported his request for damages with the Declaration of James
Abram.  With regard to the requested
damages, the original Abram Declaration indicates:
 
2. I was hired by
XpressGuards on July 12, 2021 as a Security Guard. My job duties and
responsibilities included patrolling a burned down building in Skid Row,
protecting construction workers in the area, and making sure the alleyways
remained clear.
 
3. During my time with
XpressGuards, I was doing well in my position and had no issues with any of my
coworkers. I was never late to my shift and never received any discipline or
write-ups. 
 
4. I was routinely expected
to stay on the worksite throughout my entire shift, including during my meal
and rest periods. This occurred almost every single day. I even offered to have
my pay docked if it meant I could take a meal break but was denied. 
 
5. I was also expected to
stay on site until another employee came to relieve me, which often happened
long after my shift was set to be over because this other employee was
regularly late to relieve me. Because of this, I would stay on site anywhere
between several minutes to an hour after the end of my shift. 
 
6. Approximately one (1)
week into my employment, I complained to my supervisor that the employee meant
to relieve me at the end of my shift often showed up late, causing me to miss
me bus and get home incredibly late. 
 
7. After I complained, my
supervisor switched me to the day shift so that I would not have to worry about
missing my bus’s final departure. However, I could tell that my supervisor was
clearly upset at me for making this complaint and it made me feel reluctant to
make any further complaints for fear that they would retaliate against me. 
 
8. On my last day of work,
I noticed that the portable restrooms and handwashing stations that were
normally on my worksite had been moved. In my assignment, I was sent to work in
a burned down building so the only restrooms available were the “porta potties”
that were on site. As a result, I had nowhere to go if I needed to use the
restroom during my eight-hour shift. 
 
9. I called my supervisor
to inform him that there were no restrooms available that I could use
throughout the duration of my shift and that the porta potties had been moved.
I told my supervisor that I could not work my entire eight-hour shift without
access to a safe and private bathroom. 
 
10. My supervisor did not
want to listen to my explanations and instead told me, “Just go home, you’re
fired.” I was confused and said, “What do you mean? This is a legitimate
concern.” However, he refused to listen to me and just kept repeating, “Just go
home, you’re fired.” 
 
11. I did not get my final
paycheck until approximately one week after I was fired.
 
12. After my termination, I
was out of work for approximately a month and a half while I searched for a new
job. I was able to find a temporary job, but that job fell through shortly
after I found it. During this time, I was very worried and anxious, as my
inability to find a steady job after XpressGuards was affecting my livelihood. 
 
13. I currently work for
Contemporary Services Corporation (“CSC”) in event security but it is a
seasonal job and still does not provide a steady paycheck. I also try to
supplement my income by working security at a club on weekends and am in the
process of obtaining my firearm license so that I can apply for armed security
positions, which would pay more and provide a steady income. 
 
14. XpressGuards’ treatment
towards me caused me to suffer a lot of trauma and emotional distress. Since my
termination, I have experienced anxiety, worry, and loss of sleep.
 
(Abram
Dec. ¶¶ 12-14.)  
 
            Subsequently, Plaintiff filed
another Declaration on July 2, which indicates:
 
11. I did not get my final
paycheck until approximately one week after I was fired. 
 
12. When I was working for
XpressGuards, I was earning approximately $18 per hour and was bringing in
approximately $720 per week. After my termination, I was out of work for
approximately a month and a half while I searched for a new job. During this
time, I was very worried and anxious, as my inability to find a steady job
after XpressGuards was affecting my livelihood. 
 
13. XpressGuards’ treatment
towards me caused me to suffer a lot of trauma and emotional distress. Since my
termination, I have experienced anxiety, worry, and loss of sleep. 
 
14. Since then, I have been
working part-time and/or seasonal jobs that do not bring in the same amount of
pay. Currently, I am working for JRM Security. While my rate fluctuates between
$20-25 per hour depending on the event, I am only scheduled to work about two
times per week depending on what events are taking place, resulting in my
earning approximately $600 per month. 
 
15. I also try to
supplement my income by working security at a club on weekends and am in the
process of obtaining my firearm license so that I can apply for armed security
positions, which would pay more and provide a steady income but am still
waiting on my license to come through and have no estimate of when I will
receive it.
 
            Therefore, Plaintiff has
substantiated the requested $10,000 for violations of Labor Code, § 98.6.    
 
            Plaintiff’s briefing further
indicates that of the $100,000 damages requested, $75,000 is for lost earnings
and $25,000 is for emotional distress.  Plaintiff
indicates that of the $75,000 requested, $65,000 is for lost wages to date
(calculated as the difference between the $2,880 he previously earned per month
and the $600 he currently earns per month), as well as $828 in missed meal/rest
breaks, $324 in unpaid overtime, $4,000 for failure to provide accurate wages
statements, $4,320 in waiting time penalties, and $750 for failure to provide
personnel/payroll records.  There is no
evidentiary support accounting for the requested $828 in missed meal/rest
breaks, $324 in unpaid overtime, or $4,320 in waiting time penalties, nor did
Plaintiff demand these amounts in the Complaint.
 
            Therefore, the Court cannot award
the damages requested.
 
b.         Prejudgment
Interest 
 
            Plaintiff
calculates prejudgment interest as follows:
 
$100,222 principal * 10% annual interest ÷
365 days/year * 1,034 days (from August 13, 2021 to June 12, 2024) = $28,321.26
 
            The Court notes that prejudgment
interest for unpaid wage and overtime claims accrues at 10%.  (See Labor Code § 218.6 [applying the 10%
interest rate of Cal. Civ. Code § 3289, subd. (b).])
 
            However, as discussed above,
Plaintiff has not substantiated the requested $100,000 in damages.  Moreover, the $100,222 used to calculate the
interest differs from the $100,000 requested, and therefore the requested
prejudgment interest is improper for this additional reason.
 
            Therefore, the Court cannot award
Plaintiff the requested prejudgment interest.
 
            c.         Costs 
 
            Plaintiff requests $1,139.55 in costs composed of $590.45 in filing fees and $549.10 in process server fees. (MC-010.)
Plaintiff’s request for costs is granted as Plaintiff is the prevailing party
in this action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s request
for default judgment is denied.
