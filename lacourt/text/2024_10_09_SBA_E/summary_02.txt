Significant Statements:
  - "To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff's proof need not be alleged."
  - "A demurrer does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law."
  - "A pleading is uncertain if it is ambiguous or unintelligible."
  - "A demurrer for uncertainty may lie if the failure to label the parties and claims renders the complaint so confusing defendant cannot tell what he or she is supposed to respond to."
  - "A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures."
  - "The doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes the relitigation of issues that were argued and decided in prior proceedings."
  - "The court may strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading."
