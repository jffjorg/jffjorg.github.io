English-text summary:
The Judge is denying the Plaintiff's motion to redact certain portions of the complaint. The Plaintiff is seeking to protect their medical information related to a breast cancer misdiagnosis, but the Judge finds that the public's right to access court records outweighs the Plaintiff's privacy rights. The Judge cites various legal precedents to support this decision, including the California Rules of Court and several California Court of Appeal cases. The Judge notes that the information at issue is closely related to the litigation and therefore must be accessible to the public.
