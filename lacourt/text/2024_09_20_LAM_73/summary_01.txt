And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to amend its answer to add a defense that the plaintiff lacks capacity to sue due to its permanently revoked corporate status. The defendant discovered this information recently and was not aware of it until August 2024, when it checked the publicly available State of Nevada database. The judge found that the defendant has sufficiently established that it acquired this information subsequent to the filing of the original answer and that the amendment is necessary and proper. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, which creates an inference that the motion is meritorious. The judge granted the motion and ordered the defendant to file and serve the proposed amended answer within 10 days.
