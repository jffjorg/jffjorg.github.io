And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 1.1, 12.1, 15.1, and 17.1. The court finds that Defendant's responses are not code-compliant and are evasive and incomplete.

Specifically, the court finds that Defendant failed to provide the names and contact information of individuals who assisted in preparing the responses to Form Interrogatory No. 1.1, and that Defendant's responses to Form Interrogatory No. 12.1 are incomplete and do not provide the information sought.

The court also finds that Defendant's responses to Form Interrogatory No. 15.1 are evasive and incomplete, and that Defendant's responses to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 are overly broad and unduly burdensome.

As a result, the court orders Defendant to provide code-compliant responses to Form Interrogatory Nos. 1.1, 12.1, 15.1, and 17.1 within 30 days.
