```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The court found that the arbitration agreement in the lease does not apply to Plaintiff's claims. The court held that the agreement does not show an intention to benefit Defendant, and therefore, Defendant is not a third-party beneficiary. The court also found that the agreement does not demonstrate equitable estoppel, as the parties' obligations under the agreement are independent of the lease. The court followed the reasoning in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company, which held that a manufacturer is not a third-party beneficiary of a sales contract with a dealership.
