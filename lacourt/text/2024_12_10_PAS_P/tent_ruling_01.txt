  Case Number:  22BBCV00516    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING HCMC’S  MOTION TO COMPEL NON-PARTY TRU STAFFING PARTNERS, INC. TO COMPLY WITH HCMC’S  SUBPOENA FOR BUSINESS RECORDS and DENYING MONETARY SANCTIONS, and GRANTING  MONETARY SANCTIONS TO TRU STAFFING PARTNERS, INC.I.          INTRODUCTION  This is a breach of contract action initiated on July 15, 2022, by  Plaintiff HCMC Legal Inc. ("HCMC" or “Plaintiff”) against Defendants  Brian Hartstein (“Hartstein”) and Epiq Systems Inc., Epiq Systems Solutions  Inc., and Epiq Systems Acquisition Inc. (“Epiq”) (collectively, “Defendants”)  HCMC alleges that Hartstein breached his employment agreement and fiduciary  duties by resigning without notice and subsequently joining Epiq, a direct  competitor. HCMC further contends that Hartstein solicited HCMC’s clients and  former employees, thereby causing significant harm to its business operations. On November 7, 2024, HCMC filed a motion to compel non-party Tru Staffing  Partners, Inc. (“Tru Staffing”) to comply with a subpoena to produce business  records and requested monetary sanctions. Tru Staffing, a staffing and  recruiting agency, is alleged to have facilitated Hartstein’s transition to  Epiq, including assisting with negotiations related to Hartstein’s employment  and interactions concerning HCMC’s clients. On November 25, 2024, Tru Staffing  filed its opposition to the motion, and on December 3, 2024, HCMC filed its  reply. II.        LEGAL STANDARD Any party may obtain discovery by taking the oral deposition of any  person, including any party to the action. (Code Civ. Proc. §  2025.010.)¿Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1987.1, “the court, upon  motion reasonably made [by a party] . . . may make an order . . . directing  compliance with [a subpoena] upon those terms or conditions as the court shall  declare . . .” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1987.1(a).)¿Likewise, pursuant to Code of  Civil Procedure section 2025.480 subdivision (a), “[i]f a deponent fails to  answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored  information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s control that is specified  in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery  may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.” (Code  Civ. Proc. § 2025.480(a).)¿If a nonparty deponent, properly served with a  deposition subpoena, fails to attend a deposition, the court may  impose¿sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1987.2, 2020.240, 2025.440(b),  2025.480(j).) III.      DISCUSSION HCMC brings this motion to compel  compliance with a subpoena served on non-party Tru Staffing and seeks monetary  sanctions. Tru Staffing opposes the motion, asserting that it is procedurally  flawed due to untimeliness and fails to comply with statutory requirements. In  addition, Tru Staffing requests monetary sanctions and terminating sanctions  against HCMC and its counsel for alleged misuse of the discovery process.  Procedural issues Tru Staffing contends that HCMC’s  motion to compel compliance with the subpoena is untimely under Code of Civil  Procedure section 2025.480 subdivision (b), which sets a mandatory 60-day  deadline for such motions. Tru Staffing argues that the record  was completed on March 1, 2024, when it served its objections to HCMC’s  subpoena. Citing Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th  123, 136, Tru Staffing asserts that the 60-day statutory deadline began on this  date because objections complete the record of the deposition for document  requests. Accordingly, Tru Staffing maintains the motion to compel was due by  May 2, 2024, inclusive of the two-court-day extension for electronic service  under Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision (a)(4). HCMC’s  motion, filed on November 7, 2024—189 days after the deadline—was therefore  untimely. (Opposition, pp.8-9) HCMC, however, argues that the  motion is timely because of the discovery stay issued by the court on April 28,  2024, which HCMC asserts tolled all discovery-related deadlines, including the  60-day period to file motions to compel. (Motion, p.8) HCMC further asserts  that it reasonably relied on the understanding that the stay applied to its  subpoena motion while it prioritized resolving discovery disputes with  Defendants. (Reply, pp. 4-6) The Court finds that HCMC motion to  compel compliance with the subpoena is untimely under Code of Civil Procedure  section 2025.480, subdivision (b), which imposes a mandatory 60-day deadline  for filing such motions. Tru Staffing served its objections to HCMC’s subpoena  on March 1, 2024, Accordingly, the statutory deadline to file a motion to  compel compliance was May 2, 2024, inclusive of the two-court-day extension for  electronic service under Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, subdivision  (a)(4). HCMC’s motion, filed on November 7, 2024, was 189 days past the  statutory deadline. The Court rejects the argument that  the discovery stay issued on April 28, 2024, tolled all discovery-related  deadlines, including those applicable to non-parties like Tru Staffing. The  scope of the stay was expressly limited to specific, pending motions involving  the parties, as outlined in Attachment 4B to the order appointing a discovery  referee. None of these motions pertained to the subpoena directed to Tru  Staffing. (Lubrano Decl., ¶ 8, Exh. G) Additionally, the stay order explicitly  stated that “the parties have agreed to stay the deadlines for the  aforementioned discovery motions,” indicating that the stay applied only to the  motions specifically enumerated in the order. Tru Staffing, as a non-party, was  not referenced in the order. Moreover, since the parties did not stipulate to  any tolling or extension of HCMC’s mandatory deadline, the motion is untimely. Furthermore, HCMC’s motion was not  pending at the time the discovery stay was issued. The April 28, 2024, order  was limited to then-existing motions and did not extend to motions filed  subsequently. Without clear authority or language applying the stay to  third-party disputes, HCMC’s reliance on the stay to justify its delay is  misplaced.  Accordingly, the Court DENIES  HCMC’s motion for untimeliness.  Monetary Sanctions HCMC request for monetary sanctions: HCMC seeks monetary sanctions of  $8,625.00, Given that the motion to compel is untimely, the Court DENIES HCMC’s  request for discovery sanctions.   Tru Staffing request for monetary sanctions: Tru Staffing seeks $36,459.50 in  monetary sanctions against HCMC and its counsel pursuant to Code of Civil  Procedure sections 2023.020 and 2023.030. Tru Staffing argues that HCMC failed  to comply with its statutory obligation to meet and confer in good faith before  filing its motion, constituting a misuse of the discovery process. (Opposition,  p. 12) According to the declaration of  Joelle A. Berle, Tru Staffing’s lead attorney, the fees incurred include at  least 22.8 hours spent by Ms. Berle preparing the opposition and supporting  documents at an hourly rate of $840, and 21.5 hours by senior associate Alexis  Cruz at a rate of $805. Additionally, Ms. Berle anticipates spending three  hours preparing for, traveling to and from, and attending the hearing,  amounting to an additional $2,520. In total, these efforts result in $36,459.50  in fees for opposing the motion. (Berle Decl., ¶ 14) Tru Staffing also seeks an  additional $21,757.50 in monetary sanctions for fees associated with reviewing  and analyzing the subpoena, assessing the claims and scope of the document  requests, meeting and conferring with HCMC’s counsel, and conducting related  legal research. These fees reflect 20.8 hours by Ms. Berle at $840 per hour,  6.3 hours by junior associate Sally Kim at $545 per hour, and 0.8 hours by  senior partner Ted Jacobs at $1,065 per hour. Tru Staffing argues that these  fees were necessary due to HCMC’s overbroad and improper subpoena. (Berle  Decl., ¶ 15; Opposition, p. 14) Tru Staffing contends that HCMC’s  subpoena improperly sought documents that were already produced by Defendants,  including 12 of the 13 document requests targeting communications between Tru  Staffing and either Defendant Epiq or Defendant Hartstein. These unredacted  records were produced by Defendant Hartstein on October 8, 2024, pursuant to  the Discovery Referee’s orders. Tru Staffing further argues that the subpoena  was vague, ambiguous, overbroad, and sought protected information outside the  permissible scope of discovery. (Lubrano Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. A; Berle Decl., ¶¶  6-7) Tru Staffing characterizes the  subpoena as a fishing expedition for documents already in HCMC’s possession,  causing unwarranted annoyance, oppression, and undue burden on Tru Staffing as  a non-party. It asserts that HCMC’s conduct violates Code of Civil Procedure  sections 2023.010 and 2023.030, which prohibit discovery misuse and authorize  monetary sanctions. (Opposition, pp. 12, 14) The Court finds that HCMC failed to  meet and confer in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 2016.040  and 2025.480, subdivision (b). While HCMC asserts that it believed discovery  deadlines were stayed, this misunderstanding does not excuse its obligation to  engage in meaningful discussions with Tru Staffing to resolve the issues  informally. The obligation to meet and confer was particularly critical given  the alleged ambiguity surrounding the discovery stay, which did not explicitly  include non-parties like Tru Staffing. Evidence presented demonstrates that  HCMC’s communication with Tru Staffing was minimal and failed to meet the  statutory requirement for good faith efforts. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  section 2023.020, monetary sanctions are mandatory for failure to comply with  the meet-and-confer requirement. However, the Court exercises discretion in  determining the reasonableness of the amount sought. While Tru Staffing  requests $36,459.50 and an additional $21,757.50 in attorneys’ fees, the Court  finds this amount excessive given the scope and complexity of the motion. The  Court reduces the sanctions award to $20,000, reflecting reasonable expenses  incurred in opposing the motion.   Terminating Sanctions The Court notes that terminating  sanctions are a severe remedy and should only be imposed in circumstances where  a party’s noncompliance is willful, persistent, and without reasonable  justification, and where lesser sanctions would be ineffective in ensuring  compliance. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Los  Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)  Here, while Tru Staffing raises  concerns about HCMC’s discovery conduct, the record does not demonstrate the  level of willful or persistent misconduct necessary to justify terminating  sanctions. Lesser sanctions, such as monetary penalties, remain sufficient to  address the issues raised and to ensure compliance with discovery obligations.  Accordingly, the Court DENIES  terminating sanctions.               IV.  CONCLUSION AND ORDER The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion  to compel and motion for sanctions.  The  Court DENIES Tru Staffing’s request for terminating sanctions. The Court GRANTS  Tru Staffing’s request for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of  $20,000, payable by Plaintiff within 30 days of this order. The Court declines to issue a ruling regarding the second subpoena, as the matter is not before the Court at  this time. Plaintiff is to give notice.              Dated: December 10, 2024                                                                                                                                                                           JARED D. MOSES  JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT[TENTATIVE]  ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS and GRANTING  PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS AS TO DEFENDANT EPIQ EDISCOVERY SOLUTIONS,  INC.I.        INTRODUCTION  This is a breach of contract action initiated on  July 15, 2022, by Plaintiff HCMC Legal Inc. ("Hire Counsel" or  “Plaintiff”) against Defendants Brian Hartstein (“Hartstein”) and Epiq Systems  Inc., Epiq Systems Solutions Inc., and Epiq Systems Acquisition Inc.  (collectively, “Epiq” or “Defendant”). Plaintiff alleges that Hartstein  breached his employment agreement and fiduciary duties by resigning without  notice and subsequently joining Epiq, a direct competitor. Plaintiff further  contends that Hartstein solicited Hire Counsel’s clients and former employees,  thereby causing significant harm to its business operations.On October 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for  sanctions. Defendants filed their opposition on November 7, 2024, and Plaintiff  submitted a reply on November 13, 2024.II.       LEGAL  STANDARDCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030  permits courts to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that  constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. Section 2023.010 provides a  non-exhaustive list of conduct that is considered misuse of the discovery  process, including as relevant here, failing to respond or to submit to an  authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide  discovery. (Cal. Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d), (g).) Further, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030  subdivision (d) gives courts the authority to issue a terminating sanction by  one of four following orders: (1) an order striking out the pleadings or parts  of the pleadings of any party engaging in misuse of the discovery process; (2)  an order staying further proceedings until an order for discovery is obeyed;  (3) an order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party;  or (4) an order rendering a default judgment against that party. In determining whether to impose terminating  sanctions, trial courts must consider the totality of the circumstances,  including whether the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding  party; and the number of informal and formal attempts to obtain the discovery.  (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App,4th 1225, 1246.) The trial court has broad discretion in selecting  discovery sanctions, subject to reversal only for abuse. (Reedy v. Bussell  (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1293; Miranda v. 21st Century Ins. Co.  (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 913, 928–929.)¿ The trial court should consider both the  conduct being sanctioned and its effect on the party seeking discovery and, in  choosing a sanction, should “attempt [] to tailor the sanction to the harm  caused by the withheld discovery.” (Do It Urself Moving & Storage, Inc.  v. Brown, Leifer, Slatkin & Berns (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 27, 36.) The discovery statutes evince an incremental  approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending  with the ultimate sanction of termination.¿ “Discovery sanctions should be  appropriate to the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to  protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Laguna  Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, 231 Cal.App.3d at p. 487.) ¿If a lesser  sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted; continuing  misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until  the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.¿ (Doppes v. Bentley  Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal. App. 4th 967, 992.)  III.     DISCUSSIONPlaintiff  brings the instant motion seeking terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions  of $15,000, alleging Defendant has engaged in a prolonged pattern of discovery  abuse. Plaintiff contends that over the past year, Defendant has repeatedly  failed to comply with its discovery obligations and has violated the Court’s  September 4, 2024, order. Despite being given numerous opportunities to comply,  Defendant has consistently delayed production, providing only partial responses  that Plaintiff deems insufficient and incomplete. Plaintiff asserts that  Defendant has failed to produce code-compliant responses required by statute  and court order and remains in violation of the Court’s order. To date,  Defendant has not provided the mandated supplemental responses, failed to  produce required documents, and has not corrected deficiencies in its privilege  log. Defendant has made no substantive effort to rectify these violations,  disregarding the Court’s directives and obstructing Plaintiff’s ability to  conduct thorough discovery.Plaintiff  argues that Defendant’s misconduct, which includes the failure to comply with  discovery orders and incomplete document production, has prejudiced Plaintiff’s  ability to timely and effectively prosecute its claims. With trial only three  months away, Plaintiff contends that punitive measures are necessary to address  Defendant’s interference with Plaintiff’s discovery rights. Plaintiff further  requests that in addition to terminating sanctions, the Court should impose a  monetary sanction of $4,000 per day for every day Defendant has remained in  violation of the Court’s order since September 24, 2024, amounting to $124,000  as of the date of this motion and accruing daily. Additionally, Plaintiff seeks  reimbursement for the hundreds of hours expended on meet-and-confer efforts,  retaining a discovery referee, and filing discovery motions, requesting that  Defendant and its counsel be jointly and severally ordered to pay no less than  $15,000 in fees and costs associated with compelling compliance. Defendant has  offered no adequate justification for these ongoing violations despite having  over a year to provide substantive, code-compliant responses (Lubrano Decl., ¶¶  25, 27).Defendant,  in opposition, argues that terminating sanctions are unwarranted, asserting  that it has made significant efforts to comply with its discovery obligations  and that recent delays were due to circumstances beyond its control. Defendant  specifically attributes these delays to the family emergency of its in-house  counsel, Matthew Cates, who manages this litigation. Defendant explains that on  October 9, 2024, during Plaintiff’s ex parte application for sanctions, the  Court was informed of Mr. Cates’ father’s terminal illness, which led Mr. Cates  to take family leave. Subsequently, after Mr. Cates’ father passed away, he  took bereavement leave to handle funeral arrangements and assist his mother’s  transition. Although another in-house attorney was assigned to oversee the  production in Mr. Cates’ absence, that attorney was not fully acquainted with  the case before Mr. Cates’ return. Defendant asserts that since Mr. Cates  resumed his duties, he has prioritized finalizing the supplemental production,  and Epiq is diligently working to complete its document production before the  hearing on this motion.Defendant  further contends that it has provided hundreds of documents responsive to  Plaintiff’s requests, including a privilege log, and is actively conducting  additional searches for any remaining documents, including text message records  from employees’ devices. Defendant maintains that it is operating in good faith  to comply with the Court’s September 4, 2024, order and that its actions do not  constitute willful misconduct or an abuse of the discovery process as Plaintiff  alleges.Moreover,  Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s complaints of deficiencies in Epiq’s  supplemental responses were raised for the first time in this motion, without  any prior meet-and-confer process, which Defendant asserts violates standard  procedural requirements. Defendant claims that Plaintiff’s failure to confer  about these alleged deficiencies before filing the motion is premature and  improper, as it deprived Defendant of the opportunity to address and  potentially resolve these issues without court intervention.Regarding  Plaintiff’s request for daily monetary sanctions, Defendant asserts that this  is excessive and unnecessary, particularly given that the parties have agreed  to a continuance of the trial date from February 2025 to May 2025, pending  review of a written stipulation. Defendant argues that the additional time  provided by the trial continuance will allow Plaintiff ample opportunity to  review forthcoming documents and engage in a meet-and-confer process to address  any lingering discovery issues.The  Court finds that, while Defendant’s document production was delayed, the  circumstances surrounding in-house counsel’s family emergency provide a  reasonable explanation for the recent delays, particularly given that the  September 24, 2024, deadline was less than two months ago. Given the  agreed-upon continuance of the trial date, any prejudice to Plaintiff’s trial  preparation is mitigated by the additional time. Furthermore, the Court notes  that terminating sanctions are a severe remedy, only imposed when a party's  noncompliance is found to be willful, persistent, and without reasonable  justification, and when lesser sanctions would be ineffective in ensuring  compliance (Lang v. Hochman, 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Los  Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez, 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390). Here, Defendant has  demonstrated a commitment to compliance following Mr. Cates’ return, and the  delays do not rise to the level of willful misconduct or a pattern of discovery  abuse.Based  on the foregoing, the Court finds that terminating sanctions are not warranted  under these circumstances. Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions is  therefore DENIED.Monetary sanctionsThe  Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated significant and ongoing prejudice  caused by Defendant’s failure to comply with its discovery obligations.  Defendant has exhibited a persistent pattern of failing to respond adequately  to discovery requests, some of which preceded Mr. Cates’ unfortunate family  circumstances, necessitating extensive efforts by Plaintiff to compel  compliance. Specifically, Plaintiff granted Defendant five extensions between  December 2023 and February 2024 (Lubrano Decl., ¶¶ 4–8), with Defendant  repeatedly promising that substantive responses were forthcoming. Plaintiff  engaged in multiple meet-and-confer efforts (Lubrano Decl., ¶¶ 7, 9), exchanged  numerous emails (Lubrano Decl., ¶¶ 8, 22), and ultimately required the  appointment of a discovery referee to resolve the disputes (Lubrano Decl., ¶¶  15–16). Even after the Court adopted the referee’s recommendations on September  4, 2024, ordering Defendant to provide code-compliant responses within 20 days,  Defendant failed to fully comply, producing only partial responses without  Bates-stamped documents or a proper privilege log (Lubrano Decl., ¶¶ 21, 26).While  the Court acknowledges that recent circumstances involving Defendant’s in-house  counsel reasonably explain some delays in responding to the September 4, 2024,  order, Plaintiff has suffered significant prejudice in pursuing these  responses. The costs incurred by Plaintiff, including meet-and-confer efforts,  motion practice, and participation in proceedings with the discovery referee,  were necessitated solely by Defendant’s ongoing noncompliance. As such, the  Court awards Plaintiff $15,000 in monetary sanctions to compensate for the  prejudice caused by Defendant’s lack of discovery compliance.           Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for  monetary sanctions.           IV. CONCLUSION AND ORDERThe  Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for terminating sanctions. The Court GRANTS  Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $15,000, payable by  Defendant Epiq Ediscovery Solutions, Inc within 30 days of this order.Plaintiff  is to give notice.           Dated: December, 2024                                                                                                                                               JARED  D. MOSES JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT[TENTATIVE] ORDER  GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL to MAY 20, 2025I.        INTRODUCTION  This is a breach of contract action initiated on  July 15, 2022, by Plaintiff HCMC Legal Inc. ("HCMC" or “Plaintiff”)  against Defendants Brian Hartstein (“Hartstein”) and Epiq Systems Inc., Epiq  Systems Solutions Inc., and Epiq Systems Acquisition Inc. (“Epiq”)  (collectively, “Defendants”) HCMC alleges that Hartstein breached his  employment agreement and fiduciary duties by resigning without notice and  subsequently joining Epiq, a direct competitor. HCMC further contends that  Hartstein solicited HCMC’s clients and former employees, thereby causing  significant harm to its business operations.On November 14, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to  continue the trial. On November 25, 2024, HCMC filed an opposition to the  motion. On December 3, 2024, Defendants filed a reply. Trial is currently set  for February 25, 2025.II.       LEGAL  STANDARDCalifornia Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subdivision  (c) states that although disfavored, the trial date may be continued for “good  cause,” which includes (without limitation): (1) unavailability of trial  counsel or witnesses due to “death, illness, or other excusable circumstances”;  (2) the addition of a new party depriving the new party (or other parties) from  conducting discovery and preparing for trial; (3) “excused inability to obtain  essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent  efforts”; or (4) “[a] significant, unanticipated change in the status of the  case” preventing it from being ready for trial. (Id., Rule 3.1332(c).)¿Other relevant considerations may include: “(1) The  proximity of the trial date; [¶] (2) Whether there was any previous  continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party; [¶] (3) The  length of the continuance requested; [¶] (4) The availability of alternative  means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a  continuance; [¶] (5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a  result of the continuance; [¶] (6) If the case is entitled to a preferential trial  setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a continuance  outweighs the need to avoid delay; [¶] (7)¿The court's calendar and the impact  of granting a continuance on other pending trials; [¶] (8) Whether trial  counsel is engaged in another trial; [¶] (9) Whether all parties have  stipulated to a continuance; [¶] (10) Whether the interests of justice are best  served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions  on the continuance; and [¶] (11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant to the  fair determination of the motion or application.” (Id., Rule 3.1332(d).)¿Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 allows a  court to grant leave to complete discovery proceedings. In doing so, a court  shall consider matters relevant to the leave requested, including, but not  limited to: (1) the necessity of the discovery, (2) the diligence in seeking  the discovery or discovery motion, (3) the likelihood of interference with the  trial calendar or prejudice to a party, and (4) the length of time that has  elapsed between previous trial dates. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2024.050.) III.     DISCUSSIONDefendants  move to continue the trial, arguing that HCMC agreed to continue the trial,  later reneged on the agreement, and engaged in discovery abuses. Defendants  contend they reasonably relied on HCMC’s initial agreement, which caused them  prejudice when HCMC failed to follow through.Defendants  assert that HCMC’s counsel initially agreed to discuss continuing the trial to  May 12, 2025. Based on this understanding, Defendants refrained from filing  motions for summary judgment or adjudication before the cut-off date. However,  when HCMC later reneged on the tentative agreement, Defendants argue that they  were unfairly prejudiced as a result (Motion, pp. 7–8).Defendants  further claim that HCMC delayed producing its Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK)  for deposition, despite being served with a deposition notice on September 19,  2024. HCMC initially refused to provide dates and ultimately offered deposition  dates in January 2025, just days before the discovery cut-off for the February  trial. Defendants argue that this delay leaves them with insufficient time to  address deposition-related issues through court intervention. (Motion, pp.  9–12, 14).In  opposition, HCMC argues that Defendants' arguments lack merit and are a pretext  for delay. First, HCMC asserts that adequate discovery time remains because the  deposition dates for January 2025 fall within the discovery cut-off period.  HCMC contends that Defendants' demand for earlier dates is unreasonable,  particularly given the logistical challenges of scheduling the PMK, who is in  Chicago and New York. HCMC further argues that Defendants’ insistence on  conducting the deposition in person in Los Angeles exacerbates these challenges  (Opposition, p. 5).Next,  HCMC asserts that any discussions about a potential trial continuance were  contingent on client approval, which was never granted. HCMC contends that  Defendants’ reliance on a tentative agreement was misplaced and does not  constitute good cause for a continuance (Opposition, p. 3). Additionally, HCMC  highlights that Defendants previously assured the Court that no trial  continuance would be necessary when seeking leave to file a cross-complaint in  October 2024. HCMC argues that this change in position undermines Defendants’  credibility and suggests a strategy of delay rather than a legitimate need for  additional time (Opposition, pp. 3–5).HCMC  also contends that it will be equally prejudiced under the current trial  schedule, which requires it to complete Hartstein’s deposition within a  constrained timeframe. HCMC notes that Hartstein has limited availability  during the first weeks of December 2024, further complicating its ability to  conduct necessary discovery. HCMC concludes that the current schedule allows  sufficient time for both parties to complete their discovery obligations and  adequately prepare for trial without the need for a continuance (Opposition,  pp. 7-8)The  Court finds that good cause exists to continue the trial date based on  Defendants’ reasonable reliance on the trial continuance discussions. The  record demonstrates that HCMC’s counsel engaged in discussions regarding a  potential continuance, and Defendants even drafted a stipulation to memorialize  the proposed continuance. Defendants’ reliance on these discussions was not  entirely unjustified. Accordingly, the Court finds that good cause exists to  grant the motion.Furthermore,  the Court acknowledges the logistical challenges raised by HCMC, including the  scheduling of its PMK deposition and its planned deposition of Hartstein in  December. The holiday season often results in delays, and the PMK’s  out-of-state location adds to the complexity of scheduling. Under these  circumstances, the Court is inclined to grant the motion to ensure both parties  have adequate time to complete their discovery obligations.Finally,  the requested continuance is relatively brief and does not appear to unduly  prejudice HCMC. The additional time will allow all parties to complete  necessary discovery and adequately prepare for trial, thereby ensuring  fairness.In  balancing the interests of the parties, the Court concludes that the interests  of justice favor granting the motion to continue the trial.           IV. CONCLUSION AND ORDERThe  Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to continue trial. The trial is continued to May 20, 2025.[1] All  motion and discovery cutoff dates shall be based on the new trial date.  There will be no further trial continuances absent extraordinary circumstances.Defendants  are to give notice. Dated:  December 10, 2024                                                                                                                                                           JARED D.
