Hearing Date: December 15, 2023
Department 54, Judge Maurice Leiter
Motion to Continue Trial
Moving Party: Plaintiff Christine Jones
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:     PLAINTIFF’S MOTION IS GRANTED.
 
TRIAL IS CONTINUED TO SEPTEMBER 3, 2024
AT 9:30. THE FINAL STATUS CONFERENCE WILL BE AUGUST 23, 2024 AT 9:30.  PRETRIAL DEADLINES WILL BE BASED ON THESE NEW
DATES.
 
PLAINTIFF TO
NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
While trial continuances are generally
disfavored, pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1332(c), circumstances that indicate good
cause for a continuance include “[a] party's excused inability to obtain
essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent
efforts.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(c)(6).) Factors the Court may consider include,
“[t]he proximity of the trial date,” “[w]hether there was any previous
continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party,” and
“[t]he length of the continuance requested.” (CRC Rule 3.1332(d).)
 
Plaintiff moves to continue the
February 26, 2024 trial and related dates to September or October 2024 on the
ground that Plaintiff’s counsel will be engaged in trial in a different case in
February. Defendants have stipulated to a trial continuance. This is the first
request for a trial continuance in this action. Plaintiff represents that the
parties are working together to move the case forward. The Court finds good
cause for a continuance. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion does not mention any
efforts to settle this matter. The Court expects the parties to engage in
diligent, good faith efforts to settle. The Court encourages the parties to agree
soon to a mediator and a firm mediation date. The Court is unlikely to grant a
further trial continuance.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.
