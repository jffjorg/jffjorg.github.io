The Court considers the moving papers. 
No opposition has been received.
 
Petitioner complies with the venue requirement under Insurance Code §
10139.5, subdivision (c)(1), as Payee resides in the County of Los
Angeles.  (Decl. Duderstadt ¶ 1.)
 
Insurance Code § 10139.5 provides that a direct or indirect transfer of
structured settlement payment rights is not effective unless the transfer has
been approved in a final court order based on certain express written findings
by the Court.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (a)(1)-(6).)  The Court makes the
following findings:
 
·      
The transfer is in the best interest of the Payee as
contemplated under Insurance Code section 10139.5, subd. (a)(1). (Decl.
Duderstadt ¶ 4.)
·      
Under Section 10139.5, subd. (a)(2), Payee has been
advised in writing by Petitioner to seek independent professional advice
regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived
that advice in writing.  (Exh. E.)
 
·      
Under Section 10139.5, subd. (a)(3), Petitioner has
provided Payee with a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136 and the
transfer agreement complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.  (Exh. B.)
 
 
·      
Under Section 10139.5, subd. (a)(4), the transfer does
not contravene any applicable statute or the order of any court or other
government authority.  (Petition,
generally.)
 
·      
Under Section 10139.5, subd. (a)(5), Payee reasonably
understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the terms set forth
in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136. Payee is transferring
360 monthly payments of $350.00 each, beginning on 12/01/2023 through and
including 11/012053, B) 1 lump sum payment of $25,000.00 due on 9/21/2032, and
(C) 1 lump sum payment of $25,000.00 on 09/212052. in exchange for $51,000.00.
(Id.) The present value of the payment at the IRS discounted rate of 5% is
$87,358.79. Petitioner will pay Payee the present value of the payment at a
discounted rate of 10.34%, or $51,000.00.
 
·      
Under Section 10139.5, subd. (a)(6), Payee understands
and does not wish to exercise the payee's right to cancel the transfer
agreement.
 
The Court finds that the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in the
payee's best interest. The petition is GRANTED.
