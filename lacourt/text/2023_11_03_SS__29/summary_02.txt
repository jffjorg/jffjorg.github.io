And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion of Maria Avalos and Alfonso Avalos Cervantes to set aside and vacate the order of dismissal. The plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) on October 14, 2020, alleging causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. The complaint was dismissed without prejudice on February 16, 2023. The plaintiffs then filed a motion to set aside the dismissal on August 16, 2023, which was timely filed within the six-month limit set by statute. The motion was granted because the court found that counsel's failure to appear for the hearing on February 16, 2023 was due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect. The court cited various statutes and case law in support of its decision, including Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) and Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001). The court also noted that the law favors disposing of cases on their merits and that any doubts must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief under Code of Civil Procedure (CCP), Section 473.
