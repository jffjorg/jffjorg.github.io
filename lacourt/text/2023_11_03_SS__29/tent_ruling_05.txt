 Case Number:  21STCV44157    Hearing Date:   November 3, 2023    Dept:  29  
Tentative
 
The motion is granted.
 
Legal
Standard
 
The court may order that an attorney
be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted
to withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it
unreasonable to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof.
Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion
to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi
& Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be
served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
              Counsel has filed the
requisite forms pursuant to CRC Rule 3.1362. Counsel has filed proof of service
showing service of the forms on Defendant’s counsel and Plaintiff’s current
address, which was confirmed in the last 30 days by conversation. 
 
              Counsel declares that she
seeks to be relieved because there has been a complete breakdown in
attorney-client communication. Counsel states that there are irreconcilable
differences in the attorney-client relationship.  There is good cause for counsel to be
relieved. 
 
              The next hearing is
scheduled for February 16, 2024 as the Final Status Conference. Jury trial is
scheduled for March 1, 2024. The Court finds that Plaintiff will not be
prejudiced if Counsel is permitted to withdraw at this time. 
                           
 
Conclusion
 
The motion to
be relieved as counsel is GRANTED.    
 
The order is
effective upon filing of proof of service of the signed order on Plaintiff.
 
Moving party
to give notice.
