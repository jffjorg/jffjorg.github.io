And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The defendant had failed to produce a witness for deposition and had refused to designate a person most qualified to testify on certain topics. The court finds that the plaintiff has shown good cause for the requested documents and that the defendant has failed to justify its refusal to comply with the deposition notice. The court orders the defendant to produce a PMQ witness to testify on the topics in the deposition notice dated July 27, 2023, and to produce the documents requested in that notice, within 30 days of notice of this order.

The court also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions in part, ordering the defendant and its counsel, Graves & King LLP, to pay monetary sanctions to the plaintiff in the amount of $2,320 within 30 days of notice of this order. The sanctions are calculated as follows: 4.5 hours of attorney time, multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate of $300 per hour for work on a straightforward motion to compel deposition, plus the expense of $970 actually and reasonably incurred by the plaintiff in connection with the non-appearance of the defendant.
