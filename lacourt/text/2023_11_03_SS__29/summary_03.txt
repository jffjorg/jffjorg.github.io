And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a motion to compel further responses in a civil case. The motion was filed on April 19, 2023, but the responses at issue were served on March 17, 2021, more than 45 days ago. Although the parties discussed the possibility of amended or supplemental responses, none were actually served. The judge finds that there is no evidence of an agreement to extend the 45-day period to file a motion to compel further responses, and therefore denies the motion as untimely under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (c).
