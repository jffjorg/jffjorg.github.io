Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Defendant Bell Canyon Association, Inc. to change the venue of the trial from Los Angeles Superior Court to Ventura Superior Court. The motion was based on the argument that the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by a change of venue. However, the judge found that Defendant has not met its burden of showing that this would be the case. The judge noted that while some potential witnesses may be located in Ventura County, the primary focus of the trial is likely to be the accident itself and the injuries sustained by the plaintiff, rather than the rescue efforts of the first responders. Additionally, the judge pointed out that the medical providers of the plaintiff are located in Los Angeles County, and a trial in Ventura would likely be less convenient for them than a trial in Los Angeles County. The judge concluded that Defendant has not presented sufficient evidence to support its motion, and therefore denied it.
