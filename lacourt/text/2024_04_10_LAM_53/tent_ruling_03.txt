  Order RE:
 
 
plaintiff’s demurrer to amended answer
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Plaintiff Shahnaz Bahadori
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Houman Vosoghi, M.D. 
Demurrer to Amended Answer
The court
considered the moving and opposition papers filed in connection with this demurrer.
 No reply papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Shahnaz Bahadori (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
sustaining her demurrer to the eighth and 14th affirmative defenses asserted by
defendant Houman Vosoghi, M.D. (“Defendant”) in his Amended Answer to
Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint. 
The court sustains Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s eighth
affirmative defense for statute of limitations because it does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a defense and is ambiguous and unintelligible and
therefore uncertain since Defendant has asserted both that        (1) Plaintiff’s cause of action is
barred by the statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure
section 340.5 but (2) “it appears that [P]laintiff has filed the Complaint
within the applicable statute of limitations, however, investigation and
discovery are continuing.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.20, subds. (a), (b); Def. Amended Answer, p. 5, ¶ 8.)
The court sustains Plaintiff’s demurrer to Defendant’s 14th
affirmative defense of judicial estoppel because it does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a defense and is ambiguous and unintelligible and
therefore uncertain since Defendant has asserted both that (1) Plaintiff is
barred from asserting any cause of action against him in this action pursuant
to the doctrine of judicial estoppel and (2) “it does not appear that
[P]laintiff is judicially estopped from bringing this action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subds. (a),
(b); Def. Amended Answer, p. 8, ¶ 14.)
The burden is on Defendant “to articulate how it could amend its
pleading to render it sufficient.”  (Palm
Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th
268, 290.)  The court finds that
Defendant has not met his burden to show how he could amend his answer to
render it sufficient to constitute defenses and to cure its uncertainty.  The court therefore sustains Plaintiff’s
demurrer without leave to amend. 
ORDER
            The court sustains plaintiff Shahnaz
Bahadori’s demurrer to defendant Houman Vosoghi’s eighth and 14th affirmative
defenses without leave to amend. 
            The court orders plaintiff Shahnaz
Bahadori to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
