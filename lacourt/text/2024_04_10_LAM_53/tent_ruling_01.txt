  Order RE:
 
defendant and cross-complainant’s motion to
  compel deposition testimony and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant and cross-complainant
Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Plaintiff David Maijala
Motion to Compel Deposition Testimony and
for Sanctions
The court considered the moving and reply papers filed in connection
with this motion. 
The court notes that plaintiff David Maijala’s opposition papers were
filed seven court days before the hearing in violation of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b). 
However, because the reply papers expressly rely on the exhibits
attached to the opposition, the court has exercised its discretion to consider
the untimely opposition papers.  (Reply,
pp. 2, fn. 1, 4:19, 4:26, 5:7-8.) 
DISCUSSION
Defendant and cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc.
(“Defendant”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling plaintiff David
Maijala (“Plaintiff”) to appear for deposition and to answer questions
regarding his employment history, including whether he was involuntarily
terminated by two employers, AMG/Notthoff Engineering, Inc., and Salsbury
Industries, and (2) awarding monetary sanctions in favor of Defendant and
against Plaintiff in the amount of $2,975.
“If a deponent fails to answer any question . . . , the party seeking
discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd.
(a).) 
The court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff (1) to answer
Defendant’s question as to why Plaintiff “separate[d] from” his former employer
AMG/Notthoff Engineering, Inc., (2) to answer Defendant’s question as to why
Plaintiff “separate[d] from” his former employer Salsbury Industries, and (3)
to answer any reasonable follow-up questions. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).)  The court orders that Plaintiff is not
required to disclose trade secret information that he learned from his former
employers.  Either party may designate Plaintiff’s
testimony regarding these matters as being subject to the protective order
entered by the court in this action on March 20, 2024.
            The court finds that the
circumstances presented would make the imposition of sanctions unjust and
therefore denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.480, subd. (j).) 
ORDER
            The court grants in part defendant
and cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc.’s motion to compel
deposition testimony and for sanctions as follows. 
            The court orders plaintiff and
cross-defendant David Maijala, at a deposition to be taken by counsel for
defendant and cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc., (1) to
answer defendant and cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc.’s question
as to why plaintiff and cross-defendant David Maijala “separate[d] from”
AMG/Notthoff Engineering, Inc., (2) to answer defendant and cross-complainant
Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc.’s question as to why plaintiff and
cross-defendant David Maijala “separate[d] from” Salsbury Industries, and (3)
to answer any reasonable follow-up questions. 

Plaintiff and cross-defendant David Maijala shall not be required to
disclose trade secret information that he learned from his former employers.
The court denies defendant and cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft
Components, Inc.’s request for monetary sanctions.
            The court orders defendant and
cross-complainant Mulgrew Aircraft Components, Inc. to give notice of this
ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  April 10, 2024
