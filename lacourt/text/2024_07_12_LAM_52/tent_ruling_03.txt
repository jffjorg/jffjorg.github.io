 Case Number:  23STCV06188    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Alan Richards’s Motion to
Compel Attendance at Deposition 
Plaintiff Alan Richards moves to
compel defendant FrescoFICO, LLC, through its chief executive officer Robin
Herndon, to testify at deposition.  Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450(a) provides, “If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under
Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it … the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony.”  (CCP § 2025.450(a).) 
            Plaintiff
shows good cause to compel Herndon’s deposition.  Plaintiff served the amended notice of
deposition for Herndon on March 5, 2024. 
(Gunning Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. C.)  Defendant
did not object to the notice of deposition. 
(Id., ¶ 5.)  At the time
set for the deposition, deponent Herndon “informed counsel for Plaintiff that
Defendant had fired their counsel and that he could not proceed with the
deposition.”  (Ibid.)  Herndon therefore failed to proceed with the
deposition without having served a valid objection first.  Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling
Herndon’s deposition.
            Plaintiff
also moves for $2,181.80 in sanctions against defendant.  When a court grants a motion to compel
deposition, it must impose monetary sanctions “against the deponent or the
party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (CCP § 2025.450(g)(1).)  The court does not find defendant acted with
substantial justification.  Sanctions are
just under the circumstances.  Plaintiff
reasonably incurred $2,181.80 in expenses and attorney fees. 
Disposition    
Plaintiff Alan Richards’s motion to
compel the deposition of Robin Herndon is granted.  
Deponent Robin Herndon is ordered to testify at deposition within 10 days.  Defendant FrescoFICO, LLC is ordered to pay plaintiff Alan Richards $2,181.80 in
sanctions within 30 days.
