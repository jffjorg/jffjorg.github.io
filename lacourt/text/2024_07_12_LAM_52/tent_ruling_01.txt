Hourly Rates
For hourly rates,
“the trial court is in the best position to value the services rendered by the
attorneys.”  (569 East County
Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th
426, 436.)  Courts may rely on their “own
knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience,
skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees, the difficulty or
complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied, and affidavits
from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate
determinations in other cases.” (Id. at p. 437, citations omitted.)
The court finds
plaintiff claims excessive hourly rates for one law clerk and three attorneys.  Kris Coombs, Jr. is a law clerk, not a
licensed attorney.  (Shahian Decl., ¶
52.)  The court finds Coombs’s reasonable
hourly rate is $200.  
Plaintiff presents
insufficient evidence of the qualifications and experience of attorneys Angel
Baker, Jami Littles, and Matthew Pardo.  Plaintiff’s
billing records state Baker’s rate was $595, tied with Littles for the second
highest rate among the 16 timekeepers.  (Id.,
Ex. 18, p. 4.)  But plaintiff’s counsel’s
declaration about the attorneys’ experience and qualifications does not mention
Baker whatsoever.  Plaintiff’s billing
records claim $390 hourly for Pardo.  (Id.,
Ex. 18, p. 5.)  As with Baker, plaintiff’s
supporting declaration does not state Pardo’s qualifications.  For Littles, plaintiff states only, “Jami
Littles is a former associate attorney at SLP who was admitted to the California
State bar in 1998.  At SLP, Ms. Fox [sic]
focused on lemon law and consumer warranty matters.”  (Id., ¶ 62.)  The court will reduce Baker’s hourly rate to
$450, Littles’s hourly rate to $525, and Pardo’s hourly rate to $300.  
Based on its
knowledge of the legal market, its review of the credentials and experience of
plaintiff’s attorneys, and the particular tasks performed by counsel, the court
finds the other rates claimed by plaintiff’s counsel are reasonable.
Hours
In calculating the
lodestar, the court must determine whether the tasks performed by an attorney
were necessary and whether the amount of time billed for each task was
reasonable.  (Baxter v. Bock (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 775, 793.)  The moving party has the burden of proof on
these issues.  (Ibid.)  The number of hours
billed may be unreasonable if the case is “overstaffed” with too many lawyers,
resulting in redundant or unnecessary work.  (Hensley
v. Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S. 424, 434.) 
A reduced award is justified when a case is “overlitigated” and the
bills are “padded.”  (Morris v.
Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 38 (Morris).)  For a “voluminous fee application,” courts
may “make across-the-board percentage cuts either in the number of hours
claimed or in the final lodestar figure.” 
(Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th
24, 41 (Warren); accord Morris, supra, 41 Cal.App.5th at
p. 40 [“The court could properly have made an across-the-board reduction of 30
percent”].)  
After reviewing the billing records (Shahian Decl., Ex. 18),
the court finds many hours of
plaintiff’s counsel’s work were unreasonable and inefficient.  The evidence in this case is similar to the
record in Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240 (Mikhaeilpoor), where the same law firm represented the
plaintiff/appellant.  The Court of Appeal
stated: 
[T]he
record demonstrates the highly inefficient manner in which plaintiff litigated
her case.  Plaintiff’s trial counsel
claims “extensive experience with claims brought under the Song-Beverly [Act].”  Payam Shahian, the senior attorney among
plaintiff’s trial counsel, supervises the other attorneys in his firm, but does
not “materially” get involved “unless they involve complex legal issues,
reach significant stages of litigation, or require [his] assistance.”  … 
Shahian did not bill time to this case, confirming the case did not
involve complex legal issues.  Yet,
despite counsel’s experience litigating “hundreds of automotive defect cases
involving California’s consumer protection statutes, including Song-Beverly,”
an astonishing array of 10 different attorneys litigated this case, with
multiple attorneys staffed at different times. 
Further, counsel’s billing entries demonstrate a lack of efficiency in
litigating the case and a lack of clarity in tasks performed.  This evidence supports the trial court’s
finding that plaintiff’s counsel failed to act efficiently.
(Mikhaeilpoor,
supra, 48 Cal.App.5th at pp. 255-256, italics in original.)
Plaintiff’s counsel similarly overstaffed this case
with 16 lawyers.  Doing so resulted in
inefficient and duplicative work.  Plaintiff’s
counsel used numerous attorneys to perform related tasks that one attorney
could have done more efficiently.  For
example, on defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings on the initial
complaint, Daniel Law billed 0.7 hours to meet and confer, then Michael Tracy
billed 2.5 hours to draft the opposition, then Law billed another 1.8 hours to
revised and finalize the opposition.  (Shahian
Decl., Ex. 18, p. 2.)  When defendant
demurred to the first amended complaint on similar grounds as the prior motion,
another attorney, Christopher Campbell, billed 11 hours to draft the opposition.  (Ibid.)  Meanwhile, David Lunn billed 2.3 hours to
prepare for and appear at the hearing.  (Ibid.)  That was the only task Lunn billed on this
case.  Using one attorney to perform all
these related tasks would have been considerably more efficient. 
Similarly, plaintiff used multiple attorneys to work
on discovery.  Neal Butala drafted
discovery requests (Shahian Decl., Ex. 18, p. 1), Tionna Carvalho revised them
(ibid.), and Daniel Law worked on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
rule 26 disclosure report while the case was in federal court (ibid.).  Nadine Aslaadi then reviewed defendant’s
discovery response while Kris Coombs drafted a motion to compel further
responses.  (Id., pp. 1-2.)
In another
example, on December 1, 2022, Joy DeLeon billed 2.3 hours to prepare for and
attend the telephonic post-mediation status conference. (Shahian Decl., Ex. 18,
p. 2.)  The conference lasted only a few
minutes.  Plaintiff’s counsel could have
used an attorney who was familiar with the case and needed significantly less time
to prepare for the status conference. 
Plaintiff also
billed an excessive number of hours for several tasks.  The bills for this motion illustrate the
problem.  Plaintiff billed 8.6 hours to
draft this motion and claimed another $3,500 in fees (amounting to another 5.9
hours at the $595 hourly rate billed for the initial 8.6 hours) anticipated to
draft the reply brief and attend the hearing. 
The declaration in support of plaintiff’s reply brief states a different
attorney spent 10.6 hours drafting it. 
(Castro Decl., ¶ 5.)  
This motion is
relatively simple.  It is like many other
motions plaintiff’s counsel has filed. 
In some places, plaintiff did not properly modify the papers from prior versions
filed in other cases.  As discussed
above, Payam Shahian’s declaration in support of this motion omits the
qualifications and experience of attorneys Angel Baker and Matthew Pardo, who
billed for work on the case.  Shahian’s
declaration also attests to the hourly rates and qualifications of four attorneys
who did not bill for any work on this case: Jaclyn Laing (Shahian Decl., ¶¶
58-59), Ian McCallister (¶¶ 66-67), Tyson Smith (¶¶ 74-75), and Anna Weiser (¶¶
78-79).  Given plaintiff’s counsel’s
extensive experience in similar cases and with similar motions, the motion did
not reasonably require close to 18 hours of work.  
Finally,
plaintiff’s counsel billed at attorney or law clerk rates for tasks that were
clerical or could have been done by a paralegal.  Nino Sanaia billed 0.4 hours at $385 hourly to
“Draft P’s notice of CMC” and 0.4 hours to “Draft P’s CMS and notice of posting
jury fees.”  (Shahian Decl., Ex. 18, p. 1.)  Kris Coombs billed 0.3 hours at $375 hourly
to “Draft P’s notice of CMC.”  (Ibid.)  Nadine Aslaadi billed 0.2 hours at $350
hourly to “Draft and finalize P’s CMS.” 
(Ibid.)  Tionna Carvalho
billed 0.2 hours at $570 hourly to “Review and finalize NOS.”  (Id., p. 3.)  With the reply brief, plaintiff submitted a
table including a column for “Plaintiff’s Response” to each billing entry
defendant challenged.  (Castro Decl., Ex.
2.)  In the rows for these tasks, that
column is empty.  (Ibid.)   
After reviewing all
billing records, the court exercises its discretion to cut plaintiff’s hours
claimed by 25 percent across the board.  
Multiplier
Plaintiff moves for a
1.35 multiplier to the lodestar.  A
multiplier is not warranted.  Multipliers may be awarded based on factors including
“(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill
displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.”  (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) 
This case did not involve novel or difficult questions.  Plaintiff’s counsel did not demonstrate
exceptional skill in litigating the case. 
Counsel’s hourly rates adequately account for representation on
contingency.  (See Horsford v. Board
of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359,
395.)
Other Costs
            Plaintiff claims $4,030.81 in other costs.  The court will award all expenses
claimed.  Defendant argues expert witness
fees and some other items are not authorized as recoverable costs under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1033.5.  The
Song-Beverly Act, however, expands the costs a prevailing plaintiff may
recover.  “[I]n enacting Civil
Code section 1794, subdivision (d) the Legislature intended the phrase ‘costs
and expenses’ to cover items not included in ‘the detailed statutory definition
of “costs” ’ set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.”  (Warren, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p.
42.)  Plaintiff presents adequate
evidence supporting the $4,030.81 in expenses she claims.  Even if not expressly permitted as a recoverable
cost, each item was reasonably necessary to the litigation.  
DISPOSITION
            Plaintiff’s
motion for attorney fees is granted in part. 
After accounting for the reductions described above, the court
calculates the award as follows:
