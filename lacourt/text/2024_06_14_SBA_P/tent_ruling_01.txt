  Case Number:  23TRCV01305    Hearing Date:   June 14, 2024    Dept:  P Tentative:
The Court has reviewed the request for default judgment and is DENIED without
prejudice due to the following defects:
 
(1)  
Not
all the evidence attached to Gecer’s declaration is authenticated. For example,
Gecer attaches “seller account” and “buyer account” statements that are both
not authenticated. Further, Gecer has also failed to authenticated the invoices
from Defendant to Plaintiff for the buyer account statement (Exh. C). Moreover,
many of these invoices are in Turkish and have not been translated. Cal Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1110(g) requires exhibits written in a foreign language
to be accompanied by an English translation, certified under oath by a
qualified interpreter.
(2)  
Plaintiff
has not shown entitlement to prejudgment interest at 10% per year. This is not
an action based on contract. In a non-contracts case, the prejudgment interest
rate is 7% (Cal. Const. Art. 15 § 1).
