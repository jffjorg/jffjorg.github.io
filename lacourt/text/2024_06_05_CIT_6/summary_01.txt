Significant Statements:
  - "The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination."
  - "Discovery sanctions 'should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed what is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.'"
  - "Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but are justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules."
