  Case Number:  22PSCV00465    Hearing Date:   June 5, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  California  Home Solar Technology, Inc. v. Shuai Deng, et al.  Defendant  Shuai Deng’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court GRANTS Defendant Shuai Deng’s motion for terminating  sanctions. The Complaint filed by Plaintiff California Home Solar Technology,  Inc. is dismissed with prejudice.  The Court GRANTS Defendant’s requests for monetary sanctions against  Plaintiff only in the reduced amount of $1,675.00. Plaintiff must pay said  monetary sanctions to counsel for Defendant within 20 days of the Court’s  order.               Defendant is ordered to submit a  proposed order and give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days  of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a business dispute case. On May 17, 2022, plaintiff  California Home Solar Technology, Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant  Shuai Deng (Defendant) and Does 1 to 25, alleging causes of action for conversion,  unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment, waste of  corporate assets, and constructive trust.  On March 15, 2024, Defendant moved for terminating sanctions or  contempt. On April 18, 2024, the Court denied the motion without prejudice to  give Plaintiff one last opportunity to comply with the Court’s prior order on  February 22, 2024.  On May 10, 2024, Defendant moved again for terminating sanctions.  The motion is unopposed.  LEGAL STANDARD  The court is authorized, after notice and an opportunity  for hearing, to impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in  conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: monetary sanctions, issue  sanctions, evidence sanctions, terminating sanctions, and contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,  subds. (a)-(e).) A terminating sanction may be imposed by an order  dismissing the action of the party that brought the action. (Id., §  2023.030, subd. (d)(3).)    “The discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to  discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the  ultimate sanction of termination. [Citation.]” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992 (Doppes);  see J.W. v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2018)  29 Cal.App.5th 1142, 1169.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb misuse, a  greater sanction is warranted. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) “Discovery  sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed what is required to  protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’” (Id.)  “But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the  evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the  discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate  sanction.” (Id., quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279–280; Creed-21  v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702, quoting Doppes  and Mileikowsky.)    The court should consider the totality of the  circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if the actions were  willful, the determent to the propounding party, and the number of formal and  informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77  Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly,  but are justified where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse,  and there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance  with the discovery rules. (Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.)  Before any sanctions may be imposed the court must make  an express finding that there has been a willful failure of the party to serve  the required discovery responses. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los  Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118 (Fairfield).) The  party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the burden of showing  that the failure was not willful. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84  Cal.App.3d 771, 788 (Deyo); Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977)  66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252-253.)  Code of Civil Procedure, section 2023.010, subdivisions  (d) and (f) provide that a misuse of the discovery process includes, but is not  limited to, “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of  discovery” and “[m]aking an evasive response to discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2023.010, subds. (d), (f).)  DISCUSSION  Defendant seeks terminating  sanctions based on Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the Court’s February 22,  2024 order and the Court’s April 18, 2024 order regarding discovery Defendant  previously propounded. Defendant notes that despite the Court having given  Plaintiff another opportunity to comply, Plaintiff still has not produced  responses to Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents (Set One) or Form  Interrogatories (Set One), or paid the $675.00 in monetary sanctions previously  ordered.  The Court finds that  terminating sanctions are appropriate here. Plaintiff has had more than enough  time to provide responses to Defendant’s discovery requests and pay the $675.00  in monetary sanctions previously ordered by the Court. The discovery requests  were served back in September 2023. (Sullivan Decl., ¶ 2.) Despite multiple  extensions, Plaintiff did not provide responses. (Id., ¶¶ 2-6.) On  February 22, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s discovery motions, ordering  Plaintiff to provide responses within 20 days of the Court’s order and to pay  $675.00 in monetary sanctions. (Order re Tentative Ruling (2/20/24).) Plaintiff  failed to comply with that order, leaving Defendant to file a motion for  terminating sanctions. (Order re Tentative Ruling (4/18/24).) Although the  Court denied the motion without prejudice, it reiterated its order on February  22, 2024, directing Plaintiff to comply. (Id.) Counsel for Plaintiff  was present at the hearing on April 18, 2024. (Minute Order (4/18/24).) Defendant  gave notice of the Court’s April 18, 2024 order. (Notice of Ruling (4/25/24).) Plaintiff  has not opposed this motion either, which the Court construes as a tacit  admission that Defendant’s arguments are meritorious. (Sexton  v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410;  C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition, Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro.  Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10.) Plaintiff therefore has also  necessarily failed to demonstrate that its noncompliance was not willful. (See Deyo,  supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788.)  Given  Plaintiff’s clearly demonstrated pattern of failing to comply with its  discovery obligations and the Court’s orders, it is clear that Plaintiff’s  actions are willful, (Fairfield, supra, 246 Cal.App.2d at p. 118),  and that lesser sanctions will not produce compliance (see Deyo, supra, 84  Cal.App.3d at pp. 787, 797; Doppes,  supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Accordingly,  the Court hereby DISMISSES this action as to Defendant per Code of Civil  Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (d)(3). (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,  subd. (d)(3).) The Court directs Defendant to submit a proposed order for entry  of Defendant’s dismissal from this action. The Court further notes that this  leaves only the Doe Defendants in this action. The Court will therefore set an Order to Show  Cause as to Why This Action Should Not be Dismissed as to the Remaining Doe  Defendants.                          The Court GRANTS  Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff only. Defendant  has had to incur fees in connection with multiple motions due to Plaintiff’s  failures to comply with discovery and the Court’s prior orders. The Court notified  the parties in its ruling on April 18, 2024, that if Plaintiff failed to comply  with the Court’s orders and Defendant brings another motion for terminating sanctions  and prevails, the Court would allow Defendant to seek monetary sanctions for  the time spent preparing both motions for terminating sanctions. Thus, the Court GRANTS  Defendant’s requests for monetary sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,675.00,  comprised of 1.0 hour for preparing each motion and 1.0 hour for appearing at  the hearing on each motion, totaling 4.0 hours, multiplied by the hourly rate  of $400.00, plus $75.00 for the motion filing fees for this motion only.  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Defendant Shuai Deng’s motion for terminating  sanctions. The Complaint filed by Plaintiff California Home Solar Technology,  Inc. is dismissed with prejudice.  The Court GRANTS Defendant’s requests for monetary sanctions against  Plaintiff only in the reduced amount of $1,675.00. Plaintiff must pay said  monetary sanctions to counsel for Defendant within 20 days of the Court’s  order.               Defendant is ordered to submit a  proposed order and give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days  of this order.
