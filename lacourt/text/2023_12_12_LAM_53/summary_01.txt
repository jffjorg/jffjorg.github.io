Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of Asset Default Management, Inc. (the defendant) on the First Amended Complaint filed by Shai Harris (as successor trustee of the H. McClenon Trust and as trustee of the ADH Harris Trust). The Judge found that the First Amended Complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant, as there is no affirmative cause of action for unconscionability under Uniform Commercial Code section 2-302. The Judge also noted that the plaintiffs failed to respond to the Order to Show Cause and did not demonstrate that unconscionability is a valid cause of action. As a result, the Judge granted its own motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. The defendant is dismissed from the action with prejudice, and the court directs the clerk to dispose of the case as completed.
