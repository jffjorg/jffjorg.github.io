  Order RE:
 
order to show cause re: why the court should

  amended complaint as to defendant asset default management, inc.
 



Order to Show Cause re: Why the Court
Should Not, on its Own Motion, Grant a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on
the First Amended Complaint as to Defendant Asset Default Management, Inc.
On October 31, 2023, the court set for hearing on December 12, 2023, an
Order to Show Cause re: why the court should not, on the court’s own motion,
grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the First Amended Complaint,
filed by plaintiffs Shai Harris, as successor trustee of the H. McClenon Trust
dated December 12, 2019, and Shai Harris, as trustee of the ADH Harris Trust
dated January 14, 2020 (“Plaintiffs”), as to defendant Asset Default
Management, Inc. (“Defendant”) because it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action against Defendant pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 438. 
The court ordered that any response to the Order to Show Cause shall
be filed and served no later than nine court days before the hearing.  Plaintiffs did not file a response to the
Order to Show Cause. 
The court grants its own motion for judgment on the pleadings as to
the First Amended Complaint for the administering of an unconscionable contract
or clause under Uniform Commercial Code section 2-302 because it does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Defendant since there
is no affirmative cause of action for unconscionability, which is a defense to
the enforcement of a contract.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(3)(B)(ii); Jones v. Wells Fargo Bank (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1527, 1539 [“there is
no cause of action for unconscionability under [Civil Code] section 1670.5;
that doctrine is only a defense to contract enforcement”]; Stirlen v. Supercuts, Inc. (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1519, 1530-1531 [the
California Legislature, in enacting Civil Code section 1670.5, “adopted the
doctrine of unconscionability enunciated in Section 2-302 of the Uniform
Commercial Code”]; Hines v. US
Bankcorp (C.D. Cal., July 14,
2021) 2021 WL 3923248 at pp. *2-3 [dismissing third cause of action for
violation of section 2-302 of the UCC because unconscionability is not an
affirmative cause of action].) Plaintiffs did not file a response to the Order
to Show Cause with the court demonstrating that unconscionability is a valid
cause of action.  Thus, the court grants
its own motion for judgment on the pleadings in favor of Defendant. 
The
burden is on the plaintiff “to articulate how it could amend its pleading to
render it sufficient.”¿ (Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners Assn., Inc. v.
Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290.)¿ To satisfy that burden, a
plaintiff “must show in what manner he can amend his complaint and how that
amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading.”¿ (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)¿ The court finds that Plaintiffs have
not met their burden to show how they could amend their pleading to render it
sufficient against Defendant and therefore grants its motion without leave to
amend. 
ORDER
            The court grants its own motion for
judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendant Asset Management, Inc. on the
First Amended Complaint filed by plaintiffs Shai Harris, as
successor trustee of the H. McClenon Trust dated December 12, 2019, and Shai
Harris, as trustee of the ADH Harris Trust dated January 14, 2020. 
            The court orders that defendant
Asset Default Management, Inc., is dismissed from this action with prejudice. 
            The court also notes that (1) on
October 30, 2023, the court entered judgment of dismissal, with prejudice, as
to defendants Teresa Gorman Martinez and Ruben Martinez, trustees of GM Defined
Benefit Pension Plan, and (2) on October 31, 2023, the court dismissed
defendants Lil Wave Financial, Inc., d/b/a Superior Loan Servicing (erroneously
sued separately as Lil Wave Financial, Inc., and Superior Loan Servicing) and
Funding Rush, Inc. from this action with prejudice. 
Thus, because all of the defendants named in the First Amended
Complaint have been dismissed, the court directs the clerk to dispose of this
case as completed. 
            The court directs the clerk to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 12, 2023
