And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's request for entry of court judgment by default against the defendant, Chengming Zheng. The plaintiff, Moossa Naim, as trustee of the Moossa and Laura Naim Family Trust, is seeking a judgment of $181,780.54, consisting of damages, interest, costs, and attorney's fees. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not submitted competent evidence to support the request for damages and has also requested interest twice, which represents a double recovery. The court therefore denies the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice, requiring the plaintiff to request and calculate damages and prejudgment interest separately.
