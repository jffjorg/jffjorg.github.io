  RE:
 
plaintiff’s request for entry of court
  judgment by default



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Moossa Naim, as
trustee of the Moossa and Laura Naim Family Trust dated December 15, 2009             
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Plaintiff’s Request for Entry of Court
Judgment by Default
            Plaintiff Moossa Naim, as trustee of
the Moossa and Laura Naim Family Trust dated December 15, 2009 (“Plaintiff”)
requests that the court enter judgment by default against defendant Chengming
Zheng, a/k/a Cheng Ming Zheng (“Defendant”) in the total amount of $181,780.54,
consisting of (1) $164,167.88 in damages, (2) $11,469.26 in interest, (3)
$2,497.03 in costs, and (4) $3,646.37 in attorney’s fees. 
            The court notes a number of defects in
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment against Defendant.
            First, the court finds that
Plaintiff has not submitted competent evidence in support of the request for
damages in the amount of $164,167.88. 
Plaintiff has submitted only the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, who
has not laid a foundation for the facts stated therein or shown that they are
based on the personal knowledge of the declarant.  Thus, Plaintiff has not supported the request
for damages with competent evidence. 
            Second, Plaintiff requests interest
twice: (1) in calculating the damages request for $164,167.88, and (2) as an
independent request.  (Manasserian Decl.,
¶¶ 20, 26; Manasserian Decl., Ex. E [setting forth damages calculations by
adding together principal arrears, late fees, and interest]; Manasserian Decl.,
¶ 31 [requesting an additional $11,469.26 in prejudgment interest].)  By including interest in Plaintiff’s request
for damages, Plaintiff’s request for default judgment represents a double
recovery of interest.  Plaintiff must
request and calculate damages and prejudgment interest separately.  
            The court therefore denies plaintiff
Moossa Naim, as trustee of the Moossa and Laura Naim Family Trust dated
December 15, 2009’s request for court judgment by default against defendant
Chengming Zheng, a/k/a Cheng Ming Zheng without prejudice. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  December 12, 2023
