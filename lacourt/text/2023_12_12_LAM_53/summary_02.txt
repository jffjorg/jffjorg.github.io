```

And here is a brief English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied defendant Volkswagen's motion for summary judgment on several causes of action related to the Song-Beverly Act and breach of warranty. The court has also denied defendant Audi's motion for summary adjudication on the cause of action for negligent repair. The court has granted summary adjudication to defendant Volkswagen on the third cause of action for failure to conform to warranties. The court has found that the subject vehicle is a new motor vehicle within the meaning of the Song-Beverly Act, and therefore the plaintiff's claims for breach of warranty and failure to conform to warranties are not barred.
