PARTY: Plaintiffs
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendant Seung Jae Baek (“Defendant”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
            The currently operative first
amended complaint (the “FAC”) alleges 24 causes of action arising out of
alleged wrongful conduct that occurred in the course of a business
relationship.  
 
 
 
            On October 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed:
(1) a motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production, Set One
(the “RFP Motion”); (2) a motion to compel further responses to Requests for
Admissions, Set One (the “RFA Motion”); and (3) a motion to compel further
responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One (“the “SPROG Motion”)
(collectively, the “Motions”).  The
Motions also request monetary sanctions for Defendant’s misuse of the discovery
process. 
 
DISCUSSION
Under
California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 2031.310, a motion to
compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents
may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2)
inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3)
unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(CCP § 2031.310, subd. (c).)  A
motion to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.  (See CCP § 2031.310 subd. (b)(1); Calcor
Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216,
234-35.)  To establish good cause, a
discovery proponent must identify a disputed fact that is of consequence in the
action and explain how the discovery sought will tend in reason to prove or
disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or
disprove the fact.  (Digital Music News LLC v. Superior Court (2014)
226 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)  
 
A
representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search
and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that demand.  (CCP § 2031.230.)  This statement shall also specify whether the
inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party.  (Id.)  The statement shall set forth the name and
address of any natural person or organization known or believed by that party
to have possession, custody, or control of that item or category of item.  (Id.) 

 
Under CCP section 2030.300, on receipt of a response
to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply: (1) an answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete;
(2) an exercise of the option to produce documents under CCP section 2030.230
is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate;
or (3) an objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.  (CCP § 2030.300, subd. (a).)  Responses to interrogatories must be as
complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the
responding party permits.  (CCP §
2030.220, subd. (a).)  If an
interrogatory cannot be answered completely, then it must be answered to the
extent possible.  (CCP § 2030.220, subd.
(b).)  If the responding party does not
have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that
party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain
the information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except
where the information is equally available to the propounding party.  (CCP § 2030.220, subd. (c).)  If the
responding party cannot furnish details, they should set forth the efforts made
to secure the information.  (Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 782.) 
The responding party cannot plead ignorance to information which can be
obtained from sources under their control. 
(Id.)
 
Under CCP section 2033.290, subdivision (a), on
receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems
that either of the following apply: (1) an answer to a particular request is
evasive or incomplete; or (2) an objection to a particular request is without
merit or too general.  (CCP § 2033.230,
subd. (a).)  As to requests for admission: (1) if only a part of a request
for admission is objectionable, the remainder of the request shall be answered;
and (2) if an objection is made to request or to a part of a request, the
specific ground for the objection shall be set forth clearly in the response,
and if an objection is based on a claim of privilege then the particular
privilege invoked shall be clearly stated.  (CCP § 2033.230, subds.
(a)-(b).)
  
Plaintiffs
served the discovery requests at issue in the Motions on June 29, 2023.  (See Declaration of Christian T. Kim
(“Kim Decl.”) ¶ 2, Exhibit 1.)[1]  Defendant provided his belated responses on
August 15, 2023.  (Kim Decl. ¶ 4, Exhibit
2.)  Despite meet and confer efforts,
Plaintiffs and Defendant were unable to resolve the dispute over Defendant’s
responses.  (See Kim Decl.
¶¶ 5-19.)
 
            Upon review of the Separate Statements filed in
connection with the Motions, the Court agrees that Defendant’s responses are
incomplete because they contain improper objections and do not include
statements of ability to comply that conform with the statutory requirements
set forth above.  The Court therefore
GRANTS the Motions.  Defendant is ordered
to provide further supplemental, code-compliant responses, and any necessary
privilege log within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiffs
request monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,955 in connection with each
Motion.  This amount represents: (1) 6.8 hours
of attorney time drafting the moving papers billed at a rate of $350 per hour; 0.5
hours of attorney time revising the moving papers at a rate of $450 per hour; 0.5
hours of paralegal time preparing the filings; and (2) an anticipated five
hours preparing the reply papers and attending the hearing billed at a rate of
$450 per hour.  (See Kim Decl. ¶¶
21-26.)  
 
The
Court exercises its discretion and awards Plaintiffs monetary sanctions in the total
reasonable amount of $2,380, which represents 6.8 hours preparing the Motions
collectively at a rate of $350 per hour.  (Moran v. Oso Valley Greenbelt Assn.
(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1034.)[2]  Defendant is ordered to pay this amount
within 20 days of the date of this order. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
