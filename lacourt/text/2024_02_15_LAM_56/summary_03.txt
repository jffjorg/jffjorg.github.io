The court has reviewed the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint filed by the defendant, Revel Management Group, LLC, and the opposition and reply papers submitted by the plaintiff, Hugo Villasenor. The court finds that the defendant has acted in good faith in seeking leave to file the cross-complaint and grants the motion. The defendant is ordered to file the proposed cross-complaint within five court days of the date of this order. The court also finds that the defendant's awareness of the plaintiff's relationship with Muse and its previous settlement attempt do not demonstrate bad faith in seeking leave to file the cross-complaint. The court has considered the California Code of Civil Procedure and other relevant laws in making its decision.
