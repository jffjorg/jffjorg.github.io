The motion is DENIED as to Request No. 17. Sanctions are awarded against Plaintiff and its counsel in the amount of $1060.00, payable to Defendants within 30 days.Defendants to provide notice.DISCUSSION“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) The propounding party must demonstrate that the responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding party asserted objections that are either without merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)A motion to compel further responses to requests for admissions may be made on the grounds that an answer is incomplete or evasive, or an objection is without merit. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.290, subd. (a)(1)–(2).)Defendant Felix Pena (Defendant) moves to compel further responses from Plaintiff Roxbury20 BC, LLC (Plaintiff) to Requests for Admission No. 17 and 20, and Form Interrogatory No. 7.3.Form Interrogatory No. 7.3 asked whether any property identified as damaged in a previous interrogatory had been repaired, and if so to state the date the repairs occurred, a description of the repairs, the cost, the contact information of the repairer, and the same information for the person who paid. (Separate Statement at p. 1.) Plaintiff responded by stating that “multiple minor repairs” have been made, which Plaintiff lacked knowledge of because the handyman who conducted the repairs did not invoice them. (Separate Statement at pp. 1–2.) Request for Production No. 20 sought an admission from Plaintiff that Karolin Neman, the wife of Plaintiff’s principal, told Defendant Felix Pena in writing that she “would like to cancel the escrow for Roxbury” because she “decided to file for divorce” from Morad Neman. (Separate Statement at p. 2.) The parties acknowledge that a further response has been provided to Request for Admission No. 17, and it is no longer at issue. (Reply at p. 2.)Further responses are quired for Form Interrogatory No. 7.3. Plaintiff denies having any personal knowledge of the “minor” repairs at issue, but acknowledges that the handyman who conducted the repairs is “a full-time employee of Plaintiff.” (Opposition at p. 3.) Plaintiff’s response stated that the handyman could be contacted through Plaintiff’s counsel. (Separate Statement at p. 2.) But the notion that Defendant can only seek direct answers through the handyman, rather than interrogatories directed to Plaintiff itself is incorrect,An interrogatory response must “be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220, subd. (a).) “If the responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where the information is equally available to the propounding party.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220, subd. (c).)Here, the handyman’s knowledge of the repairs is imputed to Plaintiff itself, because the handyman is conceded to be Plaintiff’s agent and employee. “[T]he actual knowledge of theagent is imputed to the principal.” (In re Marriage of Cloney (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 429, 439 .) “A corporation is, of course, a legal fiction that cannot act at all except through its employees and agents.” (Black v. Bank of America (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1, 6.) Plaintiff therefore has an obligation to make “a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information” from its agents. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.220, subd. (c).) Thus a further response is required.A further response is also required as to Request for Admission No. 20. This request asked whether the wife of Plaintiff’s principal sought to cancel escrow for the property at issue based on her desire for a divorce, which is relevant to Plaintiff’s allegation that he sought to withdraw from the purchase because of the cost of repairs. (Complaint ¶ 11.) Although Plaintiff argues that Karolin Neman’s communications with Defendant are irrelevant, because Ben Neman was the manager and principal of Plaintiff (Opposition at pp. 4–5), Defendant presents evidence that both Karolin and Ben Neman identified themselves as Plaintiff’s “managers” in papers related to the property purchase. (Supp. Dicecca Decl. Exh. D.) The request is therefore relevant to the subject matter of this dispute, and a further response is required.Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED as to Request No. 20 and Interrogatory No. 7.3, and DENIED as moot for Request No. 17.Statute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)Defendant seeks $1,060.00 in connection with each motion, representing two hours of attorney work at $500 per hour plus a $60 filing fee, amounting to a total sanctions request for both motions of $2,120.00. (Dicecca Decl. ¶¶ 12–13.) The Court will grant sanctions in the reduced amount of $1060.00.
