BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Stevie Moore
(plaintiff) filed a complaint against defendants Entertainment Partners, LLC,
Central Casting, and GEP Administrative Services, LLC (GEP, collectively,
defendants) on November 28, 2022. Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action:
(1) failure to pay overtime, (2) failure to provide meal break, (3) failure to
provide rest break, (4) failure to
timely pay all wages due, (5)
retaliation, (6) failure to prevent investigate and remedy discrimination
harassment and retaliation, (7) hostile work environment, (8) violation of
business and professions code section 17200 et seq., and (9) wrongful termination.
Defendant GEP filed the instant
motions on June 3, 2024. No oppositions have been filed.
LEGAL STANDARD
A plaintiff may serve a request
for production of documents and interrogatories without leave of court at any
time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party
to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.020(b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020(b).)
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service, but the
parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such
agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.260(a), 2031.270(a) - (b); Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2030.270(a)-(b).)
Where there has been no timely
response to a request for the production of documents or to interrogatories,
the demanding party may seek an order compelling a response. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300(b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(b).) If a party fails to timely
respond to a request for production of documents, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the
protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300(a); Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290(a).)
DISCUSSION
Defendant GEP served Requests
for Production of Documents, Set One and Form Interrogatories – General, Set
One on September 13, 2023, by email. (Decl. of Andrew S. Wellman, ¶ 4; Exhs. A,
B.) On October 12, 2023, defendant extended the deadline to October 31, 2024.
(Decl. of Andrew S. Wellman, ¶ 5.) The parties were optimistic about a
resolution when plaintiff’s counsel stopped communicating with defendant’s
counsel; defendant’s counsel emailed and/or called plaintiff’s counsel on
November 10, November 21, December 6, and January 10, 2024. (Decl. of Andrew S.
Wellman, ¶ 6-7.) On February 5, 2024, defendant’s counsel sent a meet and
confer letter regarding plaintiff’s missing responses to defendant’s written
discovery. (Decl. of Andrew S. Wellman, ¶ 8; Exh. C.) On May 3, 2024,
defendant’s counsel emailed plaintiff’s counsel stating that it was seeking
court intervention in the form of the instant motions. (Decl. of Andrew S.
Wellman, ¶ 11; Exh. D.)
The court finds that defendant
GEP properly served the written discovery on plaintiff and plaintiff has failed
to provide verified responses. Accordingly, the court grants defendant GEP’s
motion to compel responses to Request for Production of Documents and Form
Interrogatories.
Based on the foregoing, the
court GRANTS defendant GEP’s motion to compel plaintiff to respond to Request
for Production of Documents, Set One and Form Interrogatories – General, Set
One.
Defendant GEP is ordered to
give notice of this ruling.
