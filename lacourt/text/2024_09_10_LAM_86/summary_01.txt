And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the petition filed by Alfred Madain, the petitioner, seeking a writ of mandate to compel the Pasadena Unified School District to reinstate his employment as a teacher with back pay and interest. The Judge found that the District's actions, including placing the petitioner on unpaid administrative leave and ceasing payment, were not tantamount to a dismissal or effective termination of his employment. The Judge noted that the petitioner had not been released, discharged, or fired from his employment and was still receiving health insurance benefits from the District. The Judge also found that the District had not attempted to terminate the petitioner's employment and that the actions taken were consistent with the Education Code. The Judge denied the petition and ordered the respondent to prepare, serve, and file a proposed judgment.
