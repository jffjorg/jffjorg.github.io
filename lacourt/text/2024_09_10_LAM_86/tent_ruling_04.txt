 Case Number:  24STCP01625    Hearing Date:   September 10, 2024    Dept:  86 MOTION FOR AN ORDER DEEMING THE PETITION FOR WRIT OF
MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FILED ON MAY 16, 2024
 
Date:               9/10/24
(1:30 PM)
Case:                           KNT Downtown LA
LLC v. City of Los Angeles et al. (24STCP01625)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioner KNT Downtown LA LLC’s Motion for an Order Deeming
the Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint Filed on May 16, 2024 is
GRANTED. 
 
Petitioner’s request for judicial notice is DENIED as
“unnecessary to the resolution” of the issues before the Court. (Martinez v.
San Diego County Credit Union (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1048, 1075.) 
 
On Thursday, May 16, 2024, petitioner electronically
submitted the following document for filing: “Verified Petition and Complaint
for (1) Writ of Mandate – CCP § 1094.5; (2) Writ of Mandate – CCP § 1085; (3)
Declaratory Relief; (4) Injunctive Relief; (5) Denial of Due Process – 42
U.S.C. § 1983; (6) Regulatory Taking; (7) Intentional Interference with
Prospective Economic Advantage; (8) Negligent Interference with Prospective
Economic Advantage; (9) Intentional Interference with Contractual
Relationships” (“Petition and Complaint”). (Hallock Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. 1; Ryan
Decl. ¶ 4.) At 1:23 p.m. on May 16, 2024, petitioner received confirmation that
the Petition and Complaint was electronically submitted for filing with filing
fees having been paid. (Hallock Decl. ¶ 5; Ryan Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 4.)
 
On Friday, May 17, 2024, petitioner received a “Notice of
Court Rejection of Electronic Filing” (“Rejection Notice”). (Hallock Decl. ¶ 6
& Ex. 2; Ryan Decl. ¶ 7.) The reason given on the Rejection Notice was “Initial
document can not be a Complaint and Petition, it has to be Complaint or
Petition.” (Hallock Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 2.) On May 17, 2024, petitioner’s
counsel called the clerk’s office and spoke with three different people after
the Rejection Notice. None of the people with whom counsel spoke provided any
further reason for the rejection of the Petition and Complaint. Counsel was
instructed to file a petition and complaint separately. (Hallock Decl. ¶ 7.) 
 
On Monday, May 20, 2024, counsel spoke with a supervisor and
manager of the clerk’s office. (Hallock Decl. ¶¶ 9-11.) The manager informed
counsel that there was no rule prohibiting the filing of a petition and
complaint in one document but it was a policy of the clerk. (Hallock Decl. ¶
11.) The manager told counsel that the clerk’s office would not accept the
filing unless “Verified Petition and Complaint” in the title of the document
was changed to “Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint.” (Hallock
Decl. ¶¶ 11, 12.) Counsel made the requested change to the title and made no
other changes to the Petition and Complaint. (Hallock Decl. ¶¶ 13, 14
& Ex. 3.) On May 20, 2024, counsel had the Petition and Complaint with the
amended title filed, which was accepted for filing on the same day. (Hallock
Decl. ¶ 14.) 
 
On July 9, 2024, petitioner filed a motion for order deeming
the filing date of the Petition and Complaint to be May 16, 2024. 
 
“[T]he local Superior Court may not condition the filing of
a complaint on local rule requirements. Instead, so long as a complaint
complies with state requirements, the clerk has a ministerial duty to file. In
legal effect, a complaint is ‘filed’ when it is presented to the clerk for
filing in the form required by state law.” (Carlson v. State of California
Department of Fish & Game (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1268, 1270.) 
 
The Petition and Complaint submitted for filing on May 16,
2024 complied with state requirements. CCP § 422.30 provides, as relevant here,
that every pleading shall contain a caption setting forth the title of the
action. (CCP § 422.30(a)(2); see also CCP § 422.10 [civil pleadings
include complaints].) In addition, as pertinent to the instant motion, Rule of
Court 2.111 sets forth the required format of the first page of each paper
filed in California trial courts. Underneath the case number, for all complaints
and petitions, the “character of the action or proceeding” must be stated.
(Rule of Court 2.111(6). Petitioner’s filing on May 16, 2024 stated, “Verified
Petition and Complaint for (1) Writ of Mandate – CCP § 1094.5; (2) Writ of
Mandate – CCP § 1085; (3) Declaratory Relief; (4) Injunctive Relief; (5) Denial
of Due Process – 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (6) Regulatory Taking; (7) Intentional
Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage; (8) Negligent Interference
with Prospective Economic Advantage; (9) Intentional Interference with
Contractual Relationships.” (Hallock Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. 1.) From the entirety
of the title, it can be ascertained that the character of the action was a
Petition for Writ of Mandate (1st and 2nd causes of
action) and a Complaint with seven civil claims (3rd through
9th causes of action). Petitioner’s May 16, 2024 submission of the
Petition and Complaint for filing complied with CCP § 422.30 and Rule of Court
2.111. 
 
The clerk’s office rejected the Petition and Complaint
because the first paper that commences a proceeding purportedly cannot be a
petition and a complaint. (Hallock Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. 2.) Such a combined
pleading has been approved by the California Supreme Court. (See Hensler
v. City of Glendale (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1, 14 [“an ‘as applied’ challenge to
the development restrictions imposed by the administrative agency, may be
properly made in a petition for writ of ‘administrative’ mandamus to review the
final administrative decision [citation] and that action may be joined with one
for inverse condemnation”].) In their opposition, respondents City of Los
Angeles and Los Angeles Housing Department do not cite any rule requiring an
initial filing to be either a petition or complaint. 
 
Respondents City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles Housing
Department also argue that the May 16, 2024 submission was “poorly drafted by
being entitled ‘VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT’ which was made more confusing
by listing all nine claims collectively under both headings rather than clearly
dominating the pleading as containing a Petition for Writ
of Mandate and Complaint alleging seven civil claims.” (Opp.
at 2:28-3:4.) Respondents cite no authority indicating that petitioner was
required to expressly designate which claims are part of the Petition and which
claims are part of the Complaint. While the clerk’s office is required to
reject papers that do not comply with the Rules of Court (Rule of Court 2.118)
or state statutes (see Duran v. St. Luke's Hospital (2003) 114
Cal.App.4th 457, 459 [clerk’s office properly rejected filing of complaint for
failure to pay entire filing fee]), petitioner appears to have complied with
all such rules and statutes. To the extent that the clerk’s office has a policy
of rejecting an initial filing that is a combined petition and complaint, “[T]here
is no comparable authorization in state law directing or permitting a clerk to
refuse to file a paper for failure to comply with a local rule.” (See Carlson,
68 Cal.App.4th at 1272-73.) 
 
Respondents also argue that the instant motion is a
disguised summary adjudication motion because it would essentially adjudicate
the merit of their statute of limitations and exhaustion of administrative
remedies defenses. This motion is not brought under CCP § 437c. Petitioner is
entitled to correct errors in filing dates when the filings were improperly
rejected. (See Rojas v. Cutsforth (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 774, 778
[holding that complaint should be deemed filed on date presented when clerk had
no proper basis to reject complaint].) 
That the corrected filing date may have some consequential impact on
asserted defenses does not somehow convert the instant motion into an improper
motion for summary adjudication. 
 
The May 16, 2024 filing was improperly rejected due to the
incorrect assertion that an initial filing cannot be a petition and a
complaint. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED. No material difference appearing
between the Petition and Complaint submitted for filing on May 16, 2024 and the
Petition and Complaint accepted for filing on May 20, 2024 (compare Hallock
Decl. ¶¶ 4, 13 & Exs. 1, 3), the Petition and Complaint is deemed
filed on May 16, 2024.  The docket and
records and files of this case shall so reflect.
