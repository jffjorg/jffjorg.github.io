Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for an order deeming the filing date of the Petition and Complaint to be May 16, 2024. The Petitioner, KNT Downtown LA LLC, submitted the Petition and Complaint on May 16, 2024, but it was initially rejected by the clerk's office due to an incorrect assertion that an initial filing cannot be a petition and a complaint. The Petitioner made changes to the title and resubmitted the Petition and Complaint, which was accepted for filing on May 20, 2024. The judge found that the Petition and Complaint complied with state requirements and that the clerk's office had no proper basis to reject the filing. The judge also denied the Respondents' argument that the motion was a disguised summary adjudication motion. The ruling is based on California statutes and rules, including CCP § 1094.5, CCP § 1085, CCP § 422.30, and Rule of Court 2.111.
