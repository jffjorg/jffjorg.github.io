collective bargaining for employees of public school districts educating
students” from kindergarten through high school. (San Mateo City School
Dist. v. Public Employment Relations Bd. (1983) 33 Cal.3d 850, 855.) The
EERA is codified in Government Code § 3540, et seq. PERB has exclusive
jurisdiction over disputes involving the statutory duties and rights of public
employees under the EERA. (Ibid., citing Gov. Code § 3541.3.)

Education Code unless otherwise specified.
 


[3]           Section 45041 states, in relevant part:
“A person in a position requiring certification qualifications who serves less
than a full school year shall receive as salary only an amount that bears the
same ratio to the established annual salary for the position as the number of
working days he serves bears to the total number of working days plus
institutes in the annual school term, and any other day when the employee is
required by the governing board to be present at the schools of the district.”
