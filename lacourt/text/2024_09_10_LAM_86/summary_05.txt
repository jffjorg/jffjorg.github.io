The purchase was completed, and Borrower remains in possession of the hotel. The value of the loan agreements has not been destroyed."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's application for a right to attach order against the defendant, Thuy-Vi Vu. The defendant guaranteed loans to V & K Properties LLC, which used the funds to purchase a hotel in Fremont, CA. When the hotel was shut down due to a government closure order, the defendant argued that commercial frustration applied to excuse performance. However, the judge ruled that commercial frustration does not apply in this case because the hotel was purchased and the defendant remains in possession of it. The judge also denied the defendant's claim of exemption for a homestead and life insurance policy. The plaintiff is entitled to attach the defendant's property, subject to a homestead exemption, and the defendant has not provided sufficient evidence to support its claim of exemption. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to post a bond in the amount of $10,000 before issuance of a writ of attachment.
