[1]           In a footnote, Grasic and Korbelin
also request that the Court quash the proofs of service filed with respect to
the summons and First Amended Complaint. (Opp. at 4, fn. 1.) The request is
denied, as Grasic and Korbelin have not filed any motion with proper notice to
quash service of summons pursuant to CCP § 418.10.  


[2]           Plaintiff also asserts causes of
action based on Civil Code §§ 3439.04(a)(2) and 3439.05.  The Court does not address the likelihood of
success as to those claims, as plaintiff’s likelihood of prevailing on the
first cause of action is sufficient for issuance of the requested preliminary
injunction.
