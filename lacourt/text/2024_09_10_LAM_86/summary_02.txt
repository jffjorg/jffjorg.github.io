And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case involving the application of Education Code § 45041, which dictates how to calculate the salary of an employee who serves less than a full school year. The Employee Relations Act (EERA) establishes a system of collective bargaining for public school district employees, and the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) has exclusive jurisdiction over disputes involving the statutory duties and rights of public employees under the EERA. The judge is seeking to clarify how to apply this provision, specifically how to calculate the salary of an employee who serves less than a full school year.
