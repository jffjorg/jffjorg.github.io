And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denied the defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and new trial. The defendants had argued that the jury verdict was flawed and that there was insufficient evidence to support the judgment. The judge found that the defendants had waived any right to challenge the verdict form and jury instructions because they failed to object at the appropriate time. The judge also found that the verdict and judgment were supported by sufficient evidence. The defendants had also argued that the Court lacked in rem jurisdiction because the properties in question were located in Riverside County, but the judge found that the Court had jurisdiction over the action. The judge also found that Plaintiffs as corporate entities had capacity to sue and defend.
