And here is a brief English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion to set aside the judgment based on abandonment of attorney. The plaintiff's counsel, Mr. Malczynski, failed to appear at the trial and did not file necessary trial documents, leading to a default judgment against the defendants. The defendants argued that Mr. Malczynski abandoned them, but the judge found that he did not completely fail to represent them, and therefore, did not meet the standard for abandonment. The judge also found that the defendants failed to demonstrate that the opposing party's rights would not be prejudiced or suffered injustice if the motion was denied. As a result, the motion was denied.
