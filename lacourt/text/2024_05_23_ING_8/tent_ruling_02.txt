BACKGROUNDA. FactualOn December 27, 2022, Plaintiff, Julia Misley (formerly known as Julia Holcomb) (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendant Doe 1 and DOES 2 through 50. On February 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendant, Steven Victor Tallarico aka Steven Tyler, and DOES 2 through 50. The FAC alleges causes of action for: (1) Sexual Battery – Civil Code § 1708.5; (2) Sexual Assault; and (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.   The FAC is based on Plaintiff’ allegations that she is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, sexual battery, assault, and molestation at the hands of Defendant, Steven Victor Tallarico aka Steven Tyler (“Defendant”). Plaintiff alleges that when she was 16 years old, Defendant used his role, status, and power as a well-known musician and rock star to gain access to, groom, manipulate, exploit, sexually assault Plaintiff over the course of over three years in numerous states across the country, including California.   On March 12, 2024, this Court heard Defendant’s Special Motion to Strike portions of the IIED cause of action pursuant to Section 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP Motion) and granted it in part.    Now, Plaintiff has filed this Motion to Strike costs which the Court treats as a motion to tax specific costs claimed.   B. ProceduralOn April 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Strike Costs. On May 10, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition brief. To date, no reply brief has been filed.   II. ANALYSIS  Legal Standard   “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the costs memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(1).)¿ The failure to timely file a motion to tax or strike costs constitutes a waiver of the right to object to costs, unless the Court in its discretion grants relief under Code of Civil Procedure Section 473, such as based upon a finding of excusable neglect. (Douglas v. Willi (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 287, 289; see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(b)(3) [“The party claiming costs and the party contesting costs may agree to extend the time for serving and filing the cost memorandum and a motion to strike or tax costs.¿ This agreement must be confirmed in writing, specify the extended date for service, and be filed with the clerk.¿ In the absence of an agreement, the court may extend the times for serving and filing the cost memorandum or the notice of motion to strike or tax costs for a period not to exceed 30 days.”].)A prevailing party claiming costs must file and serve a memorandum of costs either (1) within 15 days after the date of service of a notice of entry of judgment or dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5, (2) 15 days after the service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or (3) within 180 days after entry of judgment, whichever is first. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (a).) Any motion to strike or tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the memorandum, plus an additional 5 days if served by mail or 2 days if served electronically. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1).) “Unless objection is made to the entire cost memorandum, the motion to strike or tax costs must refer to each item objected to by the same number and appear in the same order as the corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of costs and must state why the item is objectionable.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(2).) California Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a), sets forth items allowable as costs.¿ And section 1033.5, subdivision (b) lists the items that are not allowable as costs.¿ The court has discretion to allow costs that are not barred by subdivision (b), but are not listed under subdivision (a).¿ (Science Applications International Corporation v. Superior Court (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1095, 1103.)¿ If an item of costs is expressly allowed by statute and if items appear on their face to be proper, the verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of their propriety, shifting the burden of proof to the objecting party to show that the items are not “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation” or “reasonable in amount.”¿ (Benach v. County of L. A. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 836, 855; (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131-32 [“trial court erred in requiring additional proof from” the party claiming costs, where the party attacking costs had the burden]; Santantonio v. Westinghouse Broad. Co. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 102, 116, 121 [after a prima facie showing based on verified cost memorandum, objecting party has the burden to prove costs should be disallowed]; Ladas v. Cal. State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773 (“Ladas”).)¿ But if an item of cost does not appear proper on its face, the burden of showing that it is reasonable and necessary shifts to the party claiming the cost.¿ (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131; Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1267; but see Bach v. County of Butte (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 294, 308 ["Only after such costs are challenged by a motion to tax do the parties need to justify their claims by submitting documentation of the costs they have incurred."].)  Accordingly, the court must determine whether section 1033.5 expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears proper on its face.¿ (See Nelson, supra, 72 Cal.App.4th at 131.)¿¿  Discussion  Here, Plaintiff brought this Motion to Strike Costs as to Defendant’s claimed travel costs relating to the Anti-SLAPP motion. On March 27, 2024, Defendant filed a Memorandum of Costs seeking a total amount of $7,105.56. The crux of the motion to strike issue Plaintiff has raised as to the costs, is the $4,479.41 Defendant is seeking to recover in travel costs for three people to travel from Atlanta, Georgia to Los Angeles for a hearing on an anti-SLAPP motion. Plaintiff argues that this cost is not reasonable. The Court agrees in part and disagrees in part.  Travel expenses outside of depositions are recoverable at the court’s discretion where they are reasonably necessary to the litigation. (See Code Civ. Proc., §1033.5, subd. (c); see also Ladas, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at pp. 775-776 [denying travel expenses outside of deposition travel under subdivision (a)(3) and concluding they were merely convenient under subdivision (c)(4)].)¿In this case, Plaintiff contends that Defendant’s counsel of record is Squire Patton Boggs, a law firm which has an office in Los Angeles, California. Plaintiff also notes that although Defendant lists four California-based attorneys, three of whom are located in Los Angeles on his case caption, two out-of-state attorneys and one out-of-state paralegal from Atlanta, Georgia nonetheless traveled to Los Angeles, California to attend the Anti-SLAPP motion hearing in-person. Plaintiff contends that only one of the out-of-state attorneys, Mr. Long-Daniels, made an official appearance or spoke to argue the motion.  In opposition, Defendant notes that his costs were reasonably necessary to the litigation. Defendant Mr. Long-Daniels is the lead counsel and Defendant’s attorney of choice to handle such substantive matters. Further, Defendant cites to two California Federal District Court cases – one published, and one unpublished – where courts have awarded travel costs to out-of-town attorneys to travel to hearings. First, Defendant cites to Page v. Something Weird Video (1996) 960 F.Supp 1438, where the District Court found that some of the travel expenses incurred for a New York attorney to attend a hearing was, in the exercise of the trial court’s discretion in that case, “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial.” (Page, supra, 960 F.Supp. at 1447.) In Page, the Court did not discuss the availability of local counsel, but noted that the New York attorney who was granted reasonable travel costs argued both a choice-of-law motion as well as a summary judgment motion. (Id. at 1446.) However, this Court also notes that this case was decided in 1996, when remote, virtual appearances were fanciful projections of the future rather than a daily routine as they have been since early in the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a quarter century later. Further, Judge Paez’ decision from the Central District of California also held the following: “The cost of Mr. Boras' airline tickets is excessive. Flying first-class is not “reasonably necessary” to further litigation. The parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment were scheduled well in advance, and round-trip airfare from New York City to Los Angeles typically need not exceed $600.”  (Page, supra, 960 F.Supp. at p. 1447.)  Judge Paez thus cut the claimed $2,751.60 airfare costs for the one attorney to $1,200, which was a tiny fraction of the $82,000 attorneys fee awarded in that case. Next, Defendant cites to the unpublished California Federal District Court case of Bonner v. Fuji Photo Film (2008) 2008 WL 410260 (“Bonner”). In Bonner, the Defendant requested travel expenses for the cost of several different defense counsel traveling between San Francisco and Los Angeles for different court hearings and different depositions. The District Court found that Defendant’s counsel’s cost of traveling to San Francisco to participate in the Court’s hearing on Defendant’s motion to remand and a motion to dismiss were reasonably necessary costs of conducting litigation. The District Court also noted that the fact a Defendant hired counsel in Los Angeles rather than San Francisco did not preclude that Defendant from recovering the costs of counsel’s travel expenses, and the Bonner Court did not differentiate in its analysis between deposition travel and court hearing travel.     Defendant also cites to Doe v. Los Angeles County Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 675, where the Second District Court of Appeal found that lodging expenses may be reasonable. (Id. at p. 696.) The Second District Court of Appeal found that lodging expenses during a trial for a legal assistant/paralegal, who was crucial to the defense, were reasonably necessary to litigation. (Ibid.) The Court noted that the legal assistant “assisted with the preparation, organization, and management of exhibits, documents, and witnesses. She also helped finalize and file documents prepared during trial.” (Ibid.)  A California state court case that was not cited by the parties supports the proposition that Section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(3) does not limit reimbursement for travel expenses to travel by attorneys practicing in the court's jurisdiction.  (Thon v. Thompson (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1546, 1548.)  In Thon, the Fourth District affirmed the trial court’s allowance of some of the airplane flight costs from Bakersfield to San Diego, but reversed on the differential between the costs of the chartered flights actually taken and commercial flights that could have been taken as there was no showing the chartered flights were reasonably necessary.   Here, the Court finds that each of the cases cited above support the proposition that travel costs by out-of-county or out-of-state lawyers may be awarded if, in the trial court’s discretion, they are found to be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation and were reasonably in amount.  Clients have a right to counsel of their choice, and many higher-profile clients hire law firms with multiple offices to enable them to address litigation or other legal matters that arise in different areas of the country.  The Client should not be barred from recovering costs incurred in litigation merely because the specific expertise of a particular lawyer is found in a different office or different state than the local office where the litigation is venued.    David Long-Daniels’ declaration notes that on March 11, 2024, he traveled from Atlanta, Georgia to Los Angeles, California to attend the hearing on Defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion. (Declaration of David Long-Daniels (“Long-Daniels Decl.”), ¶ 4.) He further asserts that the cost of his flight was $3,247.81, but that he only attributes a portion of that cost, $114.74, to this case. He also notes he paid $516.26 to stay in a hotel the night prior to the hearing. (Long-Daniels Decl., ¶ 4.) As such, Mr. Long-Daniels is seeking a total sum of costs for travel expenses in the amount of $631. (Long-Daniels Decl., ¶ 5.)   In Allyson Lumpkin’s declaration (“Lumpkin Decl.”), she notes that on March 11, 2024, she also travelled from Atlanta, Georgia to Los Angeles, California. (Lumpkin Decl., ¶ 4.) She notes the cost of her flight was $3,217.50, but that she only attributes $313.18, to this case. (Lumpkin Decl., ¶ 4.) She also notes that she paid $555.06 to stay in a hotel the night prior to the hearing. (Lumpkin Decl., ¶ 4.) As such, she is seeking a total sum for costs of travel in the amount of $868.24. (Lumpkin Decl., ¶ 5.)  Lastly, Marvelle Moore’s declaration (“Moore Decl.”) indicates that she too traveled on March 11, 2022, and that the cost of her flight was $2,550.44, but that she attributes only a portion of that cost, $2,024.49, to this case. (Moore Decl., ¶ 4.) She also notes that she paid $749.97 to stay in a hotel the night before the hearing. (Moore Decl., ¶ 4.) She further contends she paid $24.43 to print additional materials required for the hearing, and paid $181.28 for Uber rides to get from the airport to the hotel and back. (Moore Decl., ¶ 4) As such, the total sum cost of travel expenses Moore is claiming is $2,980.17.  With the benefit of the declarations provided in support of the Opposition to the motion to tax costs, a factual basis for judging the motion to tax has been more fully provided than just the Cost Bill.  Mr. Long-Daniels’ $631 combined cost is determined by the Court to be reasonable in amount and was reasonably incurred in the conduct of the litigation, so the Court DENIES the motion to tax that amount.  While other court appearances in this case might not be as necessary for in-person appearance, the anti-SLAPP motion was a crucial early motion that a reasonable client facing the type of claims made in this case would want their lead trial counsel to attend in person.   Ms. Allyson Lumpkin attested to her history with this case and supportive Senior Associate role on the matter.  The Court exercises its discretion and finds her in-court attendance reasonably incurred and the amounts claimed to be reasonable in amount.  The Court thus finds her $868.24 to be justified and the motion to tax that amount is DENIED.   The Court GRANTS the motion to tax $2,980.17 in costs for Marvelle Moore as not being reasonably necessary costs for this hearing.  This case is not similar to Doe, where the legal assistant/paralegal was crucial from the inception of the case through trial, and was necessary at trial for trial counsel there.  While the Court acknowledges the important role of paralegals in providing research, support, investigation and other matters, and while many tasks sometimes assigned to higher-priced lawyers may be more efficiently and economically performed by experienced paralegals, Ms. Moore’s in-person attendance in Southern California for a motion hearing is not shown on the record before this Court to be reasonably necessary.  The Court’s ruling on this motion is expressly without prejudice to consideration of fees or costs incurred for a different nature of motion, other hearing, or trial, where the in-person attendance of a paralegal such as Ms. Moore may well be reasonably necessary.
