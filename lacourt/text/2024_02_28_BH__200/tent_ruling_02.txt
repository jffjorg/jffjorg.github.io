[1] Significantly, though the Court then admonished
Thomas for not disclosing the complete history of what occurred in the Utah
courts, Thomas again now repeats that Court’s initial temporary decision
without also mentioning its subsequent conclusion after hearing from all
parties. The Court concurs with Petitioners that this level of advocacy may be sanctionable.



[2] To the extent Thomas seeks to avoid any consequences
resulting from approval of the final report because of the pending litigation,
Receiver has indicated he takes no position concerning same. The issues to be
decided do not concern Thomas’ management of the 101 Trusts.   


[3] Thomas had the opportunity to contest specific fees and
costs by way of the Compensation Procedure in the receivership order, whereby
the parties were notified through-out this case what the fees were prior to
their payment. Thomas did not obtain any order on any objections to those fees.
He cannot now do so when he could have done so before.
