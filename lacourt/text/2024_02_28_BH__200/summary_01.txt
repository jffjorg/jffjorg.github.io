And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is about a motion to approve the Receiver's final account and terminate the receivership. The Receiver was appointed on July 26, 2018, and has been managing several entities and distributing assets to beneficiaries. Thomas, the defendant, has raised objections to the Receiver's final account and the Court must determine whether to schedule an evidentiary hearing to resolve these disputes. The Judge has already overruled Thomas's objections to the audit report and has found no basis to change those rulings. The Court will consider Thomas's offer of proof to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is needed. If no hearing is needed, the Court will adopt this tentative ruling on the hearing date.
