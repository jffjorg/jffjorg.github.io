And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Thomas and the 101 Trusts. The judge notes that Thomas has failed to disclose the complete history of the case in the Utah courts, and is now repeating the initial temporary decision without mentioning the subsequent conclusion after hearing from all parties. The judge concurs with the petitioners that this level of advocacy may be sanctionable. The judge also notes that the receiver takes no position on the pending litigation and that the issues to be decided do not concern Thomas' management of the 101 Trusts. Furthermore, the judge rules that Thomas had the opportunity to contest specific fees and costs through the Compensation Procedure in the receivership order, but did not do so. As a result, Thomas cannot now contest the fees and costs when he could have done so before.
