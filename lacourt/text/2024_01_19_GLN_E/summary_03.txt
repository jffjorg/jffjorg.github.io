And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for attorneys' fees and non-taxable costs filed by Plaintiff Mikayel Badalyan, an attorney who was represented by his wife, Ms. Sinanyan, in a prior case. The prior case resulted in a settlement agreement, and Plaintiff is now suing Defendant NR Development, Inc. for breach of that agreement.

The court has previously denied Plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees based on concerns about the attorney-client relationship between Plaintiff and his wife. However, Plaintiff has provided additional information and arguments that distinguish this case from a previous case, Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp., which held that an attorney cannot recover attorneys' fees when representing himself in propria persona.

The court is inclined to grant the motion, but will hear argument on the issue of whether Plaintiff's wife can recover attorneys' fees for work done on her husband's behalf. The court notes that Plaintiff's wife is not a party to the settlement agreement and has not signed the 998 offer, and therefore may not have standing to sue for breach of contract.

The court will also consider the reasonableness of the attorneys' fees and costs requested, and may adjust the lodestar amount based on factors such as the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, the skill displayed in presenting them, and the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys.
