BACKGROUND
Plaintiff,
Amelia Lopez, filed the instant lawsuit on 03/28/2022 alleging the following
five causes of action: (1) Violation of Subdivision (d) of Civil Code Section
1793.2; (2) Violation of Subdivision (b) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (3)
Violation of Subdivision (a)(3) of Civil Code Section 1793.2; (4) Breach of
Express Written Warranty Civil Code Section 1791.2 Subdivision (a), Section
1794; and (5) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability Civil Code
Section 1791.1, Section 1794.
 
This
action stemmed from Plaintiff purchasing a 2019 Chevrolet Colorado on or about
October 12, 2019.
 
On
06/12/2023, a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case was filed with the Court.
 
In
the Major Declaration, Major states that the parties executed the settlement
agreement on July 6, 2023 for $84,000.00 with fees by motion. (Decl. Major ¶6.)
 
However,
in Plaintiff’s Counsel’s (Oliva) declaration, Oliva states that Plaintiff
executed the Settlement Agreement and Release (SAR) on July 6, 2023, but
Defendant has yet to return to Plaintiff the counter-signed SAR. (Decl. Oliva
¶¶5-6.)
 
 
ANALYSIS
Timeliness
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must
be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail, the period is extended as provided in Code of
Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum was served electronically,
the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section
1010.6(a)(4).” (CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)
Here, the instant motion appears timely because the
memorandum of costs was served electronically and filed on 08/31/2023, and the
instant motion was served by email and filed on 09/14/2023. Further, Opposition
does not argue that the instant motion is untimely.
CRC Rule 3.1700(a)(1)
Defendant
argues that the Court should strike Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Costs in its
entirety as untimely. 
Defendant cites to CRC, Rule 3.1700(a) which states, “A
prevailing party who claims costs must serve and file a memorandum of costs
within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of entry of judgment or
dismissal by the clerk under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 or the date
of service of written notice of entry of judgment or dismissal, or within 180
days after entry of judgment, whichever is first. The memorandum of costs must
be verified by a statement of the party, attorney, or agent that to the best of
his or her knowledge the items of cost are correct and were necessarily
incurred in the case.” (CRC, Rule 3.1700(a)(1).)
Defendant argues this motion is untimely on the basis
that “rather than take any immediate action after filing the Notice of
Settlement or even executing the settlement agreement, Counsel waited 56
days – almost two months – before filing its Motion for Costs.” (Def.
Mot. p. 5.)
[The Court notes that it appears as if Defendant is
arguing that there was almost two months between 7/6/2023 when the parties
allegedly signed the settlement agreement, and 8/31/2023, when Plaintiff filed
the Memorandum of Costs.]
To support its argument, Defendant cites Madrigal
v. Hyundai Motor Am., No. C090463, 2023 WL 2883009, which Defendant says Madrigal
cites the California Supreme Court’s holding in DeSaulles v. Community
Hospital of Monterey Peninsula (2016), 62 Cal.4th 1140, 202. Defendant
argues that Madrigal affirmatively stated that a compromise under
Section 998 is the legal equivalent of a judgment. 
[The Court notes that Defendant’s citation of Madrigal
appears to be improper. First, Defendant does not indicate the page at
which it obtained its quotation. Defendant also did not note that review was
granted in Madrigal. “Pending review and filing of the Supreme Court's
opinion, unless otherwise ordered by the Supreme Court under (3), a published
opinion of a Court of Appeal in the matter has no binding or precedential
effect, and may be cited for potentially persuasive value only. Any citation to
the Court of Appeal opinion must also note the grant of review and any
subsequent action by the Supreme Court.” (CRC, Rule 8.1115(e)(1).)]
Defendant quotes the following portion of Madrigal:
“ ‘[A]s between
the parties thereto and for purposes of enforcement of settlement agreements, a
compromise agreement contemplating payment by defendant and dismissal of the
action by plaintiff is the legal equivalent of a judgment in plaintiff’s
favor.’” (DeSaulles, supra, at p. 1155, 202 Cal.Rptr.3d 429, 370 P.3d
996, citing Goodstein, supra, 27 Cal.App.4th at p. 907, 32
Cal.Rptr.2d 740, italics added.) Thus, the Supreme Court agreed that the
term “judgment” in section 998 is meant to include its functional equivalents,
such as dismissal of a case with prejudice.
 
(Madrigal v.
Hyundai Motor America (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 385, 400, rev. granted.)
 
Thus, Defendant
argues that when Plaintiff filed the Notice of Settlement, or alternatively
when she executed the settlement agreement, the time limit for counsel to file
this memorandum of costs began to run because the settlement was equivalent to
a “judgment” under CRC, Rule 3.1700(a)(1).
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff
argues that while a settlement agreement operates as an “entry of judgment” for
purposes of Civ. Proc. Code §998 and  that a previously rejected 998 Offer of
Compromise may be considered in applying the penalty provision of that Code
section, the cases that Defendant cited are inapposite because they don’t
interpret the meaning of the word “judgment” for purposes of CRC, Rule 3.1700.
 
Here, the Court does
not find Defendant’s argument persuasive. Defendant cited Madrigal which
dealt with interpreting “judgment” in the context of Code of Civil Procedure Section
998. Defendant’s citation is inapposite, and Defendant did not cite any case
law pertaining to the instant context of the definition of “judgment” under
CRC, Rule 3.1700. Therefore, since Defendant did not cite any case law on point
that a judgment has occurred, and since dismissal has not occurred, Defendant’s
argument that Plaintiff’s Memordum of Costs is untimely is unavailing.
 
Form of Motion
“Unless
objection is made to the entire cost memorandum, the motion to strike or tax
costs must refer to each item objected to by the same number and appear in the
same order as the corresponding cost item claimed on the memorandum of costs
and must state why the item is objectionable.” (CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(2).)
Although this issue was not brought up in Opposition,
it appears that Defendant did not comply with CRC 3.1700(b)(2). The Court
brings this up on its own because of how difficult it is to parse through the
Defendant’s objections to costs.
While to some degree, it is possible that Defendant
objected to the entire cost memorandum, and thus Defendant complied with CRC
3.1700(b)(2), it does not really seem like that is what Defendant is doing
here. Defendant moved only to strike the entirety of the Memorandum of Costs on
the basis that the memorandum was untimely. However, the remainder of the
motion seeks to strike costs in the amount of $1,375.29. 
It would have helped Defendant to comply with
3.1700(b)(2) because Defendant argued in its moving papers as follows:
Counsel presents
no evidence to support its claim for $2,751.45 in costs, other than the
Memorandum of Costs itself and various invoices. In that Memorandum, Counsel
seeks $1,375.29 in costs which are without merit representing another attempt
for Counsel to bolster overall costs in this matter at the expense of GM and
without benefit to Plaintiff. Counsel’s Memorandum of Costs, seeks $2,751.45
including expenses not actually or reasonably incurred:
 
     · GM should not be required to pay
the $328.0 in service of process costs related to serving nonparty deposition
notices. (See Memorandum of Costs; Worksheet, p. 1, 5.a. and Attachment 5.d.).
These dealerships are a non-parties with their own counsel and are not
controlled by GM. Moreover, none of this work by Counsel advanced Plaintiff’s
case and benefitted only Counsel. As such, Counsel should not recover any of
these costs. 
 
· GM should not be required to
reimburse Counsel for $1,047.29 for costs associated with Plaintiff’s motions
to compel ($802.44), her ex parte application to shorten time or continue trial
($194.32), a case reassignment notice ($00.53), and a mediation invoice
($50.00). (Id.; Worksheet, p. 1, 16. and Attachments 1(g) and 16(a). These were
optional costs that Plaintiff elected, where the motions practice was entirely
one-sided. These unnecessary costs should be stricken in their entirety. 
 
Accordingly, GM
asks for a reduction of $1,375.29. Counsel should recover no more than
$1,376.16 in costs.
 
(Def. Mot. p. 6.)
 
As can be seen
from above, Defendant does not make it clear which items of cost Defendant is
objecting to, and even if Defendant had indicated which items of costs it was
objecting to, Defendant still did not identify which number the item was listed
under on the Memorandum of Costs.
 
Burden: Further Analysis
“If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be
proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that
they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993)
19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774 citing Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d
618, 624.)
Defendant argues in its moving papers that Plaintiff
bears the burden to establish that her costs were necessary and reasonable.
Defendant argues this by assuming it properly objected, and since it properly
objected, it put these objections into issue and now Plaintiff has the burden
of proof claiming them as costs.
The Court notes that Defendant’s argument does not
appear to be entirely correct both legally and factually.
To illustrate how Defendant oversimplified the issue
of the burden, the Court will cite a portion of a case that Defendant itself
cited:
In ruling upon a motion
to tax costs, the trial court's first determination is whether the statute
expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears proper on its face.
“If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show [the costs] to be unnecessary
or unreasonable.” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111,
131, 84 Cal.Rptr.2d 753.) Where costs are not expressly allowed by the
statute, the burden is on the party claiming the costs to show that the charges
were reasonable and necessary. (Id. at p. 132, 84 Cal.Rptr.2d
753.) “Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation
presents a question of *30 fact for the trial court and its
decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.”
 
(Foothill-De Anza
Community College Dist. v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 29-30.)
 
As explained in Foothill,
 the trial court’s first determination is
whether the statute expressly allows the particular item and whether it appears
proper on its face. If the statute expressly allows the item, then the burden
is on the objecting party to show the costs to be unnecessary or unreasonable. 
 
The issue with Defendant/Movant’s
argument (i.e., that the burden is on Plaintiff to show necessity and
reasonableness) is that Defendant made no argument and no explanation as to how
any of these costs are not expressly authorized by statute. While it appears as
if it would be Plaintiff’s burden to show reasonableness and necessity when the
costs are not expressly allowed by statute, the problem here is that Movant
doesn’t even attempt to explain in the slightest fashion how the costs are not
expressly allowed by statute.
 
Therefore, Movant seems
to assume it properly objected, but the Court is not convinced as such, because
Movant makes no attempt to argue how any items of costs are not allowed by
statute. 
 
Further, the case of Nelson
v. Anderson helps explain the parties’ burdens:
 
We agree the mere
filing of a motion to tax costs may be a “proper objection” to an item, the
necessity of which appears doubtful, or which does not appear to be proper on
its face. (See Oak Grove School Dist. v. City Title Ins. Co. (1963)
217 Cal.App.2d 678, 698–699, 32 Cal.Rptr. 288.) However, “[i]f the items appear
to be proper charges, the verified memorandum is prima facie evidence that the
costs, expenses and services therein listed were necessarily incurred by the
defendant [citations], and the burden of showing that an item is not properly
chargeable or is unreasonable is upon the [objecting party].” (Id., at
p. 699, 32 Cal.Rptr. 288; see also, Miller v. Highland Ditch Co. (1891)
91 Cal. 103, 105–106, 27 P. 536.)
 
The court's first
determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows the
particular item, and whether it appears proper on its face. (Cf., Ladas
v. California State Auto. Assn., supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at pp. 774–776,
23 Cal.Rptr.2d 810.) If so, the burden is on the objecting party to show them
to be unnecessary or unreasonable. (Decoto School Dist. v. M. & S. Tile
Co. (1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 310, 317, 37 Cal.Rptr. 225.)
 
(Nelson v.
Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.)
 
As Nelson also
explained, the court’s first determination is whether the statute expressly
allows the particular item, and whether it appears proper on its face. While
CCP § 1033.5(a) lists items allowable as costs under Section 1032, and while
1033.5(b) lists items not allowable as costs except when expressly authorized
by law, Movant makes no argument that any of the items it is objecting to are
not expressly allowed by statute. 
 
In fact, the way
in which Movant argues is as follows:
 
Counsel presents
no evidence to support its claim for $2,751.45 in costs, other than the
Memorandum of Costs itself and various invoices. In that Memorandum, Counsel
seeks $1,375.29 in costs which are without merit representing another attempt
for Counsel to bolster overall costs in this matter at the expense of GM and
without benefit to Plaintiff. Counsel’s Memorandum of Costs, seeks $2,751.45
including expenses not actually or reasonably incurred:
 
     · GM should not be required to pay
the $328.0 in service of process costs related to serving nonparty deposition
notices. (See Memorandum of Costs; Worksheet, p. 1, 5.a. and Attachment 5.d.).
These dealerships are a non-parties with their own counsel and are not
controlled by GM. Moreover, none of this work by Counsel advanced Plaintiff’s
case and benefited only Counsel. As such, Counsel should not recover any of
these costs. 
 
· GM should not be required to
reimburse Counsel for $1,047.29 for costs associated with Plaintiff’s motions
to compel ($802.44), her ex parte application to shorten time or continue trial
($194.32), a case reassignment notice ($00.53), and a mediation invoice
($50.00). (Id.; Worksheet, p. 1, 16. and Attachments 1(g) and 16(a). These were
optional costs that Plaintiff elected, where the motions practice was entirely
one-sided. These unnecessary costs should be stricken in their entirety. 
 
Accordingly, GM
asks for a reduction of $1,375.29. Counsel should recover no more than
$1,376.16 in costs.
 
(Def. Mot. p. 6.)
 
As can be seen in
Movant’s motion, Movant makes no attempt to argue that the costs are not
expressly allowed by statute based on § 1033.5(a) or § 1033.5(b). Movant argues
only as to the reasonableness and necessity of the costs. 
 
Further, while
Movant only argued reasonableness and necessity, in Opposition, the Plaintiff sufficiently
explained why the costs were necessary and reasonable. 
 
The Opposition
also points out that it is difficult to ascertain which costs Defendant is
referring to with respect to the $802.44 in connection with the motions to
compel because Defendant does not name any specific costs or cite where those
costs are in the memorandum of costs. Even though Plaintiff brought this up in
Opposition, Defendant made no attempt in the Reply to clarify which items of
costs it is attacking with respect to the motions to compel.
 
To the Court, it
appears as if Plaintiff sufficiently demonstrated on pages 4-6 of the
Opposition why the costs were reasonable and necessary. In Reply, Defendant
makes no attempt to attack the substance of why Plaintiff believes the costs to
be reasonable and necessary, but instead copies the exact argument it asserted
in its moving papers.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
Movant
made no arguments about any of the costs not being expressly allowed by
statute. Movant argued only that some of the costs were unreasonable and not
necessary. Not only were Movant’s arguments on unreasonableness and necessity unpersuasive,
but Plaintiff also successfully attacked those arguments in its Opposition and
explained why the costs were reasonable and necessary. 
 
Further, for
several costs the Movant seeks to strike, Movant does not even identify the
costs it is seeking to strike in any clear manner.
 
Defendant’s motion
to strike costs is DENIED.
