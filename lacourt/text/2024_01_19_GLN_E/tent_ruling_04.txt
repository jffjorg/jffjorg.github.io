RULING ON MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES 
BACKGROUND
On
12/13/2022, Plaintiffs Jose L. Barajas and Edilia Solis filed a Complaint
against Ford Motor Company, a Delaware corporation, alleging three causes of
action for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, (2)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty, and (3) Violation
of the Song-Beverly Act Section 1793.2.
Plaintiffs allege that on August 29, 2019 they
purchased a 2019 Ford Edge (Compl. ¶8.) Plaintiffs allege that the Subject
Vehicle was delivered to them with serious defects and nonconformities to
warranty and developed other serious defects and nonconformities to warranty

and suspension system defects.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Plaintiffs
JOSE L. BARAJAS and EDILIA SOLIS (“Plaintiffs”) move for an order to strike
Defendant FORD MOTOR COMPANY’s (“Defendant”) objections and compel further
responses to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of Documents, Set One, numbers
46-91 (collectively, the “RFPs”). Plaintiffs bring this Motion pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2031.310, and 2031.320, on the grounds

seek documents relevant to their Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”)
causes of action.

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL FURTHER – REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION
Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may obtain discovery
regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved
in the pending action..., if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence
or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.”  The Section specifically
provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or defense of the party
seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,” and that discovery “may
be obtained of the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any
discoverable matter, as well as of the existence, description, nature, custody,
condition and location of any document, electronically stored information,
tangible thing, or land or other property.”

 
CCP § 2031.310(a) provides that a party demanding a document
inspection may move for an order compelling further responses to the demand if
the demanding party deems that:
“(1)   A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete.
  (2)   A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
  (3)  
An objection in the response is without merit or too general.”  

 
Under
CCP § 2031.310 (b)(1), “The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.”  
 
“In
the more specific context of a demand for production of a tangible thing, the
party who asks the trial court to compel production must show “good cause” for
the request—but unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of
attorney work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of
relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)


PROCEDURAL ANALYSIS
45-Day Requirement
Unless
notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a further response to
the demand. (CCP §2031.310(c).) 
Neither party addresses the timeliness requirement.
Meet and Confer
“The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.” (CCP §2031.310(b)(2).)
Here, Opposition argues that Movant did not meet and
confer. The Court does not find this argument availing .
ANALYSIS
 
TENTATIVE RULING
(TR)  RFP 46
Defendant’s
objection as to “warranty parts replacement trends” being vague is sustained. This
is not a defined term, and it is unclear what this term is referring to. Despite
Plaintiff submitting 9 pages in its Separate Statement as to the insufficiency
of Defendant’s response to this RFP, Plaintiff does not address this objection.

 
“In the more
specific context of a demand for production of a tangible thing, the party who
asks the trial court to compel production must show “good cause” for the
request—but unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney
work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of
relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) Here, Plaintiff does not attempt to explain good cause.
 
Plaintiff’s motion
DENIED as to RFP 46.


TR RFP 47, 48, 49,
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 72, 74,
75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, and 91
Defendant’s
objections are overruled. The objections did not comply with § 2031.240.
Further, the objections as to privilege and work product did not comply with § 2031.240(c)(1).

 
As to those RFPs
that Ford stated it would comply in part, it lists what it will produce, but it
did not identify with particularity the documents that fall within any category
to which an objection is made. These responses are evasive. Ford appears to
unilaterally limit what it wants to produce. 
 
Motion to compel
further response to RFPs 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 61, 62, 63,
64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 72, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 84, 85, 86, 87,
88, 89, 90, and 91                 is GRANTED.

Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) Here, Plaintiff
does not attempt to explain good cause.
 
Plaintiff’s motion DENIED as to RFP 50.



TR RFP 59
Defendant’s
objection as to “commonly observed problems” being vague is sustained. This is
not a defined term, and it is unclear what this term is referring to. Despite
Plaintiff submitting 8 pages in its Separate Statement as to the insufficiency
of Defendant’s response to this RFP, Plaintiff does not once address this
objection. 
 
“In the more
specific context of a demand for production of a tangible thing, the party who
asks the trial court to compel production must show “good cause” for the
request—but unless there is a legitimate privilege issue or claim of attorney
work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of

work product, that burden is met simply by a fact-specific showing of
relevance.” (TBG Ins. Services Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96
Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) 
 
Here, the request
refers to plans, policies, procedures, programs, or measures since 2011.

Sanctions
Except
as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary sanction
under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further
response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP §2031.310(h).)
 
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
No sanctions were
requested by either party.
