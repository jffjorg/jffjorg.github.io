And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in an unlawful detainer action. The plaintiffs, Shin Ho Kim and Gena Soon Yoon, seek summary judgment against the defendant, Robert Yepremian, on the grounds that the defendant failed to comply with the terms of a commercial lease agreement and that the lease expired on July 16, 2022. The judge notes that the motion is confusingly written and that the plaintiffs did not clearly explain how their evidence satisfies each element of their cause of action. The judge also expresses concern about the service of the motion and requests that the plaintiffs clarify the basis for their action, whether it is based on the expiration of the fixed-term lease or some other theory. The judge has scheduled a hearing to consider the motion, during which the parties will have the opportunity to present their arguments.
