And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has reviewed the motion to strike Plaintiff's Memorandum of Costs and has denied the motion. The court found that Defendant's arguments were unpersuasive and that Plaintiff successfully demonstrated the reasonableness and necessity of the costs. The court also noted that Defendant failed to comply with California Rules of Court Rule 3.1700(b)(2) by not clearly identifying the specific costs it was objecting to. Therefore, the court denied Defendant's motion to strike costs.
