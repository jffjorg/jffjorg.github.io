(“Chase”) Responding Party: Plaintiffs,  Meline Galstyan and Andrey Pilikyan Moving Papers: Notice/Memo;  Amended Notice of Hearing on Demurrer to SAC Opposition Papers: Opposition Reply Papers: Reply RELIEF REQUESTED  Defendant, Chase, demurs to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) on the following  grounds: 1.  The First Cause of Action does not state a cause of action because the common  law negligence cause of action is displaced and preempted by the comprehensive  scheme of regulation in California's enactment of Division 11 of the California  Commercial Code applicable to wire transfers. 2.  The First and Eighth Causes of Action do not state a cause of action because as  a matter of law Plaintiffs have alleged no claims outside the scope of the  preclusion of common law causes of action under Commercial Code Article 11 and  as a matter of law a bank has no duty of care to supervise or oversee its  customer's account activity. 3.  The Eighth Cause of Action does not state a cause of action against Chase  because the SAC does not allege any deceptive or fraudulent act by Chase. 4.  The Ninth Cause of Action does not state a cause of action because the  allegations of the SAC show no violation of Article 11 by Chase and establish  that Chase acted on the Plaintiffs’ authorization and the Electronic Funds  Transfer Act does not apply to wire transfers. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs filed a  Complaint on 02/17/2023. On 06/05/2023, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended  Complaint (FAC) alleging nine causes of action – (1) Negligence, (2) Breach of  Contract, (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (4) Breach of Covenant of Good Faith  and Fair Dealing, (5) Conversion, (6) Fraud, (7) Money Had and Received, (8)  Unfair Business Practices (Bus. & Prof Code §17200 et seq., and (9)  Violation of California Commercial Code §11101 On  07/21/2023 this Court overruled Chase’s demurrer to the first, eighth, and  ninth causes of action in the FAC. On  08/04/2023, this Court heard Defendants, Avi Ghazaryan, Talin Torossian, and  RLG State Realty’s demurrer to the FAC. The demurrer was overruled as to the  first and third causes of action and sustained with leave to amend as to the  second, fourth, and eighth causes of action.  The  instant demurrer pertains to the SAC.

Here,  moving party alleged it met and conferred but an agreement was not reached.  (Beebe Decl. ¶¶3-4.) LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS Demurrer  – Sufficiency A demurrer for  sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th  740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,  courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of  Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s]  the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not  contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152  Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer  proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via  proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian  v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and  not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the  defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing  is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,  states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at  747.)   The  general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not  evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of  Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.)   “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that  his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable  precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the  nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.  (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)   On  demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not  the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any  legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of  America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of  causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an  entire cause of action to be sustained.”   (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,  119.)  “Generally  it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if  there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by  amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy  (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)  TENTATIVE RULING  Although Defendant only demurred to the first, eighth, and ninth causes  of action, the Court is considering sustaining this demurrer to the entire  complaint on grounds of uncertainty upon its own motion.  A special demurrer for  uncertainty, CCP § 430.10(f), is disfavored and will only be sustained where  the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot  reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or  what counts or claims are directed against him/her.  (Khoury  v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified  under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.) Here,  Defendant cannot determine what counts and claims are directed against it. As  pointed out on page 9 of the demurrer, Plaintiff refers to all defendants as  “Wire Fraud Defendants” in ¶16. However, the fifth, sixth, and seventh causes  of action are directed at Seeger and “Wire Transfer Defendants.” Wire Transfer  Defendants is not a defined term like “Wire Fraud Defendants.”  Therefore,  Defendant is left to guess and assume whether the fifth, sixth, and seventh causes  of action are being alleged against Chase.  The  Court notes that this could be problematic because Defendant did not demur to  those causes of action. They did not demur to those causes of action because  they assumed those causes of action are not alleged against them. However, for  Plaintiffs to take advantage of this uncertainty seems unfair when Defendant  would be the one to lose its opportunity to demur. In Opposition, Opposition  does not attempt to make clear who the “Wire Transfer Defendants” are.  Not  only is this problematic for purposes of Defendant’s demurrer, but it would  also be problematic for Defendant’s motion to strike. The  court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it  deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any  pleading. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part  of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a  court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436(b).)  A  motion to strike cannot be based upon the grounds that a complaint fails to  state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, but instead is properly  based on grounds of superfluous or abusive allegations, or improprieties in  form or procedure.  (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008) 161  Cal.App.4th 509, 528-29.)    The  grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way  of judicial notice.  (Code. Civ. Proc. § 437; Turman v. Turning  Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63 [“judges  read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all  parts in their context, and assume their truth”].)    Further,  CCP §431.10(a)-(c) states as follows: (a) A  material allegation in a pleading is one essential to the claim or defense and  which could not be stricken from the pleading without leaving it insufficient  as to that claim or defense. (b) An  immaterial allegation in a pleading is any of the following: (1) An  allegation that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense. (2) An  allegation that is neither pertinent to nor supported by an otherwise  sufficient claim or defense. (3) A  demand for judgment requesting relief not supported by the allegations of the  complaint or cross-complaint. (c) An  “immaterial allegation” means “irrelevant matter” as that term is used in  Section 436.   (CCP  §431.10(a)-(c).) The  reason this is problematic is because Defendant’s motion to strike points out  several instances in which fraud is generally and conclusorily alleged against  Chase in ¶32 and aiding and abetting the other defendants in fraud in ¶33.  Paragraph  3 of the prayer for relief requests punitive damages as to Seeger and the Wire  Transfer Defendants.  However,  not only is it unclear who the Wire Transfer Defendants are, but it is unclear  if Plaintiffs are attempting to hold Chase liable for punitive damages. It is  unclear if Plaintiffs are seeking to hold Chase liable for punitive damages,  and under what cause of action. Further,  in light of Plaintiffs’ opposition stating that Plaintiffs intend to seek leave  to amend, and for purposes of judicial economy, it makes sense to the Court to SUSTAIN  Defendant’s demurrer and GRANT Defendant’s motion to strike, both with leave to  amend granted.Case No: 23GDCV00329

does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against Wells

the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)  In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and
not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at
747.)  The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) 
“All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that
his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable
precision and with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source and extent of his cause of action.”  (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
(1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.”  (Das v. Bank of
America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.TENTATIVE RULING













































The
Court’s tentative is to follow the same approach it took in ruling on the
Demurrer by JPMorgan Chase’s Demurrer, being heard concurrently with this
Demurrer.
