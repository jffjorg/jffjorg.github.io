Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court sustains Defendant Abedian's demurrer to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The demurrer is sustained as to the first and second causes of action for accounting and quantum meruit, and overruled as to the third and fourth causes of action for conspiracy to commit fraud and fraud. The Court finds that the First Amended Complaint is deficient in alleging specific facts necessary to state a claim for civil conspiracy based on fraud and fraud. The Plaintiff failed to file a timely opposition to the demurrer, and the Court notes that the failure to file opposition creates an inference that the demurrer is meritorious. Leave to amend is denied as there is no reasonable possibility of a successful amendment. The Court's decision is based on the alleged facts and legal authorities presented in the case.
