And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling focuses on the period from December 2014 to January 2017, during which Scott O'Neil was CEO of ODS and Lucanish was employed there. The court previously denied Lucanish's motion for summary adjudication of certain causes of action, and Lucanish has now asked the court to reconsider this decision. The judge concludes that the court did not have good cause to reconsider its earlier decision. However, the judge does decide one issue related to "reasonable belief" and orders the parties to address certain public policy issues. The judge also suggests that the parties consider stipulating to filing a supplemental complaint and cross-complaint to address new facts that have arisen since the case was filed, and orders the parties to file motions in limine and proposed joint jury instructions in advance of a future hearing.
