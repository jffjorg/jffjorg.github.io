original request for entry of default was rejected by the Court clerk because
of the attorney of record zip code on file was different and because the name
of defendant on the proof of service of summons and complaint did not
correspond to the true name on the amendment to complaint. (See Notice of
Rejection dated July 28, 2022.) 
Â 
The Court further notes that
according to the 12/4/21 proof of service, Defendant was served with the
amendment to complaint. No First Amended Complaint has been filed.
