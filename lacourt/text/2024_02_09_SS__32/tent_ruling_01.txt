CASE NUMBER:


21STCV42590




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Vacate Default and Default Judgment




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Tazman James Johnson




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff
  Jane Doe



 
BACKGROUND
 
On November 17, 2021, Plaintiff
Jane Doe (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Tazmin James
Johnson (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 25 for sexual battery, gender violence,
battery, and assault. 
 
On September 26, 2022, default
was entered against Defendant. 
 
On May 16, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s request for default judgement but denied the request for
punitive damages. The Court ordered Plaintiff to submit an amended judgment
form to reflect the Court’s order. (Min. Order, 5/16/23.) 
 
On July 3, 2023, the Court granted
default judgment against Defendant. 
 
On December 28, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion to vacate the
entry of default and default judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section
473(b) and 473.5. Plaintiff opposes and Defendant replies. 
 
The motion was heard on February 5, 2024. At the hearing, counsel for
Plaintiff asserted that Defendant was barred from mandatory relief under
section 473(b) pursuant to two cases not cited in Plaintiff’s opposition.
Defendant objected to the untimeliness of Plaintiff’s argument. The Court
overruled the objection and continued the hearing for Defendant to have time to
respond. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a default
taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect.  This application must be filed
no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought,
and must contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
“The six-month time limit for granting statutory relief
[under section 473(b)] is jurisdictional and the court may not consider a
motion for relief made after that period has elapsed.” (Manson, Iver &
York v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) “The six-month period runs
from entry of default, not entry of judgment.” (Id. [citing Weiss v.
Blumencranc (1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 536, 541].) “The reason for the rule is
that vacation of the judgment alone ordinarily would constitute an idle act; if
the judgment were vacated the default would remain intact and permit immediate
entry of another judgment giving the plaintiff the relief to which his
complaint entitles him.” (Rutan v. Summit Sports, Inc. (1985) 173
Cal.App.3d 965, 970.) However, under the mandatory provision of section 473(b)
for attorney fault, the six-month time limit runs from entry of judgment. (Sugasawara v. Newland (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 297.) If a
motion based on attorney fault is timely, section 473(b) also requires the
court to vacate the underlying default entered by the clerk. (Id. at
295.) 
 
Under the mandatory provision of section
473(b), the Court shall vacate default and default judgment “unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney’s mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
473(b) [italics added].) “[F]or mandatory relief to apply the court must also
satisfy itself that the default (i.e., the failure to respond) was in
fact caused by attorney mistake or neglect.” (Cisneros v. Vueve (1995)
37 Cal.App.4th 906, 911 [emphasis in original].) Where the attorney did not
represent defendant “at the time the default was entered, […] as a matter of
law, […the attorney] was not the proximate cause of the entry of default as
defined in the ‘unless clause.’ Hence, […] defendants were not entitled to relief
under the attorney affidavit provisions of section 473.” (Id. at 912
[alterations added].)
 
Section 473.5
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, “[w]hen
service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to
defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered against
him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to
set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action.” ¿This motion must be brought “within a reasonable time, but in no
event exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment
against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a written
notice that the default or default judgment has been entered.” (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 473.5(a).) 
¿¿ 
The focus of section 473.5 is whether the defaulting party
obtained actual notice in time to defend the action.¿“Discretionary relief
based upon a lack of actual notice under section 473.5 empowers a court to
grant relief from a default judgment where a valid service of summons has not
resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action.”¿ (Anastos
v. Lee (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1314, 1319.)¿“A party seeking relief under
section 473.5 must provide an affidavit showing under oath that his or her lack
of actual notice in time to defend was not caused by inexcusable neglect or
avoidance of service.”¿(Ibid.; Code Civ. Proc. §
473.5(b).)¿The term “actual notice” means
“genuine knowledge of the party litigant.”¿(Rosenthal v. Garner (1983)
142 Cal.App.3d 891, 895.) 
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, here, default
judgment was entered on July
3, 2023. Therefore, the deadline to file this motion based on attorney fault
was January 3, 2024. Since Defendant filed this motion on December 28, 2023, it
is timely. Though Plaintiff argues that the six-month limit runs from the entry
of default, that rule does not apply to mandatory relief based on attorney
fault. (See Sugasawara v. Newland (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 297.)  
 
The Declaration of Gary Jay Kaufman states that when Defendant
purportedly received substitute service of the summons and complaint on August
10, 2022, his office was not yet representing Defendant. (Kaufman Decl. ¶ 8.) After
default was entered against Defendant on September 26, 2022, Mr. Kaufman’s
office was retained both on this civil case, and on Defendant’s other criminal
matters. (Id. ¶¶ 8–9.) However, since counsel does not declare that he was
representing Defendant at the time default was entered, counsel was not the
proximate cause of the entry of default and therefore Defendant is not entitled
to relief under the mandatory provision of section 473(b).
 
Regarding section 473.5, Plaintiff argues that Defendant had
actual notice because he was personally served with the complaint and summons
on December 4, 2021. Counsel for Defendant argues that Defendant lacks actual
notice because he was not served with the statement of damages, except by
substitute service. He further presents evidence that Defendant was admitted to
a residential rehabilitation facility on the same day as the substitute service
– August 10, 2022. The letter from the residential rehabilitation facility is
dated August 10, 2022, at 4:30 p.m. (Kaufman Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. C.),
while the proof of substituted service demonstrates service at 5:56 p.m.
 
However, neither party addresses the
April 24, 2022 proof of personal service of statement of damages, which was
filed with the Court on July 26, 2022.
 
There is no affidavit from
Defendant that he did not receive actual notice in time to defend the action,
given the proofs of personal service of the summons and complaint, as well as
the statement of damages.[1] At
most, there is evidence that Defendant was in a residential rehabilitation
facility on August 10, 2022. Accordingly,
Defendant has not presented sufficient evidence to support setting aside the
default pursuant to section 473.5.
 
            Finally,
although Plaintiff argues that the Court should not set aside the default on
equitable grounds, this was not raised in Defendant’s motion, and therefore the
Court declines to reach Plaintiff’s arguments.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendant’s Motion to Vacate the default
and default judgment.
 
Defendant to provide notice and file a proof of service of such.
