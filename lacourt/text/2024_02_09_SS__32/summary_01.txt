And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to vacate the default and default judgment. The defendant filed the motion on December 28, 2023, which is timely. However, the judge finds that the defendant is not entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) because the attorney who represented the defendant at the time the default was entered was not the proximate cause of the entry of default.

The judge also finds that the defendant has not presented sufficient evidence to support setting aside the default pursuant to section 473.5. The defendant argues that he lacked actual notice of the lawsuit due to being in a residential rehabilitation facility on August 10, 2022, but the judge notes that there is evidence that the defendant received personal service of the summons and complaint, as well as the statement of damages, and that the defendant has not provided an affidavit showing that he did not receive actual notice in time to defend the action.

Finally, the judge declines to reach the plaintiff's argument that the court should not set aside the default on equitable grounds because this was not raised in the defendant's motion.
