Background
 
This action arises out of real estate development
projects in Los Angeles, California concerning properties with assessor parcel
numbers 4419-015-196, 4419-015-907, 4419-015-026, 4419-015- 022 and
4378-002-032 (the “Parcels”). 
 
Steven Powers, as trustee under Amended and Restated
Trust Agreement for R.E.I. 401(k) Trust entered into December 29, 2009, and
effective as of January 1, 2009 (“Plaintiff”), alleges that he is an elderly
man and was fraudulently induced into entering a contract for the sale of land
by Defendant Marcos Vivian (“Vivian”). Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that he
signed a contract with Marquez Pacific View, LLC (“MPV”) based on Vivian’s
misrepresentations. 
 
According to Plaintiff, this contract provided he would
receive a 15% stake in the development project and land for APN 4419- 015-026,
a 15% stake in the development project and land for APN 4419-015-022, and
$300,000 for APN 4378-022-032. Plaintiff further alleges that contrary to MPV’s
and Vivian’s representations, the property interests were instead transferred
to the defendant, Vicino Limited Partnership (“Vicino”).
 
The Fourth Amended Complaint (“4AC”) states the following
nineteen causes of action:
 
1)     Breach of written contract against
Pacific View;
2)     Breach of contract against Pacific
View:
3)     Breach of contract against Vivian;
4)     Breach of contract against Vivian:
5)     Breach of contract against Asia Top
City LTD (“Asia Top City”);
6)     Breach of written contract against
Vivian, Pacific View; 
7)     Breach of written contract against
Pacific View;
8)     Breach of written contract against
Pacific View;
9)     Breach of written contract against
Vivian and Pacific View; 
10) Breach of written contract against
Vivian;
11) Breach of written contract against
Pacific View;
12) Declaratory Relief against Asia Top
City, Vivian, and Pacific View;
13) Intentional Misrepresentation against
Vivian, Pacific View, and Asia Top City;
14) Concealment; against Vivian, Pacific
View, Air I, LLC, and US Realty Holdings, LLC; 
15) Fifteenth Cause of Action against
Vivian, Pacific View, and Asia Top City; 
16) Seventeenth Cause of Action against
Vivian and Pacific View;
17) Fraudulent Transfer against Vivian,
Bel Air I; US Realty Holdings, LLC;
18) Elder Abuse against Vivian, Pacific
View and Asia Top City; and 
19) Restitution from Transferee Based on
Quasi-Contract or Unjust Enrichment against Vivian, Pacific Vivie, Bel Air 1,
LLC, and US Realty, LLC;
 
On February 23, 2022, the court sustained the demurrer to
the 18th cause of action in the 4AC without leave to amend. 
 
On April 6, 2022, Defendant MPV filed a Cross-Complaint
against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant alleging two causes of action for Declaratory
Relief. 
 
On October 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the operative Fifth Amended Complaint (“5AC”) alleging the same 19 causes of
action as the 4AC. 
 
Defendants now demurrer to the tenth
cause of action and move to strike the 5AC. Plaintiff opposes the Motion. For
the reasons stated below, the court treats the demurrer as a motion for
judgment on the pleadings. 
 
motion for
judgment on the pleadings[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings
performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only
defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed.” (Burnett v. Chimney Sweep (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th
1057, 1064.) “In deciding or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all
properly pleaded material facts are deemed to be true, as well as all facts
that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.” (Fire Ins.
Exchange v. Superior Court (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) When
considering demurrers and judgment on the pleadings, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. (Wilson v. Transit Authority of City
of Sacramento (1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 716, 720-21.) A motion for judgment on
the pleadings does not lie as to a portion of a cause of action. (Id.)
“In the case of either a demurrer or a motion for judgment on the pleadings,
leave to amend should be granted if there is any reasonable possibility that
the plaintiff can state a good cause of action.” (Gami v. Mullikin Medical
Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870, 876.) A non-statutory motion for judgment
on the pleadings may be made any time before or during trial. (Stoops v.
Abbassi (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may take judicial notice
of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of
the United States and of any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any
court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of any
state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not
reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate
determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid.
Code, § 452, subds. (c), (d), and (h).) “Taking judicial notice of a
document is not the same as accepting the truth of its contents or accepting a
particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986)
184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
 
Defendants’ request judicial
notice of the following: 
 
1)

3)

4)

Recorder on July 6, 2023 as Document No. 20230441292, a true and correct copy
of which is attached hereto as Exhibit E.
 
6)

described in Schedule 1 thereto), and recorded with the Los Angeles County
Recorder on January 16, 2014 as Document No. 20140052311, a true and correct
copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit F.
 
Defendant’s request for judicial
notice is granted. 
 
III.      Discussion
 
A.        Prior Demurrer to Tenth Cause of Action
was Overruled
 
Plaintiff asserts
that because on September 30, 2021 Judge Burdge overruled the demurrer to the
tenth cause of action as raised in this demurrer, Defendants may not demurrer
again to the tenth cause of action. (D’s RJN Ex. C [Order 09/21/2021 at p. 9 of
25].) “If the demurrer is erroneously overruled, [the demurring party] is
acting properly in raising the point again, at his next opportunity. If the
trial judge made the former ruling himself, he is not bound by it.
[Citation.]  And, if the demurrer was overruled by a different judge,
the trial judge is equally free to reexamine the sufficiency of the pleading.”
(Ion Equipment Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 877.)
 
 
In September 2021,
Defendant’s demurred to the tenth cause of action not on the basis that it was
uncertain or insufficiently pled but on the basis that “the tenth cause of
action is time-barred because consideration under the October 22, 2013 OTP was
due by October 31, 2013, more than four years prior to the filing of this
action.” (D’s RJN  Ex.  C at p. 7 of 25.) The previous demurrer
focused on whether the 10th cause of action was time-barred, not whether it was
sufficiently pled. Therefore, Defendant cannot demurrer to the 10th cause of
action on similar grounds. 
 
            B.        CCP § 430.41(b)’s Prohibition on Successive Demurrers
 
Plaintiff also objects
to the demurrer to the tenth cause of action because it violates section
430.41: 
 
A party demurring to a pleading that has been
amended after a demurrer to an earlier version of the pleading was sustained
shall not demur to any portion of the amended complaint, cross-complaint, or
answer on grounds that could have been raised by demurrer to the earlier
version of the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer.
 
(CCP § 430.41(b).)
Plaintiff asserts that Defendants could have demurred to the tenth cause of
action in a prior demurrer but failed to do so, thus barring this demurrer. The
court agrees that Defendants are statutorily barred from demurring to the 10th
cause of action on a new basis because Defendants failed to raise it in a prior
demurrer. 
 
Defendants can
object to the 10th cause of action by seeking a motion for judgment on the
pleading because a motion for judgment on the pleading may be made on a ground
not raised in an earlier demurrer. (CCP § 438(g)(2).) 
 
Although Defendants
did not seek a motion for judgment on the pleading, section 438 allows the
court to consider Defendants’ argument in a sua sponte motion for
judgment on the pleadings. “The court may upon its own motion grant a motion
for judgment on the pleadings.” (CCP § 438(b)(2).)  “Like a demurrer, a motion for judgment on
the pleadings attacks defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by
matters that may be judicially noticed.” (Alameda County Waste Management
Authority v. Waste Connections US, Inc. (2021) 67 Cal.App.5th 1162, 1174.) 


Therefore, the
court treats the Defendants’ demurrer as a motion for judgment on the pleadings
and considers the arguments raised on the merits. 
 
C.        Tenth Cause of Action - Breach of
Written Contract Entitled Offer to Purchase Dated October 22, 2012 
 
The elements of a
claim for breach of contract are: “(1) the existence of the contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach,
and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v.
Goldman (2011) 51 Cal. 4th 811, 821.) In addition, the complaint must
demonstrate damages proximately caused by the breach. (St. Paul Ins. v.
American Dynasty (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1060.) Furthermore, “the
complaint must [also] indicate on its face whether the contract is written,
oral, or implied by conduct.” (Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co.
(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 452, 458-59 citing CCP § 430.10(g).)
 
“If the action is
based on alleged breach of written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim
in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be
attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman &
Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 308.) Alternatively, “a plaintiff may
plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.”¿ (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,
198-199.)¿¿“[A]ll essential elements of a breach of contract cause of action []
must be pleaded with specificity.”¿(Levy v. State Farm Mutual Automobile
Ins. Co. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1, 5.) 
 
Defendants demur to
the 10th cause of action for breach of contract on the basis that it is
factually deficient and uncertain. The tenth cause of action alleges that
Plaintiff is the successor and assign of Pierpont Investment, Inc. (5AC, ¶
187.) Pierpont Investment, Inc. signed a contract with Defendant Vivian and his
designees or assigns (“Buyer”) entitled OFFER TO PURCHASE on or about October
22, 2013 (hereinafter “10/22/13 Offer to Purchase”) a real estate parcel having
APN 4378-002-032 and known as the Bel Air Lot. (Id., ¶ 187, Ex. J.) 
 
Exhibit J of the 5AC purports to be the “10/22/13 Offer to
Purchase” but Exhibit J contains three contracts with varying terms. Plaintiff
presents three different versions of the 10/22/13 Offer to Purchase. The first
two versions of the agreement are between Defendant Vivian,” an individual, and
his designees or assigns” as “Buyer” and VWY Thermal, Inc. as “Seller.” (5AC,
Ex. J.) The third version is between Defendant Vivian, “an individual, and his
designees or assigns” as “Buyer” and Pierpont Investment, Inc. as “Seller.”
(5AC, Ex. J.) 
 
The 5AC states that Plaintiff is “the assignee, successor, and
transferee” of the company named Pierpont Investments, Inc. and VWY Thermal
Inc. regarding the rights under any contracts signed by the respective
entities. (5AC, ¶¶ 8, 10.) 
 
Plaintiff states despite three contracts being attached to Exhibit
J, there are only two contract versions, two contracts with version
SMRH:401507419.3 which list  VWY Thermal,
Inc. as the “Seller” and one contract with version SMRH:401507419.2 which lists
Pierpont Investment, Inc. as the “Seller.” (5AC, Ex. J.) Plaintiff explains
that the reason there are two versions of the contract is because “the parties
wanted to ensure that there was no “title break” in the record history, hence
the reason for the two contracts.” (Opp., at p. 2:24-25.) However, this
explanation is missing from the 5AC. 
 
Instead, Plaintiff points to Section 8 of SMRH:401507419.3 which
clarifies the reason for the updated form of contract is to close “title break”
but the contract itself states that the purpose is to close the “title break”: 
 
8. CONDITION OF
Title; Title Policy
 
[]
 
In connection therewith,
Seller shall provide to the Title Company . . . (c) a Grant Deed, fully
executed and the properly acknowledged by Pierfront Investment, Inc. a Cayman
Island corporation (“Pierfront”), in favor of Buyer, in order to close the
“title break” created by certain Grant Deed executed on May 21, 1998, by Home
Food Services, Incorporated, a Nevada corporation, in favor of Pierfront,
recorded on December 10, 1998 in the Official Records of Los Angeles Count,
California . . .
 
(5AC, Ex. J [SMRH:401507419.3])
 
Regardless of which version of the 10/22/13 Offer to Purchase
Defendant Vivian signed, Plaintiff fails to point to the provisions of the
agreement Vivian breached as the “Buyer.” The 5AC fails to point to or recite
what provision in Exhibit J, required Defendant Vivian “to develop the Bel Air
Lot within a reasonable time” and sell it, entitling Plaintiff to proceeds of
approximately $300.000. (5AC, ¶¶ 191, 194.) 
The 5AC fails to point to or recite the provisions of the agreement that
prohibited Vivian from transferring to the property. (5AC, ¶ 198.) 
 
Plaintiff’s opposition asserts that Defendant Vivian breached
Section 2 of the contract (Ex. J [SMRH:401507419.3]) which states: 
 
2. Kicker
 
Within thirty (30) days
after the sale by Buyer of the Property for a purchase price in excess of Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), and provided that Seller has complied with
all of its post-closing obligations hereunder, Buyer shall pay to Seller an
amount (the “Participation Payment”) equal to the difference between
Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000) and the amount of property taxes and
assessments outstanding as of the Closing Date, including all penalties and
interests accrued on such amounts through the Closing Date. 
 
(Ex. J [SMRH:401507419.3])
 
“In contract law, a ‘condition precedent’ is ‘either an act of a
party that must be performed or an uncertain event that must happen before the
contractual right accrues or the contractual duty arises.’ [Citations.]” (Barroso
v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1009.) The 5AC is
devoid of any allegation stating that the condition was triggered, meaning
Buyer/Vivian sold the property in excess of $500,000. On the contrary, the
allegations in the 5AC suggest that the condition was never triggered because
Vivian transferred “the property to a third party, Bel Air I, LLC, and then to
US Realty LLC, constituting breaches of contract.” (5AC, ¶ 198.) Accordingly,
Vivian’s obligation to pay the Participation Payment/Kicker was never
triggered. 
 
Plaintiff fails to point to or recite the provisions in Exhibit J
that prohibited Vivian from transferring title to the Bel Air Property or
obligated Vivian to sell the property, let alone to develop it  within a reasonable time. (5AC, ¶ 191.)  Moreover, Plaintiff cannot allege that sale
of the Bel Air Lot to Vivian was done with the understanding that Vivian would
develop the Lot and sell it within a reasonable time because the 10/22/13 Offer
to Purchase states: “This Agreement supersedes all prior discussions,
agreements and understandings between Seller and Buyer and constitutes the
entire agreement between Seller and Buyer with respect to the transaction
herein contemplated.” (5AC, Ex. J, § 14.) Therefore, Plaintiff fails to show
that Defendant Vivian breached the 10/22/13 Offer to Purchase by transferring
the Bel Air Lot to another entity. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Vivian triggered
the Participant Payment obligation by using the Bel Air property to take out
loans in excess of $500,000 and that these loans constituted sales. (Aalaei
Decl., Ex. A.) Yet this allegation is not present in the 5AC. “[F]acts not
alleged are presumed not to exist.” (Schick v. Lerner (1987) 193
Cal.App.3d 1321, 1327.) Therefore, the 5AC is devoid of allegations showing
that Defendant Vivian triggered the obligation to pay Plaintiff the
Participation Payment and breached the agreement by failing to do so. 
 
Lastly, Plaintiff seeks to add a claim for breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing without having obtain permission to do
so. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.112 requires that each cause of action or count
be separately stated but Plaintiff impermissibly seeks to allege a breach of
contract claim and a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing in the same count based on the same facts. (See Davis v. Fresno
Unified School District (2020) 57 Cal.App.5th 911, 921, fn. 5.) Therefore,
to the extent that Plaintiff asserts a cause of action for breach of the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the court finds the claim is
improperly pled. 
 
Based on the facts above, the court agrees that the tenth cause of
action is insufficiently pled and grants the motion for judgment on the
pleadings with leave to amend. 
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time
allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to
strike the whole or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or
disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
“Where the defect raised by a
motion to strike or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend
is routinely and liberally granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the
defect in question.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Discussion
 
Defendants seek to
strike portions of the tenth cause of action. Because the court grants the
motion for judgment on the pleadings, the motion to strike is moot as to the
tenth cause of action. 
 
Defendants also
seek to strike the 18th cause of action for elder abuse (beginning at page 56,
line 5 through page 59, line 12) and the 19th cause of action for unjust
enrichment:
 

Paragraph 353:
     “Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks an order establishing Defendants as
     constructive trustees of the profits and property which they have unjustly
     received…”

 
Lastly, Defendants
also seek to strike the following portions of the 5AC’s Prayer for Relief: 
 

Page 60, lines 20-22: “3.
     Non-Economic damages, including, but not limited to mental anguish, pain
     and suffering, and emotional distress;”
Page 60, lines 23-24: “6.
     Injunctive Relief;”
Page 61, lines 1: “10.
     Reasonable attorneys’ fees;”
Page 61, line 2: “11.
     Attachment;”
Page 61, line 3: “12.
     Appointment of a receiver;”
Page 61, line 4: “13.
     Specific performance, including return of the real property to Plaintiff;”
Page 61, line 5: “14.
     Equitable relief;”
Page 61, line 7: “16.
     Enhanced remedies under the Welfare & Institutions Code.”

 
The court analyses
each request to strike in turn. 
 
A.        Request to Strike
18th Cause of Action: Elder Abuse
 
Defendants move to
strike the eighteenth cause of action in its entirety because the court
previously sustained the demurrer to the eighteenth cause of action without
leave to amend. (See Order 02/23/2022; D’s RJN Ex. D.)
 
Plaintiff’s
opposition asserts that the 2/23/2022 Order is correct, and that the eighteenth
cause of action should be stricken but not the request to strike attorney’s
fees as various contracts attached to the 4AC provide for attorney’s fees.
(Opp. at p. 3-22.) 
 
The eighteenth
cause of action is stricken in its entirety. 
 
B.        Request to Strike
Portions of the  19th Cause of Action
Defendants fail to
explain why they seek to strike the following Paragraph for the 19th cause of
action for unjust enrichment: 
 

Paragraph 353:
     “Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks an order establishing Defendants as
     constructive trustees of the profits and property which they have unjustly
     received…”

 
Unjust enrichment
is synonymous with restitution. (Rutherford Holdings, LLC v. Plaza Del Rey (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 221, 231.) Restitution may be
awarded in lieu of breach of contract damages when the parties had an express
contract, but the express contract is void because it was procured by fraud or
is unenforceable or ineffective for some reason. (Id.) “A claim for restitution is permitted even if the party
inconsistently pleads a breach of contract claim that alleges the existence of
an enforceable agreement.” (Id.) “A constructive trust is an
involuntary equitable trust created by operation of law as a remedy to compel
the transfer of property from the person wrongfully holding it to the rightful
owner. [Citations.] The essence of the theory of constructive trust is to
prevent unjust enrichment and to prevent a person from taking advantage of his
or her own wrongdoing.” (Communist Party v. 522 Valencia, Inc. (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 980, 990.) Civ. Code sections 2223 and 2224 set forth the
circumstances under which a constructive trust may be imposed. (Id.)
 
Plaintiff fails to plead
facts showing that the fact that Defendants obtained the Bel Air Lot without
paying any consideration constitutes wrongful detention by Defendants such that
they became an involuntary trustee (Civ. Code § 2223) or that Defendants
wrongfully gained the property by “by fraud, accident, mistake, undue
influence, the violation of a trust, or other wrongful act” (Civ. Code § 2224.)

 
Therefore, the
court agrees that paragraph 353 should be stricken without leave to amend. 
 
C.        Request to Strike
Portions of the Prayer for Relief 
 

Page 61, line 5: “14.
     Equitable relief;”

 
Defendants assert
that Plaintiff’s request for equitable relief should be stricken because the
court previously struck the request, finding, “[t]he 4AC does not allege facts
demonstrating why any of the requested equitable remedies are necessary.” (D’s
RJN Ex. D [02/23/2022 Order at p. 15.) The court finds that Plaintiff's 19th
cause of action pleads an unjust enrichment and quasi-contract claim that
remains unchallenged by Defendant and reflects Plaintiff’s entitlement to
equitable relief. 
 
Therefore, the
request to strike Page 61, line 5: “14. Equitable relief” is denied. 
 

Page 60, lines 20-22: “3.
     Non-Economic damages, including, but not limited to mental anguish, pain
     and suffering, and emotional distress;”
Page 61, line 7: “16.
     Enhanced remedies under the Welfare & Institutions Code.”

 
As stated above,
Plaintiff does not challenge the correctness of the February 23, 2022 Order. On
February 23, 2022, this court stated: 
 
“No California case has allowed recovery for
emotional distress arising solely out of property damage.” (Cooper v.
Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1008, 1012.) “[M]oreover, a
preexisting contractual relationship, without more, will not support a recovery
for mental suffering where the defendant’s tortious conduct has resulted only
in economic injury to the plaintiff.” (Elrich v. Menezes (1999) 21
Cal.4th 543, 544-555.) Here, the 4AC does not allege that Plaintiff suffered
more than economic injury resulting from the various defendants’ breach of
agreements between them pertaining to real estate development projects. 
 
(Order 02/23/2022.)

 
As the cause of
action for elder abuse is stricken without leave to amend, the court also
strikes without leave to amend Plaintiff’s request for noneconomic damages due
to mental anguish as there is no cause of action supporting such a claim for
relief or for the request for enhanced damages under the Welfare & Inst
Code. 
 

Page 60, lines 23-24: “6.
     Injunctive Relief;”

 
In its February 23,
2022 Order, the court struck Plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief and
noted that Plaintiff failed to identify what kind of claim for injunctive
relief was sought. (D’s RJN, Ex. D at p. 15 of 16.)
 
Despite Plaintiff
filing a fourth and fifth amended complaint, Plaintiff failed to allege a cause
of action for injunctive relief. Therefore, the request to strike Plaintiff’s
request for injunctive relief is granted without leave to amend. 
 

Page 61, lines 1: “10.
     Reasonable attorneys’ fees;”

 
The court denies
Defendants’ request to strike Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees because
Defendants fail to show that none of the contracts at issue provide for
attorney’s fees to the prevailing party. 
 

Page 61, line 2: “11.
     Attachment;”
Page 61, line 3: “12.
     Appointment of a receiver;”
Page 61, line 4: “13.
     Specific performance, including return of the real property to Plaintiff;”

 
Defendants point
out that on February 23, 2022, the court struck Plaintiff’s request for
attachment, appointment of receiver, and specific performance. (D’s RJN Ex. D.)
The court noted: “The FAC includes no basis for awarding any of these equitable
remedies and neither does Plaintiff’s opposition, which does not directly
address this issue.” (Id.) 
 
Despite several
amendments to the pleadings, Plaintiff failed to articulate a basis for the
remedies sought and Plaintiff’s opposition fails to show that further
amendments would be successful. Therefore, the request to strike the request
for “attachment, appointment of a receiver, and specific performance” is
granted without leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
The motion
for judgment on the pleadings as to the tenth cause of action is granted with
leave to amend. The motion to strike is granted and denied in part.
 
The
request to strike Page 61, lines 1: “10. Reasonable attorneys’ fees” is denied.
 The motion to strike the tenth cause of
action is denied as moot. 
 
The
request to strike the 18th cause of action (beginning at page 56, line 5
through page 59, line 12) and Paragraph 353 of the 19th cause of action is
granted without leave to amend. The request to strike the following is granted
without leave to amend: 
 
·      
Page 60, lines 20-22: “3. Non-Economic damages,
including, but not limited to mental anguish, pain and suffering, and emotional
distress;”
·       Page
60, lines 23-24: “6. Injunctive Relief;”
·       Page
61, line 2: “11. Attachment;”
·       Page
61, line 3: “12. Appointment of a receiver;”
