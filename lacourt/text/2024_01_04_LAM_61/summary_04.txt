And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted in part the motion by Golden West Donuts and Sophon Koeuth to recall and quash a writ of execution and return of assets levied. The writ of execution was issued to enforce a default judgment that was later vacated. The Judge has ordered the plaintiff to return $10,744.26 in levied funds to the defendants. The Judge has also denied the defendants' request for $9,795.90 in attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 697.410. The Judge has ruled that the statute does not apply in this case because it is an application for relief based on a vacated judgment, not mistaken identity.
