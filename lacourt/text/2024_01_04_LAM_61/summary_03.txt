And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied Defendant Armen Ambarachyan's motion for sanctions against Plaintiff Sebastian Rucci and the Law Offices of Sebastian Rucci, P.C. The motion sought $71,000 in sanctions, which includes $18,000 in fees expended with the present motion and $53,000 in legal fees incurred. The basis for the motion is similar to the bases offered for Defendant's prior demurrer and motion to apply Ohio law, which contend that Plaintiff, a resident of Ohio, cannot benefit from California's Homeowner Bill of Rights. However, the motion is unpersuasive because none of the exhibits attached to the motion are authenticated, and the evidence presented contradicts Plaintiff's verified allegations of California residence. Therefore, the motion is denied.
