MATTER


Request for Default Judgment



 
Plaintiff Sargenti Architects P.D. (“Plaintiff”) requests for default
judgment against Defendant Raider 94612, LLC (“Defendant”) in
the amount of $90,431.56, which is composed of special damages demanded in the
complaint in the amount of $78,388.11; prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,866.95;
costs in the amount of $516.50; and attorneys’ fees in the amount of $660.
 
A.    Damages
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges five causes of action for (1) Breach of Written Agreement; (2)
Goods Sold and Delivered; (3) Reasonable Value; (4) Indebtedness; and (5)
Fraud.  Defendant was personally served
with a copy of the summons and complaint on October 9, 2023. Default was
entered against Defendant on November 13, 2023, and the Doe defendants were
dismissed on November 17, 2023. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint seeks $78,388.11 in special damages. (See Compl.) Therefore,
Plaintiff does not seek damages that are in excess of what is pled in the
Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the
plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v.
Smith (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1131,
1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is
limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            In support of the request, Plaintiff
has provided the Declaration of Robert Sargenti, attached to which is a copy of
the March 21, 2022 Project Agreement where Defendant agreed to pay $78,388.11 in
exchange for Plaintiff’s architectural and engineering services.  (Sargenti Decl. ¶ 3 and Ex. 1.)  Plaintiff provided these architectural and
engineering services, but Defendant has not paid any part of the
$78,388.11.  (Sargenti Decl. ¶ 4 and Ex.
2.)  
 
            Therefore, the Court finds that
Plaintiff is entitled to the requested $78,388.11 in damages. 
 
B.    Prejudgment Interest
 
            Plaintiff
requests prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,866.95, calculated as 10%
annual interest rate on the principal balance of $78,388.11 for the 506 days
from June 22, 2022 to November 10, 2023. 
Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to the requested prejudgment interest
in the amount of $10,866.95.
 
C.    Attorneys’ Fees and Costs
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs to a prevailing party under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the recovery of attorneys’ fees
when authorized by contract, statute, or law. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 provides
“[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the
measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to
the agreement, express or implied, of the parties [….]”  Similarly, Civil Code section 1717 provides
“[i]n any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that
attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be
awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party
who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she
is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.” 
(Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)
 
The Code of Civil Procedure defines the “prevailing party” as follows:

 
[T]he party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief
and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
            
            The Sargenti declaration
indicates, “In accordance with the Agreement, Defendant is liable for all costs
and disbursements, including attorney’s fees incurred by Plaintiff in the
enforcement of the Agreement.”  (Sargenti
Decl. ¶ 6.)  However, Plaintiff
does not identify what specific portion of the Agreement entitles Plaintiff to
recover attorneys’ fees, and upon the Court’s review of the Agreement, there is
no attorneys’ fees provision warranting an award of such fees.  Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiff’s
request for attorneys’ fees. 
 
            Plaintiff also requests $516.50 in costs composed of $435 in filing fees and $81.50 in process server fees. (CIV-100.) Plaintiff’s
request for costs is granted as Plaintiff is the prevailing party in this
action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff has
only shown entitlement to judgment in the amount of $89,771.56, composed of $78,388.11
in special damages, $10,866.95 in prejudgment interest, and $516.50 in costs.  
 
            Accordingly, the Court
will enter the Judgment as indicated.
