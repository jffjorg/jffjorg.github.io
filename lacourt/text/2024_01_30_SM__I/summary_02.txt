Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the papers and is considering a motion to seal confidential information from a complaint. The plaintiff has filed a third amended complaint and is seeking to file a redacted version in the public domain, while keeping the unredacted version under seal. The defendant objects, arguing that much of the information is already in the public domain and is not actually confidential. The judge has reviewed the redactions and has identified certain paragraphs that contain confidential medical information about Spacey, including allegations based on his medical records. The judge has also identified paragraphs that are not confidential. The judge will discuss the motion with the parties and make a final ruling.
