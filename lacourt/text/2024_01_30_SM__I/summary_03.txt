And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrers filed by the insurance company are sustained in part and overruled in part. The plaintiffs have filed a breach of insurance contract case against the carrier, alleging that they had a policy that covered the period from February 13, 2023 to February 14, 2024, and that an incident occurred during that period that was allegedly covered by the policy. However, the carrier discontinued the automatic renewal program without notice, and the policy lapsed. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action, which are for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, respectively, finding that the plaintiffs have not alleged facts that would give rise to a reasonable inference of scienter. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, finding that the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to support a claim of negligent misrepresentation. However, the judge has overruled the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, which is for declaratory relief, finding that there is an actual controversy over whether the policy is (or was) in force. The judge has given the plaintiffs 30 days' leave to amend the complaint.
