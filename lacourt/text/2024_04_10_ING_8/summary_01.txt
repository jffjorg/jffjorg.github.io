The tentative ruling is regarding a Motion for Attorneys' Fees filed by Defendant Danli Lai, who seeks to recover $36,084 in fees for prevailing on his Motion for Summary Judgment. The defendant argues that he is entitled to attorneys' fees as a prevailing party, while the plaintiffs argue that the defendant's alleged refusal to mediate is a bar to his recovery of fees.

The Court notes that the Residential Purchase Agreement (RPA) requires a party who refuses to participate in mediation to be barred from recovering attorneys' fees.
