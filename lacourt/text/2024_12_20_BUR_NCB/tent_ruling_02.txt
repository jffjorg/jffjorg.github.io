  order RE:
DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES
  (SET TWO)
 



BACKGROUND 
The operative first amended complaint
(“FAC”), filed April 18, 2023, alleges a single cause of action for negligence
arising from a car accident that occurred in Studio City on May 26, 2022.
Plaintiff Camille Johnson (“Plaintiff”) names defendants Diana Hertz and her
insurer, State Farm Insurance Company (together “Defendants”).
On November 5, 2024, Defendants filed a
motion to compel responses to their Special Interrogatories (Set Two).
Plaintiff filed no opposition, and Defendants no reply.
DISCUSSION
                                                                                              
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed
fails to serve a timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories
are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party
propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to
the interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)-(b).)  
Defendants’
counsel’s undisputed declaration demonstrates Defendants propounded the subject
interrogatories on Plaintiff on September 16, 2024, and Plaintiff did not serve
responses before this motion was filed. (Stevens Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendants are
entitled to the relief they seek.
“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under [section 2023.010 et seq.] against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel [initial
responses] ... unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c) [interrogatories],
2031.300(c) [requests for production]; 2033.280(c) [requests for admission].)
Plaintiff, having filed no opposition,
demonstrates no reason why sanctions should not be imposed. Defendants’ counsel
requests a reasonable $750.00 in fees and costs. The amount is awarded in full.
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
Defendants’ motion to compel responses to
special interrogatories (set two) and request for sanctions is granted.
Plaintiff is ordered to provide full,
Code-compliant responses, without objections, within thirty (30) days of this
order.
Plaintiff is ordered to pay $750.00 in
sanctions to Defendants and/or their attorney of record within thirty (30)
days.
Defendants shall provide notice of this
order.
