Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Defendant Omar Loera's unopposed motion to compel Plaintiff Naomi Villalobos' deposition. The court finds that Plaintiff failed to appear for deposition despite Defendant's attempts to meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel. As a result, the court awards Defendant $2,632.85 in monetary sanctions for the cost of hiring a court reporter, filing and e-service fees, and attorney's fees. The court also notes that the estimated time spent drafting the motion and preparing a reply is excessive and reduces the award accordingly.
