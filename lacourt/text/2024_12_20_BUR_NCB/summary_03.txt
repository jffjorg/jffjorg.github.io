Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Kurt Zimmerman to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) in a case involving Plaintiff Hani Mammo and his allegations against ABA Law Group and its attorneys. The demurrer challenges the second and third causes of action for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, respectively.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action without leave to amend, finding that Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to support a cause of action for breach of oral contract. The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action with leave to amend, finding that Plaintiff's allegations of breach of fiduciary duty are too general and do not provide sufficient detail about the specific actions of Defendant Zimmerman that allegedly breached his fiduciary duty.

The judge has cautioned Plaintiff that this may be the final opportunity to amend the cause of action against Defendant Zimmerman. The judge has also ordered Defendant to provide notice of this order.
