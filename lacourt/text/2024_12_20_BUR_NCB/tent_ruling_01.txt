  order RE:
Motion to compel deposition



 
BACKGROUND

A.    Allegations
of Complaint
Plaintiff Noemi
Villalobos (“Plaintiff”) alleges that she is a tenant of residential property
located at 1236 N. Orchard Dr., Burbank, CA 91506. She alleges that she took
possession in 2012. She alleges that prior to, but specifically since March 30,
2019, she was paying money to Defendant for use of the property until she
vacated the property in March 2022. Plaintiff alleges Defendant Oasis Builders
in the alter alias of Defendant Omar Loera (“Loera”) and the manager of the
property. Loera is alleged to be the legal owner of the property.
The Third
Amended Complaint (“TAC”), filed May 30, 2023, alleges five causes of action
against Defendants Omar Loera, Oasis Builders, and Does 1 through 50 for (1)
tortious breach of warranty of habitability, (2) breach of covenant of quiet
enjoyment, (3) nuisance, (4) negligence, and (5) intentional interference with
estate (Civ. Code § 789.3). 
B.     Relevant
Background
On August 18,
2023, the Court sustained without leave to amend Defendants’ demurrer to
Plaintiff’s second cause of action in the TAC. Plaintiff has not yet filed a
Fourth Amended Complaint.
On September 19,
2023, default was entered as to Defendant Oasis Builders.
C.     Motion
on Calendar
            On
November 12, 2024, Loera filed a motion to compel Plaintiff to attend her
deposition pursuant to CCP § 2025.450.
            The
motion is unopposed.
LEGAL STANDARD
            “If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director,
managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an
organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.” (CCP § 2025.450(a).)
            Such
motion to compel deposition must meet the following requirements: (1) “[t]he
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice[]”; and (2) “[t]he motion
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040,
or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance.” (CCP § 2025.450(b).)
            If
a motion to compel deposition is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP §
2025.450(g)(1).)
DISCUSSION                                                                                               
Here,
Defendant’s counsel states that, after not receiving any responses to his
attempted communication with Plaintiff’s counsel to set a date for Plaintiff’s
deposition, on October 6, 2024, he served Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel
with a notice of deposition scheduled for October 15, 2024. (Quan Decl., ¶ 3;
Exh. A.) On October 11, 2024, Defendant’s counsel inquired whether the noticed
deposition of Plaintiff would take place on October 15, 2024, and Plaintiff’s
counsel stated that he would be unavailable because of a trial scheduled for
October 14, 2024. (Id., ¶ 4; Exh. B.) On October 16, 2024, after
receiving confirmation from Plaintiff’s counsel that Plaintiff could be
available on October 25, 2024, Defendant’s counsel served Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel an amended notice of deposition for October 25,
2024—Plaintiff’s counsel never served any objections to this amended notice. (Id.,
¶ 5-6; Exh. C.) 
Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel failed to appear on the noticed deposition date even though
the court reporter, Sheba Ivie, had already set up her equipment and Defendant
and Defendant’s counsel were all waiting at the location. (Quan Decl., ¶ 7.)
After waiting at the location, Defendant’s counsel called the office of
Plaintiff’s counsel, and the person who answered the phone informed Defendant’s
counsel that Plaintiff’s counsel was currently in trial and the replacement
attorney had a medical emergency. (Ibid.) Defendant’s counsel requested
the court reporter to take a Certificate of Non-Appearance. (Id., ¶ 8.)
The declaration
of Defendant’s counsel is sufficient to demonstrate that Plaintiff failed to
proceed with the duly noticed deposition and that Defendant’s counsel attempted
to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the nonappearance. (CCP
§§ 2025.450(a), (b)(2).) Accordingly, Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel
the deposition of Plaintiff is GRANTED.
Defendant claims
that monetary sanctions are warranted in the total amount of $4,051.00 based on
Plaintiff’s failure to appear, including $1,175.85 in damages for the cost of
hiring the court reporter, $75 in filing and e-service fees, and $2,800.15 in
attorney’s fees. Defendant’s counsel states that their normal hourly rate is
$350/hour, and that they spent one (1) hour attending Plaintiff’s deposition on
October 25, 2024, four (4) hours drafting the instant motion to compel, and anticipated
spending two (2) hours drafting a reply to Plaintiff’s opposition, and one (1)
hour to attend the hearing.
Here, the court
notes that the $1,175.85 in damages for the cost of hiring the court reporter
and $75 in filing and e-service fees are reasonable based on Plaintiff’s
failure to appear. 
Further, the
Court notes that attorney’s fees are warranted based on Plaintiff’s failure to
appear necessitating the filing of the instant motion. However, the estimated
time to review the opposition and prepare a reply is inapplicable as the motion
is unopposed. Further, the four (4) hours to draft the instant motion is
excessive given the simplicity of the instant motion. Accordingly, the Court
awards one (1) hour for attending Plaintiff’s deposition, two (2) hours to
draft the instant motion, and one (1) hour to attend the hearing.
In all, the
Court awards $2,632.85 in monetary sanctions.
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is granted. And Defendant’s request for
sanctions is granted in the reduced amount of $2,632.85.
Defendant shall provide notice of
this order.
