  order RE:
MoTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
BACKGROUND

A.    Allegations
of Complaint
On June 3, 2024,
Plaintiff Erik De La Rosa (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action arising
out of an injury Plaintiff sustained on June 10, 2022 while working on the
premises of Defendants’ Dale Gibson and Heather Gibson (collectively
“Defendants”). Plaintiff alleges he was working within the attic of the subject
premises when the defective, cracked, broken, and/or deteriorated flooring
collapsed, causing him to fall and endure severe injury and pain. 
The complaint,
filed on June 3, 2024, alleges two causes of action for (1) general negligence;
and (2) premises liability. 
B.     Relevant
Background 
On October 31,
2024, the Court issued a minute order, noting there was no proof of service of
the Summons and Complaint filed. Counsel for plaintiff represented they were
still attempting to serve defendant with the Summons and Complaint. Counsel for
plaintiff requested that hearing be continued so that Case Management
Conference was continued to March 6, 2025, and remains on calendar for said
date. Trial in this action is not yet set.
C.     Motion(s)
on Calendar
            On
November 20, 2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel, Mary Guirguis, filed the instant Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel, as well as the Declaration of Mary Guirguis (MC-052)
and Proposed Order (MC-053). There is no opposition. 
             
DISCUSSION                                                                                               
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The determination whether to
grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion
of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66
Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) 
An application to be relieved as counsel
must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion)
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the
action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
Counsel Guirguis
states there has been a “breakdown in the communication between Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel. Plaintiff’s counsel is unable to locate/make contact with
client.” (See MC-052.) Counsel Guirguis further declares that the client
was served by mail at the client’s last known address which the attorney has
been unable to confirm the address is current after making the following
efforts: (a) mailing the motion papers to client’s last known address, return
receipt requested; (b) calling the client’s last known telephone number or
numbers; and (d) conducting a search “TLO search to locate current address.
Confirmed with Plaintiff’s family members.” (MC-052, ¶3(b)(2).) Thus,
Plaintiff’s Counsel concludes she is unable to locate or make contact with
client after diligent efforts to do so. 
The Court finds
that Counsel Guirguis has properly moved to be relieved as counsel and has
established both procedural and substantive requirements in filing the required
forms (MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053) and setting forth a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship. The next hearing is a case management conference
on March 6, 2025, which leaves sufficient time for Plaintiff to obtain new
counsel if he wishes to. Thus, the Court exercises its discretion to grant the
instant motion.
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Counsel
Guirguis’ Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.
MOVING PARTY
shall
provide notice of this order.
