The court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Arthur Wutong Shi's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories (Set Two) in a case involving sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence. The court finds that the motion is timely and that Plaintiff Jane Doe's responses to the interrogatories are incomplete. The court orders Plaintiff to provide complete responses to the interrogatories within 30 days. The court also notes that Defendant's oversight in not attaching the disputed discovery to his motion is not a basis for denying the motion. Sanctions are denied.
