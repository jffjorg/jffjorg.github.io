```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied Defendant's motion to enforce the levy without prejudice. The motion seeks to recover the judgment from Third-Party because it failed to comply with the levy. However, the court finds that the Defendant has not established an essential predicate fact, and the motion seeking recovery from Third Party of the entire judgment against Plaintiff fails. The court concludes that the Defendant may enforce Third-Party's liability under Code of Civil Procedure section 701.020 in an examination proceeding or by a separate creditor's suit.
