  Case Number:  20STCV19549    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  74 Joanne Capriotto, et al. v. Robinson
Helicopter Company Incorporated, et al.
 
Harco National Insurance Company’s
Motion to Consolidate Cases.
 
The
court considered the moving papers. No opposition was timely filed. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b) [“All papers opposing a motion . . . shall be filed
with the court and a copy served on each party at least nine court days . . . before
the hearing.”].)
BACKGROUND 
            The actions at issue all arise from a helicopter
accident.
            On May 20, 2020, Joanne Capriotto
and others filed a complaint against Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc. (Joanne
Capriotto, et al. v. Robinson Helicopter, Inc., Los Angeles Superior Court,
Case No. 20STCV19549).
            On
May 21, 2020, Jessica R. Croce and others filed a complaint against Robinson
Helicopter Company, Inc. (Jessica R. Croce, et al. v. Robinson Helicopter
Company, Inc., Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. 20STCV19346).
            On
January 5, 2023, Harco National Insurance Company (Harco) filed a complaint
against Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc. (Harco National Insurance Company
v. Robinson Helicopter Company, et al., Los Angeles Superior Court, Case
No. 23TRCV00032).
            On
March 29, 2024, Harco filed this motion to consolidate the actions.
LEGAL STANDARD 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 1048 grants discretion to trial courts to
consolidate actions involving common questions of law or fact. “Consolidation
is not a matter of right; it rests solely within the sound discretion of the
trial judge . . .” (Fisher v. Nash Bldg. Co. (1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 397,
402.) There are two types of consolidation under section 1048: “a consolidation
for purposes of trial only, where the two actions remain otherwise separate;
and a complete consolidation or consolidation for all purposes, where the two
actions are merged into a single proceeding under one case number and result in
only one verdict or set of findings and one judgment.” (Hamilton v. Asbestos
Corp. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147.)
DISCUSSION
            With this motion, Harco seeks to
consolidate Harco National Insurance Company v. Robinson Helicopter Company,
et al., Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. 23TRCV00032 with Jessica R.
Croce, et al. v. Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc., Los Angeles Superior
Court, Case No. 20STCV19346 and Joanne Capriotto, et al. v. Robinson
Helicopter, Inc., Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. 20STCV19549. 
            The
court notes that Harco has not filed the notice of motion in each case sought
to be consolidated. (California Rules of Court, rule 3.350, subd. (a)(1)(C).)
Nor has Harco filed a proposed order in each case sought to be consolidated.
(California Rules of Court, rule 3.350, subd. (c).) However, the proof of
service indicates Harco has served the motion on the counsel of all affected
parties and all three cases are assigned to this department.
            The
court finds consolidation under Code of Civil Procedure section 1048,
subdivision (a), is proper. First, all three cases are pending in this
department. Second, the cases involve a common question of fact: namely, a
helicopter accident on January 9, 2020. Third, the cases involve common
questions of law: all three complaints allege negligence and strict liability
against Robinson Helicopter Company. Fourth, consolidation will be convenient
for parties, witness, and counsel in the actions. Fifth, consolidation will
avoid the risk of inconsistent rulings. And sixth, none of the parties has
cited any potential prejudice in a timely opposition. 
CONCLUSION
              The court grants Harco National
Insurance Company’s motion to consolidate Harco National Insurance Company
v. Robinson Helicopter Company, et al., Los Angeles Superior Court, Case
No. 23TRCV00032, Jessica R. Croce, et al. v. Robinson Helicopter Company,
Inc., Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. 20STCV19346, and Joanne
Capriotto, et al. v. Robinson Helicopter, Inc., Los Angeles Superior Court,
Case No. 20STCV19549. 
            The
court will sign Harco’s proposed order filed on March 29, 2024.
            Harco
National Insurance Company shall give notice.
