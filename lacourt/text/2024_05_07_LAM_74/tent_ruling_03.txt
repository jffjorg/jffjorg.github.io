 Case Number:  23STCV19035    Hearing Date:   May 7, 2024    Dept:  74 Osman I.
Elbiali v. 612 Vermont Investment Fund, LLC, et al.
Defendant’s Motion to Enforce Levy
and Request for Sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND 
            On
December 18, 2017, Plaintiff Osman I. Elbiali (Plaintiff) filed a complaint
against Defendant 612 Vermont Investment Fund, LLC (Defendant). 
            On
July 10, 2018, the court granted Defendant’s special motion to strike. 
            On
September 26, 2019, the court granted Defendant’s request for attorney’s fees
and costs. Accordingly, on October 21, 2019, the court ordered Plaintiff to pay
Defendant $25,000 in attorney’s fees and costs. 
            On
April 18, 2022, Defendant issued a writ of execution.
            On
June 15, 2022, a levy on all wages and monies due was issued against
Third-Party Sherif Osmon, Inc. (dba Maged Chevron) (Third-Party). 
            Third-Party
did not respond or comply with the levy.
            On
September 14, 2023, Defendant filed this motion to enforce the levy.
¿¿DISCUSSION  
            With
this motion, Defendant seeks to recover the judgment from Third-Party because
it failed to comply with the levy. Defendant also requests attorneys’ fees and
costs incurred in bringing this motion. In support, Defendant cites Code of
Civil Procedure section 701.020. 
            When
a levy is made by service of the writ of execution and a notice of levy on a
third-party, and that person fails to deliver the levied property to the
levying officer without good cause, the third-party is liable to the judgment
creditor for the lesser of either (1) the value of the judgment
debtor’s interest in the property or the amount of payments required to be
made, or (2) the amount required to satisfy the judgment under
which the levy is made. (Code Civ. Proc., § 701.020, subd. (a).)
Defendant’s
motion does not show that the amount Defendant seeks – the entire judgment – is
less than the amount Third Party owes Plaintiff. Thus, Defendant’s motion
seeking recovery from Third Party of the entire judgment against
Plaintiff fails because Defendant has not established an essential predicate
fact. Defendant’s motion is not the proper vehicle for enforcing Third-Party’s
liability. Defendant may enforce Third-Party’s liability under Code of Civil
Procedure section 701.020 in an examination proceeding or by a separate
creditor’s suit. (Wanke, Indus., Commercial, Residential, Inc. v. AV Builder
Corp. (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 466, 473.) 
CONCLUSION 
The
court denies Defendant’s motion to enforce levy without prejudice.
Defendant
shall give notice.
