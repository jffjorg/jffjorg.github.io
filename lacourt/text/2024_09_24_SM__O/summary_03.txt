```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the defendants' motion to disqualify the plaintiff's counsel. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff's counsel had engaged in ethical violations, but failed to meet their burden of proof. The plaintiff had declared that it was their "strong preference" to be represented by their current counsel, and the judge found that the defendants had not shown a "genuine likelihood" that the alleged violations would affect the outcome of the proceedings. The judge also noted that disqualification of counsel is a prophylactic remedy designed to mitigate unfair advantage, and that the defendants had not met the standard for disqualification.
