Summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Namecheap, Inc. v. Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN had filed a demurrer to Namecheap's petition to confirm an arbitration award, arguing that the petition seeks additional requirements on ICANN that go beyond the scope of the arbitration award. The Judge has overruled ICANN's demurrer, finding that the petition states a proper petition claim for relief under CCP §§ 1286.2 and 1286.4. The Judge also noted that the court assumes the truth of the complaint's properly pleaded or implied factual allegations and that a demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged. The case will proceed with the petition to confirm the arbitration award.
