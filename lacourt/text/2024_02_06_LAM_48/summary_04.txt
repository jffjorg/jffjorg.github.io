And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motions of FMB Development, LLC's counsel, Luna & Glushon APC, to be relieved from their representation. The counsel's declaration states that the clients have failed to pay under their fee agreement and that irreconcilable differences have caused a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. Since no party opposed the motion, the judge has granted it. However, the judge has noted that FMB Development, LLC, as a corporation, cannot represent itself in court and must retain new counsel before further participation in the action. The judge has ordered that the parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling must send an email to the court, and that no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
