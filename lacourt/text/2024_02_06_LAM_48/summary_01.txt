And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the motions to tax costs in this case. The motions were filed by Cross-Complainant Tania Saroyan on January 12, 2024, and the oppositions were filed by Cross-Defendants Samuel Carrasco and Erick Carrasco on January 24, 2024. The sole ground raised in each opposition is that the motions were improperly served two days later than the statutorily required notice period. To allow for proper notice and oppositions on the merits, the motions are continued to April 23, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Cross-Defendants may file amended oppositions and Cross-Complainant may file replies, pursuant to the normal statutory deadlines. The judge has also indicated that parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org indicating their intention to submit. If all parties in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference) is also on calendar.
