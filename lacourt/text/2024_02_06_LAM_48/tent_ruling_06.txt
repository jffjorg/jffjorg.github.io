  CASE NO.: 23STCV16888
 
[REVISED TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION OF HUNTER DODGE’S PMK
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
February 6, 2024



 
On July 19, 2023, Plaintiff Melissa
Bontempt this action against Defendants FCA US LLC and Axis Automotive Group,
LLC dba Hunter Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram Fiat and HW Hunter Ram (“Hunter Dodge”).
On
December 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel the deposition of Hunter
Dodge’s PMK.
If
a party or an officer, director, managing agent, employee of a party, or person
designated as the person most qualified to testify fails to appear for examination
or produce documents, the demanding party may move to compel attendance, testimony,
and production.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (a).)
Plaintiff’s
motion does not challenge the propriety of Hunter Dodge’s objections and topic
limitations.  No separate statement of
issues was filed.  Therefore, the Court
will only determine whether to order the attendance of Hunter Dodge’s PMK at
deposition and will not rule on any objections or topics.
On
August 29, 2023, Plaintiff noticed the deposition of Hunter Dodge’s PMK for
September 22, 2023.  (Saeedian Decl. ¶¶
3-4 & Ex. 1.)  Hunter Dodge did not
respond to Plaintiff’s meet and confer letter, did not file an objection to the
Notice of the Deposition, and did not produce its PMK for deposition on
September 22, 2023.  (Saeedian Decl. ¶
5.)
On
September 29, 2023, Plaintiff sent another meet and confer letter, but Hunter
Dodge has not responded with its PMK’s availability.  (Saeedian Decl. ¶ 6.)  The Court is guessing that Plaintiff
subscribes to the common belief that depositions cannot be noticed until after
a date is agreed on by the parties and that to do otherwise is to
“unilaterally” set the deposition which is improper.  It is not improper to “unilaterally” pick a
date.
The
unopposed motion is GRANTED.  Hunter
Dodge is ordered to produce its PMK for deposition within 30 days.  The Court makes no further findings or orders
about the scope of the deposition.
The
request for sanctions is granted.  Hunter
Dodge’s counsel is ordered to pay sanctions of $2,846.75 to Plaintiff within 30
days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
