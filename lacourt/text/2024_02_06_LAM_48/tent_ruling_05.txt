  CASE NO.: 23STCP02068
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
February 6, 2024



 
Luna
& Glushon APC, counsel of record for Defendants FMB Development LLC, FMB Consulting
LLC, and Ilan Kenig, seeks to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel’s declaration states that the clients
have failed to pay under the parties’ fee agreement, and irreconcilable differences
have manifested to a degree that there has been a complete breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship.  No party opposed the motions.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motions
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  This matter has already been ordered to arbitration
with only Status Conferences scheduled in this Court, so there is no prejudice to
Defendants.
The
proposed orders do not include Defendants’ current or last known phone numbers.  Counsel must provide this information at the hearing.
Subject
to the provision of Defendants’ phone numbers, the unopposed motions to be relieved
are GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of service showing service of the
signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on FMB Development LLC, FMB Consulting
LLC, Ilan Kenig, and all parties who have appeared.
However,
“a corporation cannot represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona
or through an officer or agent who is not an attorney.”  (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Control Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.)  FMB Development LLC and FMB Consulting LLC must
retain new counsel before further participation in this action.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
