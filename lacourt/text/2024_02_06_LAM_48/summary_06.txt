And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Hunter Dodge's PMK. The plaintiff filed the motion on December 11, 2023, and Hunter Dodge did not respond to the meet and confer letter or produce the PMK for deposition. The court finds that Hunter Dodge's failure to respond and produce the PMK is unreasonable and orders them to produce the PMK for deposition within 30 days. Additionally, the court grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions and orders Hunter Dodge's counsel to pay $2,846.75 to the plaintiff within 30 days. The court notes that it is not improper to unilaterally pick a date for a deposition and that Hunter Dodge's failure to respond and produce the PMK is a violation of the court's rules and orders.
