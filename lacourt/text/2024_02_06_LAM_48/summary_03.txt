And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled on the demurrers and motions to strike filed by the defendants in response to the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The demurrers are sustained with 30 days' leave to amend, as the allegations of fraudulent inducement lack the required particularity. The motions to strike are denied as moot, as they are duplicative of the demurrers. The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend its pleadings to address the deficiencies identified.
