Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which argued that the complaint was deficient due to the lack of a personal representative or successor-in-interest. The judge found that the complaint alleged sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for general negligence and premises liability against Defendant. The judge noted that a pending action does not abate by the death of a party, and that Plaintiff's counsel has located the next of kin as the successor in interest. The judge expects Plaintiff's counsel to file a motion to substitute Decedent with the successor in interest in a timely manner, and warned that failure to do so may result in dismissal of the action. The judge set a hearing to consider the substitution of the successor in interest and ordered Defendant to give notice.

## English Summary: 

The judge has denied Defendant's motion to dismiss the case. The Defendant argued that the case should be dismissed because the Plaintiff, Patrick Croghan, passed away before the case was resolved, and no personal representative has been appointed to continue the lawsuit. 

The Judge ruled that the case can proceed without a personal representative for now. However, the Judge expects Plaintiff's lawyer to find a successor in interest (someone who can legally continue the case on behalf of the deceased) and file a motion to replace the deceased Plaintiff with that successor. If the lawyer does not do this within a reasonable time, the case could be dismissed.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant argued that the complaint is deficient because there is no personal representative or successor-in-interest appointed for the decedent, Patrick Croghan. However, the judge found that the complaint states sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for general negligence and premises liability against the defendant. The judge also noted that the defendant's contention regarding the decedent's former spouse's potential to be the personal representative or successor-in-interest is outside the scope of a judgment on the pleadings.

The judge has set an order to show cause (OSC) for the plaintiff's counsel to file a motion to substitute the decedent with the successor in interest. The plaintiff's counsel must file the motion in a timely manner, or risk the court dismissing the action. The judge has also cautioned the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and to submit their views on the tentative ruling by email to the court.
