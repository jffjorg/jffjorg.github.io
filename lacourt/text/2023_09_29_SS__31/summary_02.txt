The first motion is to compel discovery responses, which were propounded on March 16, 2023, and were due on April 15, 2023. Although the court granted two extensions to the plaintiffs, they failed to respond to the discovery requests. The judge grants the motion to compel discovery responses and orders the plaintiffs to serve verified responses without objections within 20 days.

The second motion is to compel a statement of damages, which was requested by defendant Hartwick on a timely basis. The plaintiffs failed to serve their statement of damages, and the judge grants the motion and orders the plaintiffs to serve their statement of damages within 20 days.

The third motion is for sanctions, which were sought by defendant Hartwick due to the plaintiffs' failure to respond to discovery requests and to serve their statement of damages. The judge imposes sanctions on the plaintiffs and their counsel, jointly and severally, in the amount of $460, which includes attorney's fees and the motion filing fee. The judge also orders the plaintiffs and their counsel to pay an additional $460 in sanctions.

The judge notes that defendant Hartwick filed a single motion that should have been four separate motions, and the court imposes an additional fee for the filing of the motion. The judge orders defendant Hartwick to pay three additional filing fees. The hearing date is set for September 29, 2023, and parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
