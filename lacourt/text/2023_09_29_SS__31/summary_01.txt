The Judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's request for default judgment against Defendant for several reasons. Firstly, Plaintiff served a Statement of Damages to Defendant on 1/16/2023, but default was entered on 6/23/2021. Plaintiff must serve Defendant with a Statement of Damages before default is entered. Secondly, Plaintiff's CIV-100 was not signed by counsel, and Plaintiff's declaration in Spanish was not certified under oath by a qualified interpreter.

Plaintiff's Request for Court Judgment calls for special damages of $20,858.65, but Plaintiff does not provide a clear explanation of what the remaining $7,489.65 is for. Plaintiff must clarify the amount requested for future medical expenses and provide competent evidence supporting any amount requested.

Plaintiff is requesting general damages of $500,000, but must submit competent evidence explaining and supporting the request. Plaintiff is given a deadline to submit a new entry of default, and failure to do so may result in sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
