And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the request for default judgment submitted by plaintiff Jose Martin Arenas against defendant Jose Montoya dba A Imports & Domestic Auto Wrecking. The court has denied the request for the following reasons: the underlying default is void because it was entered without a Statement of Damages, which was served to the defendant on January 16, 2023. The court has also noted several defects in the plaintiff's request for default judgment, including the lack of a signature on the CIV-100 form, an un-certified English translation of the plaintiff's declaration, and insufficient evidence to support the plaintiff's claims for special and general damages. The court has ordered the plaintiff to obtain a new entry of default and submit a new default package, which must cure the defects noted above. If the plaintiff fails to do so, the court may impose sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
