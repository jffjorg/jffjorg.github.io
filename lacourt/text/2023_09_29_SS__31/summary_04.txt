And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of Plaintiff Alicia Huitron's attorney, Adina A. Ostoia, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which has made it impossible for Counsel to obtain Plaintiff's signature on a substitution of attorney. The judge orders Counsel to give notice of the ruling. The ruling is effective upon filing proof of service of the final order. There is no trial date set, so Plaintiff has sufficient time to seek new counsel. The judge advises the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement before the hearing date. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number, including the hearing date and time, Counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.
