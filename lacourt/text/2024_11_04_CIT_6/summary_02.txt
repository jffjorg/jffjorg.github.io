Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Carlos Gaspar v. Ford Motor Company. The case involves a lemon law dispute, and the Court has ruled on two motions: one to compel further responses to written discovery requests, and one to compel further responses to special interrogatories.

The Court has denied the motion to compel further responses as to Request Number 8, finding that the request is overly broad and that the Court's access to the Workshop Manual does not permit a simple "print all" type of production. The Court has also granted the motion in part as to Request Numbers 10 through 14, 27, and 28, but limited to the same year, make and model vehicles sold in California, with the same alleged defects.

The Court has granted Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses as to Special Interrogatories Numbers 8, 12, 13, 18, 20, 21, and 22, finding that the requests are not overly broad and that the objections based on privilege are unavailing. The Court has denied the motion as to Special Interrogatories Numbers 2, 7, 19, and 26, finding that the requests are overly broad and that the objections based on privilege are valid.

The Court has ordered Plaintiff to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
