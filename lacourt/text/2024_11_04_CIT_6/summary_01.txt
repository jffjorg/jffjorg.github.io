And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Imran Haddish v. Scott Warmuth, a Professional Corporation dba Law Offices of Scott Warmuth, et al. The case involves a legal malpractice claim brought by Haddish against Warmuth and others. Warmuth has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against him. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the complaint alleges facts that could support an ostensible agency relationship between Warmuth and the other defendants, and that Warmuth is liable for the acts of the other defendants. The judge also found that the complaint alleges facts that support claims of breach of contract and professional negligence. The judge's ruling is subject to change after further briefing and argument.
