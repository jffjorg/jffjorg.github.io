STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for employment discrimination, harassment, retaliation,
and defamation. Plaintiff alleges that he was not selected for the position of
Dean of the College of Ethnic Studies at California State University Los
Angeles. Plaintiff attributes this denial to alleged statements by Defendant
Melina Abdullah which he contends were defamatory.
 
Defendant Board of Trustees of
California State University moves for an award of attorney’s fees and costs
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c). 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Board of Trustees of the
California State University’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant
is awarded attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $76,100.74,
representing $75,688 in attorney’s fees and $412.74 in costs. 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant Board of Trustees of
California State University moves for an award of attorney’s fees and costs
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c). 
 
Entitlement to Fees
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16(c) entitles a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike,
otherwise known as an anti-SLAPP motion, to recover their attorney’s fees and
costs. The amount of attorneys’ fees awarded must be reasonable. (See, e.g., Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.) The prevailing defendant may only
recover fees and costs incurred in connection with the motion to strike. (Lafayette
Morehouse, inc. v. Chronical Publishing Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1379,
1383.) This limitation nevertheless permits recovery of consequential fees,
such as those incurred litigating the fee award (Ketchum v. Moses, supra, 24
Cal.4th at 1141) and on appeal. (Evans v. Unknow (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th
1490, 1499-1500 [Section 425.16(c) permits recovery of appellate fees because
they are not expressly precluded by the statutory language].) Examples of
matters which are excluded from a fee award under this provision include, inter
alia, fees for “attacking service of process, preparing and revising an
answer to the complaint” and “obtaining the docket at the inception of the
case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1325.) 
 
On September 6, 2024, the Court granted
Defendant’s special motion to strike the fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of
action alleged in the Complaint. (September 6, 2024 Minute Order.) Defendant is
therefore entitled to an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs by the
express language of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c). 
 
Reasonableness of Fees
 
            Although Defendant
moves for a total award of $88,443.47 in fees and costs, comprised of a claimed
$79,957.97 in fees and costs through the filing of the motion, plus $8,485.50
in fees and costs associated with the reply and the hearing, closer examination
of the papers indicates that Defendant’s arithmetic is incorrect. Specifically,
Defendant appears to have calculated $75,545.23 in attorney’s fees and $412.74
in costs through the filing of the instant motion but totals that value
incorrectly to $79,957.97. (See Declaration of Kevin L. Vick ISO Mot. ¶ 9.)
Moreover, close reading of the billing records provided by Defendant reveals
that the total fees incurred through the initial filing are $75,172.50,
not either amount referenced above. Applying the proper calculations, Defendant
is seeking an award of $75,172.50 in attorney’s fees and $412.74 in
costs incurred up through the filing of the motion, plus $7,495.50 in fees
associated with the reply, plus $990 in anticipated fees, for a total of $84,070.74
in requested fees and costs. (Supplemental Declaration of Kevin L. Vick ISO
Reply ¶ 2.) 
 
Reasonable
attorney fees are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to the “lodestar”
method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134
Cal.App.3d 999, 1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Ibid.)
In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled to consider the
“fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for
similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the
fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
 
The Court has broad discretion in determining the
amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned
absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or
necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)  The
Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will
suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258,
274-275.) 
 
            Here,
Defendant requests a total award of $84,443.47 in requested fees and costs. The
bulk of these fees, totaling $75,172.50, not $75,545.23 nor $79,957.97
as claimed by Defendant, are based on 7.5 hours of paralegal time at $195 per
hour, 87.3 hours of attorney time at $355 per hour, 69.9 hours of attorney time
at $495 per hour, and a further 16.4 hours of attorney time by a separate
lawyer at the same $495 per hour rate incurred through the filing of this
motion. (See Vick Decl. Exh. 2.) Defendant requests an additional $7,495.50 in
fees actually incurred in connection with the reply, based on 14.7 additional
hours of attorney time at $355 per hour, plus 4.6 hours of attorney time at
$495 per hour. (Supp. Vick Decl. Exh. 4.) Defendant further requests $990 in
anticipated fees, reflecting 2 hours of attorney time at the $495 hourly rate.
(Supp Vick Decl. ¶ 2.) Finally, Defendant requests $412.74 in costs. (See Vick
Decl. Exh. 2.)
 
            Defendant
has provided itemized billing records indicating the attorney or paralegal who
performed each task, the date of the work, and the hours, rate, and amount
billed, with relatively detailed descriptions of each task. (Vick Decl. Exh.
2., Supp Vick Decl. Exh. 4.) Attorney Kevin Vick testifies to his own
experience and $495 hourly rate, as well as that of his attorney colleagues
Jean-Paul Jassy (also $495 per hour), Nicholas Hartmann ($355 per hour) and
paralegal Jason Kang ($195 per hour.) (Vick Decl. ¶¶ 4-7.) The records show
that research and drafting tasks were generally, but not always, assigned to
more junior attorneys—i.e., Attorney Hartmann—charging lower rates, while
reserving strategic and editing pursuits and client communication to more
senior attorneys. Although Attorney Vick appears to have performed significant
research and drafting work during the initial stages of preparing the Special
Motion to Strike in May 2024, Attorney Hartmann increasingly took on those
tasks as the case proceeded. (Vick Decl. Exh. 2; see also Supp Vick Decl. Exh.
4.) Defendant’s billing records therefore demonstrate that counsel exercised billing
judgment in the apportionment of attorney time.
 
            Plaintiff argues
that the fees sought by Defendant are unreasonable because they are excessive
or contain duplicative work and block billing, with specific identification of
billing entries which he contends are improper. The Court first notes that
Defendant seeks fees for activities beyond those necessary to support its
anti-SLAPP motion, by including in its billing records various communications
about Defendant Abdullah’s joinder in Defendant’s motion as well as defense
counsel’s review of Abdullah’s cross-complaint and discussions about Abdullah’s
potential response to the complaint. To account for these non-compensable
hours, the Court reduces the fee award by $990 to cover 2 hours of work at the
$495 rate. The Court has conducted its own review of defense counsel’s billing
records and concludes that, while there is no improper block billing, the
records reflect some excessive and duplicative work, including multiple reviews
and revisions by several attorneys of the moving and reply papers and input by
three attorneys on the six-page opposition to the ex parte application. The
Court, thus, reduces the remaining fees sought in the moving papers by $5,000
to trim from the award any unnecessary or unjustified fees. The Court also shaves
$990 from the fees sought in drafting the reply brief in support of this fee
motion based on its view that expending 18 hours on a simple ten-page reply is
excessive.  Thus, the Court finds that
Defendant is entitled to recover reasonable fees in the total amount of $75,688,
plus costs of $412.74.
 
Plaintiff also asserts, without explanation or evidence, that
the work undertaken by Defendant’s counsel to prepare the Special Motion to
Strike would have been necessary to litigate the remaining claims. Mere
assertions such as this are not persuasive, nor are Plaintiff’s wholly
irrelevant contentions that Plaintiff is “not an abuser of the legal process”
and “did not intend to drive up fees.” 
 
            Finally, Plaintiff request that the
Court stay enforcement of any fee order until the conclusion of the case,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 918. Although the Court ordinarily
may stay enforcement of any judgment or order under that section, subdivision
(b) prohibits the Court, without consent of the adverse party, from staying
enforcement of an order more than 10 days beyond the last date to appeal that order
if that order would be stayed on appeal only by posting an undertaking. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 918(b).) Fee awards pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16(c) fall within the purview of that subdivision. (Dowling v. Zimmerman
(2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1400, 1432.) Moreover, Plaintiff offers no
explanation or evidence of why good cause exists for such an order beyond a
bare assertion that the fee award “would create undue hardship for Plaintiff.” (Opposition
p.13:12.) 
 
            In sum, Defendant has demonstrated
both its entitlement to fees and costs and the reasonableness of a slightly
reduced award of fees and costs. The Court therefore awards Defendant, the Board
of Trustees of California State University, a total of $76,100.74,
representing $75,688 in attorney’s fees and $412.74 in costs. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly, Defendant
Board of Trustees of the California State University’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant
is awarded attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $76,100.74,
representing $75,688 in attorney’s fees and $412.74 in costs. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
