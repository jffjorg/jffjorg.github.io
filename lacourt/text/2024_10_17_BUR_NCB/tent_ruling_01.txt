 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion to compel further responses    
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiffs
Michael Green, Mia Cordes, Delia Reed, Zarinah Reed, and Jimmie Henry
(“Plaintiffs”) allege that they reside at 6705 Riverton Avenue, North
Hollywood, CA 91606 in various units. 
Michael Green and Mia Cordes reside in Apartment 13, Jimmie Henry
resides in Apartment C1, and Delia Reed and Zarinah Reed reside in Apartment
21.  Defendant Royal Garden Apartments
Inc. (“Defendant”) is alleged to be the owner, agent, and manager of the 6705
Riverton Avenue property.  Plaintiffs
allege that the premises have an infestation of roaches and rodents, lack
adequate gas facilities, and lack smoke detectors.  They allege that the premises are
uninhabitable.  
The complaint, filed March 23, 2023,
alleges causes of action for: (1) breach of warranty of habitability; (2)
breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment; (3) nuisance; (4) negligence (Civ. Code,
§§ 1714(a), 3333); (5) premises liability (negligence per se); (6) unfair
business practice and unfair competition; and (7) IIED.  
On August 16, 2023, Plaintiffs named J.K.
Residential Services, Inc. as Doe 1.  On
August 29, 2024, Plaintiffs named Anza Management Company as Doe 2.  
B.    
Relevant Background re: Discovery 
On August 1, 2024, the Court held an
Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”). 
The Court ordered that each side may have 35 discovery requests and that
no additional discovery requests were permitted without further order of the
Court.  The Court continued the IDC to
August 9, 2024.  
On August 9, 2024,
the Court held another IDC in order to sequence and control discovery in this
matter: 
By
October 1, 2024, each party will serve upon all other parties a disclosure
statement as described in Code of Civil Procedure Section 2016.090(a)(1).
Except
for motions already filed and/or decided interrogatory and request for
admission discovery is stayed. 
Motions
to compel regarding document requests or depositions may be filed. As to
defendants' currently contemplated motions to compel further responses to
requests for production of documents, the time for filing those motions is
stayed by ten days from today's date to give plaintiff's the opportunity to to
[sic] provide supplemental responses.
(August
9, 2024 Minute Order.) 
C.    
Motion on Calendar 
On July 30, 2024, Plaintiff Michael Green
filed a motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Requests for
Admissions, set one (“RFA”).  
On August 23, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition
brief. 
On September 20, 2024, Green filed a reply
brief. 
The matter initially came for hearing on
October 4, 2024 before Judge Suzette Clover. 
The Court briefly heard oral arguments and, at the request of counsel,
continued the hearing to October 17, 2024. 

DISCUSSION 
Green moves to
compel Defendant’s further responses to RFA Nos. 1-39, 41-59, and 61-71.  Green argues that Defendant provided
boilerplate objections/responses to the RFAs at issue and that Defendant’s
response does not comply with CCP § 2033.220. 

            CCP
§ 2033.220 states: 
(a) Each answer
in a response to requests for admission shall be as complete and
straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party
permits.
(b) Each answer
shall:
(1) Admit so much
of the matter involved in the request as is true, either as expressed in the
request itself or as reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party.
(2) Deny so much
of the matter involved in the request as is untrue.
(3) Specify so
much of the matter involved in the request as to the truth of which the
responding party lacks sufficient information or knowledge.
(c)
If a responding party gives lack of information or knowledge as a reason for a
failure to admit all or part of a request for admission, that party shall state
in the answer that a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular
request has been made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is
insufficient to enable that party to admit the matter.
(CCP
§ 2033.220.)  
Green’s separate
statement is five pages in length and does not provide what each of the RFA
requests seek.[1]  Green generally states that Defendant
responded to the RFAs as follows: 
On
information and belief, based on the wording of the request, a reasonable
inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has been made, and the
information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable the
Responding party to admit or deny. 
(Green
Separate Statement at p.2.)  Green argues
that the response does not conform to CCP § 2033.220(c) and that the
boilerplate objections constitute a misuse of the discovery process.  
            In opposition, Defendant argues that
Green’s counsel’s meet and confer attempts were insufficient.  On July 10, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent a
meet and confer letter regarding Defendant’s responses to FROGs, SROGs, and
RPDs (Opp. at Ex. C); on July 11, 2024, defense counsel responded to the
letter, addressing the FROGs, SROGs, and RPDs (Opp. at Ex. D); on July 11,
2024, the parties’ counsel emailed regarding the discovery and meet and confer
attempts (Opp. at Exs. E-F); on July 17, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent a
supplemental meet and confer letter regarding the FROGs, SROGs, RPDs, and RFA
Nos. 1-39, 41-59, and 61-71 (Opp. at Ex. G; on July 17, 2024, Plaintiffs’
counsel sent an Additional Meet and Confer letter regarding the FROGs (Opp. at
Ex. K); on July 19, 2024, the parties’ counsel emailed about discovery issues
but did not discuss the RFAs (Opp. at Exs. H-I); and on July 22, 2024, defense
counsel sent a meet and confer letter regarding the SROGs and RPDs, but did not
address the RFAs (Opp. at Ex. J). 
            Here, the parties do not appear to
have adequately met and conferred about the RFAs at issue.  While Plaintiffs’ counsel sent one letter
regarding RFA Nos. 1-39, 41-59, and 61-71 on July 17, 2024, the parties did not
discuss the RFAs any further after that letter. 
However, Defendant states that in compliance with the IDC, it served supplemental
responses to RFA Nos. 1-35 on August 23, 2024 (the same day as the filing of
the opposition brief).  (Opp. at Ex.
L.)  In light of Defendant’s service of
supplemental responses to RFA Nos. 1-35 prior to the hearing on the motion, the
motion is denied as to RFA Nos. 1-35.  If
Green finds that Defendant’s responses to RFA Nos. 1-35 are deficient, the
parties are ordered to meet and confer about the supplemental responses.  The parties should make good faith efforts to
resolve their discovery disputes.  As
stated in the Court’s IDC order, the filing of additional discovery motions is
stayed until further Court order. 
            With respect to RFA Nos. 36-39,
41-59, and 61-71, the motion is denied. 
At the IDC held on August 1, 2024, the Court ordered “that each side may
have 35 discovery requests. No additional requests are permitted without
further order of the court.”  The Court
intended this to include the RFAs at issue, such that Green had the opportunity
to propound 35 RFAs and/or pick 35 RFAs from the RFA, set one (at issue in this
motion) that he had already propounded.  (See
Opp. at p.13.)  As additional RFAs over
35 requests were expressly not allowed following the Court’s IDC, the motion is
denied as to RFA Nos. 36-39, 41-59, and 61-71. 
Green seeks sanctions in the amount of
$1,470.50 (= [4 hours on the motion papers + an estimated 3 hours to review the
opposition, prepare the reply, and attend the hearing] at $200/hour, plus
$70.50 in filing fees).  Defendant seeks
sanctions in the amount of $2,127.50 against Green and Plaintiffs’ counsel (=
[2.5 hours reviewing the motion papers + 7 hours on the opposition + 2
anticipated hours to review the reply and attend the hearing] at
$185/hour).  The Court will reduce the
sanctions sought by Green to $900.  The
meet and confer attempts by Plaintiffs’ counsel were sparse with respect to the
RFAs.  In addition, the motion is largely
denied against Green as the motion was moot with respect to RFA Nos. 1-35 in
light of the supplemental responses and no additional discovery beyond 35
requests will be compelled.  Defendant’s
request for sanctions is denied. 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
Plaintiff
Michael Green’s motion to compel Defendant Royal Garden Apartments Inc.’s further responses
to RFA Nos. 1-39, 41-59, and 61-71 is denied in part and granted in part. 
The motion is denied as moot as to RFA
Nos. 1-35 in light of the supplemental responses provided.  The motion is denied as to RFA Nos. 36-39, 41-59,
and 61-71, as the Court limited discovery to 35 requests based on the August 1,
2024 Informal Discovery Conference. 
Defendant is
ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $900 to Plaintiff, by and
through counsel.  The Court suspends all
payment of sanctions until March 20, 2025. 
The Court will re-evaluate the issue of sanctions at the time of the
Final Status Conference.  
Plaintiff shall provide notice of this order.
