The Court
notes that while Green’s motion papers cite to Exhibits 1 and 2 as the RFA
requests and responses, a review of Exhibits 1 and 2 show that they include
Form Interrogatory (“FROG”) requests and responses to FROGs.  (Mot., Ex. 1 [FROG requests], Ex. 2 [FROG
responses].)  The opposition papers
attach the RFAs at issue (served April 27, 2024) as Exhibit A and Defendant’s
responses (served June 12, 2024) as Exhibit B.
