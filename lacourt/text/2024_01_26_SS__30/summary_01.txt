And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to compel the deposition of non-party Andrew Miller without prejudice. The motion was denied due to lack of personal service on the deponent. The deposition subpoena was sent to the Sheriff's office on May 15, 2023, and notice of deposition was served on all parties on June 9, 2023. Andrew Miller failed to appear for deposition on June 29, 2023. Cross-Complainants argue that there was no personal service of the subpoena on Miller, and that Miller's doctor has advised against him testifying due to his health issues. Cross-Defendant argues that Cross-Complainants' counsel stated they had authority to accept service of the subpoena on behalf of Miller, and that the conditions of the agreement were not met due to attempted personal service at Miller's home. The Judge finds that the motion was denied due to lack of personal service on the deponent, and that the deposition subpoena was not served on Miller.
