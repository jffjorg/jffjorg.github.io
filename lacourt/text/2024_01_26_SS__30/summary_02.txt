And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff and his guardian ad litem is granted. This means that the plaintiff and his guardian ad litem must appear for a deposition within 30 days. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for sanctions, ordering the plaintiff and his guardian ad litem to pay the defendant $500 in sanctions. This is because the plaintiff and his guardian ad litem failed to appear for the deposition and did not respond to the defendant's request for alternative dates.
