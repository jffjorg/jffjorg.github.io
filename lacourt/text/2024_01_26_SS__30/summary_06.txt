And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike, ruling that the plaintiff's complaint states a cause of action for assault and battery against the defendant HBIC. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to establish that the assault and battery were committed within the scope of the defendant's employment and that the defendant ratified the employee's conduct. The judge also finds that the defendant failed to meet its burden of showing that the complaint does not state a cause of action.
