Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve a compromise of a disputed claim of a minor, G.L. (age 11), and finds the settlement reasonable. However, the petition is continued for 60 days due to the lack of a proposed order and an order to deposit into a blocked account. Additionally, the defendants have not been served with the petition. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, and allows counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. Counsel is ordered to file the necessary orders and serve the defendants, and to provide notice to the moving party. The judicial assistant is ordered to calendar the next hearing.
