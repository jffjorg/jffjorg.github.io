And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer is overruled, and the motion to strike is granted in part and denied in part. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligence per se, and the defendant's demurrer is therefore overruled. The court also finds that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a claim for punitive damages, and the motion to strike is denied in part. The court grants the motion to strike the request for attorney fees under the cause of action for negligence per se, but denies the motion to strike the claim for punitive damages.
