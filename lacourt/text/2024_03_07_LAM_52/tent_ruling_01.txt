  Case Number:  22STCV05815    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Dana Moon’s Motion for
Order to Reopen Discovery and to Extend Discovery and Discovery Motion Cut-off
Dates
Plaintiff
Dana Moon moves to reopen discovery.
Plaintiff
does not show she made an adequate attempt to meet and confer about reopening
discovery.  A motion to reopen discovery
“shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.”  (CCP § 2024.050(a).)  “A meet and confer declaration in support of
a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (CCP § 2016.040.)  
The
declaration of Jeffrey E. Dorsett in support of this motion does not show any
such effort to resolve the issue presented by the motion: reopening
discovery.  His declaration begins by explaining
the parties’ disputes over the depositions of defendants Chong Park and Howard
Park.  (J. Dorsett Decl., ¶¶ 2-28.)  It ends by stating, “After meeting and
conferring, Counsel and I agreed to an IDC and agreed that the motion cut-off
date shall be 20 days after the IDC.  Counsel
stated that he was going to add his request to compel Plaintiff’s further
deposition answers as to Plaintiff’s contentions.  IDC regarding Defendants’ and Plaintiff’s
depositions was scheduled for January 22, 2024, but was rescheduled to February
6, 2024 on this court’s own motion then was continued again to March 1, 2024,
due to Counsel’s engaging in another trial from February 5, 2024.”  (Id., ¶¶ 29-31.)  
This
declaration does not show any effort to informally resolve the issue at hand.  It refers only to “meeting and conferring” to
set an IDC for January 22.  It identifies
no efforts plaintiff’s counsel made to avoid the need to file this motion to
reopen discovery after the IDC was rescheduled and before plaintiff filed the motion
on February 8.  
Plaintiff
also fails to show good cause to reopen discovery.  Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050(b)
provides:
In
exercising its discretion to grant or deny this motion, the court shall take
into consideration any matter relevant to the leave requested, including, but
not limited to, the following:
(1) The
necessity and the reasons for the discovery.
(2) The
diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery or the
hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that the discovery was not
completed or that the discovery motion was not heard earlier.
(3) Any
likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing the discovery motion will
prevent the case from going to trial on the date set, or otherwise interfere
with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any other party.
(4) The
length of time that has elapsed between any date previously set, and the date
presently set, for the trial of the action.
This statute provides the
exclusive procedure for reopening discovery. 
Plaintiff’s motion never cites the statute.  Even if the moving party
shows grounds for compelling discovery, the court cannot grant that relief
after the discovery motion deadline without “first deciding whether discovery
should be reopened for that purpose under all of the relevant
circumstances.”  (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 1568, 1588 (Pelton-Shepherd).)  The court should make that decision after the
parties “offer[] evidence and argument” on the relevant factors under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2024.050, thus giving the court “an informed basis on
which to exercise its discretion.”  (Ibid.)  
Plaintiff’s
motion almost exclusively discusses the substance of the underlying discovery
disputes.  Not whether the relevant
factors support reopening discovery under section 2024.050.  
Plaintiff’s
papers do demonstrate that defendants’ counsel obstructed the deposition of
Chong Park.  Defendants’ counsel made
numerous improper objections.  “Objections
to the competency of the deponent, or to the relevancy, materiality, or
admissibility at trial of the testimony or of the materials produced are
unnecessary.”  (CCP § 2025.460(c).)  Defendants’ counsel objected, for example, that
questions “lack[] foundation” (J. Dorsett Decl., Ex. A, Chong Park Depo., 191:9,
199:24) and repeatedly called questions “inappropriate” (id., pp. 192,
194, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203).  He also
argued on the record, such as by stating, “[B]y not responding, you are
admitting that those are inappropriate questions yet you keep doing it every
time.”  (Id., p. 200:17-19.)  
Defendants’
counsel also improperly instructed Chong Park not to answer questions.  Generally, it is only proper to instruct the
deponent not to answer when a question “pertains to privileged matters.”  (Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc.
(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1015.)  Defendants’
counsel instructed Chong Park not to answer because questions were purportedly
“argumentative or harassing” (Chong Park Depo., 191:18-192:7, 194:8-13) and
that a question was “asked and answered” (id., 193:19-24).  
Defendants’
counsel’s conduct, though inappropriate, is not itself grounds for reopening
discovery.  It may be grounds for a
motion to compel further answers at deposition under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.480.  Similarly, that Howard
Park did not appear for a continued session of his deposition on January 18,
2024, may be grounds for a motion to compel his attendance under section
2025.450.  But the court cannot reopen
discovery solely on that basis.  (Pelton-Shepherd,
supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1587-1588.) 
The court must first consider all relevant factors.  Plaintiff fails to show why additional
testimony is necessary (§ 2024.050(b)(1)) or that plaintiff diligently sought
to complete discovery before the deadline (id., subd. (b)(2)).
Plaintiff
makes only a conclusory argument that “if the requested continuance is not
granted, Plaintiff would be deprived of the opportunity to fully and fairly
present her case.”  (Motion, p. 12.)  This section of plaintiff’s brief cites only Cadle
Co. v. World Wide Hospitality Furniture, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 504,
which does not discuss discovery at all, let alone reopening discovery.  That opinion held the trial “court abused its
discretion in entering judgment against the corporate defendant” when “[a] brief
trial continuance would have permitted” the suspended corporation to “restore
[its] good standing with the State, and defend the litigation.”  (Id. at p. 512.)  Any prejudice in not permitting plaintiff to
conduct additional discovery is far less than the prejudice from refusing to
permit a party to defend itself at all.  
After
considering all factors relevant to reopening discovery, the court exercises
its discretion not to do so.
Plaintiff
Dana Moon’s motion to reopen discovery is denied.
