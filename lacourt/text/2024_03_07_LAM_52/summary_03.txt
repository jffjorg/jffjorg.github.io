And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Petitioner Edward A. Klein's petition to compel arbitration and payment of fees and costs is granted. Respondent Pathward, N.A. failed to pay initiation fees within 30 days, which constitutes a material breach of the arbitration agreement. JAMS's letter extending the deadline for payment does not change this conclusion. The Judge finds that Petitioner did not reasonably incur $8,895 in expenses as a result of Respondent's breach and reduces the award to $6,795.
