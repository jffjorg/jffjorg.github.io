And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery. The plaintiff failed to show that they made an adequate attempt to meet and confer with the defendant about reopening discovery. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate good cause to reopen discovery, as they did not show that additional testimony was necessary or that they diligently sought to complete discovery before the deadline. The judge noted that while the defendant's counsel obstructed the deposition of Chong Park, this is not grounds for reopening discovery. The judge also found that the plaintiff's argument about prejudice if discovery is not reopened was conclusory and lacked evidence to support it. As a result, the judge denied the motion to reopen discovery.
