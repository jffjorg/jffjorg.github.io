And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings pending arbitration. The defendants, Bluevine Inc. and Coastal Financial Corporation a/k/a Coastal Community Bank, have demonstrated the existence of an arbitration agreement which may be invoked by defendants against plaintiffs. The agreement requires submission of claims arising out of or relating to the agreement, which includes disputes concerning the acquisition, use, or balance of account or sub-account, advertisements, promotions, or oral or written statements related to the account or sub-account. The court finds that the defendants have met their burden of proving the existence of an enforceable arbitration agreement and that the disputes are covered by the agreement. Therefore, the court grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings pending arbitration.
