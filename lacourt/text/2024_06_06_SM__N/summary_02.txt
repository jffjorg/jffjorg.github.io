And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has granted the plaintiff's ex parte application to lift the stay as to individual defendants Adrian Steckel, Bradley J. Pizer, and Kevin Dawson. The defendants opposed the issuance of an order lifting the stay because all causes of action except one are alleged against all defendants, including MoveCU Inc., which is in bankruptcy. The Judge noted that the automatic stay of judicial proceedings does not apply to non-debtor co-defendants, except in unique circumstances. The Judge found that this case does not represent such an unusual situation and granted the plaintiff's application.
