 Case Number:  23STCV24268    Hearing Date:   January 30, 2024    Dept:  30 ARMENAK BADOYAN, et al. vs UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC., et al.TENTATIVEDefendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED with 20 days leave to amend. Moving party to give notice.Legal StandardA demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 (internal citations omitted).)A special demurrer for uncertainty is appropriate where the pleading is so poorly written that the defendant cannot reasonably respond because it cannot tell what claims need to be admitted or denied.¿ (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)DiscussionI. Meet and ConferBefore filing a demurrer, demurring party is also required to meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41.)The Court finds the meet and confer requirements have been met.II. MeritsDefendant demurs to the FAC, arguing that it fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. Defendant contends that Plaintiffs have alleged a single cause of action for “uninsured motorist arbitration” which is not a viable cause of action as to demurring Defendant who is also not a proper party. There are no facts alleged in the FAC that demurring Defendant was a party to the occurrence, owned, or negligently operated the vehicle nor can these deficiencies be cured. Defendant is an Insurance Company.As an initial matter, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (SAC). However, there is no showing in the Court’s docket that Plaintiff obtained leave of court or the parties stipulatedto allow Plaintiff to do. Code of Civil Procedure section 472 states in relevant part: “A party may amend its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).)Plaintiff already amended his pleading once without leave of court, by filing the FAC. Any subsequent amendment must have been upon court order. (Hedwall v. PCMV, LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 564, 574-579.) The Court in Hedwall held that the right to amend the complaint as a matter of right under CCP section 472 pertains to the original complaint. (Id., 574-575.) Therefore, the operative pleading is the first amended complaint (FAC).Next, the Court notes that the FAC contains no facts as to Defendant, whatsoever. Thus, the Court agrees the FAC fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The demurrer is SUSTAINED.Leave to AmendThe burden is on Plaintiff to show in what manner he or she can amend the complaint, and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349; Hendy v. Losse (1991) 54 Cal.3d 723, 742.)Although Plaintiffs have not opposed the motion to show how they can amend the complaint, Plaintiff previously attempted to file a SAC. In light of this fact, and because this is the first challenge to the pleadings, leave to amend is granted.
