And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained, meaning that the complaint filed by the plaintiff does not state a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The plaintiff had previously filed a second amended complaint (SAC) without leave of court, which is not allowed. The judge has determined that the first amended complaint (FAC) contains no facts about the defendant and is therefore defective. The judge has granted leave to amend the complaint, but the plaintiff has not shown how it plans to do so.
