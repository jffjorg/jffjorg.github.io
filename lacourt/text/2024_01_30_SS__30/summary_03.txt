And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Steven Lamoureux's motion to compel responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One. The plaintiff, California Automobile Insurance Company, failed to respond to the discovery requests despite the deadline of July 13, 2023. The judge found that the plaintiff's objections to the discovery requests were waived due to the failure to timely respond. The judge also denied both parties' request for sanctions, as the notice of motion and opposition did not comply with the requirements of CCP section 2023.040. The plaintiff is ordered to provide responses without objections within 20 days.
