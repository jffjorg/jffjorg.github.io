And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, State of California, has moved to compel the plaintiff, Taisha Morris, to provide verified responses to form interrogatories. The plaintiff failed to provide responses despite being served the request on April 18, 2023, and the statute-mandated deadline of May 22, 2023. The court finds that the defendant is entitled to a court order directing the plaintiff to provide responses without objections. The defendant's request for sanctions is denied because the motion was not opposed. The court also denies the defendant's request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery, citing a previous court decision. The plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses within 20 days of this order.
