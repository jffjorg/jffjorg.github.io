Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production as moot. The plaintiff has already responded to the discovery requests, making the motions unnecessary. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the plaintiff's counsel has provided substantial justification for the failure to serve timely responses. The judge notes that the plaintiff's opposition was not unsuccessfully made, as the motions are being denied as moot.
