(Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014))
  - "A court may not issue a terminating sanction for failure to pay a monetary discovery sanction." (Newland v. Superior Court (1995))

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the plaintiff's motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions against the defendant. The defendant has failed to comply with the court's order to provide verified responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff is ordered to file a supplemental declaration five court days prior to the next hearing to inform the court whether the defendant has complied.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions without prejudice. The plaintiff failed to provide adequate notice that monetary sanctions were being sought in the notice of motion.

The judge is inclined to grant the motion for issue or evidentiary sanctions because the responses were not verified. However, the judge wants to give the defendant one final opportunity to comply with the court's order and provide verified responses.
