Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to the requests for production of documents (RPD). The motion was brought by the plaintiff, Teresita Mahayag Teichmann, against the defendant, Mag Estate Property, LLC. The plaintiff seeks discovery regarding the defendant's treatment of other tenants in the 13-unit apartment complex where the plaintiff resides.

The judge finds that the defendant has provided verified responses to some of the RPD, but that some documents may still be responsive to the requests. The judge also finds that some aspects of the RPD are too broad and that the plaintiff has not provided a solid explanation for why such expansive discovery is necessary.

The judge grants the motion in part, ordering the defendant to provide further responses to some of the RPD, including documents relating to the apartment complex where the plaintiff resides. The judge also denies the motion as to other RPD, finding that the defendant has already provided sufficient responses.

The judge notes that the defendant has not shown that the requested information is protectible because it is pre-litigation offers to compromise, and that the defendant has not identified any feasible alternatives that would serve the same interests or protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy. The judge also notes that the protective order in place in this case would adequately protect the privacy interests of third parties.

The judge concludes that the motion is denied as to RPD Nos. 4 and 28; granted, in part, as to Nos. 17 and 18 limited to information concerning the apartment complex where the plaintiff resides; and granted as to Nos. 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 20, 21, 26, and 27 (where appropriate, limited to the apartment complex). The defendant is ordered to provide a further response in keeping with the court's order within 20 days of its issuance.
