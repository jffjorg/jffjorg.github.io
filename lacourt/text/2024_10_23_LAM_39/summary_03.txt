Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant National Community Renaissance of California's motion to strike punitive damages allegations from the complaint filed by Plaintiffs Delmy Yadira Vargas Hernandez, Sebastian Gonzalez, Delmy S. Gonzalez, and Babie J. Gonzalez. The judge found that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged a claim for punitive damages against Defendant, as they do not provide specific facts to show that Defendant acted with malice. The judge also noted that, as a corporate entity, Defendant can only be held liable for punitive damages if its officers, directors, or managing agents acted with malice, and Plaintiffs have failed to allege such malice. The judge gave Plaintiffs one more opportunity to amend their complaint to state a claim for punitive damages, and ordered them to file an amended complaint within 10 days.
