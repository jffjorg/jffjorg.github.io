  Order RE:
 
defendant’s motion to compel plaintiff’s
  deposition and for sanctions
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Defendant Airgas USA, LLC 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Joe Ledesma
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Deposition and for Sanctions
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendant Airgas USA, LLC (“Defendant”) moves the court for an order
(1) compelling plaintiff Joe Ledesma (“Plaintiff”) to appear for and testify at
deposition, and (2) imposing issue, evidentiary, terminating, or monetary
sanctions in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff.
“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . .
, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination . . . , the party giving the notice may move for an
order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
The court finds that Defendant has (1) submitted a meet and confer
declaration that complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040, and
(2) shown that Plaintiff has failed to appear for deposition and to provide
Defendant’s counsel with his availability to appear for deposition.  The court notes that Plaintiff has argued, in
his opposition, that his counsel offered the deposition date of July 31, 2024,
but that Defendant instead filed this motion as a bad faith tactic to punish
Plaintiff.  (Opp., p. 5:22-24.)  The court disagrees.  Plaintiff’s counsel offered this date “if
[counsel was] not in trial,” advising Defendant’s counsel further that “this
date might not be available.” 
(Ehsani-Nia Decl., Ex. 15, PDF p. 233 [emphasis added].)  Thus, Plaintiff did not provide Defendant
with a date certain on which he would appear for deposition.  
The court therefore grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subds. (a), (b)(2).) 
The court grants Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (g)(1).)  The court finds that $2,250
(5 hours x $450 hourly rate for counsel) is a reasonable amount of sanctions to
impose against Plaintiff in connection with this motion.  (Ehsani-Nia Decl., ¶¶ 30-31.) 
The court denies Defendant’s requests for terminating, issue, and
evidence sanctions against Plaintiff because the court finds that compelling
Plaintiff to appear for deposition and awarding monetary sanctions in
Defendant’s favor is sufficient to remedy the harm caused by Plaintiff’s
failure to appear and provide dates for his deposition.  (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract
Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604 [sanctions should
be tailored to the harm caused by withheld discovery].) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in his
favor and against Defendant. 
ORDER
            The court grants defendant Airgas
USA LLC’s motion to compel plaintiff’s deposition for sanctions as follows. 
            The court orders plaintiff Joe
Ledesma to attend and testify at a deposition to be taken by counsel for
defendant Airgas USA LLC on ___________________, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., to be
conducted by a videoconference platform selected by defendant Airgas USA, LLC. 
            The court orders plaintiff Joe
Ledesma to pay monetary sanctions to defendant Airgas USA, LLC in the amount of
$2,250 within 30 days of the date of this order. 
            The court denies all other relief
requested in defendant Airgas USA LLC’s motion.
            The court orders defendant Airgas
USA, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
