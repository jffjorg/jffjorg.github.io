And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling regarding a substitution of attorney in a civil case. The case involves James Jones, who has appointed Leslie Bushnell as his attorney in fact through a Durable Power of Attorney. Bushnell has submitted a settlement agreement and the Durable Power of Attorney to the court. However, Steven S. Vahidi has also filed a Substitution of Attorney – Civil form claiming to represent James Jones. The court is concerned that Vahidi may not have the authority to represent Jones, as the Durable Power of Attorney remains in effect with regard to Bushnell's authority to act on Jones's behalf in litigation. The court has set a hearing for December 13, 2024, to determine the validity of the Durable Power of Attorney and whether Vahidi has authority to represent Jones. The court has ordered that any response to the Order to Show Cause be filed and served no later than nine court days before the hearing.
