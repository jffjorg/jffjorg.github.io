MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Emilio Reyes            

 

RESPONDING PARTIES:    Defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc.,
and Andrew Salas

Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production of
Documents

The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 

REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE

            The court denies plaintiff Emilio Reyes’s
request for judicial notice because the Third Amended Complaint is not relevant
to the court’s disposition of this motion. 
(Malek Media Group LLC v. AXQG Corp. (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 817,
825 [“Any matter to be judicially noticed must be relevant to a material
issue”].) 

DISCUSSION

Plaintiff Emilio Reyes (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order (1) compelling
defendant Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc. (“Defendant”), to serve further,
verified responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set
One, numbers 53-54, 85-87, 111-117, 127-128, and 149-170, and (2) awarding
monetary sanctions in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of
$339.06.

The court finds that the discovery motion cutoff date has passed and
therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a).) 

Except as otherwise provided, “any party shall be entitled as a matter
of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before the 30th day, and to
have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the
date initially set for the trial of the action.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2024.020, subd. (a).)  “Thus, if a party properly notices a discovery
motion to be heard on or before the discovery motion cutoff date, that party
has a right to have the motion heard.  By negative implication, a
party who notices a discovery motion to be heard after the discovery
motion cutoff date does not have a right to have the motion heard.”  (Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1568, 1586 [emphasis in original].) 

On March 6, 2023, the court set this case for trial on May 15,
2024.  (March 6, 2023 Minute Order, p.
1.)  On May 2, 2024, the court (1)
continued trial, pursuant to the request of Plaintiff, from May 15, 2024 to
July 10, 2024, and (2) ordered that “[a]ll discovery cut-off and discovery
motion cut-off dates, and deadlines for the exchange of information concerning
expert trial witnesses, shall be based on the date initially set for trial of this
action (5/15/24) and shall not be reopened or based on the new trial date,
except that Defendants may take the deposition of Plaintiff Emilio Reyes
pursuant [to] the Court’s 5/1/24 order.” 
(May 2, 2024 Minute Order, pp. 1-2.)  On June 27, 2024, the court continued trial
from July 10, 2024 to July 17, 2024 on the court’s own motion.  (June 27, 2024 Minute Order, p. 2.)  The court did not reopen discovery or extend
the discovery and discovery motion cutoff dates in that order.  (Ibid.)  Thereafter, on July 15, 2024, the court
issued a minute order (1) continuing trial from July 17, 2024 to October 16,
2024, and (2) ordering that “the discovery cut-off and discovery motion cut-off
dates are only extended with respect to the deposition of Plaintiff, Emilio
Reyes.”  (July 15, 2024 Minute Order, p.
1.) 

Thus, the court finds that the discovery motion cutoff date in this
action was on April 30, 2024, i.e., 15 days before the date initially set for
trial (May 15, 2024).  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2024.020, subd. (a).)  Because
Plaintiff (1) noticed this motion for hearing after the discovery motion cutoff
date, and (2) did not file a motion requesting leave to have this motion
concerning discovery heard pursuant to section 2024.050, the court finds that
Plaintiff does not have a right to have this motion heard.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020, subd. (a),
2024.050 [court “shall” take into consideration the factors in exercising its
discretion to grant or deny a motion for leave to reopen discovery]; Pelton-Shepherd
Industries, Inc., supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at p. 1586.) 

The court denies Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff. 

ORDER

            The court denies plaintiff Emilio
Reyes’s motion to compel further responses to requests for production of
documents.

            The court orders defendant Los
Indios de San Gabriel, Inc. to give notice of this ruling.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
