Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the City of Santa Monica to the complaint filed by Johah Doe (A.G.) alleging childhood sexual abuse. The Court has found that the complaint states facts sufficient to support the timely presentation element of the causes of action against the City. The Court has also found that AB 218, which revives previously barred claims for childhood sexual abuse, does not provide a gift, as it does not provide a benefit to a specific individual or group, does not retroactively create liability where none existed, and serves a public purpose. The Court has therefore overruled the City's demurrer.
