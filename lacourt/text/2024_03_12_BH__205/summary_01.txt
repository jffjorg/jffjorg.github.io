And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Los Angeles County Child Support Services Department (CSSD) against Stephen Kop, et al. The case arises from an allegedly wrongful lien placed on insurance proceeds following an accident involving Kop. CSSD argues that the claims against it should be heard in the Family Division of the Superior Court, not in this Court. The judge agrees, concluding that Kop's claims seek to relitigate a family law judgment, which must be decided in the Family Division.

The judge also sustains CSSD's demurrer, finding that Kop's claims are barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel, and are time-barred pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. section 473. The judge also grants CSSD's motion to strike, finding that Kop's prayer for attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest are not supported by statute or contract.

In summary, the judge has ruled in favor of CSSD, dismissing Kop's claims and denying his request for attorneys' fees and prejudgment interest.
