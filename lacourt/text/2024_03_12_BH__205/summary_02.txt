And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. grants plaintiff Ciena Norton permission to file a motion to compel production of text messages from a third party witness, but denies her request to deem the motion timely filed. The motion is related to a rape allegation made by plaintiff against Michael Pellico, who died during the police investigation. The plaintiff alleges that she was prevented from filing the motion without scheduling an informal discovery conference (IDC), and was not able to schedule an IDC until after the deadline to file the motion. The court notes that the department's rules requiring an IDC do not apply to motions to compel third-party compliance with a subpoena. The court will decide whether the motion is timely filed when ruling on the merits of the motion.
