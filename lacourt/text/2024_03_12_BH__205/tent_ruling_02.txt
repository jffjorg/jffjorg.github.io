 Case Number:  23SMCV00238    Hearing Date:   March 12, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   CIENA NORTON,    Plaintiff, v.  STEPHEN PELLICO, as Executor of the Estate of Michael Alan Pellico, et al.   Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV00238     Hearing Date:  March 12, 2024      [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF CIENA NORTON’S MOTION    FOR PERMISSION TO FILE MOTION TO    COMPEL PRODUCTION OF TEXT    MESSAGES AND FOR ORDER THAT    SAID MOTION BE DEEMED TIMELY    FILED      Plaintiff Ciena Norton alleges she was raped and severely injured by Michael Pellico during a November 14, 2021 dinner party.  Michael Pellico died during the police investigation of the rape, and Plaintiff now sues his estate.   This hearing is on Plaintiff’s motion for permission to file a motion to compel production of text messages from a third party witness and to deem the motion timely filed.  Plaintiff maintains she was prevented from filing the motion without scheduling an informal discovery conference (“IDC”), and she was not able to schedule an IDC until after the deadline to file the motion to compel. This Department’s rules requiring an informal discovery conference do not apply to motions to compel third party compliance with a subpoena.  In any event, even absent an informal discovery conference, the Court may grant a party permission to file a discovery motion.  The Court grants Plaintiff leave to file her motion to compel.  The Court will decide whether the motion is timely filed when ruling on the merits of the motion.   Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Plaintiff’s motion for permission to file a motion to compel production of text messages pursuant to subpoena and for order that said motion be deemed timely filed.     IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: March 12, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
