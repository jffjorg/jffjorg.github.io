Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to lift the stay filed by Roman James and Roman James Design Build, Inc. (Moving Defendants). The Court previously stayed the case pending the resolution of the cross-complaint filed by the plaintiffs in a related case, Hakimfar v. Roman James, et al. (Case No. 18STCV03136). The Hakimfar Court has now ruled on the cross-complaint, sustaining a demurrer and granting a motion to strike. As a result, the Court lifts the stay on the present case and sets a hearing on Moving Defendants' demurrer and motion to strike for April 29, 2024. The parties are required to file supplemental briefs by March 29, 2024.
