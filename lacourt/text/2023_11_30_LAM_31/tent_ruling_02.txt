I.             INTRODUCTION
 
On October 10, 2023, Michael J.
Jaurigue and Amanda L. Thompson, counsel for Plaintiff, Fredrick Smith, filed this
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
II.           LEGAL
STANDARDS 
 
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362
(Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to
be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general
terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is
brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved
as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion
and declaration on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an
attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there
is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of
justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.          DISCUSSION 
 
Michael J. Jaurigue and Amanda L.
Thompson seek to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff for the
following reasons: “The relationship of trust and confidence essential to the
attorney-client relationship has ceased to exist.  An irreparable breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship has arisen that makes continued representation
unreasonably difficult.  The specific
acts giving rise to this motion are confidential.  Client will not consent to counsel being
relieved pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 284(1).”  (MC-052.) 
 
 
Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)  
 
Upon review, the Court finds the Motion
does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Specifically, Item 5b of the proposed order
does not specify the date when the order is to be effective.  The Court further notes that Defendant
reserved hearing dates and filed discovery motions for those dates after
Counsel filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  The Court will require Counsel to file and
serve an amended Motion which includes the hearing dates for Defendant’s discovery
motions.
 
IV.          CONCLUSION   
                Accordingly, the Hearing
on the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel scheduled for 11/30/2023 is CONTINUED
to 01/05/2024 at 08:30 AM.¿ Counsel is to file and serve an amended Motion and
proposed order consistent with this order no later than 5 court days before the
hearing.¿
                Counsel to give
notice.
