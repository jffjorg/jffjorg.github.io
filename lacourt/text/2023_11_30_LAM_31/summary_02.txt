And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Michael J. Jaurigue and Amanda L. Thompson, counsel for plaintiff Fredrick Smith. The motion is to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The court finds that the motion does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, specifically regarding the proposed order. The court also notes that the defendant has reserved hearing dates and filed discovery motions for those dates, which will be affected by the motion. The court continues the hearing to January 5, 2024, and requires counsel to file and serve an amended motion and proposed order consistent with this order by five court days before the hearing.
