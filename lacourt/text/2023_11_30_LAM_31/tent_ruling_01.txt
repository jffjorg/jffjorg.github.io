  Case Number:  19PSCP00106    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  31 TENTATIVEPlaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is GRANTED.Legal
Standard Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1008(a) provides that “[w]hen an application for an order has
been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or
granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order
may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of
the order . . . [may] make application to the same judge or court that made the
order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.
The party making the application shall state by affidavit what application
was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions were made, and
what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be
shown.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).) A trial court has discretion
with respect to granting a motion for reconsideration.  (New York Times
Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.) A violation of Section 1008’s requirements
“may be punished as a contempt and with sanctions as allowed by Section 128.7.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(d).)“A motion for
reconsideration may only be brought if the party moving for reconsideration can
offer ‘new or different facts, circumstances, or law which it could not, with
reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the time of the prior
motion. (Citations.) A motion for reconsideration will be denied absent a
strong showing of diligence.” (Garcia
v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
674, 690; Forrest v. State Of California Dept. Of Corporations (2007)
150 Cal.App.4th 183, 202 disapproved of and overruled on unrelated
grounds in Shalant v. Girardi (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1164,
1172 (footnote 3); New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212–213; Baldwin v.
Home Sav. of America. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192,
1199.) DiscussionDefendant moves for reconsideration under CCP section 1008 and the
Court’s power to reconsider its own order sua sponte. Plaintiff, through
counsel petitioned the court to approve a minor's compromise. The court issued
a tentative ruling. A hearing was held that focused on additional documentation
the court requested to approve the costs requested by counsel, in the petition.
The tentative ruling awarded plaintiff's counsel 25% of the gross recovery.
Counsel did not argue the issue at the time due to an oversight, in that he
misread the tentative ruling as to the fees awarded, thinking 33.3% was
approved, as requested in the petition.I.                
CCP section
1008First, the Court finds the motion is untimely. The order approving
25% of attorney fees was made on September 19, 2023. This motion was filed on
November 3, 2023, more than 10 days after the ruling. Counsel argues he waived
notice.In
any event, even if it was not untimely, Plaintiff’s counsel’s failure to argue
the issue of attorney fees at oral argument is wholly collateral to the merits
of the order approving 25% of attorney fees, and thus, is not a new fact or
circumstance that this court may consider under CCP section 1008. (See Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995)
32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500 (holding that alleged fact that party seeking
reconsideration had not intended to waive oral argument did not constitute a
new or different fact under Section 1008, because it was wholly collateral to the merits of the initial motion).)  
Therefore, the
motion for reconsideration is untimely, and Plaintiff has failed to meet her
burden under section 1008 to provide new or different facts or circumstances. Where a
party moving for reconsideration of an interim order fails to raise new or
different facts or law, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motion. (Kerns
v. CSE Ins. Group (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 368, 391.)  II. Reconsideration
On its Own MotionLastly, counsel requests that the Court
reconsider its own order on its own motion.  The court retains the inherent
authority to amend its own orders on its own motion. (Le Francois v. Goel
(2005) 35 Cal. 4th 1094, 1107.)
 The court’s
inherent authority to reconsider and correct its own orders is constitutionally
derived. (Walker v. Superior Court¿(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 267.) A court “must exercise due consideration
before modifying, amending, or revoking its prior order.” (Case v. Lazben
Financial Co. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 172, 189.)  A court’s inherent power to reconsider
interim rulings may be exercised “even in the absence of newly discovered
evidence” and “[e]ven without a change of law.” (Ziller Electronics Lab GmbH
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1222, 1231, Pinela v. Neiman
Marcus Group, Inc. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 227, 237.) Thus, the inherent
power is distinct from a court’s power under CCP § 1008 following a motion for
reconsideration. (Kerns v. CSE Ins. Group (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 368,
389: “Consequently, we hold that the separation of powers doctrine precludes an
interpretation of section 1008 that would deprive a trial court of jurisdiction
to reconsider its own interim orders sua sponte.”)  In counsel’s
declaration submitted with the petition to approve the minor’s compromise, he
states that he has conducted four depositions, that they were extensive, and
that the matter settled before trial. This was not sufficient to show that
33.3% of attorney fees is reasonable. Counsel fails to discuss the hours
expended on this case and the labor required, whether the matter was novel or
difficult, the skills required, his experience and ability, the results
obtained, the risk borne by representing Plaintiff on a contingency basis, the
delay in payments, among other many factors under Cal
Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(b).However,
in counsel’s declaration filed with the motion for reconsideration, counsel
argues he spent $100,000 worth of his time (billed at $550 an hour) on this case. The matter was heavily contested by the
school district and the case was aggressively litigated. As such, the Court reconsiders its order on its own motion,
only to allow counsel to provide a further declaration discussing the relevant
factors under Cal Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(b), in order to determine whether
attorney fees in a higher amount are warranted. Thus, the petition to approve
minor’s compromise is continued to allow counsel to file his declaration and
submit proof of costs.
Conclusion
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is GRANTED on its own motion, only to allow counsel to provide a further
declaration discussing the relevant factors under Cal Rules of Court, Rule
7.955(b), in order to determine whether attorney fees in a higher amount are
warranted. Thus, the petition to approve minor’s compromise is continued to
allow counsel to file his declaration and submit proof of costs. This will be the last continuance. Continuance date to be determined at the hearing.Moving party to give notice.
