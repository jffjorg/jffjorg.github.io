MOTION FOR CONTEMPT



 
MOVING PARTY:                  Plaintiff
Dylan Scott Perry
 
RESPONDING PARTY:         Defendant Blue Shield of California
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On June 22, 2023,
Plaintiff, Dylan Scott Perry, filed this action against Defendant, Blue Shield
of California, alleging that Defendant intentionally cancelled Plaintiff’s
health insurance policy.  As a result,
Plaintiff suffered emotional and physical distress, as well as monetary damages.  The operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
was filed on July 13, 2023.  Plaintiff is
self-represented. 
 
On September 8, 2023,
Defendant filed a Demurrer and Motion to Strike the FAC.   Plaintiff filed Opposition documents on
September 26 and September 28, 2023. 
Defendant filed a Reply on October 2, 2023.
 
On October 3, 2023, the
case was reassigned to this Court from Department 28 of the Spring Street
Courthouse.  The Hearings for the
Demurrer and Motion to Strike were advanced and vacated.
 
            On October 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this Motion for Judgment of Civil Contempt against Kimberly A. Klinsport,
and/or Jason Y. Wu (Attorneys for Blue Shield of California). Plaintiff argues
Defendant lied about serving Plaintiff with the Demurrer. Plaintiff filed an
affidavit in support of the Motion on October 19, 2023.
 
            On October 30, 2023, Defendant filed
an Opposition to the Motion for Contempt.   
 
            On November 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a Reply.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
 
            Contempt is any act, in or out of
court, “which tends to impede, embarrass or obstruct the court in the discharge
of its duties.”  (In re Shortridge (1893) 99 Cal. 526, 532.) 
Particular acts constituting contempt are enumerated by statute, including:¿
“(d)isobedience of any lawful ... order, or process of the court”;¿
“(d)isobedience of a subpoena duly served”; “refusing to ... answer as a witness”;¿
“(d)isorderly, contemptuous, or insolent behavior toward the judge while
holding the court, tending to interrupt the due course of ... trial.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1209(a); see also Code Civ. Proc., § 1991 [disobedience of
subpoena]; and Pen. Code, § 166 [misdemeanor].) 
 
            In this case involving the
disobedience of a prior court order, the contempt at issue is “indirect,” which
requires a more elaborate procedure to notify the person(s) sought to be
charged and to allow him or her an opportunity to be heard.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 1211–1218; see also Hanson v. Superior Court (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 75, 81.)  “An affidavit must be presented to the court stating
the facts constituting the contempt, an order to show cause must be issued, and
hearing on the facts must be held by the judge.”  (Arthur v. Superior
Court (1965) 62 Cal.2d 404, 407-08.)  Since the acts involved did not
occur in the court’s presence, the affidavit (declaration) must cover each
element of the commission of the contempt.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1211.5.)  These elements are: (1) the rendition of a valid court order;
(2) actual knowledge of the order; (3) ability to comply; and (4) willful
disobedience of the order.  (Conn v. Superior Court (1987) 196
Cal.App.3d 774, 784 [repeated failures to turn over documents as
ordered].)  Upon receipt of the affidavit, the court usually issues an
order to show cause (OSC) why the person should not be held in contempt. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1212.)  Subsequently,
upon review of the answer and evidence, “the court or judge shall determine
whether the person proceeded against is guilty of the contempt charged, and if
it be adjudged that he or she is guilty of the contempt, a fine may be imposed
on him or her not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), payable to the
court, or he or she may be imprisoned not exceeding five days, or both.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1218, subd. (a).) 
            
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff argues the motion should be
granted because Plaintiff was never served with the Demurrer.  Plaintiff explains that his “building manager
signs for packages and delivers them at his convenience.  I have never given defendant permission to
serve my building manager on my behalf.”  (Motion, p. 2:3-4.)  Plaintiff further argues that defense counsel
unethically requested in the Reply to Plaintiff’s Opposition to the Demurrer
that the Court disregard Plaintiff’s Opposition as untimely filed.
 
            Plaintiff’s Motion for Contempt is
substantively and procedurally deficient. 
 First, the proof of service
attached to Defendant’s Demurrer indicates that Plaintiff was served with the
Demurrer and other filed documents at 752 S. Main St., Los Angeles, CA 90014 by
Federal Express.  This address matches
the address that appears on the FAC.  Defendant
effected proper service of the at-issue documents.   Second,
Plaintiff’s Motion does not concern the violation of a court order.  “A most basic premise in the law of [indirect]
contempt is that such punishment can only rest upon clear, intentional
violation of a specific, narrowly drawn order.”  (Wilson v. Superior Ct. (1987) 194 Cal.
App. 3d 1259.)  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Accordingly, the Motion for Contempt is
DENIED.  
 
            Moving party to give notice, unless
waived.
