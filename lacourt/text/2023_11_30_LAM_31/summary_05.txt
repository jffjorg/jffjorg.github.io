And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion by the plaintiffs, 3840 Crenshaw, LLC, et al., for an order directing service of the summons and complaint on the defendant, 3820 Crenshaw, LLC, through the Secretary of State. The defendant's agent of service of process, Robin Yi, has evaded attempts to be served, and the plaintiffs have used two process servers who have tried and failed to effect service more than twelve times. The court finds that service through the Secretary of State is the only remaining means for the plaintiffs to serve documents in this action. The ruling is based on Corporations Code section 1702, subdivision (a) and Corporations Code section 2111, which provide for substituted service of process through the Secretary of State in certain circumstances. The court also cites to Vorburg v. Vorburg (1941) 18 Cal.2d 794, 797, which holds that diligence is a relative term and must be determined by the circumstances of each case.
