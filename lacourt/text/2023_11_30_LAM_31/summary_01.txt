And here is a summary in English text:

The judge issues a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration, but only to allow the plaintiff's counsel to provide further evidence regarding the reasonable attorney fees. The original tentative ruling awarded 25% of the gross recovery to the plaintiff's counsel, but the counsel had misread the ruling and thought 33.3% was approved. The counsel failed to argue the issue at the time due to an oversight. The judge notes that the motion is untimely and that the counsel has failed to meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008 to provide new or different facts or circumstances. However, the judge exercises its inherent power to reconsider its own order on its own motion and allows the counsel to provide a further declaration discussing the relevant factors under California Rules of Court, Rule 7.955(b) to determine whether attorney fees in a higher amount are warranted. The petition to approve the minor's compromise is continued to allow the counsel to file his declaration and submit proof of costs.
