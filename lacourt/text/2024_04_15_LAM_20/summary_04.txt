And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the case and finds that the four subpoenas issued to the plaintiff's medical providers are overbroad and invasive of the plaintiff's constitutional right to privacy. The subpoenas seek all of the plaintiff's psychological records from 2001 to the present, which the Court finds to be excessive and unnecessary. The Court grants the Motions to Quash the subpoenas and orders the moving party to give notice. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, counsel are encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person.
