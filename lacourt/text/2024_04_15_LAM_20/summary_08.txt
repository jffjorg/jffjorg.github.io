This tentative ruling addresses a dispute over discovery responses in a habitability matter. The Defendants, 3J1M LLC, Ironwood Velvet LLC, and Aperto Property Management Inc., seek to compel further responses to special and form interrogatories from the Plaintiffs, Dawnielle Desensi, Shyann Redmond, and Alexis Redmond. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have already provided supplemental responses to form interrogatories, making the motion to compel moot. However, the Court grants the motion to compel as to special interrogatories, requiring the Defendants to provide further responses within 30 days. The Court also awards reduced sanctions of $1,000.
