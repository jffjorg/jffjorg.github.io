This is a habitability matter.  Defendants 3J1M LLC, Ironwood Velvet LLC, and Aperto Property Management Inc. seek to compel further responses to their special and form interrogatories from Plaintiffs Dawnielle Desensi, Shyann Redmond, and Alexis Redmond.With respect to form interrogatories, Plaintiffs indicate that supplemental responses have been served.  Therefore, the Motion directed at this discovery is denied as moot.  With respect to the 84 special interrogatories, the Court finds that these interrogatories seek basic information as to witnesses, documents, and facts supporting Plaintiffs’ claims and damages and that the objections lack merit.  Therefore, the Motion to Compel as to special interrogatories is granted.  Further responses are to be provided within 30 days.  The Court awards reduced sanctions in the total amount of $1,000.Moving parties to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
