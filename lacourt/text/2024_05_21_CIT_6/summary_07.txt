And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is denying the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendant, Michael Nieto. The plaintiff, Santander Consumer USA INC., has filed a lawsuit against the defendant and the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) alleging causes of action for possession, quiet title, and declaratory relief. The plaintiff has failed to mention the 2019 Dodge Charger in the complaint and has also failed to produce the original loan agreement, which is required when a loan agreement is involved. The court finds that a default judgment hearing is not the appropriate mechanism for this case, and instead, a prove-up hearing is necessary to resolve the quiet title claims. The court will set a default prove-up hearing to resolve the case.
