 Case Number:  23PSCV04002    Hearing Date:   May 21, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Santander Consumer USA INC.’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendant: Michael Nieto  TENTATIVE RULING                        Plaintiff’s request for entry of default  judgment is DENIED without prejudice. The Court will set a default prove-up  hearing.BACKGROUND                        This  is an action for repossession. On December 28, 2023, plaintiff Santander  Consumer USA Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Michael  Nieto (Nieto), California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and Does 1  through 10, alleging causes of action for possession, quiet title, and  declaratory relief. On March 15, 2024, Plaintiff and DMV entered into a  stipulation regarding waiver of appearance by and of monetary recovery against DMV,  and the Court signed an order regarding the same on the same date.              On  April 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment against  Nieto and DMV.  LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS  Plaintiff  seeks against Defendant Nieto: (1) possession of a 2020 Jeep Wrangler, VIN  1C4HJXDG8LW133221; (2) to be adjudicated the legal owner and lienholder of a  2019 Dodge Charger, VIN 2C3CDXGJ2KH506831; and (3) that if Plaintiff regains  the subject vehicle, that the amount of the proceeds of sale of will be  credited to Defendant Nieto’s account and judgment.  With respect to DMV, Plaintiff also seeks for the  Court to order DMV to: (1) accept Plaintiff’s prior security interest in the  subject vehicle issued on or about 12/4/2019; (2) to the extent there is any  new or conflicting ownership interest in the 2020 Jeep Wrangler, to invalidate  any such conflicting ownership interest and issue a new certificate of  ownership to Plaintiff as the legal owner; and (3) to the extent there is any  hold on the title or registration of the subject vehicle, to remove any such  hold and thereby enable Plaintiff to sell the subject vehicle once it regains possession.  The  Court finds some issues with Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment.  First, there is no mention of the 2019 Dodge Charger in the complaint. (See  generally, Compl. And Vargas Decl., ¶18(b).) The only vehicle mentioned therein  is the 2020 Jeep Wrangler. (See Id., ¶ 7; Id., Prayer for Relief,  ¶ 1; Id., Ex. A.) Also, Pablo Murcia-Bilbao is not named as a defendant  in the complaint. (See Id. and Vargas Decl., ¶¶ 11, 12.) The Court  cannot award judgment over property that was not mentioned in the complaint.  The  Court also notes that Plaintiff’s supporting declaration does not explain why  it could not produce the original, which is required when a loan agreement is  involved. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1806; Kahn v. Lasorda’s Dugout, Inc. (2002)  (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1118, 1123.)  The  Court further finds that the likely appropriate mechanism for default judgment  here is a prove-up hearing, as quiet title claims usually require a prove-up  hearing. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 764.010.)  CONCLUSION                        Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. The Court will set a  default prove-up hearing.
