NAME:  Nicholas
Muso, et al. v. Sevadham Management, LP, et al. 
Plaintiffs’
Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Form Interrogatories,
Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One 
TENTATIVE
RULING 
The Court GRANTS
Plaintiffs’ motion as to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and
orders Sevadham to provide verified, code-compliant, objection-free responses,
including all responsive documents, to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, within 30 days of the Court’s order. 
Plaintiffs
are ordered to immediately file a separate motion to compel responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One and a separate motion to compel responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One and pay the applicable filing fees forthwith. Once
the motions have been filed and the filing fees paid, the Court will GRANT Plaintiffs’
motions with respect to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special
Interrogatories, Set One. Otherwise, the motion will be denied without
prejudice as to those two sets of discovery requests. Assuming Plaintiffs
timely pay the respective filing fees, Sevadham must provide verified,
code-compliant responses, without objections, to Plaintiffs’ Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One, within 30 days
of the Court’s order. 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within
five calendar days of this order. 
BACKGROUND 
This is an elder abuse and wrongful death action. On August 26,
2021, plaintiff Patricia Muso, individually and as representative of decedent Nicholas
Muso (collectively, Plaintiffs), filed this action against defendants Sevadham
Management, LP dba Mountain View Centers Claremont Memory Care (Sevadham), Does
1 through 25, plus Nicholas Anthony Muso and Kathryn Muso as nominal
defendants, alleging causes of action for dependent adult abuse and neglect,
violation of patient rights, negligence, and wrongful death. 
On April 26, 2024, Plaintiffs moved to compel responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One. The motion is unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
When a party fails to serve a timely response
to interrogatories, the party propounding the interrogatories may move for an
order compelling a response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) A party
who fails to provide a timely response waives any objection, including one
based on privilege or work product. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) “The
court shall impose a monetary sanction… against any party, person, or attorney
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
 
When a party fails to serve a timely response
to an inspection demand, the party making the demand may move for an order
compelling a response to the inspection demand. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely response waives any
objection, including one based on privilege or work product. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (a).) “[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction… against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) 
PRELIMINARY
ISSUES 
            The Court notes that Plaintiffs
filed this motion on April 26, 2024, but the deadline for filing it was April
25, 2024 based on the May 21, 2024 hearing date due to Plaintiffs serving the
motion electronically. (See Motion, p. 10 of pdf; Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b); Id., § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3)(B).) The Court also notes,
however, that the proof of service indicates service was completed on April 25,
2024. (See Motion, p. 10 of pdf.) The Court therefore exercises its discretion
to still consider Plaintiffs’ motion, but admonishes Plaintiffs to comply with
the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going forward. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1300, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
Meet and Confer 
Although meeting and conferring is not required before bringing
motions to compel, (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404), the Court
appreciates Plaintiffs’ efforts to meet and confer with Sevadham before
bringing this motion. (Oghassabian Decl., ¶¶ 8-9; see Dept. 6 Courtroom
Information [“Parties are required to meet and confer prior to filing any
motion.”]) 
            Analysis 
Plaintiffs
indicate they served Special Interrogatories, Set One, Form Interrogatories,
Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Sevadham on June
13, 2023. (Oghassabian Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Exs. A, B.) Sevadham has not responded to
the requests, despite Plaintiffs’ meet-and-confer efforts. (Oghassabian Decl.,
¶¶ 4-9, Exs. C, D, E.) The Court finds Plaintiffs’ motion to be well taken. 
However,
the Court notes that Plaintiffs only paid one motion filing fee for what should
have been three separate motions, i.e., one for each set of discovery requests.
(See Motion, p. 8 of pdf.) Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion as
to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and orders Sevadham to provide
verified, code-compliant, objection-free responses, including all responsive
documents, to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of Documents, Set One, within 30
days of the Court’s order. 
Plaintiffs
are ordered to immediately file a separate motion to compel responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One and a separate motion to compel responses to
Form Interrogatories, Set One and pay the applicable filing fees forthwith. Once
the motions have been filed and the filing fees paid, the Court will GRANT Plaintiffs’
motions with respect to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special
Interrogatories, Set One. Otherwise, the motion will be denied without
prejudice as to those two sets of discovery requests. Assuming Plaintiffs
timely pay the respective filing fees, Sevadham must provide verified,
code-compliant responses, without objections, to Plaintiffs’ Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One, within 30 days
of the Court’s order. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS
Plaintiffs’ motion as to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and
orders Sevadham to provide verified, code-compliant, objection-free responses,
including all responsive documents, to Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, within 30 days of the Court’s order.
