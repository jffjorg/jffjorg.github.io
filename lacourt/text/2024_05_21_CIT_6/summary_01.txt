The court grants Plaintiffs' motion as to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and orders Sevadham to provide verified, code-compliant, objection-free responses, including all responsive documents, to Plaintiffs' Request for Production of Documents, Set One, within 30 days of the court's order. Plaintiffs are ordered to immediately file separate motions to compel responses to special interrogatories and form interrogatories, and pay the applicable filing fees forthwith. Once the motions have been filed and the filing fees paid, the court will grant Plaintiffs' motions with respect to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One.
