Golden State Water Company  Plaintiff’s  Motion to Approve PAGA Settlement  TENTATIVE  RULING  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion subject to the modifications  noted herein. The Court approves and awards the following: (1) $200,000 for  attorney fees to Plaintiff’s counsel; (2) $11,508.12 in costs to  Plaintiff’s counsel; (3) a service award in the amount of $5,000.00 to  Plaintiff Jacqueline Alvarez; (4) $6,207.90 in  settlement administration costs to ILYM Group; (5) no less than $282,962.98  (75% of $377,283.98) to LWDA; and (6) no less than $94,321.00 (25% of $377,283.98)  to the PAGA Members.  The Court directs Plaintiff to submit a revised proposed order  consistent with the modifications noted herein.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND  This is a representative action under the California Labor Code  Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA). On March 15, 2022, plaintiff Jacqueline  Alvarez, on behalf of the State of California as a private attorney general (Plaintiff),  filed this action against defendant Golden State Water Company (Defendant) and  Does 1 through 50, alleging various labor code violations.  On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff moved for the Court to approve settlement  of the PAGA claim alleged against Defendant. The motion is unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD  The PAGA is "a procedural statute allowing an aggrieved  employee to recover civil penalties- for Labor Code violations-that otherwise  would be sought by state labor law enforcement agencies." (Amalgamated  Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993,  1003.) The statute provides a mechanism for private enforcement of Labor Code  violations for the public benefit. (See Arias v. Superior Court (2009)  46 Cal.4th 969, 986.)  To incentivize employees to bring PAGA actions, the statute  provides aggrieved employees 25 percent of the recovered civil penalties. (Lab.  Code § 2699, subd. (i).) The remaining 75 percent is distributed to the Labor  and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) "for enforcement of labor laws and  education of employers and employees about their rights and responsibilities  under [the Labor Code]." (Lab. Code § 2699, subd. (i).)  Labor Code section 2699 provides in pertinent part: (2)    The superior court shall review and  approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part. The  proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same time that it  is submitted to the court.  (3)    A copy of the superior court’s judgment  in any civil action filed pursuant to this part and any other order in that  action that either provides for or denies an award of civil penalties under  this code shall be submitted to the agency within 10 days after entry of the  judgment or order.  (Lab. Code, § 2699, subds. (l)(2), (l)(3).)   While PAGA requires court review and approval  of settlements, it does not specify the standard or criteria for such review. (Moniz  v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 75.) Thus, “a trial court  should evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable,  and adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law  violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.”  (Id. at p. 77.) To determine if a PAGA settlement is fair, reasonable  and adequate, courts consider factors “including the strength of the  plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the proceeding, the complexity and  likely duration of further litigation, and the settlement amount.” (Id. at  p. 75.) Lastly, courts will also consider if the settlement is “adequate  in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter  future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.” (Ibid.) In considering the amount of settlement, the court is mindful that  compromise is inherent and necessary in the settlement process. (Wershba v.  Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 250.)  DISCUSSION  Plaintiff moves for court approval of  PAGA settlement under Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l).  1)      Summary of  Settlement  The parties have agreed to settle the  matter for the gross amount of $600,000. (Nordrehaug Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 3.1.) From  this, the following would be deducted: attorney fees ($200,000.00 or 33.33% of the gross settlement  amount), litigation costs (up to $13,000.00), a service award to Plaintiff ($5,000),  and settlement administration costs (up to $7,000). (Id., ¶¶ 3.2.1,  3.2.2, 3.2.3.) This leaves a net settlement amount of $375,000.00. Under Labor  Code section 2699, subdivision (i), 75% is payable to the Labor and Workforce  Development Agency (LWDA), and 25% is payable to the aggrieved  employees. Thus, the sum of $281,250.00 is payable to the LWDA, and $93,750.00  will be divided among approximately 431 employees. (Nordrehaug Decl., ¶ 4; Id.,  Ex. 1, ¶ 3.2.4.)  2)       Notice to the LWDA  Labor Code section 2699(l)(2) requires  that the settlement be provided to the Labor Workforce Development Agency  (LWDA) at the same time it is presented to the Court. Notice of the original  settlement was provided to the LWDA on April 10, 2024. (See Proof of Service,  4/10/24.) Plaintiff’s counsel declares that the settlement has been served on the  LWDA as verified in the proof of service. (Nordrehaug Decl., ¶ 13.) The LWDA  has not opposed the settlement. "[PAGA] authorizes a representative action  only for the purpose of seeking statutory penalties for Labor Code violations  (Lab. Code, § 2699, subds. (a), (g)), and an action to recover civil penalties  is fundamentally a law enforcement action designed to protect the public and  not to benefit private parties." (Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46  Cal.4th 969, 986.) There are no objections from any aggrieved employees or  others.  3)       Division of Civil Penalties  "[C]ivil penalties recovered by  aggrieved employees shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor  and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws, including the  administration of this part, and for education of employers and employees about  their rights and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously  appropriated to supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those  purposes; and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees." (Lab. Code, § 2699,  subd. (i).)  As shown above, the settlement properly  divides the net amount of civil penalties between the LWDA and aggrieved  employees.  4)       Breadth of Release  The release in the settlement agreement  is as follows:  5.2. Release by PAGA Members: All PAGA  Members are deemed to release, on behalf of themselves and their respective  former and present representatives, agents, attorneys, heirs, administrators,  successors, and assigns, the Released Parties from all “Released PAGA Claims.”  “Released PAGA Claims” means all claims  for PAGA penalties that were alleged, or reasonably could have been alleged,  based on the facts stated in the Operative Complaint and the PAGA Notice  submitted by Plaintiff to the LWDA, which occurred during the PAGA Period, and expressly  excluding all other claims, including claims for vested benefits, wrongful  termination, violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, unemployment  insurance, disability, social security, workers’ compensation, California class  claims, and PAGA claims outside of the PAGA period. In no event shall the  release of the Released PAGA Claims in this Settlement Agreement release any  individual non-PAGA claims of any individuals.  (Nordrehaug Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 5.2.)  The settlement agreement's release as to  absent aggrieved employees is appropriately limited to claims for PAGA  penalties based on the facts in the complaint and does not include any  individual non-PAGA claims. This is an appropriately limited release.  The scope of Plaintiff's individual  release is as follows:  5.1.  Plaintiff’s Release. Plaintiff and her respective former and present spouses,  representatives, agents, attorneys (including PAGA Counsel), heirs,  administrators, successors, and assigns generally, release and discharge  Released Parties from all claims, transactions, or occurrences that occurred  during the PAGA Period, including, but not limited to: (a) all claims that  were, or reasonably could have been, alleged, based on the facts contained in  the Operative Complaint and the PAGA Notice (“Plaintiff’s Release”).  Plaintiff’s Release does not extend to any claims or actions to enforce this  Agreement, or to any claims for vested benefits, unemployment benefits,  disability benefits, social security benefits, workers’ compensation benefits  that arose at any time, claims that cannot be released as a matter of law, or  based on occurrences outside the PAGA Period. Plaintiff acknowledges that  Plaintiff may discover facts or law different from, or in addition to, the  facts or law that Plaintiff now knows or believes to be true but agrees,  nonetheless, that Plaintiff’s Release shall be and remain effective in all  respects, notwithstanding such different or additional facts or Plaintiff’s  discovery of them.  5.1.1  Plaintiff’s Waiver of Rights Under California Civil Code Section 1542. For  purposes of Plaintiff’s Release, Plaintiff expressly waives and relinquishes  the provisions, rights, and benefits, if any, of section 1542 of the California  Civil Code, which reads: A general release does not extend to claims that the  creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her  favor at the time of executing the release, and that if known by him or her  would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or  Released Party.  (Nordrehaug  Decl., Ex. 1, ¶¶ 5.1, 5.1.1.)  This release is likewise acceptable.  5)       Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate  Plaintiff argues that the settlement  should be found to be fair and reasonable for various reasons: Plaintiff  complied with the necessary Labor Code administrative requirements, the  settling parties reached a compromise through arms-length negotiations,  sufficient investigation and discovery by experienced counsel to act  competently in negotiating settlement, the settlement is reasonable in light of  the parties' legal positions, the risk of continued litigation, and the  underlying purpose of the PAGA. (Motion, pp. 12-17; Nordrehaug Decl., ¶¶ 3-16.)  Under Dunk v. Ford Motor Co.  (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, a presumption of fairness exists where "(1)  the settlement is reached through arm's-length bargaining; (2) investigation  and discovery are sufficient to allow counsel and the court to act  intelligently; (3) counsel is experienced in similar litigation; and (4) the  percentage of objectors is small." (Id. at 1802.)  First, the settlement appears to have  been reached through arm's-length bargaining. The parties attended mediation with  Hon. Daniel Buckley (Ret.) in June 2023, reaching a settlement pursuant to the  mediator's proposal. (Nordrehaug Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel describes the  investigation and discovery performed in the case, including interviews with  Plaintiff and review of Defendant’s production of policies, practices, and  procedures, as well as records and data to determine the number of PAGA members  and the number of relevant pay periods. (Nordrehaug Decl., ¶¶ 3, 6; Alvarez  Decl., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff's counsel has extensive experience with this type of  litigation. (Nordrehaug  Decl., ¶¶ 7, 10-12.)  There are no objectors. The settlement is therefore presumptively fair.  6)      Civil  Penalties  Plaintiff's briefing allows this Court  to determine that the investigation and discovery by Plaintiff supports the  settlement. Plaintiff seeks civil penalties for six different violations of the  Labor Code. Plaintiff explains Defendant’s potential PAGA exposure is $2,066,00.00  for 20,660 pay periods. (Nordrehaug Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff then suggests the  actual potential recovery would likely be lower, that these calculations were  performed at the maximum statutory rate for penalties and the difficulty in  proving that each PAGA member suffered a violation for each period the employee  worked in relation to the violations at issue. (Nordrehaug Decl., ¶¶ 6-7.) Plaintiff  also suggests the actual potential recovery would likely be lower considering  the risk of not prevailing on the merits and the Court’s discretion to reduce  penalties. (Motion, 13:12-14:11.) Plaintiff further notes that Defendant  disputes having violated the Labor Code, that Defendant asserted additional  defenses to both liability and the amount of the penalties, and that Defendant  could argue no penalties before the PAGA notification should be awarded because  the violations were not intentional, and at least one Court has so ruled.  (Nordrehaug Decl., ¶ 7.)  The Court finds that the civil penalties  agreed upon are fair and reasonable. While the total award results in only $29  penalties per pay period ($600,000.00 award divided by 20,660 pay periods in  the PAGA period (Nordrehaug Decl., ¶ 6)), the Court finds this appropriate as  it considers the legal issues in this case and the risk to the parties in  proceeding to trial. The Court also finds this settlement is adequate under  PAGA, as other courts have imposed even smaller penalties. (See, e.g.,  Carrington v. Starbucks Corp. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 504, 517 [where  violations were minimal and compliance was attempted, court imposed a penalty  of $5 per violation].)  7)      Attorney Fees  and Costs  Under Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (g), an employee who  prevails in a PAGA action is entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs. (Lab.  Code, § 2699, subd. (g).) Here, Plaintiff requests attorney fees in the amount  of $200,000.00 (33.33% of the gross settlement amount) and litigation costs in  the amount of $13,000. (Marquez Decl.,  ¶ 21.) Plaintiff indicates the lodestar amount in this case is $149,587.50  and requests a multiplier of 1.3. (Nordrehaug  Decl., ¶ 8.) In reviewing such fee enhancements, the court considers the  risk of contingency, exceptional skill, and other factors such as the novelty  or difficulty of the issues. (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th  1122, 1138 (Ketchum); Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)  However, factors such as experience and skill are not considered if already  recognized by the lodestar. (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p.  1138.)  Here, Plaintiff’s lodestar is based on the billing rate of  Plaintiff’s counsel. (Nordrehaug Decl.,  ¶¶ 8, 12, Ex. 2.) Thus, the Court finds the skill and experience of Plaintiff’s  counsel has already been accounted for by the lodestar. As for enhancement  factors, Plaintiff’s counsel took a risk by taking this case on contingency.  (Nordrehaug Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff’s counsel also estimates an additional $10,000.00  to $20,000.00 in fees for managing the completion of the settlement. (Nordrehaug  Decl., ¶ 8.) The Court finds the 1.3 multiplier to be appropriate here. As  for costs, Plaintiff provided an itemization of the costs incurred in this case  ($11,508.12), which falls below the maximum of $13,000 allowed by the  settlement agreement. (Nordrehaug Decl.,  ¶ 9, Ex. 2.)  Accordingly, the Court finds the award of attorney fees and costs  in the settlement agreement are fair and reasonable.  Because the litigation costs are only $11,508.12, the Court ORDERS  $1,491.88 of the litigation expense allocation of $13,000.00 returned to the  net settlement amount and to be factored in recalculating the payments to the  LWDA and aggrieved employees.  8)      Service Award  While a plaintiff may receive reasonable enhancement payments as a  class representative, courts must balance such an award between the interests  of compensating the plaintiff for the expense or risk they incurred in bringing  the suit while avoiding creating a perverse incentive for the plaintiff to  accept suboptimal settlements in exchange for a higher enhancement payment. (See  Munoz v. BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th  399, 412.)  The settlement agreement awards Plaintiff a service award of $5,000.00,  which Plaintiff has requested. (Nordrehaug  Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 3.2.1; Alvarez Decl., ¶ 10.) In support of this request,  Plaintiff submitted a declaration stating that Plaintiff spent approximately 30-40  hours meeting with attorneys over the case and has been actively involved in  the litigation and settlement process. (Alvarez Decl., ¶  8.) Plaintiff also stated an awareness of the  professional and financial risks of bringing a PAGA action. (Alvarez Decl., ¶ 6.)  Considering the Plaintiff’s involvement and risk taken, the Court finds  the service award of $5,000.00 to be reasonable. (See Uribe v. Crown  Building Maintenance Co. (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 986, 995, 998 [noting trial  court reduced request for $10,000 enhancement award in a $370,000 PAGA  settlement to $5,000].)  9)      Settlement Administration and  Costs        The proposed settlement contemplates using the services of ILYM  Group Inc.  (ILYM) as the neutral party  that will administer the settlement. (Nordrehaug Decl., ¶ 14, Settlement  Agreement, §§ 1.2, 7.1-7.4.) ILYM is allocated $7,000 for its services per the  terms of the settlement agreement. (Motion, 9:5-15; Nordrehaug Decl., Ex. 1, ¶  3.2.3.)  ILYM provided a declaration from Anthony Rogers, ILYM's Senior  Vice President, which explains the qualifications and experience of ILYM to be  an administrator, and procedures for notice preparation and distribution. (Rogers  Decl., ¶¶ 1-7, Exs. A-C [respectively, ILYM's company curriculum vitae, security  summary and protocol, and breakdown of fee not to exceed $6,207.90].)  The Court GRANTS the settlement insofar as it seeks appointment of  ILYM Group, Inc. as the settlement administrator. ILYM Group, Inc. is ORDERED  APPOINTED as settlement administrator.  Because ILYM will only charge $6,207.90 for its services, the  Court ORDERS $792.10 of the administrator fee allocation of $7,000 returned to  the net settlement amount and to be factored in recalculating the payments to  the LWDA and aggrieved employees.  Lastly, the Court notes that no objections to the proposed  settlement appear in Plaintiff’s papers and none have been filed with the Court.  The Court thus finds that the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and  adequate to all concerned.  Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion. For the sake  of clarity and in light of the modifications to some of the amounts noted  herein, the new net settlement amount is now $377,283.98, i.e., $375,000.00  plus $2,283.98 returned from litigation costs ($1,491.88) and settlement and  administration costs ($792.10).  CONCLUSION  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion subject to the modifications  noted herein. The Court approves and awards the following: (1) $200,000 for  attorney fees to Plaintiff’s counsel; (2) $11,508.12 in costs to  Plaintiff’s counsel; (3) a service award in the amount of $5,000.00 to  Plaintiff Jacqueline Alvarez; (4) $6,207.90 in  settlement administration costs to ILYM Group; (5) no less than $282,962.98  (75% of $377,283.98) to LWDA; and (6) no less than $94,321.00 (25% of $377,283.98)  to the PAGA Members.  The Court directs Plaintiff to submit a revised proposed order  consistent with the modifications noted herein.               Plaintiff is ordered to give notice  of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
