And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings without prejudice. The Court finds that the revival of previously barred claims under AB 218 is constitutional and does not violate the Gift Clause of the California Constitution. The Court concludes that the Legislature has the power to revive claims previously barred by the claims presentation requirement, and that AB 218 was enacted for a public purpose, namely to benefit victims of childhood sexual assault and prevent further assaults. The Court notes that there are other cases pending before the Court of Appeal that may reach a different conclusion on the constitutionality of AB 218.
