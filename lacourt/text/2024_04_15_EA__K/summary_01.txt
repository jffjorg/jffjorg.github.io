And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has taken the Petition to Modify Victim Restitution off-calendar due to several reasons. First, there is no evidence that the defendant, David A. Escoto, was provided with notice of the hearing date and served with a copy of the Petition. Second, the Petitioner did not provide any legal authority for the Petition. Third, the court is a civil department, not a criminal court, and therefore lacks jurisdiction to issue a ruling. Fourth, the Petitioner represents that Matt Caluza of the California Victim Compensation Board advised him to obtain an order signed by the presiding judge, but the court is not the presiding judge. Finally, the Petitioner did not attach a copy of the original 2002 restitution order to the Petition.
