  Case Number:  24PSCP00070    Hearing Date:   April 15, 2024    Dept:  K Petitioner Don
Karlin’s Petition to Modify Victim Restitution is TAKEN OFF-CALENDAR [see
below].
Background[1]  
On February 7, 2024, Petitioner Don
Karlin (“Petitioner”) filed the instant “Petition to Modify Victim Restitution”
(“Petition”).
Discussion
Petitioner moves
the court for an order modifying the beneficiary of the restitution order
issued in Case No. KA057115, a 2002 criminal matter against offender David A.
Escoto (“Escoto”).
The court takes the
Petition off-calendar. First, there is no evidence that Escoto was provided
notice of the instant hearing date and served with a copy of the Petition.
Second, Petitioner provides the court with no legal authority for the Petition.
Third, the court is a civil department, not a criminal court. The court queries
why the Petition was not filed in Case No. KA057115. The court does not have
jurisdiction to issue any ruling. Fourth, Petitioner represents that Matt
Caluza (“Caluza”) of the California Victim Compensation Board advised him to
obtain an order signed by the presiding judge. (Karlin Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. 1). The
court makes no analysis as to the correctness of Caluza’s instruction;
regardless, the court is not the presiding judge. Fifth, Petitioner has not
attached a copy of the original 2002 restitution order.
