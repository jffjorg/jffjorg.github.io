Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment or adjudication in this case. The plaintiff, Angela Walton, alleged that she was retaliated against by the defendant, Sheriff Villanueva, for reporting harassment and unlawful conduct. The judge found that there were triable issues of fact regarding whether the defendant's proffered reasons for the adverse employment actions were pretextual, and whether the plaintiff engaged in protected activity. The judge also found that the defendant's motion for summary judgment or adjudication was denied because there were material disputes of fact regarding the whistleblower retaliation, discrimination, and failure to prevent claims.
