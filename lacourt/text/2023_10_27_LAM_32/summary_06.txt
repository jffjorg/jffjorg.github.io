Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Tiffany Haddish's motion to seal the motion to compel arbitration. The judge found that Defendant Haddish failed to provide sufficient facts to support the necessary findings under California Rules of Court, Rule 2.550. Specifically, the judge found that Defendant Haddish did not demonstrate an overriding interest that supports sealing the entire motion to compel arbitration, and that sealing the entire motion would not be narrowly tailored. The judge also found that Defendant Haddish could have redacted only specific references to the agreement instead of the entire motion. As a result, the judge denied Defendant Haddish's motion to seal and ordered her to file an unredacted version of the motion to compel arbitration.
