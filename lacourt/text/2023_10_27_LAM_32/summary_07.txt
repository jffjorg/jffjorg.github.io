And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, Mikhail Mekk and Mission Organic Center Inc., on their special motion to strike the complaint filed by plaintiff Eugene Popok. The complaint alleges breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud.

The judge found that the defendants' disclosure of the settlement agreement during a previous trial constitutes protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute, as it is a statement made in the course of a judicial proceeding. The judge also held that the litigation privilege applies to the breach of contract claim, as the settlement agreement does not clearly prohibit the conduct complained of.

Furthermore, the judge found that the plaintiff cannot demonstrate that the defendants breached the confidentiality provision of the settlement agreement, as the clause only prohibits disclosure of the terms and amount of the settlement, not any discussion of the fact of settlement. Finally, the judge held that the plaintiff cannot establish damages, as he did not have an interest in Mission Organic Center Inc. at the time he allegedly lost the opportunity to sell his interest.

As a result, the judge has granted the defendants' special motion to strike the complaint, finding that the plaintiff has no probability of success.
