And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion to compel arbitration of the individual PAGA claims brought by Plaintiff Gerra Iyob-Tessema against Defendants M Street Kitchens LLC, Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, Inc., and Restaurant Personnel, Inc. The Plaintiff is seeking penalties for alleged wage violations, while the Defendants argue that the claims are subject to arbitration.

The Judge finds that the Defendants have proven the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, which covers both individual and non-individual claims. The Judge also finds that the non-individual PAGA claims should be stayed pending arbitration, as the issues involved in the arbitration and the court action are overlapping.

The Judge grants the motion to compel arbitration as to the individual PAGA claims and stays the action as to the non-individual PAGA claims pending the outcome of arbitration. The Judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1281.2 and Section 1281.4, as well as case law, including Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC, Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana, Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc., Rocha v. U-Haul Co. of California, Franco v. Arakelian Enterprises, Inc., and Leenay v. Superior Court.
