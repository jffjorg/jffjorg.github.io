And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the Choi Defendants is overruled, and the motion to strike is denied. The complaint alleges that the Chois are liable for the harm caused to the Plaintiffs, including breach of warranty of habitability, implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge has found that the complaint sufficiently alleges that the Chois were aware of the uninhabitable conditions and failed to address them, and that they are therefore liable for the harm caused to the Plaintiffs. The judge has also found that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support claims of excessive collection of rent, tenant harassment, and retaliation. The judge has also denied the Choi Defendants' motion to strike the nuisance claim, finding that it is not duplicative of the negligence claim and that it is a viable cause of action. Finally, the judge has found that the complaint alleges sufficient facts to support claims for punitive damages and attorneys' fees.
