And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, which alleges that the defendants orally agreed to rent the premises from the decedent, Rafik Degeryan. The defendants argued that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case because there is a pending dissolution of marriage action between the parties, and that the court should abate the unlawful detainer action pending a complete resolution of the family law matter. The judge found that the defendants failed to show that both cases involve the same parties on the same causes of action, and that the dissolution of marriage action has not yet determined the character or ownership of the subject property. Therefore, the judge overruled the demurrer and ordered the moving parties to file a Notice of Related Case in Department 1 and all departments with related matters.
