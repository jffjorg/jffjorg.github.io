 Case Number:  21STCV20481    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2025    Dept:  T Eric Lee, et al. vs James J. Jaber, M.D. Motion: Motion for Order Continuing Trial and Final Status Conference DatesMoving Party: Plaintiffs Eric Lee and Jasmine LeeResponding Party: Defendant James Jaber MDTentative Ruling: GrantBACKGROUNDThis case stems from alleged injuries from a physical attack. The complaint was filed on June 1, 2021.Trial is currently scheduled for January 27, 2025. Plaintiffs Eric Lee and Jasmine Lee (“Plaintiffs”) now move to continue the trial and final status conference dates. Defendant James Jaber MD (“Defendant”) opposes and Plaintiffs reply. MOVING PARTY POSITION Plaintiffs asks for a trial continuance because Jasmine Lee will be in China celebrating the Chinese New Year during the current trial date. Therefore, they ask for a trial continuance to February 17, 2025, April 7, 2025, April 14, 2025, or May 12, 2025.OPPOSITION Defendant argues the motion did not provide the minimum notice requirement under Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b). REPLYPlaintiffs argue the continuance of this motion will cure any notice defect. ANALYSISAs an initial matter, the Court notes this motion was filed December 9, 2024, but was originally set for hearing on December 31, 2024. Since the motion is being heard on January 10, 2025, it is timely under section 1005(b). Plaintiffs’ counsel declares that when the current trial date was set, he was unaware that January 27, 2025 was two days before the Chinese New Year. (Eisenberg Decl. ¶ 5.) Because Plaintiffs’ counsel was unable to confirm his client’s availability at the time the new trial date was being considered, the Court finds sufficient good cause to continue trial. RULINGPlaintiffs’ Motion for Order Continuing Trial and Final Status Conference Dates is GRANTED. The Court will confer with the parties regarding a new trial date at the time of the hearing.  Parties are directed to be aware of their clients' future availability at the hearing.
