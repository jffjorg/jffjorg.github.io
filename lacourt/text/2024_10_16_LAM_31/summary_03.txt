And here is the summary in English text:

Judge Kerry Bensinger has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Fred Goldstein's motion for reconsideration. The motion was filed in response to the court's denial of Plaintiff's ex parte application to file a late motion to compel further responses. The court found that Plaintiff missed deadlines to file motions to compel further responses and that his ex parte motion for leave to file a late motion to compel was procedurally defective. The court also found that Plaintiff did not demonstrate good cause for the denial of his ex parte application and that his arguments were based on mistaken beliefs rather than new or different facts, circumstances, or law. As a result, the court denied Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.
