MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Christina Gozy
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC
 
 
            This is a
Song-Beverly action.  Before the court are
Plaintiff Christina Gozy’s three (3) motions to compel Defendant Mercedes Benz
USA, LLC’s further discovery responses to Plaintiff’s First Set of Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of
Documents.   
 
On August 16, 2024, the motions to compel further were heard
along with Plaintiff’s motions to compel initial responses and motion to deem
Requests for Admission admitted against Defendant.  After taking the motions under submission,
the court issued a final ruling granting Plaintiff’s motion to compel initial
responses to the Special Interrogatories and Request for Production of
Documents.  The court denied Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories and to deem Request for
Admissions admitted.  As to Plaintiff’s
motion to compel further responses, the court continued the motions to October
16, 2024 to allow the parties to first participate in an informal discovery
conference.
 
The court notes that the parties have not participated in an
informal discovery conference.  Nor have
the parties apprised the court of the status of the discovery dispute.  For these reasons, Plaintiff’s motions to
compel further responses are DENIED.
 
Defendant to give notice.
