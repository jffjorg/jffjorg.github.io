[1] The court is not foreclosing
healthPiper’s ability to seek leave to file a cross-complaint in the related
action.  If healthPiper chooses to bring
such a motion, the court will entertain the motion.


[2] The fifth cause of action for
tortious interference with contractual relations against Gowda is also subject
to demurrer on statute of limitation grounds.


[3] Defendants argue the fourth cause
of action (and indeed, the entire complaint) is preempted by the California
Uniform Trade Secrets Act and barred under Labor Code section 2802.  At least with respect to the fourth cause of
action, these arguments are underdeveloped or meritless.  The court does not address them further.
