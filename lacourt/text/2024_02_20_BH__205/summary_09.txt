And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay of proceedings. The court finds that the defendant has met its burden to establish the existence of a valid arbitration agreement. The agreement is not unconscionable, and the court will stay the lawsuit pending completion of the arbitration. The court orders that the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and California arbitration law, and that the arbitrator shall apply California law to the dispute. The court also orders that the defendant shall bear the cost of the arbitrator and other incidental costs of arbitration, and that Plaintiff shall contribute an amount equal to the filing fee to initiate a claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which he was last employed by the defendant. The court further finds that the arbitration agreement does not preclude Plaintiff from bringing an individual Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) claim, and that the agreement's waiver of PAGA claims is not substantively unconscionable.
