And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by Plaintiff Ashkan Rajaee against Defendant Weinberg Gonser Frost LLP and others. The case arises from an attorney-client dispute, where Plaintiff retained Defendant to represent him in a dispute with a former business partner. The parties signed a written engagement agreement with an arbitration provision, which defines "all disputes" as including claims for malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud. The Court previously granted Defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stayed all proceedings pending completion of the arbitration. Given the stay, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint.
