English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to set aside the order granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Caltrans. The plaintiff's counsel failed to timely file an opposition to Caltrans' motion for summary judgment, and the court granted the motion. The plaintiff now seeks relief from the judgment based on his counsel's purported excusable neglect. The court finds that counsel's mistake was not excusable, as he had ample time to file the opposition and chose to wait until the last minute to do so. The court also notes that counsel has a history of failing to timely file papers in other cases. Therefore, the court denies the motion to set aside the order granting summary judgment.
