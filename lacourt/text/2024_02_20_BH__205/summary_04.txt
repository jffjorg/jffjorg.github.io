```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court sustains Defendant Niemeyer's demurrer without leave to amend, finding that Plaintiff's allegations of alter ego liability are conclusory and lack sufficient facts to support a claim. The Court also grants in part and denies in part the motion to strike, striking allegations relating to Yelp reviews and paragraphs 13 and 14 of the First Amended Complaint.

The Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations of punitive damages are sufficient, as they allege that Defendant Niemeyer ratified the conduct of "Eric" and had advance notice of his unfitness, and yet continued to employ him with a conscious disregard of the rights and safety of others.
