  Case Number:  20SMCV01196    Hearing Date:   February 20, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   WILLIAM P. HOWELL, as Trustee of the Howell Family Trust,    Plaintiff, v.  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON, et al.,    Defendants.    Case No.:  20SMCV01196      Hearing Date:  February 20, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO SET ASIDE    ORDER GRANTING SUMMARY    JUDGMENT    BACKGROUND This lawsuit arises from property damage connected to work performed by Defendant Southern California Edison’s (“SCE’s”) outside contractor, Defendant Edison Power Constructors, Inc. (“EPC”).  While replacing a deteriorated SCE utility pole on Topanga Canyon Boulevard, EPC inadvertently drilled into an underground drainage culvert owned by Defendant the People of the State of California (or “Caltrans”), and then set the replacement pole into the broken pipe.  During a subsequent rainstorm, the blockage to the culvert caused a mudslide on Plaintiff William Howell’s property located downhill from the damaged pipe.   Plaintiff sued Caltrans for inverse condemnation.  Caltrans moved for summary judgment.  Plaintiff filed an untimely opposition, which the Court declined to consider.  Plaintiff’s opposition was also based on a declaration from counsel that was not signed under penalty of perjury, and accordingly, much of Plaintiff’s evidence (which was attached to counsel’s declaration) is inadmissible.  The Court thereafter granted summary judgment in favor of Caltrans.   Plaintiff now seeks relief from the judgment based on his counsel’s purported excusable neglect in failing to timely file the opposition.  Plaintiff argues the failure was an isolated mistake due to computer problems.   EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS The Court sustains Objection No. 1 and overrules Objections Nos. 2, 3 to the Declaration of Todd Lander.   The Court also sustains Objection Nos. 4 and 5 to the Supplemental Declaration of Todd Lander.   LEGAL STANDARD Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §473(b), both discretionary and mandatory relief is available to parties when a case is dismissed.  Discretionary relief is available under the statute as “the court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 473(b).)  Alternatively, mandatory relief is available when “accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.”  (Id.)  The purpose of the attorney affidavit provision is to “relieve the innocent client of the burden of the attorney’s fault, to impose the burden on the erring attorney, and to avoid precipitating more litigation in the form of malpractice suits.”  (Hu v. Fang (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 61, 64.)  Under the mandatory relief provision, the court is required to grant relief if the attorney admits neglect, even if the neglect was inexcusable.  (Metropolitan Service Corp. v. Casa de Palms Ltd. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1487; Graham v. Beers (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1656, 1660.) An application for discretionary or mandatory relief must be made no more than six months after entry of the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) “[W]hen relief under section 473¿is¿available, there is a strong¿public¿policy¿in¿favor¿of granting relief and allowing the requesting party his or her day in court[.]” (Rappleyea v. Campbell¿(1994) 8 Cal. 4th 975, 981-82.)  Only “very slight evidence” will be required to justify a court in setting aside default.  (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233.)  “Doubts are resolved in favor of the application for relief from default.”  (Id. at 235.) DISCUSSION Mandatory Relief The Court first addresses whether mandatory relief is available where a plaintiff fails to timely serve an opposition to a motion for summary judgment.  There is a split of authority as to whether mandatory relief is available to an order granting summary judgment.   In Avila v. Chua¿(1997) 57 Cal. App. 4th 860, the plaintiff’s¿attorney failed to timely file oppositions to two motions for summary judgment.  The trial court struck the late-filed oppositions and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.¿The trial court later denied a motion to vacate the summary judgment under¿section 473(b).  On appeal, Division Five of the Second Appellate District held the trial court erred in denying the motion to vacate because the mandatory provision of¿section 473(b)¿applied.  Relying in part on Huens v. Tatum¿(1997) 52 Cal. App. 4th 259, the court in¿Avila¿concluded the plaintiff was entitled to relief under the mandatory provision of¿section 473(b)¿because the case was “directly analogous to a default judgment.”  (Avila, 57 Cal. App. 4th at 868.)  According to the¿Avila¿court, the case was “of the kind which¿Huens¿found that the mandatory provisions were designed for: Appellant lost his day in court due solely to his lawyer’s failure to timely act.” (Id.) Subsequent rulings disapprove of the holding in Avila, including the very court that decided Avila.  (See English v. IKON Business Solutions, Inc. (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130;¿see also¿Prieto v. Loyola Marymount University¿(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 290;¿Henderson, 187 Cal.App.4th 215;¿Urban Windlands Group, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles¿(2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 993, 1000.)   In¿English, the plaintiff filed an employment discrimination suit against the defendant, her former employer. (English, 94 Cal.App.4th at 133.)¿The defendant moved for summary judgment.¿(Id.) The plaintiff did not submit an opposition with any evidence.  (Id.)  Rather, the plaintiff asserted a continuance should be granted under¿section 437c, subdivision (h).¿(Id. at 133-134.)¿The trial court denied the continuance motion and subsequently granted the summary judgment motion.¿(Id.¿at 134.)¿The plaintiff then filed a¿section 473, subdivision (b)¿motion under a mandatory relief theory. (Id. at 134.)¿The plaintiff's attorney declared he erred by failing to submit evidence in opposition rather than solely arguing for a continuance.  (Id.) The trial court denied the plaintiff's motion for relief from the judgment. (Id.) The Court of Appeal affirmed the denial of the plaintiff's motion for relief from the judgment.¿(Id. at 133.) The Court of Appeal examined the legislative history of the mandatory relief provision in¿section 473, subdivision (b).¿(Id. at 138–142.)¿The Court of Appeal concluded regarding dismissals: “[W]e construe the word ‘dismissal’ as having a limited meaning similar to the term ‘default judgment.’ This approach is supported by the history of the mandatory provision, set out above.”¿ The Court of Appeal found a summary judgment is not a default, default judgment, or dismissal. (Id.¿at p. 143.) As in English, Prieto v. Loyola Marymount University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 290, expressly rejected the holding in Avila.  There, a former employee sued a university, alleging, among other things, failure to accommodate her physical disability under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. The trial court granted the university’s motion for summary judgment and denied the former employee’s motion to vacate the judgment dismissing her complaint. The former employee sought to vacate the judgment based on the mandatory relief provision.  The former employee’s attorney asserted in a declaration that he did not receive the motion for summary judgment.  The Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that the mandatory relief provision of¿§ 473, subd. (b), should be limited to the narrow class of cases in which a default judgment or a dismissal has been entered.  The fact that the former employee sought to rely on the mandatory “attorney-fault” provision of¿§ 473, subd. (b), was fatal to her motion to set aside the order granting summary judgment. The mandatory provision of¿§ 473, subd. (b), did not empower the trial court to set aside the summary judgment.  The mandatory provision of¿§ 473, subd. (b), only empowered the trial court to set aside a default judgment or a dismissal.  The Court follows the reasoning in English and its progeny.  As such, Plaintiff cannot seek mandatory relief.   Discretionary Relief The Court next considers whether Plaintiff is entitled to discretionary relief.  Caltrans argues that Plaintiff’s counsel’s mistake is not excusable because Plaintiff had two months to file an opposition yet waited until the last minute to file, knowing that there would be no staff available to help and counsel would be away from the office.  Caltrans also points out that this was not an isolated incident and counsel previously failed to timely file papers in connection with another motion.  The Court agrees with Caltrans.   A party who seeks discretionary relief under¿Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b) must demonstrate that the mistake, inadvertence, or general neglect was excusable.  In determining whether the attorney’s mistake or inadvertence was excusable, the court inquires whether a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances might have made the same error.  (Zamora v. Clayborn Contracting Group, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 258.)  Conduct falling below the professional standard of care, such as failure to timely object or to properly advance an argument, is not excusable.  (Id.)  To hold otherwise would be to eliminate the express statutory requirement of excusability and effectively eviscerate the concept of attorney malpractice.  (Id.)  When the mistake is excusable and the party seeking relief has been diligent, courts have often granted discretionary relief under this provision if no prejudice to the opposing party will ensue.  (Id.)  Courts look with particular disfavor on a party who, regardless of the merits to his or her cause, attempts to take advantage of the mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or neglect of his or her adversary.  (Id.) Here, Plaintiff had two months to file an opposition.  Yet Plaintiff’s counsel waited until the last minute to file the papers even though he had completed the papers earlier.  It was imprudent to wait until the last minute to file the papers – mere hours before the deadline – without staff support and from a different state.  It is not conduct a reasonable person would do.  Counsel maintains that he could not have submitted the papers earlier because he was waiting on his expert to sign the declaration.  Yet there is no explanation why the expert could not have signed the declaration sooner.   Plaintiff’s counsel also points to the press of other business.  But being busy with other litigation matters is not a legitimate excuse.  (Huh v. Wang (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1423 (concluding that the press of business alone is not sufficient grounds for discretionary relief).)  The “stresses of a busy law practice,” the “hurry to meet the deadline” and “several concurrent obligations due to other pending litigation” do not constitute excusable neglect.  (Ambrose v. Michelin North America (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1355.)   Counsel’s failure to timely file the opposition was also not a one-off event.  Plaintiff failed to timely file his motion for leave to amend the third amended complaint (“ATAC”).  Plaintiff compounded the error by failing to timely file his reply brief in support of his motion for leave to file the ATAC.  Additionally, Plaintiff was forced to file a “supplemental declaration” in support of his 473(b) motion because he “inadvertently” failed to attach all the opposition papers to his initial declaration.    Plaintiff’s reliance on Communidad en Action v. Los Angeles City Council (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1132 is unavailing.  The error, there, was a single calendaring mistake by lead counsel.  It was an “isolated mistake in an otherwise vigorous and thorough presentation of Comunidad’s claims.”  (Id.)  The mistake here is not a calendaring error that anyone could make; counsel made the unreasonable decision of filing the papers at the last minute, when he knew there would be no staff and while he was out of state.  It was also not an isolated mistake.              In any event, Plaintiff was able to raise arguments in his opposition at the hearing on the motion.  His counsel was given ample time to do so.  The Court considered these arguments, ultimately granting the motion for summary judgment.   On these facts, the Court denies the motion to set aside its order on summary judgment.   CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, the Court DENIES the motion to set aside its order granting summary judgment in favor of Caltrans.     IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: February 20, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
