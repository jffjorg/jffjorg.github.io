Background 
Plaintiff Claremont Village Expansion Borrower, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges
as follows:

          On August 23, 2012,
Plaintiff, as landlord, and Duang Dao Johnson (“Johnson”) and Bundid Thammniyai
(“Thammniyai”) (together, “Defendants”), as tenants, entered into a written
Shopping Center Lease (“Lease”) regarding the commercial premises located at
201 N. Indian Hill Blvd., Suite 100 in Claremont (“subject property”). The
Lease was subsequently amended by a written First Amendment of Lease dated
October 2017, wherein the base rent was adjusted and the lease term was
extended through January 4, 2023. On or about August 14, 2023, Defendants
vacated the subject property. At the time of vacating, Defendants were
delinquent in the payment of rent and/or other lease obligations. 
On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting a cause of
action against Defendants and Does 1-100 for breach of written lease. 
On October 1, 2024, Johnson’s default was entered; that day, Plaintiff
dismissed Thammniyai, without prejudice. 
A Case Management Conference is set for February 7, 2025. Pending before
the Court is Plaintiff’s application for default judgment.

Discussion 
Plaintiff’s application for default is granted;
however, Plaintiff is directed to resubmit a proposed judgment, listing
damages in Paragraph 6(a)(1) as $173,516.18 (i.e., $178,355.09 minus $4,838.91

and deleting out the figure of -$4,838.91 from the “other” box in Paragraph
