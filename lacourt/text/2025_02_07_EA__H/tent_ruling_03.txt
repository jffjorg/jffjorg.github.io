[FN1] Plaintiff’s Request for Court
Judgment (Judicial Council Form CIV-100) contains a mathematical error in
Paragraph 2(a); $178,355.09 minus $4,838.91 equals $173,516.18 (not
$173,496.18, as stated). Additionally, Plaintiff’s summary of the case contains
a mathematical error on page 2, lines 4-6 (i.e., erroneously stating that
$178,355.08 minus $4,838.91 equals $176,920.33).
