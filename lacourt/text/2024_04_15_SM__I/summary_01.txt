And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is reviewing various motions, including a plaintiff's in limine motion to determine whether an agency fee must be deducted. The judge will not rule on this motion until the case is ready for trial. The judge also notes that the expert may opine on numbers, but not legal conclusions. The judge is concerned that expert testimony may be considered advocacy and advises the expert to avoid using adjectives. The judge will defer ruling on defendant's motions in limine until after the 402 hearings. The judge grants the motion to seal confidential financial information, citing the defense's interest in keeping this information private. The judge warns that confidential information will not be kept private during trial and advises the parties to agree to offer redacted versions of documents.
