And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling in this case is that the defendant, Honda, has made a motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's Song-Beverly Act case. The court has considered the arguments presented by both parties and has decided to grant the motion, except for the issue of waiver. The court has determined that a valid arbitration agreement exists and that Honda is a third-party beneficiary of the contract. The court has also found that the dispute at issue is within the scope of the arbitration clause and that the clause is mutual, meaning that both parties can be compelled to arbitrate. The court has also considered the issue of waiver, which is the defendant's delay in bringing the motion and its conduct during the discovery process. The court has found that defendant's conduct, including its delay in bringing the motion and its failure to provide timely responses to discovery, constitutes waiver and has decided to inquire further about the defendant's intentions.
