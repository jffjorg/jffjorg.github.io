 
Plaintiff, Ellen Kallen, seeks a writ of attachment against
Defendant, Raymond York, in the amount of $1,550,000.[1]
Defendant, Raymond York, opposes the application.[2]

 
The application for a writ of attachment is denied. 
 
The court does not rule on Defendant’s
request for judicial notice or his evidentiary objections. Given Plaintiff’s
showing on the application, the court need not reach those issues.
 
APPLICABLE
LAW
 
The court shall issue a right to attach order if the court finds
all of the following:
 
(1)    The
claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be
issued.
(2)    The
plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon which the
attachment is based.
(3)    The
attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim
upon which the attachment is based.
(4)    The
amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 484.090.)
 
“The application [for a writ of attachment] shall be supported by
an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented would be
entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 484.030.) Statutory attachment procedures
are purely creations of the legislature and as such “are subject to ‘strict
construction.’ ” (Hobbs v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 79; see also Nakasone
v. Randall (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 757, 761.) A judge does not have authority
to order any attachment that is not provided for by the attachment statutes. (Jordan-Lyon
Productions, Ltd. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1459,
1466.) “The declarations in the moving papers must contain evidentiary facts,
stated ‘with particularity,’ and based on actual personal knowledge with all
documentary evidence properly identified and authenticated.” (Hobbs v. Weiss,
supra, 73 Cal.App.4th at 79-80.) “In contested applications, the
court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective
parties and make a determination of the probable outcome of the
litigation.” (Id. at 80 [cleaned up].)
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Plaintiff’s
application is defective because Plaintiff failed to submit a memorandum of
points and authorities in support of her application. Pursuant to the
California Rules of Court (CRC), a memorandum of points and authorities is
required for a pre-judgment application for attachment.  (CRC Rules, 3.1103, subd. (a)(1); 3.1112,
subd. (a)(3); 3.1113, subd. (a); and 3.1114.) “The court may construe the
absence of a memorandum as an admission that the motion . . . is not
meritorious and cause for its denial . . . .” (CRC, Rule 3.1113, subd.
(a).)  Furthermore, “[t]he Attachment Law
statutes are subject to strict construction.” (Epstein v. Abrams (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1168.)  The court
denies the applications based on Plaintiff’s failure to file a memorandum of
points and authorities with the application. 

 
CONCLUSION 
 
The application is DENIED without prejudice.
(Cf. Code Civ. Proc., § 485.220, subd. (b).)
 
If Plaintiff intends to refile her
application, she may want to consider the mostly well-taken evidentiary
objections filed by Defendant. Further, illegible documents are not admissible
as evidence.
 
 
IT
IS SO ORDERED.
