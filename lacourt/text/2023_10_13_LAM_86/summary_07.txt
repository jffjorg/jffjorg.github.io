The judge is considering a memorandum of costs filed by the plaintiff, seeking recovery of $72,875.89. The defendants have opposed the request, reducing the amount to $69,276.33. The judge notes that the defendants have represented that $24,554.50 of the costs was incurred preparing briefs and supporting papers for an evidentiary hearing on April 13, 2023. The judge has reviewed the billing records and finds that the defendants did not incur these fees on April 12 and 13, 2023, as claimed by the plaintiff's attorney, Raucher. After deducting certain costs, the total attorney's fees sought by the defendants total $64,128. The judge will take this information into consideration when making a final ruling.
