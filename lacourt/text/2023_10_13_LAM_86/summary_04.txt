And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Mitchell Beckloff, has issued a tentative ruling denying the application for a writ of attachment filed by Plaintiff Ellen Kallen against Defendant Raymond York. The application seeks a writ of attachment in the amount of $1,550,000. The Judge found that the application is defective due to the lack of a memorandum of points and authorities in support of the application, as required by the California Rules of Court. The Judge also noted that the attachment statutes are subject to strict construction and that the court may construe the absence of a memorandum as an admission that the motion is not meritorious and cause for its denial. The application is denied without prejudice, and the Plaintiff may refile the application with a memorandum of points and authorities.
