And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses Petitioner's challenge to the State Board's administrative findings on the Final CAO. Petitioner argues that the Board prejudicially abused its discretion in naming Petitioner as a responsible party for clean-up and abatement orders. The Judge finds that Petitioner's argument is not fully developed and fails to explain the legal grounds requiring the State Board to conduct a hearing. The Judge also rejects Petitioner's new arguments raised in reply, including its responsibility as a foreclosing lender and its claims under environmental laws not applicable to this case. The Judge concludes that the Board has reasonably named Petitioner as a discharger and responsible party, and that Petitioner is not entitled to relief.
