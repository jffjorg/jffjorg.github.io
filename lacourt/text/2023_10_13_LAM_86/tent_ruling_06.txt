Case Number: BC408948
Hearing Date: October 13, 2023 
 
 
[Tentative]       ORDER
GRANTING MOTION TO TAX COSTS IN PART 
 
 
Plaintiffs, Michael Khorshidi and Nejatolah
Rabbanian, move for an order taxing the costs, including attorney’s fees,
sought by Defendants, Alexander Javaheri
and David JavaherI, through a memorandum of costs filed on July 6, 2023. After
certain adjustments for appellate fees and costs (see Opposition 12, fn. 4 and 5),
Defendants seek recovery of $69,276.33 in fees and costs in post-judgment
enforcement matters.[1]
 
Plaintiffs’ request for judicial
notice (RJN) of Exhibits A through I is granted.
 
RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
The background facts and long history of this
litigation are summarized, in detail, in the Court of Appeal’s decision filed
on August 5, 2021 and this court’s order dated April 13, 2023 denying
Defendants’ motion for appointment of an elisor. (See RJN Exh. E and H.) That
full summary of this action is not repeated here but is incorporated by
reference. In addition, this court has been assigned to hear this matter since
2014.
 
The following procedural history is particularly
relevant to this motion: 
 
On July 17, 2017, the court entered judgment in
this matter finding in favor of
Defendants and as well as Cross-Complainant Parviz Abdi. The judgment provides
in pertinent part: 
 
B. Judgment against the Majority Partners on the
Javaheri Cross-Complaint 
 
1. Declaratory judgment shall be, and hereby is,
entered in favor of Cross-Complainants the Javaheris, and Abdi, and against
Cross-Defendants the Majority Partners, as requested by the Javaheri
Cross-Complaint, as follows: 
 
MICHAEL KHORSHIDI and NEJATOLAH RABBANIAN are
defaulting co-venturers and ALEXANDER JAVAHERI, DAVID JAVAHERI and PARVIZ ABDI
are entitled to exercise their buy-out rights as against MICHAEL KHORSHIDI and
NEJATOLAH RABBANIAN under Section 9 of the Joint Venture Agreement between the
parties relating to 5th and L.A., a Joint Venture. No price or date for the
buy-out of joint venture interests of MICHAEL KHORSHIDI or NEJATOLAH RABBIAN is
being set or established by the Court, such matters not being encompassed by
the pleadings and not before the Court.
 
C. Judgement in favor of Abdi and against Majority
Partners on the Abdi Cross-Complaint 
 
1.     
Judgment of specific performance shall be, and
hereby is, entered in favor of Cross-Complainant Abdi and against
Cross-Defendants, the Majority Partners, requiring MICHAEL KHORSHIDI and
NEJATOLAH RABBANIAN to specifically perform under Paragraph 9.3 of the Joint
Venture Agreement between the parties relating to 5th and L.A., a Joint
Venture, by allowing PARVIZ ABDI (along with the Javaheris, if they so choose)
to exercise the right to purchase the interests of MICHAEL KHORSHIDI and
NEJATOLAH RABBANIAN in said Joint Venture due to those individuals being
defaulting co-ventures. No price or date for the buy-out of joint venture
interests of MICHAEL KHORSHIDI or NEJATOLAH RABBIAN is being set or established
by the Court, such matters not being encompassed by the pleadings and not
before the Court . . . .
 
(RJN Exh. D.)
 
On October 12, 2021, the Court of Appeal affirmed
this court’s judgment except as to an issue related to prejudgment interest.
The Court of Appeal remanded the matter to this court to determine whether Defendants
were entitled to prejudgment interest.
 
On June 15, 2022, in an attempt to enforce the
judgment, Defendants filed their motion for elisor, which argued in part: 
 
After the Judgment was affirmed on appeal, the
Javaheris sent their demand for sale at the 2013 appraisal amount to [Plaintiffs],
yet [Plaintiffs] have refused to proceed. [¶] Accordingly, the Court now should
use its broad equitable powers to enforce the 2017 judgment, by appointing an
Elisor to execute all necessary transfer documents on behalf of [Plaintiffs] so
as to effectuate the transfers of [Plaintiffs’] interests in the Joint Venture.
Further, such transfers must be based on the 2013 appraisal amount, which is
final and binding pursuant to the JV Agreement, to be offset by any credit due
to the Javaheris.  (RJN Exh. F.)
 
The court heard argument on the motion
on October 26, 2022 and took the matter under submission. On November 23, 2022,
the court issued an order indicating it was inclined to grant the motion requesting
appointment of the elisor; the court set an evidentiary hearing “for purposes
of determining the buy-out price given required adjustments and/or offsets.”
(Minute Order 11/23/22 [November 23, 2022 Ruling].)
 
On April 13, 2023, the court held an evidentiary
hearing on the motion requesting appointment of an elisor and took the matter
under submission. On April 24, 2023, the court issued its order denying the
motion.  
 
On July 6, 2023, Defendants filed a memorandum of
costs requesting postjudgment costs of $72,875.89, including $72,557.89 in
attorney’s fees incurred between June 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023.  As noted earlier, Defendants have since reduced the request to
$69,276.33.
 
On July 21, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their motion
to tax Defendants’ claimed costs.  
 
SUMMARY OF APPLICABLE LAW 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 685.040 states: 
 
The judgment
creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a
judgment. Attorney's fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in
costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by
law. Attorney's fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as
costs collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award
of attorney's fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of
paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of
Section 1033.5.
 
“Allowable costs shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(2).) 
 
“If the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State
Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774 [Ladas].) “On the other
hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the
burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Ibid.)
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendants Satisfy the Threshold
Requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 685.040 for Post-Judgment Fees
and Costs
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section
685.040: 
 
[T]here are two requirements before a motion for an award of
postjudgment attorney fees may be awarded as costs: (1) the fees must have been
incurred to ‘enforce’ a judgment; and (2) the underlying judgment had to
include an award for attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision
(a)(10)(A), which provides
that attorney fees may be awarded when authorized by contract. (Jaffe v.
Pacelli (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 927, 935.) 

 
Defendants satisfy the two requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure section 685.040. First, the claimed fees on the
memorandum of costs, including attorney’s fees related to the motion for the
appointment of an elisor, were incurred to enforce this court’s 2017 judgment. (See
RJN Exh. F; Raucher Decl. ¶¶ 2-12.) Second,
the Corrected Judgment entered by the court on June 6, 2022 found Defendants to
be the prevailing parties and included an attorney’s fee award pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (a)(10)(A) in favor of Defendants.
(Minute Order, 6/6/22.) That Defendants meet the threshold requirements of Code
of Civil Procedure section 685.040 is undisputed by Plaintiffs in their moving
and reply papers.
 
Defendants Have Submitted Supporting
Documentation 
 
Plaintiffs contend, however, Defendants “have provided
no basis whatsoever for evaluating whether their claimed costs or attorney’s
fees are proper.” (Memo 8:25-26.) In opposition, consistent with the procedure
set forth in Ladas, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at 774, Defendants
have submitted documentation supporting their cost request, including
attorney’s fees. (See Raucher Decl.) Accordingly, Petitioner’s “no basis” argument
is moot.  
 
Defendants’ Motion for Appointment of an Elisor
Was a Reasonable and Necessary Litigation Tactic to Enforce the Judgment
 
A motion for fees under Code of Civil
Procedure section 685.040 requires the trial court to exercise its discretion
and determine the amount of reasonable and necessary attorney fees and costs. (Chinese
Yellow Pages Co. v. Chinese Overseas Marketing Service Corp. (2008) 170
Cal.App.4th 868, 885.) 
 
Fees should not be denied simply because
the moving party’s efforts to enforce a judgment were unsuccessful. “Litigation
often involves a succession of attacks upon an opponent's case; indeed the
final ground of resolution may only become clear after a series of unsuccessful
attacks. Compensation is ordinarily warranted even for unsuccessful forays.”  (City of Los Angeles v. Metropolitan Water
Dist. of Southern California (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 290, 307.) “A litigant
should not be penalized for failure to find the winning line at the outset,
unless the unsuccessful forays address discrete unrelated claims, are pursued
in bad faith, or are pursued incompetently, i.e., are such that a reasonably
competent lawyer would not have pursued them. Time not reasonably spent by
counsel for the prevailing party need not be compensated and bad faith can
constitute a basis for a total disentitlement.” 
(City of Sacramento v. Drew (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1287,
1303.)  
 
These equitable principles apply to a
request for post-judgment enforcement fees under Code of Civil Procedure section
685.040. (See Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 44, 92 [“The trial court has broad discretion to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee, and the award of such fees is governed by equitable
principles”]; Chinese Yellow Pages, supra, 170 Cal.App.4th at
885-886 [applying Code of Civil Procedure section 685.040]; Logtale, Ltd. v.
IKOR, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2019) 2019 WL 12517082 at *4 [same]; PSM Holding
Corp. v. National Farm Financial Corp. (C.D. Cal. 2010) 743 F.Supp.2d 1136,
1165 [same].)  
 
Plaintiffs contend Defendants are not
entitled to attorney’s fees related to the motion for appointment of an elisor
because Defendants “asserted non-meritorious arguments . . . to circumvent or
evade this Court’s prior judgment and thus their claimed fees related to that
Motion . . . caused unnecessary litigation, . . .” through the motion. (Memo 11:20-.)  Specifically, Plaintiffs contend the motion
was unreasonable and unnecessary because “the Court had already found the 2013
appraisal price could not be enforced and therefore it was improper for the
Javaheris to seek enforcement of it in the Motion for Elisor under the auspices
of enforcing the 2017 Judgment.” (Memo 12:4-7.)
 
Although Plaintiffs ultimately convinced the
court it would be error to grant the motion for appointment of an elisor, the
court initially indicated it intended to grant the motion and set an
evidentiary hearing to determine “the buy-out price given required adjustments
and/or offsets.” (November 23, 2022 Ruling.) In the November 23, 2022 Ruling,
the court rejected various arguments raised by Plaintiffs in their opposition
to the motion for appointment of an elisor and now reiterated in their motion
to tax costs. Among other things, the court initially ruled as follows: 
 
Plaintiffs challenged the [2013] appraisals [of Krycler]—the
foundation for the valuation of the joint venture—in this action. The court
rejected Plaintiffs’ claim after hearing witness testimony and considering
documentary evidence during trial. The court’s statement of decision dated June
1, 2017 reflects the court’s finding the appraisals were valid. . . . [¶]
 
Given the court’s final judgment, it appears it would be “reasonless
for [this] court to bring about unnecessary litigation and delay an inevitable
result by requiring [the Javaheris and Abdi] to initiate a new action against
[Khorshidi and Rabbanian] to obtain what was already [theirs] under the
existing judgment.” . . . . [¶]
 
Plaintiffs’ arguments—attempting to avoid complying with the 2017
Judgment—opposing the Javaheris’ motion are not persuasive. 
 
First, the court is not modifying the now final 2017 judgment—the court
is merely implementing it. Plaintiffs have been ordered to comply with the
Joint Venture Agreement and its buy-out provisions. Plaintiffs acknowledge
Krycler determined the fair market value of the joint venture pursuant to the
terms of the Joint Venture Agreement. To the extent, Plaintiffs attempted to
undermine Krycler’s opinion, they failed. The court upheld the appraisals and
(after considering significant testamentary and documentary evidence) found the
appraisals were unassailable. The buy-out provisions of the Joint Venture
Agreement do not require the court’s involvement, but Plaintiffs have chosen to
not comply with the court’s specific performance command in the 2017 Judgment
necessitating enforcement measures. To adopt Plaintiffs’ position is as if the
2017 Judgment does not exist; Plaintiffs ignore the 2017 Judgment and its terms
to escape the relief obtained against them in the underlying litigation. . . . [¶]
 
(November 23, 2023 Ruling.)
 
The evidentiary hearing with the particularities of establishing
the buy-out price caused the court to rethink its prior expressed intent to
grant the motion to appoint an elisor. Ultimately, 
the court determined it would be inequitable to use an
elisor in aid of enforcement of the court’s judgment. The court reasoned, in
part, that “use of an elisor appears to conflict with the court’s judgment
finding it inappropriate to set a buy-out price.” (RJN Exh. H.) However, that
was not the only reason that the court ultimately denied the motion. The court
also stated: “Having reviewed the reporter's transcript of the proceedings held
before Judge Heeseman on January 10 and 31, 2012, it is not entirely clear
whether [Plaintiffs] could be deemed to have consented to the appraisal
process.” (Ibid.) The court denied the motion for appointment of an
elisor, in part, due to the “lack of clarity concerning [Plaintiffs’]
consensual participation of the appraisal process (and their related challenge
to values).” (Ibid.) While Plaintiffs had been unsuccessful at trial in undermining
the appraisals leading to a finding of their validity such that the appraisals
could be used for the buy-out value, the court also reasoned “resolution of the
matter is not as simple or straightforward as that in Blueberry Properties,
LLC v. Chow (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1021 or Rayan v. Dykeman
(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1629, 1635.” (Ibid.)   
 
While the motion for appointment of an elisor was
ultimately unsuccessful, it was a reasonable and necessary litigation tactic to
enforce the 2017 judgment. For the reasons stated in the November 23, 2022 Ruling,
the court cannot conclude the motion for appointment of an elisor was brought
in bad faith or was frivolous. Given the protracted history of this case; the
judgment of specific performance in favor of Defendants; and Defendants’
non-frivolous argument Plaintiffs were bound by the 2013 appraisal price and the
court’s finding the appraisals were unassailable, a reasonably competent lawyer
could have brought the motion for appointment of an elisor as an effort to
enforce the 2017 judgment. Accordingly, Defendants are entitled to their reasonable
attorney’s fees incurred in connection with the motion for appointment of an
elisor, including the evidentiary hearing held on April 13, 2023.
 
Lodestar Analysis of Fee Request 
 
“The determination of what constitutes a
reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’
i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable
hourly rate. . . .’  [T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services
in the community. . . .” (Graciano v.
Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) Generally,
the reasonable hourly rate used for the lodestar calculation is the rate
prevailing in the community for similar work. 
(Center for Biological Diversity
v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 616.)  In making its calculation, the court may rely
on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees, the
difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied, and
affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and
rate determinations in other cases.  (569 East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry
Against the Dump, Inc., (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437.)  
 
“The verified time statements of the
attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of
a clear indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005)
132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.) If the motion is supported by evidence, the opposing
party must respond with specific evidence showing that the fees are
unreasonable. (Premier Medical Management
Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550,
560-63.) The court has discretion to reduce fees that result from inefficient
or duplicative use of time.  (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California
State University, supra, 132 Cal.App.4th at 395.) 

 
              Reasonable
Hourly Rate
 
Defendants request hourly rates of $650
in 2022 and $695 in 2023 for seasoned and skilled attorney Stephen Raucher;
$275 in 2022 and $340 in 2023 for associate Yunfie Ni; and $195 for three
paralegals. (Raucher Decl. ¶¶ 7-9.) 
Based on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as
well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the attorneys requesting fees,
and the legal issues in the motion for the appointment of an elisor and
evidentiary hearing, the court finds that these hourly rates are reasonable and
well within legal community standards in Los Angeles. Plaintiffs have not
developed any argument to the contrary.
 
              Reasonable
Number of Hours
 
For this motion, Defendants seek recovery
of $64,449 in attorney and paralegal fees incurred on judgment-enforcement
matters, including the motion for appointment of an elisor, between June 1,
2022 and June 30, 2023. (See Raucher Decl. ¶¶ 6 and 8-10.) Specifically,
Defendants request fees for 51.20 hours of legal work performed by attorney
Raucher; 90.90 hours of legal work performed by associate Ni; and 13.4 hours of
paralegal work. (Ibid.)  
 
In his declaration, attorney Raucher
provides the following “breakdown” of the fees: 
 
(1) $12,294.50 in fees preparing the moving papers of the Elisor
Motion (6/8/2022 – 6/15/2022); (2) $4,690.00 in fees reviewing and analyzing
[Plaintiffs’] and Abdi’s Opposition papers, and preparing the Reply in support
of the Elisor Motion (6/24/2022 – 6/30/2022); (3) $2,511.00 in fees preparing
for and conducting the July 8, 2022 Hearing on the Elisor Motion and
posthearing related work (7/7/2022 – 8/3/2022); (4) $6,549.50 in fees reviewing
and analyzing Abdi’s Supplemental Brief and [Plaintiffs’] Objection/Response
thereto, and preparing the Javaheris’ Objection papers (8/18/2022 – 9/30/2022);
(5) $4,617.50 in fees preparing for and conducting the October 26, 2022 Hearing
on the Elisor Motion, and post-hearing related work (10/25/2022 – 11/23/2022);
(6) $24,544.50 in fees preparing for and conducting the Evidentiary Hearing on
the Elisor Motion (4/12/2023 – 4/13/2023); (7) $4,038.00 in fees preparing for
and conducting the Evidentiary Hearing on the Elisor Motion (4/12/2023 –
4/13/2023); (8) $5,204.00 in fees in connection with Post-Evidentiary Hearing
work, including analyzing judgment collection issues and tools, propounding
judgment debtor discovery, researching post-judgment attorney’s fees, etc.
(4/26/2023 – 6/30/2023). (Raucher Decl. ¶ 6.) 
 
These amounts total $64,449, as do the
hours specified in paragraphs 8-10 of Raucher’s declaration for the attorney
and paralegal work. (Raucher Decl. ¶¶ 8-10.) Raucher has authenticated the billing
records that generally corroborate the summary in Raucher’s declaration
concerning the amount of legal work performed. (Raucher Decl. ¶¶ 2-5, Exh. A.)[2]  
 
The court concludes attorney Raucher’s declaration and
the corroborating billing records satisfy Defendants’ initial burden of proof
to justify the request for $64,449 in
attorney and paralegal fees (as well as the additional expenses discussed
below). Thus, the burden shifts to Plaintiffs to respond with specific evidence
and argument showing the fees are unreasonable. (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee
Assn., supra, 163 Cal.App.4th 560-63.)
 
In reply, Plaintiffs challenge the hours
requested on several grounds. (See Reply 10-13.)  Plaintiffs first contend, generally, that
“blocked billing” and various redactions prevent Plaintiffs or the court from
determining the reasonable lodestar fee. The court is not persuaded by this
general argument. “[A]n award of attorney fees may be based on counsel's
declarations, without production of detailed time records.”  (Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v.
Julian Union Elementary School Dist. (2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 970, 995.) The
court acknowledges “trial courts retain discretion to penalize block billing
when the practice prevents them from discerning which tasks are compensable and
which are not.” (Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215
Cal.App.4th 972, 1010.) Here, however, attorney Raucher has described the legal
work performed and the billing records corroborate his declaration. Many of the
billing entries are not “blocked” or redacted. Moreover, Plaintiffs and the
court can assess the reasonableness of the work performed from the blocked
entries and Raucher’s declaration.  While
some information is redacted, the relevant entries include sufficient
unredacted information for a lodestar analysis. Significantly, Defendants do
not seek recovery of the fees incurred from May 5, 2023 to June 8, 2023, the
only entries completely redacted.  (See
Oppo. 12, fn. 4, 5.)  
 
Plaintiffs next contend “[m]any of the
claimed attorney’s fees are for unrelated matters having to do with work
performed with respect to Abdi, not [Plaintiffs], for which the Javaheris
should not be compensated.” (Reply 10:4-5.) Plaintiffs point out the billing
records include legal work reviewing and analyzing certain papers filed by Abdi
in connection with the motion for appointment of an elisor and the evidentiary
hearing. (Ibid.) However, Plaintiffs do not discuss the substance of
Abdi’s filings in any detail.  
 
While Defendants and Abdi filed a joint
brief “relating to the proper calculation of the buyout price,” they
“disagree[d], however, about distribution between them, of the buyout
rights.”  (Abdi Brief filed 3/22/23.) Accordingly,
Abdi filed separate briefs on issues for which he was adverse to Defendants’
interests. (See e.g., ibid.; Abdi brief filed 4/5/23.) 
 
Apportionment of fees is not required if
fee-bearing and non-fee-bearing claims or legal activities are inextricably
intertwined. (See Fed-Mart Corp. v. Pell
Enterprises, Inc. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 215, 227.) Plaintiffs do not
discuss all the different briefs that were filed by Defendants and Abdi or
explain why it was unreasonable for Defendants to review and analyze Abdi’s
briefs or draft a separate brief regarding allocation, considering that
Defendants’ and Abdi’s interests were not always consistent. While Plaintiffs
state the “allocation issue was strictly
an issue between Abdi and the Javaheris” (Reply 10, fn. 3), Defendants needed
to respond to such issues in connection with the motion for appointment of an
elisor—a motion brought to enforce the judgment against Plaintiffs. 
 
On this briefing, the court concludes Defendants’
legal work related to Abdi’s briefs, and also Defendants’ separate briefing
regarding allocation, were inextricably intertwined with Defendants’
enforcement efforts against Plaintiffs. In their reply brief, Plaintiffs fail to show that the fees
requested for such work were unnecessary or unreasonable.  
 
Plaintiffs also object to Defendants
request fees for correspondence and collaboration between Defendants and Abdi. (Reply
10:22-23.) For the same reasons discussed earlier, Plaintiffs do not prove such
legal work was unnecessary or unreasonable in the context of the post-judgment
enforcement proceedings. Plaintiffs do not show such legal work can be
reasonably separated from the other aspects of the motion for appointment of an
elisor and related enforcement proceedings, which are compensable.  
 
Plaintiffs object to “secretarial” work
performed by paralegals, such as organizing, redacting, and highlighting trial
exhibits. (Reply 11:11-17.) Plaintiffs cite no authority that such paralegal
work is non-compensable. The court finds that organizing, redacting, and
highlighting trial exhibits (and related paralegal work) was reasonable
and necessary. (See Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th
44, 92 [“courts have approved including paralegal fees as attorney fees”].) In
fact, delegating such tasks to a paralegal reduces time associated with higher
billing attorney supervision of clerical staff.
 
Finally, Plaintiffs contend a negative
multiplier should be applied to the lodestar to account for Defendants’ lack of
success on the motion for appointment of an elisor. (Reply 12: 28.) A parties’
success is an equitable factor that the court may consider in determining the
lodestar fee.  (See Gorman v.
Tassajara Development Corp., supra, 178 Cal.App.4th at 92 [factors to be considered
in fee award include “the skill required and employed . . . [and] the success
or failure”]; see also Save Our Uniquely Rural Community Environment v.
County of San Bernardino (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1185 [“a trial court may
reduce attorney fees based on the plaintiff's degree of success”].)  
 
In this case, Defendants brought a motion for appointment
of an elisor that necessitated an evidentiary hearing and substantial legal
work from Plaintiffs, Defendants, Abdi and the court.  Ultimately, Defendants were unsuccessful. As
discussed earlier, the court finds the motion for was not brought in bad faith
and was not frivolous, and, for the reasons discussed above, was a reasonable
and necessary litigation tactic. 
 
Considering the circumstances of the
case, the court agrees with Plaintiffs a reasonable fee award for the post-judgment
enforcement proceedings should consider Defendants’ lack of success on the motion
to appoint an elisor. (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp., supra, 178
Cal.App.4th at 92. [“The factors to be considered include the nature and difficulty
of the litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required and
employed to handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure, and
other circumstances in the case.”]) The award of attorney’s fees “is
governed by equitable principles.” (Ibid.)
 
In connection with their post-judgment
enforcement efforts, Defendants should assume some meaningful percentage of the
risk and expense of their unsuccessful enforcement effort. Based on the court’s
familiarity with the post-judgment enforcement proceedings, review of the
billing records and consideration of the briefing, the court finds a 20 percent
reduction in the attorney’s fees or $12,826[3] to be an appropriate
reduction in the attorney’s fees award based on Defendants’ lack of success on
the motion. A skilled attorney like Raucher could reasonably estimate an 80
percent likelihood of success rate on the motion thereby recognizing a lack of
success rate of 20 percent.
 
Other Expenses Documented in the Billing
Records
 
The billing records authenticated by
attorney Raucher show that $6,014.39 in expenses were incurred from June 10,
2022 to June 30, 2023. For this motion, Defendants seek recovery of $4,827.33
of those expenses and assert that the remainder relate to their appellate costs
“and are more properly dealt with after the appeal.” (Opposition 12, fn. 5;
Raucher Decl. ¶ 6.)  Plaintiffs do not
discuss or challenge these expenses in reply. As these expenses appear
reasonable and necessary to the enforcement work at issue, such costs are
allowed.
 
Other Costs 
 
The memorandum of costs also requests $97
for preparing and issuing the abstract of judgment, $221 for recording and
indexing the abstract of judgment and $3 for the parking needed to obtain the
abstracts. Defendants have supported those costs, which appear reasonable.  (Raucher Decl. ¶ 12.)  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion
