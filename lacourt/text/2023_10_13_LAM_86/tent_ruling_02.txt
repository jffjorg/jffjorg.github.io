[1]
Additional analysis of the issue is set
forth in court’s ruling on Petitioner’s motion to augment the administrative
record dated August 4, 2023.
 


[2] Petitioner refers to the adjacent property as the
“Leach TSDF.”  (OB 1.)


[3] As noted earlier, the Draft CAO gave the named parties, including Petitioner, until
February 10, 2011 to provide written comments to it. (AR 6020-6032.) The Board
extended the comment deadline several times to July 11, 2011 at the request of
Petitioner and other entities named in the Draft CAO. (AR 8125-8126; AR
8133-8135; AR 8137-8138; AR 8169; AR 8180-8181.) Petitioner provided comments to
the Board on the Draft CAO on July 11, 2011. (AR 8183-8186; AR 8187-8190; AR
8768-8770.)


[4]
In its motion to augment, Petitioner
raised certain arguments about an alleged “blackout” period between the
conclusion of the comment period for the Draft CAO on July 11, 2011 and the issuance
of the Final CAO in September 2014. (See Ruling dated 8/4/23 at 5-6.) Petitioner
has not, however, raised those arguments for trial. (See Nelson v. Avondale
Homeowners Assn. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 857, 862-863 [argument waived if
not raised or adequately briefed].)
  Assuming Petitioner had renewed the argument,
the court notes Petitioner did not cite any statute or published decision
suggesting (i) a deadline by which the Board must have issued its Final CAO or (ii)
provide an additional comment period based on any purported deadline. Neither Water
Code section 13307.1 nor Hill RHF v.
City of Los Angeles (2021) 12 Cal.5th
458, cited in the motion to augment, supports Petitioner’s position. (See
Ruling at 5-6.) 


[5] In relevant part, Mathews v. Eldridge
states: 
[R]esolution of
the issue whether the administrative procedures provided here are
constitutionally sufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private
interests that are affected. [Citations.] More precisely . . . identification
of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of
three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by
the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such
interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of
additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's
interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and
administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement
would entail.  
(See Machado v. State Water Resources Control Bd.,
supra, 90 Cal.App.4th at 725-726 [quoting
Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, 424 U.S. at 334-335].)


[6] Although Petitioner’s argument is not fully developed, Petitioner
may contend that the State Board should conducted a hearing on the Final CAO
after Petitioner petitioned the State Board for review. (Amended Opening Brief
19:12-24.) Petitioner has not named State Board as a respondent in this
proceeding and, therefore, it appears there would be no remedy available to
Petitioner based on the State Board’s to conduct a hearing.  Moreover, Petitioner fails to explain the
legal grounds requiring the State Board to conduct such a hearing.
 


[7] As defined by Petitioner, a PRP is a “deep pockets
large volume arranger, transporter, and generator that sent their hazardous
waste to Leach TSDF.” (Amended Opening Brief 1:22-23.)


[8] Petitioner made two comments in response to the Draft
CAO both arguing it could not be a responsible party under any clean up and
abatement order. The Board responded to Petitioner’s comments.


[9] Petitioner also claims the Board violated Water Code
section 13330, subdivision (e) when it issued the Final CAO. (See Amended Reply
9:13.) The statute concerns a petition for reconsideration by the State Board
and judicial review. The provision appears irrelevant to Petitioner’s
challenge. Petitioner also notes it brings its challenge under a nonexistent
statutory provision—Water Code section 11304, subdivision (a). (Amended Reply
9:13.)


[10] In reaching this conclusion, the court has
considered the City of Modesto Redevelopment Agency v. Superior Court
(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 28 cited by Petitioner and discussed in San Diego
Gas & Electric Co. v. San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Bd. (See
Amended Opening Brief 11:11-15; San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. San
Diego Regional Water Quality Control Bd., supra, 36 Cal.App.5th at
440-442.) City of Modesto Redevelopment Agency v. Superior Court is not
in conflict with Tesoro Refining & Marketing Co. LLC v. Los Angeles
Regional Water Quality Control Bd. and factually distinguishable for
several reasons.      


[11] In its Amended Reply, Petitioner raises
new arguments concerning its responsibility as a foreclosing lender and
concerning environmental laws not applicable to this case. (Amended Reply
2:19-3:18 [discussing “D’Oench doctrine,” “CERCLA,” “RCRA,” and other
matters].)  Petitioner does not show good
cause to raise such arguments in reply. Accordingly, on that basis, the court
rejects such arguments.  (Balboa Ins. Co. v. Aguirre (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010.)  Furthermore, to the extent “RCRA” and “CERCLA”
were referenced in Petitioner’s Amended Opening Brief at page 16, Petitioner
does not show that such arguments are relevant to, or undermine, the Board’s administrative
findings at issue.  Relatedly, while Petitioner discusses “intentional” discharges
from the adjacent site, those record citations are largely irrelevant. It
appears waste discharges occurred from both sites and that both sites are
severely contaminated and have not been remediated.
 


[12] Petitioner cited this State Board precedential
decision in its Amended Opening Brief at page 13, lines 23-24. Nothing suggests
any controversy as to relevant factors for consideration.


[13] Even if the Board’s exercise of such discretion could
be reviewed, the court is not persuaded from Petitioner’s citations to the
administrative record and legal arguments the Board prejudicially abused its discretion.
As the entity that has owned and controlled the Site for more than 20 years,
Petitioner is reasonably named as a primarily liable discharger. Even if
Respondent had discretion to name other entities as “dischargers” (which the
court need not decide), the Board has reasonably named Petitioner as a
discharger and responsible party.  Nothing
precludes Petitioner from seeking financial contribution from other entities
through its own separate litigation efforts.
