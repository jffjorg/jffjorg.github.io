[1] The memorandum of costs sought recovery of
$72,875.89. Defendants have reduced the request to $69,276.33 in their
opposition brief.  (Opposition 13:15.)


[2] Defendants represent that the $24,554.50 was actually
for “Preparing briefs and supporting papers and evidence for the April 13, 2023
Evidentiary Hearing on the Elisor Motion (12/6/2022 – 4/10/2023).” (Opposition
11:22-23.) That representation seems consistent with the billing records as the
billing records do not show Defendants incurred $24,554.50 in fees on April 12
and 13, 2023, as stated by Raucher.


[3] After deducting $4,827.33 and other costs ($321—see Other
Costs), the attorney’s fees sought by Defendants total $64,128.
