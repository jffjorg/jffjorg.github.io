And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to tax costs. The case involves a breach of implied warranty claim brought by plaintiffs Victor Ruiz and Amelia Perez against Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. The defendant made two settlement offers, one for $46,731.64 and another for $61,000, which were not accepted by the plaintiffs. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for $48,481, and judgment was entered accordingly.

The judge found that the first settlement offer was invalid because it was conditioned on proof and documentation, which left open the possibility that the amount listed was not the actual amount that the plaintiffs would receive if they accepted the offer. In contrast, the second settlement offer was valid because it unequivocally stated the amount that the defendant would pay.

The defendant argued that the costs claimed by the plaintiffs should be taxed, but the judge found that the costs were reasonably incurred and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The judge granted the defendant's motion to tax costs in the amount of $47,377.27, which is the amount of costs incurred after the second settlement offer.
