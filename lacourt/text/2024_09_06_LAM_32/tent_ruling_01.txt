     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to tax costs 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 20, 2021, Plaintiffs Victor
Ruiz and Amelia Perez filed this action against Defendant Toyota Motor Sales
U.S.A., Inc., asserting causes of action for violations of the Song-Beverly
Act. 
            On May 28, 2021, Defendant made a
first settlement offer of $46,731.64. On May 10, 2024, Defendant made a second
settlement offer of $61,000. Plaintiffs did not accept either offer.
            On June 13, 2024, the jury returned
a verdict in favor of Plaintiffs on the breach of implied warranty claim in the
amount of $48,481. Judgment was entered accordingly on July 9, 2024.
            On July 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
Memorandum of Costs (MOC) totaling $67,849.83.
            On August 9, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion to tax costs. Plaintiff filed her opposition on August 23,
2024.
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
The statutory scheme for cost recovery
establishes three categories of trial preparation expenses: (1) one category
allowable as a matter of right to the prevailing party (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5(a)); (2) one category disallowable unless expressly authorized elsewhere
by law (id., subd. (b)); and (3) one category allowable or disallowable
in the court’s discretion (id., subd. (c)(4)). Even where costs are
deemed allowable, such costs are only recoverable to the extent that they are
(1) reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation and (2) reasonable in amount. (Id.,
subd. (c)(2)-(3).)
“If the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Sanford v. Rasnick (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 1121, 1128.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
Section 998 
            a. Legal Framework
            “If an offer made by a defendant is
not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or
award, the plaintiff shall not recover his or her postoffer costs and shall pay
the defendant’s costs from the time of the offer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 998.) “Section
998 modifies the general rule of section 1032 that only the prevailing party
recovers its costs,” because a plaintiff who prevails in the litigation may
nonetheless have their costs cut off after rejecting a more favorable offer. (Scott
Co. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1112.) 
            However, an “offer must be
unconditional to be enforceable.” (Elite Show Services, Inc. v. Staffpro,
Inc. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 263, 268.) Additionally, “[t]he offer must be
sufficiently specific to allow the recipient to meaningfully evaluate it and
make a reasoned decision whether to accept it. Further, the offeree must be
able to clearly evaluate the worth of the offer.” (Duff v. Jaguar Land Rover
North America, LLC (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 491, 499, internal citations
omitted.) An offer that presents a “moving target” is vague and invalid. (Id.
at p. 500.) An offer is evaluated at the time it is made, not “by virtue of
hindsight.” (Licudine v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2019) 30
Cal.App.5th 918, 924.)    
            b. The First Offer
            On May 28, 2021, Defendant made an
offer for $46,731.64, “subject to proof/supporting documents.” (Guillot Decl.,
Ex. B.) This is similar to the invalid offer in Duff, which provided
that Jaguar would repurchase the vehicle for $28,430.80 or a greater amount if
supported by documentation. (Duff, supra, 74 Cal.App.5th at p. 500.) The
offer here also presents a “moving target” between $46,731.64 and some other
amount based on proof. The offer is not unconditional. (See Elite Show
Services, supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at p. 268.) It conditions the payment of
$46,731.64 on proof and documentation. The offer implies that the amount may be
more or less than $46,731.64 depending on what evidence is deemed satisfactory
by Defendant, or $0 if no evidence is provided to Defendant’s satisfaction. In
other words, “it is not clear, by the terms of the statutory offer that the [trial
award] was greater than what [Defendant] was offering to pay.” (See Duff,
supra, 74 Cal.App.5th at p. 500.) 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs had
sufficient information to evaluate the offer because they possessed the sales
contract and other information necessary to calculate restitution and
incidental or consequential damages. However, the fact that Plaintiffs
possessed evidence of their damages does not mean they could determine how much
Defendant was willing to pay. At the time of the offer, there was no indication
of what “proof/supporting documents” Defendant would have deemed sufficient to
justify the amount, or what amount Defendant would have deemed warranted even
if Plaintiffs had presented proof. By conditioning payment on proof and
documentation, the offer left open the possibility that the amount listed was
not the actual amount that Plaintiffs would receive if they accepted the offer.
This is precisely the type of “moving target” found invalid in Duff.  
In sum, the May 28, 2021 offer was invalid
and did not cut off Plaintiffs’ right to costs under section 998. 
c. The Second Offer
Plaintiffs concede that the second offer
on May 10, 2024 was valid. Unlike the first offer, the second offer
unequivocally stated that Defendant would pay $61,000, which is clearly more
favorable than the trial award of $48,481. (See Guillot Decl., Ex. C.)
Therefore, Plaintiffs’ costs are cut off after May 10, 2024. Plaintiffs
acknowledge that this amounts to $47,377.27. (Opp. 2:10-11.)
II.
Reasonable Amount
            Defendant makes no argument as to
the reasonableness of each challenged item of costs. Instead, Defendant merely
argues that the costs should be taxed to the extent they were incurred after
the first or second offers. However, as discussed above, the first offer was
invalid and does not cut off Plaintiffs’ costs, and Plaintiffs have conceded
the amount incurred after the second offer. Additionally, Plaintiffs in their
opposition explain each item of costs and provide supporting documentation. The
Court finds that the costs were reasonably incurred.   
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to tax costs is
GRANTED in the amount of $47,377.27.
