And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Omeira Studio Partners, Ltd.'s motion for summary adjudication of its declaratory relief claim. The dispute centers around the distribution of $589,290 in proceeds from the film "First Reformed" between Omeira Studio Partners, Ltd. and Fibonacci Films, LLC. The parties entered into a settlement agreement, which includes a pre-CAMA (Collection Account Management Pre-Agreement) and a Pledge and Assignment Agreement. The agreements contain provisions that are unclear and have led to disputes over the distribution of the funds.

The judge found that there are factual disputes over the effectiveness of Schedule B and the source of the $910,740 received by Omeira Studio Partners, Ltd. These disputes cannot be resolved through summary adjudication and must be decided by a trier of fact. Therefore, the motion for summary adjudication was denied.
