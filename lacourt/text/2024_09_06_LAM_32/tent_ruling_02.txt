     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff omeira studio partners, ltd.’s
  motion for summary adjudication 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 7, 2023, Plaintiff Omeira
Studio Partners, Ltd. (Omeira) filed this action against Defendant Fibonacci
Films, LLC (Fibonacci) for (1) declaratory relief, (2) breach of contract, and
(3) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The
complaint concerns the rights to $589,290 of proceeds from the film First
Reformed (the Picture), which Fibonacci has allegedly refused to distribute
to Omeira pursuant to a settlement agreement (the Agreement). The funds are
currently held by third-party collection agent Freeway CAM B.V. (Freeway).
            On August 25, 2023, Fibonacci filed
a cross-complaint against Omeira asserting the same three causes of action. The
cross-complaint alleges that Fibonacci is contractually entitled to the
$589,290 in first position against Omeira. 
            On June 21, 2024, Omeira filed the
instant motion for summary adjudication of its first cause of action for
declaratory relief. Fibonacci filed its opposition on August 22, 2024. Omeira
filed its reply on August 29, 2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
The function of
a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to
whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or
claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001)
25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c)
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima
(1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each claim
as framed by the complaint, the plaintiff moving for summary judgment must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to establish each
element of the cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once
the plaintiff has met that burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to show
that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of
action or a defense thereto. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
 
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
            Omeira’s objection nos. 1-3 are
sustained. 
DISCUSSION
I.
Schedule B
            Incorporated into the Agreement is
Schedule B, which is a “Direction to Pay” instructing Freeway on how to
distribute the funds. (Omeira’s Stmt. of Undisputed Facts (UF) 3.) Schedule B
states that “[Omeira] will assign to Fibonacci its entitlements under Paragraph
5 of Schedule 2 of the Pre-CAMA once [Omeira] has been paid a sum of $589,260
thereunder.” (UF 7.) Omeira contends that Fibonacci acknowledged its
understanding of this when its attorney distributed a Commercial Summary
detailing how Fibonacci interpreted the Agreement. The Commercial Summary
stated: “From the escrow funds currently held by the court, Omeira will be paid
$910,710. From the funds currently held by Freeway representing Domestic
Territory Collected Gross Receipts, Omeira will be paid $589,290.” (UF
13.)    
            Fibonacci argues that Schedule B is
moot because Section 2.2.7 of the Agreement provides that the Direction to Pay
was only to be executed “[i]n the event the parties are unable to secure the
signature of the other parties to the pre-CAMA.” (Fibonacci’s Stmnt. of Add’l
Facts (AF) 5.) Fibonacci argues that because the pre-CAMA was fully signed (AF
7), the condition precedent to Schedule B never materialized, rendering
Schedule B invalid. Fibonacci further points out that Section 2.2.7
contemplates Ferrocyanide executing Schedule B when the conditions were met,
yet Schedule B is not signed by Ferrocyanide. (Resp. to UF 8.)   
The Court finds that Section 2.2.7 raises
a factual dispute as to the effectiveness of Schedule B. Neither party has
articulated a dispositive, undisputed interpretation of Section 2.2.7 and its
effect on Schedule B. The Court cannot find as a matter of law that Section
2.2.7 does or does not invalidate Schedule B. The Commercial Summary
contributes to the factual dispute but does not resolve it. Instead, the matter
should be reserved for the trier of fact. 
II.
Section 2.2.5 of the Agreement
            The parties entered into a
Collection Account Management Pre-Agreement (pre-CAMA), which included a
“Schedule 2” for the distribution of Collected Gross Receipts. (AF 19.) Fibonacci
relies on Section 2.2.5 of the Agreement, which replaced certain language in
Schedule 2 with the following language: 
 
“Solely from the
Domestic Territory Gross Receipt, to Omeira, until recoupment of the Omeira Contribution
(to the extent not already recouped from ROW Territory Collected Gross Receipts),
but in the event that Omeira is paid any amounts from the Fibonacci cash
deposit pursuant to the Pledge and Assignment Agreement among those
parties and concerning the Film, to Fibonacci in first position until
recoupment by Fibonacci of the amount of the Fibonacci cash deposit so paid to
Omeira and then to Omeira until recoupment of the Omeira Contribution and thereafter.”
(AF
21.) 
            Fibonacci contends that Omeira was
paid $910,740 from the Fibonacci cash deposit funds (AF 27), and therefore,
Fibonacci is entitled to recoup that amount from the Domestic Territory Gross
Receipts in first position.
            Omeira argues that the “cash
deposit” referenced in Section 2.2.5 was not made pursuant to the Pledge and
Assignment Agreement but rather under the Stipulation to Distribute
Interpleaded Funds, incorporated into the Agreement as Schedule A. Thus, Omeira
argues that Fibonacci’s right to first position under Section 2.2.5 was never
triggered. 
Fibonacci responds that “any funds paid
out of the interpleaded funds in the Court Account were enabled by the Pledge
Agreement without which there would have been no such funds.” (Opp. 5:27-28.)
In particular, Fibonacci points out that under the Pledge Agreement, it posted
a Backstop Guarantee of $1,500,000 to cover Omeira’s financing shortfalls. (AF
24.) The Backstop Funds were interpleaded with the court when the dispute arose.
(AF 25.) Omeira thereafter received $910,740 from the interpleaded funds, and
Fibonacci received the remainder of $589,260. (AF 27.) Fibonacci argues that it
would be absurd for it to pay Omeira $910,740 and also give Omeira priority to
the $589,260.     
            The Court finds that there are
factual disputes over the source of the $910,740 received by Omeira. Although
Omeira received the money from funds that were then interpleaded with the
court, a trier of fact may find that the source of the funds was the Pledge
Agreement whereby Fibonacci pledged up to $1,500,000 to cover Omeira’s
shortfalls. Thus, a trier of fact may find that Omeira received funds “pursuant
to the Pledge and Assignment Agreement,” triggering Fibonacci’s first position
under Section 2.2.5. Fibonacci’s proposed interpretation is reasonable and
raises a material dispute. The Court does not find that Fibonacci’s prior
filings constitute judicial admissions to the contrary. (See Omeira’s RJN, Ex.
1-4.)    
            In sum, there are disputes of
material fact regarding which party is entitled to the Freeway funds.
Therefore, summary adjudication of Omeira’s declaratory relief claim is
unwarranted. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff Omeira Studio Partners,
Ltd.’s motion for summary adjudication is DENIED.
