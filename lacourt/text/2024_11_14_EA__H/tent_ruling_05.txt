I.        Background 
Plaintiff
Commercial Credit Group Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows: 
          On December 30, 2022, KPW Trucking,
Inc. (“KPW”) entered into a contract (“Contract 1”) by which Plaintiff financed
KPW’s acquisition of a 2023 Volvo VNL64T760 Sleeper Tractor with Detroit DD13
425HP Engine and Automatic Transmission, Serial Identification No.
4V4NC9EH4PN611697 (“Equipment 1”). On September 13, 2022, KPW entered into
another contract (“Contract 2”) by which Plaintiff financed KPW’s acquisition
of a 2017 Hyundai Dry Van Trailer, VIN #3H3V532C6HT324085 (“Equipment 2”). KPW
defaulted under Contract 1 and  Contract 2
by failing to make installment payments and to maintain physical damage
insurance. Contract 1 and Contract 2 were guaranteed by Keping Wang (“Wang”),
Mo Li (“Li”), LM Logistic, Inc. (“LM Logistic”), and W.K.P. Logistics, Inc.
(“W.K.P. Logistics”). 
On
May 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against
KPW, Wang, Li, LM Logistic, W.K.P. Logistics (collectively, “Defendants”), and
Does 1-100 for (1) possession of personal property as to Contract 1 and (2)
possession of personal property as to Contract 2.
Pending
before the Court are Plaintiff’s applications for writ of possession, whereby
Plaintiff seeks to recover Equipment 1 and Equipment 2.
 
II.      Discussion
          A.       Writ
of Possession (Equipment 1)
Plaintiff applies for a writ of possession after
hearing pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 512.010 et seq. as against Defendants to recover Equipment 1.
“Claim
and delivery is a remedy by which a party with a superior right to a specific item
of personal property (created, most commonly, by a contractual lien) may recover
possession of that specific property before judgment.” (Waffer Internat. Corp. v. Khorsandi (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1271.) 
No
writ of possession may issue, except after a hearing on a noticed motion (Code
Civ. Proc., § 512.020, subd. (a)) or by ex parte application satisfying the
conditions of section 512.020, subdivision (b). 
Prior to the section 512.020 hearing, the defendant must be served with
all of the following: (a) A copy of the summons and complaint; (b) A Notice of
Application and Hearing; (c) A copy of the application and any affidavit in
support thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.030, subd. (a).) “If the defendant has
not appeared in the action, and a writ, notice, order, or other paper is required
to be personally served on the defendant under this title, service shall be
made in the same manner as a summons is served under Chapter 4 (commencing with
Section 413.10) of Title 5.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.030, subd. (b).) 
The
“Notice of Application and Hearing” must inform the defendant of all of the
following: (a) A hearing will be held at a place and at a time, to be specified
in the notice, on plaintiff's application for a writ of possession; (b) The
writ will be issued if the court finds that the plaintiff's claim is probably
(not actually) valid and the other requirements for issuing the writ are
established; (c) If the defendant desires to oppose the issuance of the writ,
he must file with the court either an affidavit providing evidence sufficient
to defeat the plaintiff's right to issuance of the writ or an undertaking to
stay the delivery of the property in accordance with section 515.020; (d) The
notice must contain the following statement: “If you believe the plaintiff may
not be entitled to possession of the property claimed, you may wish to seek the
advice of an attorney. Such attorney should be consulted promptly so that he
may assist you before the time set for the hearing.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.040.)
On
October 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed five proofs of service, which reflected that
Defendants had each been served via substitute service with, inter alia, the
summons, complaint, the and the application for writ of possession as to
Equipment 1 on October 8, 2024 and that the foregoing documents had thereafter
been mailed to Defendants on October 9, 2024. The
Court determines that adequate notice was provided to Defendants.
Turning to the
merits of the application, the Court must make its determinations upon the
basis of the pleadings and other papers in the record; upon good cause shown,
the Court may receive and consider additional evidence and authority produced
at the hearing or may continue the hearing for the production of such
additional evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or
points and authorities. (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.050.) The Court must issue writ
of possession if the plaintiff establishes “the probable validity of his claim”
to possession of the property and the undertaking requirements of section
515.010 are satisfied. (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.060; RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.)
“Probable validity” exists where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff
will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim. (Code Civ. Proc., §
511.090; RCA Service Co., supra, 137
Cal.App.3d at 3.) 
“[T]he elements of a
cause of action for breach of contract are (1) the existence of the contract,
(2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's
breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty,
LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.) The elements of a
cause of action for breach of guaranty are “(1) there is a valid guaranty, (2)
the borrower has defaulted, and (3) the guarantor failed to perform under the
guaranty.” (Gray1 CPB, LLC v. Kolokotronis (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 480,
486.)
Probable
validity, in this case, has been established with respect to KPW, pursuant to
the application, which is executed under penalty of perjury by Plaintiff’s Assistant
Vice President of Operations, Michael Mikulan (“Mikulan”), as well as by
Mikulan’s declaration and the exhibits attached thereto.
 
Mikulan
attests, and/or the relevant documents reflect, as follows: 
          On December 30, 2022, KPW entered into
Contract 1 by which Plaintiff financed KPW’s acquisition of Equipment 1.
(Mikulan Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. A.) Contract 1 was guaranteed by Wang, Li, LM
Logistic, and W.K.P. Logistics. (Id.) Plaintiff is, and has been since
the date of Contract 1, the legal owner of Equipment 1. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh.
B.) KPW failed to make the July 7, 2023 payment to Plaintiff called for in
Contract 1 and has failed to make all subsequent payments. (Id., ¶ 7).
Per the terms of Contract 1, Plaintiff has the right to accelerate payments and
demand surrender of Equipment 1 upon default, including the failure to make any
payments. (Id.) Plaintiff is informed and believes that KPW has not
maintained physical damage insurance for the protection of Equipment 1, as
required by Contract 1. (Id., ¶ 8.)
          Upon information and belief, and
subject to an inspection of Equipment 1, the  market value of Equipment 1 is $151,750.00. (Id.,
¶ 9, Exh. C.) The balance on Equipment
1 is $164,374.37 as of March 27, 2024. (Id.) The balance continues to accrue
interest and fees. (Id.) The equity in Equipment 1 is, at most, -$12,624.37. (Id.)
The reasonable value of Equipment 1 is, in Mikulan’s opinion based on his years
of experience in the equipment finance industry, $180.50/day, which Plaintiff has
suffered since July 7, 2023. (Id., ¶ 10.) Equipment 1 has not been taken
for a tax
assessment or fine pursuant to a statute or seized under an execution against Plaintiff.
(Id., ¶ 11). 
          Mikulan has probable cause to believe
that Equipment 1 is located at 5400 G St., Chino, CA 91710 or 13350 11th St.,
Chino, CA 91710, as Plaintiff’s agents have observed Equipment 1 at both addresses.
(Id., ¶ 12.) 
While,
based on the above showing, the Court is persuaded that a writ of possession
should issue as to KPW, it is unclear to the Court why a writ of possession
should issue as to Wang, Li, LM Logistic, and W.K.P. Logistics, inasmuch as
their role appears limited to that of guarantors and there is no indication
that Equipment 1 is in their possession. The Court will hear further from
Plaintiff’s counsel in this regard at the time of the hearing.
A
bond must be posted as part of the undertaking unless the Court finds that the
defendant has no interest in the property. (Code Civ. Proc., § 515.010, subd.
(b).) The undertaking must be in an amount equal to twice the value of the
defendant’s interest in the property (market value less all liens, etc.).  (Id.) Defendant’s interest is based on
the market value of the property less (1) any amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement, (2) all liens and
encumbrances on the property, and (3) any other factors to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property. (Id.) 
The
application is granted as to KPW, with no bond. The Court determines that,
since the balance owed is substantially more than the fair market value of Equipment
1, KPW has no interest in Equipment 1, and therefore Plaintiff is not required
to post an undertaking.   
          B.       Writ
of Possession (Equipment 2)
Plaintiff applies for a writ of possession after
hearing pursuant to Code of Civil 
Procedure sections 512.010 et seq. as against
Defendants to recover Equipment 2.
On
October 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed five proofs of service, which reflected that
Defendants had each been substitute served with, inter alia, the summons,
complaint, and the application for writ of possession as to Equipment 2 on
October 8, 2024 and that the foregoing documents had thereafter been mailed to
Defendants on October 9, 2024. The Court determines that adequate notice was provided to Defendants. 
Turning
to the merits, probable validity, in this case, has been established with
respect to KPW pursuant to the application, which is executed under penalty of
perjury by Mikulan, as well as by Mikulan’s declaration and the exhibits
attached thereto. 
Mikulan
attests, and/or the relevant documents reflect, as follows:

          On September 13, 2022, KPW entered
into Contract 2, by which Plaintiff financed KPW’s acquisition of Equipment 2.
(Mikulan Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. A.) Contract 2 was guaranteed by Wang, Li, LM
Logistic and W.K.P. Logistics. (Id.) Plaintiff is, and has been since
the date of Contract 2, the legal owner of Equipment 2. (Id., ¶ 6, Exh.
B.)
          KPW failed to make the July 17, 2023
payment to Plaintiff called for in Contract 2 and has failed to make all
subsequent payments. (Id., ¶ 7). Per the terms of Contract 2, Plaintiff
has the right to accelerate payments and demand surrender of Equipment 2 upon
default, including the failure to make any payments. (Id.) Plaintiff
is informed and believes that KPW has not maintained physical damage insurance
for the protection of Equipment 2, as required by Contract 2. (Id., ¶
8.)
          Upon information and belief, and
subject to an inspection of Equipment 2, the market value of Equipment 2 is
$25,000.00. (Id., ¶ 9, Exh. C.) The balance on Equipment
#1 is $26,383.46 as of March 27, 2024. (Id.) The balance continues to accrue
interest and fees. (Id.) The equity in Equipment 2 is, at most, -$1,383.46.
(Id.) The reasonable value of Equipment 2 is, in Mikulan’s opinion based
on his years of experience in the equipment finance industry, $35.50/day, which
Plaintiff has suffered since July 17, 2023. (Id., ¶ 10.) Equipment 2 has
not been taken for a tax assessment or fine pursuant to a statute or seized
under an execution against Plaintiff. (Id., ¶ 11).
          Mikulan has probable cause to believe
that Equipment 2 is located at 5400 G St., Chino, CA 91710 or 13350 11th St.,
Chino, CA 91710, as Plaintiff’s agents have observed Equipment 2 at both
addresses. (Id., ¶ 12.)
While
the Court is persuaded that the writ should issue as to KPW, it is again unclear
to the Court why a writ of possession should issue as to Wang, Li, LM Logistic,
and W.K.P. Logistics, inasmuch as their role appears limited to that of
guarantors and there is no indication that Equipment 2 is in their possession.
The Court will hear further from Plaintiff’s counsel in this regard at the time
of the hearing.
The
application is granted as to KPW, with no bond. The Court determines that,
since the balance owed is substantially more than the fair market value of the Equipment
2, KPW has no interest in Equipment 2, and therefore Plaintiff is not required
to post an undertaking.
