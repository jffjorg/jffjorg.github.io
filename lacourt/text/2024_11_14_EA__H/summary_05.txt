And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's application for a writ of possession to recover Equipment 1 and Equipment 2 from the defendants, KPW Trucking, Inc., et al. The plaintiff, Commercial Credit Group Inc., has alleged that KPW defaulted on two contracts, Contracts 1 and 2, and failed to maintain physical damage insurance for the equipment.

The Judge has determined that the plaintiff has established probable validity of its claim to possession of the equipment, as it has shown that KPW defaulted on the contracts and failed to maintain insurance. The Judge has also determined that the defendants, including KPW, Wang, Li, LM Logistic, and W.K.P. Logistics, have no interest in the equipment.

The Judge has granted the application for a writ of possession as to KPW, with no bond, as the balance owed is substantially more than the fair market value of the equipment. The Judge has also granted the application as to KPW for the second piece of equipment, Equipment 2.

The Judge has indicated that it will hear further from the plaintiff's counsel on why a writ of possession should issue as to the remaining defendants, Wang, Li, LM Logistic, and W.K.P. Logistics, as their role appears limited to that of guarantors and there is no indication that the equipment is in their possession.
