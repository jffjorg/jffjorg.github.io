And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's Application for Default Judgment in the case of A.A. v. Ortega. The Plaintiff, a minor, is seeking default judgment against the Defendant, Eileen Ortega, for a dog bite incident that occurred on May 5, 2023. The Clerk entered default against the Defendant on June 25, 2024. The Plaintiff's Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice due to defects in the submission. Specifically, the Plaintiff failed to provide a full and complete default prove-up package, including a declaration from the Guardian Ad Litem, Sherry Guia, and exhibits. The Court declines to evaluate piecemeal submissions and instead requires the Plaintiff to submit a revised default prove-up application that addresses the issues raised in the ruling.
