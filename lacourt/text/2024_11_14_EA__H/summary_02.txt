Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for summary judgment filed by CalPortland Construction and CalPortland Company. The motion was filed in response to the plaintiffs' complaint alleging wrongful death and survival claims. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' claims against CalPortland Company are barred by the workers' compensation exclusivity rule, as the decedent was an employee of CalPortland Company and was involved in an accident while on the job. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs' claims against CalPortland Construction are meritless, as CalPortland Construction does not own, lease, occupy, or control Cement Plant Road where the accident occurred. The judge grants summary judgment to the defendants and vacates the final status conference and jury trial set for August 26, 2025, and September 9, 2025, respectively.
