Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants (Joy Shui Hsu, Teresa Chen, and Walnut High School Chinese American Parent Association, Inc.) is sustained, with 20 days' leave to amend the complaint. The judge found that the plaintiff's (Chinese American Parent Association of Walnut) allegations of common law trademark infringement, trademark infringement conspiracy, unfair competition under Business and Professions Code, and common law unfair competition are insufficient to state a cause of action. The judge noted that the plaintiff failed to plead sufficient facts to establish prior and continuous use of the Association Trademarks, failed to identify when and where the Trademarks were used, and failed to plead specific resulting damages. The judge also found that the plaintiff failed to plead any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts or practices. The judge granted the plaintiff 20 days' leave to amend the complaint, citing the principle that leave to amend is liberally allowed as a matter of fairness.
