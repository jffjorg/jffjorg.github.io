v. Ortega, Case No. 23PSCV01379
ORDER ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION
 
Plaintiff A.A.,
a minor by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Sherry Guia’s
Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background 
This is a
dog bite case. On May 5, 2023, Plaintiff A.A., a minor by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Sherry
Guia (“Plaintiff”), filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against
Eileen Ortega (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for (1) negligence, (2) common law
strict liability based on known dangerous propensities, and (3) statutory
strict liability based on the dog bite statute.
On
June 25, 2024, the Clerk entered default against Defendant.
Pending
before the Court is Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment.
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is
denied without prejudice. The 
following defects are noted:
Plaintiff has failed to provide the Court with a
full and complete default prove-up package in compliance with California Rules
of Court Rule 3.1800. On October 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a four-page document
entitled “Amended Application for Default Judgment; Declarations of Alexis
Galindo and Sherry Guia; Exhibits” (“Amended Application”), a five-page
document entitled “Amended Declaration of Alexis Galindo ISO Plaintiff’s
Default Judgment Application” (“Amended Galindo Declaration”), and a three-page
proposed judgment; no other documents were filed. The Amended Application does
not attach a declaration from Sherry Guia or any exhibits. The Amended Galindo
Declaration references Exhibits A-H as being attached, but there are no such exhibits.
The Court declines to evaluate piecemeal submissions.
Accordingly, the application is denied without
prejudice. Plaintiff should submit a revised default prove-up application that
addresses the foregoing issues.
