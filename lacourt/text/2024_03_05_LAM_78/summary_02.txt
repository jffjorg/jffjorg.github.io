  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'"
```

And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jinhee Cho vs. Woo Yeon Lee, et al. The defendants have filed a motion to terminate sanctions due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests. The court has previously granted the defendants' five motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to discovery, and the plaintiff has failed to serve responses despite these orders. The plaintiff's counsel has also failed to respond to communication regarding the discovery requests. The court has determined that the plaintiff has a history of abuse and has failed to comply with court orders, and therefore, terminating sanctions are granted. The case is dismissed with prejudice.
