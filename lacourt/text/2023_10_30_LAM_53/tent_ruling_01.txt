EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
The court sustains defendant Hyundai
Motor America’s evidentiary objection, filed on October 24, 2023. 
 
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs Andres Manzo and Eva Mora (“Plaintiffs”) filed this lemon
law action against defendant Hyundai Motor America (“Defendant”), alleging
three causes of action pursuant to the Song-Beverly Act. 
At trial in this action, the jury found that Plaintiffs were entitled
to an award of damages in the amount of $23,276.13.  The court entered judgment in favor of
Plaintiffs and against Defendant in the amount of $23,276.13 on August 14,
2023. 
Now pending before the court are the following two motions filed by
the parties: (1) the motion to offset damages, filed by Defendant on August 25,
2023, and (2) the motion for new trial, filed by Plaintiffs on September 18,
2023.
DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR OFFSET OF DAMAGES
Defendant moves the court for an order (1) offsetting the jury award
of $23,276.13 by $11,544.46, which represents the insurance proceeds received
by Plaintiffs, and (2) entering judgment in the modified amount of $11,732.67.
First, it appears that the court does not have jurisdiction to rule on
Defendant’s motion as filed.  
“Once judgment has been entered, the trial court does retain
jurisdiction for a limited period of time to entertain and grant a motion for a
new trial ([Code Civ. Proc.,] § 655 et seq.) or a motion for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict.  ([Code Civ.
Proc.,] § 629.)  The court also retains
jurisdiction to consider and grant a motion to vacate a judgment and enter a
judgment for either of two reasons: an incorrect or erroneous legal basis for
the decision, not consistent with or supported by the facts, or a judgment not
consistent with or not supported by the special verdict.  ([Code Civ. Proc.,] §§ 663, 663a.)  The court also retains jurisdiction to
entertain and grant a motion for relief from a judgment taken against a party
through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  ([Code Civ. Proc.,] § 473.)”  (Craven v. Crout (1985) 163 Cal.App.3d
779, 782-783.) 
Defendant did not move pursuant to any of the statutory authorities
set forth above.  Defendant did not, for
example, file a motion for a new trial based on excessive damages.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subd.
(5).)  Instead, Defendant has merely
requested that the court offset the award of damages by $11,544.46.  Thus, it appears that Defendant’s motion for
offset is the improper procedural vehicle to seek such relief. 
Second, even if Defendant had filed the correct procedural motion, the
court would find that Defendant has not met its burden to show that the court
should offset the award of damages by $11,544.46.  The court finds persuasive the reasoning set
forth in Figueroa v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 708, review
granted February 1, 2023, S277547, and Williams v. FCA US LLC (2023) 88
Cal.App.5th 765, review granted May 3, 2023, S279051, concluding that
manufacturer-defendants are not entitled to an offset or reduction of an award
of restitution when consumer-plaintiffs have received money for their
vehicle.  (Figueroa, supra,
84 Cal.App.5th at pp. 714, [Song-Beverly Act’s “definition [of restitution]
does not include a set-off for the cash received by the vehicle owner on sale
of the vehicle or the vehicle’s trade-in value”], 712 [“Nowhere in section
1793.2, subdivision (d)(2)(B), or elsewhere in the Song-Beverly Act, is there a
provision allowing cash back to the manufacturer”], rev. granted; Williams,
supra, 88 Cal.App.5th at p. 785 [“Crediting the manufacturer with the
trade-in value or sale proceeds received for the defective vehicle to reduce
the buyer’s remedy under the restitution provision would create a disincentive
to reacquire or promptly replace or provide restitution for a defective vehicle
. . . .  We decline to interpret the Act
in that manner”], rev. granted.) 
The court therefore denies Defendant’s motion.
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL
Plaintiffs move the court for an order vacating and setting aside the
judgment entered by the court on August 14, 2023, on the ground that the
damages awarded were inadequate because they were not awarded prejudgment
interest pursuant to Civil Code section 3287. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subd. (5) [party may move for new trial or
to modify a decision on the ground of “[e]xcessive or inadequate damages”].)
As a threshold matter, the court notes that Defendant contends that
Plaintiffs’ motion is procedurally defective on the ground that the notice of
motion was not timely filed. 
“The party intending to move for a new trial shall file with the clerk
and serve upon each adverse party a notice of his or her intention to move for
a new trial, designating the grounds upon which the motion will be made and
whether the same will be made upon affidavits or the minutes of the court, or
both, either: [¶] (1) After the decision is rendered and before the entry of
judgment[, or] [¶] (2) Within 15 days of the date of mailing notice of entry of
judgment by the clerk of court pursuant to Section 664.5, or service upon him
or her by any party of written notice of entry of judgment, or within 180 days
after entry of judgment, whichever is            earliest. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 659, subd.
(a).)  “These time limits are
jurisdictional.”  (In re Marriage of
Herr (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1468.)
On August 15, 2023, the court issued a minute order stating the
following:  “Parties are noticed that
Judgment (by Court after jury trial) was signed, filed, and entered on
8/14/23.”  The Certificate of Mailing
states that the August 15, 2023 minute order was served on the parties on that
date.  Defendant appears to argue that
service of the minute order constitutes notice pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.5.  The court
disagrees. 
“‘[T]o qualify as a notice of entry of judgment under Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.5, the clerk’s mailed notice must affirmatively state
that it was given “upon order by the court” or “under section 664.5,” and a
certificate of mailing the notice must be executed and placed in the
file.’”  (Simgel Co., Inc. v. Jaguar
Land Rover North America, LLC (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 305, 314.)  Because the August 15, 2023 order did not
state that (1) it was entered upon order by the court, or (2) it was issued
under section 664.5, the court finds that it did not constitute notice of entry
of judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.5 and, as a result,
did not begin the 15-day limit by which Plaintiffs were required to file the
pending motion for a new trial.   The
court therefore considers the merits of Plaintiffs’ motion.
Plaintiffs request that the court modify the judgment to include,
pursuant to Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a), prejudgment interest in
the amount of $17,519.48. 
“A person who is entitled to recover damages certain, or capable of
being made certain by calculation, and the right to recover which is vested in
the person upon a particular day, is entitled also to recover interest thereon
from that day, except when the debtor is prevented by law, or by the act of the
creditor from paying the debt.”  (Civ.
Code, § 3287, subd. (a).)  “The
Song-Beverly Act does not preclude an award of prejudgment interest under
section 3287, subdivision (a).”  (Warren
v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 43; Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1010 [“Nothing in the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act bars recovery of prejudgment interest”].)  “‘ “Damages are deemed certain or capable of
being made certain within the provisions of subdivision (a) of section 3287
where there is essentially no dispute between the parties concerning the basis
of computation of damages if any are recoverable but where their dispute
centers on the issue of liability giving rise to damage.” ’”  (Duale
v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 718, 729.)  The test is
therefore whether the defendant actually knows the amount owed or could have
computed that amount from reasonably available information.  (Ibid.)  However,
“‘[t]he statute . . . does not authorize prejudgment interest where the amount
of damages, as opposed to the determination of liability, “depends upon a
judicial determination based upon conflicting evidence and it is not
ascertainable from truthful data supplied by the claimant to his debtor.”
’”  (Ibid.) 
Plaintiffs contend that Defendant
“was always aware of the purchase price of the defective vehicle since it is
written on the sales contract” and was “always aware of what the restitutionary
figure Plaintiffs were owed here to repurchase the vehicle because they made
the exact same deductions (including the mileage offset) that the jury made in
this case prior to the lawsuit.”  (Mot.,
p. 5:3-9.)  In opposition, Defendant
asserts that the amount of damages in this case could not have been calculated
before trial, in part because Plaintiffs requested damages beyond what was
awarded. 
The court finds that
Plaintiffs are not entitled to an award of prejudgment interest pursuant to
Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a), and therefore denies their request
for prejudgment interest pursuant to that statute.  Specifically, the court finds that Plaintiffs
have not shown that their damages were “certain, or capable of being made
certain by calculation” within the meaning of section 3287.  
To calculate a damages award
in many lemon law cases, a jury must first determine      (1) whether any of the defects alleged in
a complaint represents a noncomformity, (2) whether any such noncomformity
substantially impaired the use, value, or safety of the vehicle, and (3) if so,
the mileage at which the plaintiffs first presented the car for repair.  (Warren, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 44; Duale, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 729.)  Here, Plaintiffs have not presented evidence
showing that (1) these issues were not required to be resolved before
calculating damages, or (2) these issues were not in dispute at trial.  (Ibid.; Tiul Ortega v. BMW of North America, LLC (2019) 2019 WL 6123774 at *2 [“Although the [sales contract] gave the
parties and the jury a starting point from which to calculate damages, it could
not be used to determine when [the defendant’s] obligation to
repurchase/replace the Subject Vehicle arose or what damages [the plaintiff]
might be able to recover beyond the amount paid toward the Subject
Vehicle.  Under Duale, these are not pure issues of liability but rather issues affecting
the calculation of damages which could not be resolved ‘except by verdict or
judgment’”]; Gray v. Quicken
Loans, Inc. (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th
524, 528, n. 2 [“‘Although not binding, unpublished federal district court
cases are citable as persuasive authority’”].) 

Thus, the court finds that
Plaintiffs have not shown that damages could have been calculated before the
jury made findings as to the issues set forth above, irrespective of the fact
that the sales contract might have provided a “starting point” for those
calculations. 
Moreover, Plaintiffs
requested, but the jury did not award, $10,843 in incidental and consequential
damages.  The amount of those damages, as
part of the entire request for an award of damages, were not certain or capable
of being made certain before trial based on any information available to
Defendant.  (Warren, supra, 30 Cal.App.5th at p. 45 [incidental and consequential damages – “a
key component of” the jury award – were not certain].) 
The court therefore finds
that Plaintiffs have not shown that their damages were certain or capable of
being made certain.  (Civ. Code,
§ 3287, subd. (a).) 
Alternatively, Plaintiffs
request that the court modify the judgment to include, pursuant to Civil Code
section 3287, subdivision (b), prejudgment interest in the amount of
$10,941.70.
“Subdivision (b) of section 3287 applies to unliquidated claims and it
is discretionary.”  (Glassman v.
Safeco Ins. Co. of America (2023) 90 Cal.App.5h 1281, 1302, n. 10.)  “There is no authoritative list of criteria
for courts to consider, and ‘[f]ew cases have discussed the standards by which
a trial court’s exercise of discretion under section 3287, subdivision (b) are
to be judged.’”  (Hewlett-Packard Co.
v. Oracle Corp. (2021) 65 Cal.App.5th 506, 577.) 
The court, upon considering the evidence and arguments presented by
the parties and in balancing “concerns of fairness and just compensation[,]” denies
Plaintiffs’ request that the court exercise its discretion to award prejudgment
interest pursuant to Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (b), based on, among
other factors, the facts that (1) awarding prejudgment interest, under the
circumstances, would penalize Defendant for litigating a bona fide dispute, and
         (2) Plaintiffs have not
submitted evidence showing that they made reasonable, good faith offers to
settle this action that were rejected by Defendant.  (Civ. Code, § 3287, subd. (b); Hewlett-Packard
Co., supra, 65 Cal.App.5th at p. 577; A&M Produce Co. v. FMC
Corp. (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 473, 496-497.) 
The court therefore denies Plaintiffs’ motion for new trial or
modification of a decision based on inadequate damages.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subd. (5).)
