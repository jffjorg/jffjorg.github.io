And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, Keurig Dr Pepper, Inc., and Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc., granting their motion to dismiss or stay the case. The plaintiff, Coca-Cola Bottling LLC, argued that the California Franchise Relations Act should apply, but the judge found that the evidence shows that the plaintiff is not a franchisee under this act. As a result, the Texas forum selection clause is enforceable, and the case must be litigated in Texas, with a trial scheduled for March 2025. The defendants will give notice of the dismissal.
