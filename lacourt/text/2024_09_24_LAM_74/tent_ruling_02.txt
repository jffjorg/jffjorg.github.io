 Case Number:  24STCV10876    Hearing Date:   September 24, 2024    Dept:  74 Reyes  Coca-Cola Bottling LLC v. Keurig Dr Pepper, Inc., et al. Defendants Keurig Dr  Pepper, Inc. and Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.’s Motion to Dismiss or Stay Based on Forum  Non Conveniens and Comity   Plaintiff’s sole  argument against enforcing the Texas forum selection clause is the California  Franchise Relations Act. The weight of the evidence filed in support and in  opposition to the motion establishes that plaintiff is not defendants’ franchisee to which the California Franchise Relations Act applies. Thus,  plaintiff’s argument against enforcing the Texas forum selection clause fails. Accordingly,  the parties must litigate their dispute in Texas (for which a trial is pending in  March 2025). Consequently, the court grants defendants’ motion to dismiss this  case. Defendants shall give  notice.
