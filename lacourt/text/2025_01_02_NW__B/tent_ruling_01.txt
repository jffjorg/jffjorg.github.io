  Case Number:  21STCV29426    Hearing Date:   January 2, 2025    Dept:  B Hearing Date: January 2, 2025
Re: 21STCV29426 Stephon Taylor, an Individual
vs Julio Cesar Maldonado, an Individual, et al.
 
 
 
BACKGROUND
 
Defendants Julio Cesar Maldonado (“Maldonado”)
and Valencia Building Materials, Inc. (“Valencia”)(collectively “Defendants”)
move to compel nonparty Radiance Surgery Center (“Radiance Surgery”) to comply
with a deposition subpoena for the production of business records. Defendants
also seek monetary sanctions. No opposition has been filed.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
A party seeking discovery from a person who is
not a party to the action may obtain discovery by oral deposition, written
deposition, or deposition subpoena for production of business records. (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 2020.010.) A deposition subpoena may command either: (1)
only the attendance and testimony of the deponent; (2) only the production of
business records for copying; or (3) the attendance and testimony of the
deponent, as well as the production of business records, other documents,
electronically stored information, and tangible things. (CCP §
2020.020.)   
 
A service of a deposition subpoena shall be
affected a sufficient time in advance of the deposition to provide the deponent
a reasonable opportunity to locate and produce any designated documents and,
where personal attendance is commanded, a reasonable time to travel to the
place of deposition. (CCP § 2020.220(a).) Personal service of any
deposition subpoena is effective to require a deponent who is a resident of
California to: personally appear and testify, if the subpoena so specifies; to
produce any specified documents; and to appear at a court session if the
subpoena so specifies. (CCP § 2020.220(c).) A deponent who disobeys a
deposition subpoena may be punished for contempt without the necessity of a
prior order of the court directing compliance by the witness. (CCP §
2020.240.) A motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena must
be made within 60 days after completion of the deposition record, the date
objections are served, or the date specified for production, and be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration. (CCP §2025.480(b); Board of Registered
Nursing v. Sup.Ct. (Johnson & Johnson) (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1011,
1032-1033.) 
 
CCP § 1987.1(a) states: “[i]f a subpoena
requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents, or
other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the
taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person
described in subdivision (b), or upon the court’s own motion after giving
counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the
subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those
terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders. In
addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect
the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable
violations of the right of privacy of the person.” 
  
CCP §1987.2(a) states, in relevant part, “. . .
in making an order pursuant to motion made . . . under Section 1987.1, the
court may in its discretion award the amount of the reasonable expenses
incurred in making or opposing the motion, including reasonable attorney’s
fees, if the court finds the motion was made or opposed in bad faith or without
substantial justification . . .” 
 
MEET AND CONFER
 
Defendants
served the subpoenas upon Radiance Surgery on March 12, 2024, requesting the
appearance and document production of Radiance Surgery’s Custodian of Record
(“COR”) on April 17, 2024. (Perkins Decl. ¶¶ 7 and 8; Exh. A [subpoena]; Exh. B
[proof of service].) Radiance Surgery did not object. (Ibid. at ¶ 9.)
Radiance Surgery did not appear for the noticed April 17, 2024, deposition. (Ibid.
at ¶ 12; Exh. C [certificate of non-appearance].) On August 23, 2024,
defense counsel sent a meet and confer letter to Radiance Surgery regarding
this issue. (Ibid. at ¶ 13; Exh. D [meet and confer].) Accordingly,
defense counsel satisfies the meet and confer requirement.
 
DISCUSSION
 
This case involves a two-vehicle accident on
May 29, 2020. (Perkins Decl. ¶ 2.) Plaintiff Stephon Taylor (“Plaintiff”)
alleges injuries as a result. (Ibid. at ¶ 4.) On March 12, 2024,
Defendants issued a deposition subpoena for the appearance and document
production of Radiance Surgery’s Custodian of Record. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 7 and
8.) Plaintiff received significant treatments for his claimed injuries from
Radiance Surgery, including cervical surgeries. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 5 and 6.)
Therefore, Defendants show good cause for compelling Radiance Surgery’s COR’s
deposition.
 
Defendants served an effective subpoena upon
Radiance Surgery on March 12, 2024. (Perkins Decl. ¶¶ 7 and 8.) Radiance
Surgery did not object, yet failed to appear for the April 17, 2024, noticed
deposition. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 9 and 12; Exh. C [certificate of
non-appearance].) Therefore, Defendants’ motion to compel the appearance and
document production of Radiance Surgery’s COR is granted.
 
Sanctions
 
Defense counsel requests $1,905.00 in sanctions
against Radiance Surgery, comprised of a $60.00 filing fee and nine hours of
work at an hourly rate of $205.00. (Perkins Decl. ¶¶ 16 and 17.) The Court
awards sanctions in the amount of $675.00, reflecting a $60.00 filing fee and
three hours of work at an hourly rate of $205.00, as the motion was
straightforward and no opposition was filed.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Compel
Radiance Surgery Center’s Custodian of Record to Comply with Subpoena. Radiance
Surgery’s COR is ordered to appear and produce requested documents within 20
days of this hearing. Additionally, the Court awards sanctions against Radiance
Surgery in the amount of $675.00, payable to defense counsel within 20 days of
this hearing.
