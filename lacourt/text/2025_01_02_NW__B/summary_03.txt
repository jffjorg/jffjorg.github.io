And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion by the plaintiffs, Pedram Akbarineku, Amanda Johnson, Theodore Akbarineku, and Wyatt Akbarineku, to correct the date of filing of their complaint. The complaint was filed on October 8, 2024, but the plaintiffs argue that this is an error caused by a technical glitch and that the correct filing date is September 27, 2024. The court finds that the plaintiffs have shown good cause and grants the motion for a nunc pro tunc order, correcting the filing date to September 27, 2024.
