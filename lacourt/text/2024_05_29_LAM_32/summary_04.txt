And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Leonard W. Borisoff, seeks declaratory relief, claiming that the contracts at issue are void or voidable, and therefore, the defendants have no rights to the royalties. The defendants, The Pullman Group, LLC, Wertheim, LLC, David Pullman, and Broadcast Music, Inc., argue that there are material factual issues that require evidentiary resolution. However, the court finds that the defendants' concessions that the contracts are void and that they have no rights to the royalties demonstrate as a matter of law that the plaintiff is entitled to declaratory relief in its favor. The court grants the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings.
