 Case Number:  24STCV07883    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  30 Motion to Deem RFAs Admitted   On June 5, 2024, Plaintiffs served requests for admissions (RFA) on Philly Auto, Inc. (Defendant). (Green Decl. ¶ 2.) Responses were due on July 9. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250.) On July 11, Defendant requested an extension until July 31. (Green Decl. ¶ 4.) Responses were never served. (Stearns Decl. ¶ 9.) Plaintiffs filed the present motion on October 25, 2024. Defendant provided responses that day. (Id. ¶ 11, Ex. 2.) Plaintiffs are not required to meet and confer with counsel before bringing the present motion under section 2033.280, because Defendants failed to timely respond.   Under section 2033.280, the Court shall grant an order deeming requests for admissions admitted unless the responding party serves substantially compliant responses before the hearing on the motion. A finding of substantial compliance depends on “whether answers in a proposed response are ‘as complete and straightforward’ as reasonably possible, as explicitly required by section 2033.220.” (Katayama v. Continental Investment Group (2024) 105 Cal.App.5th 898, 907.) A party not in possession of information or knowledge necessary to respond to a request for admission must state in the answer that “a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has been made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable that party to admit the matter.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.220, subd. (c).)  Here, Defendant responded to requests 1–5 by stating that “[r]esponding party is without sufficient information to admit or deny the substance of this request.” (Stearns Decl. Ex. 1.) Defendant did not attest to having made a reasonable inquiry as required by section 2033.220. Thus, Defendant’s responses as to these requests were not in substantial compliance with section 2033.220.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion to deem the RFAs admitted is granted.   Defendant argues that requests 1–5 are outside the scope of allowable discovery in the present case. Discoverable information includes anything “that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010.) Here, Plaintiffs’ requests relate to Defendant’s receipt of Plaintiffs’ notice as required for Plaintiffs to bring a claim under the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) pursuant to Civil Code section 1782. This is relevant to the present litigation because Defendant asserts a lack of proper notice as a complete defense to Plaintiffs’ CLRA claims. (Answer ¶ 19.) Thus, requests 1–5 are within the scope of discovery as they relate to the subject matter of the pending action.  The Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to deem requests for admissions admitted.
