  Case Number:  23STCV00547    Hearing Date:   January 6, 2025    Dept:  30   PETITION TO CONFIRM MINOR’S COMPROMISE    Analysis  Procedural Requirements  Petitioner Ignacia Nuno is the guardian ad litem of the disabled claimant Leslie Gadea.  Petitioner has filed a Proposed Order with the petition, along with a Proposed Order to deposit money into a blocked account. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co., Ltd. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1605 [stating that a petition for court approval must comply with Cal. Rules of Court, rules 7.950, 7.950.5, 7.591 and 7.952].) Petitioner uses Judicial Council form MC-350 for the Petition and presents the Court with a Proposed Order Approving Compromise of the Disputed Claim.  The Petition is thus procedurally proper.  Substantive Requirements   Court approval is required for all settlements of a minor or dependent adult’s claim. (Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.)    Pursuant to Probate Code section 3600, subdivision (a)(2), a court may approve a compromise of a pending action or proceeding to which a minor or person with a disability is a party. Upon making such an Order,   [t]he court . . . shall make a further order authorizing and directing that reasonable expenses, medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator, costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor or person with a disability.  (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).)    Discussion  Here, the Petitioner has filled out form MC-350 and adequately satisfied the form’s requirements. After reviewing the Petition, the Court finds that the settlement is fair and reasonable. Defendants Norma Salceda, M.D., Stan Tovsky, M.D., and Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center will pay sums of $975,000, $837,500, and $1,500,000 to Claimant, respectively. (Petition ¶ 10.) Petitioner is not a Plaintiff in this action and will not receive any compensation under the settlement aside from expenses. (Id. ¶ 11.)   $1,167,461.45 will be taken out of Claimant’s recovery to reimburse Medical for Claimant’s care costs. (Id. ¶ 12.) $1,084,068.39 will be taken out of Claimant’s recovery for attorney’s fees. (Id. ¶ 13.) $50,000 will be taken out of the Claimant’s recovery to reimburse Petitioner for childcare costs. (Ibid.) And $27,444.26 will be taken out of the Claimant’s recovery to reimburse litigation costs. (Ibid.) Accordingly, after paying fees and costs, Claimant will recover $983,525.90. (Id. ¶ 15.) There is no guardianship or conservatorship of the estate of claimant, and Petitioner requests a court order to invest $700,000 in a single-premium deferred annuity and to transfer $283,525.90 into a special needs trust for the benefit of the person with the disability. (Id. ¶ 18.)  Counsel for Petitioner provides a declaration attesting to his reasonable attorney fees. (Attachment 13a.) Petitioner and her attorney agreed to a contingent fee agreement at a rate of 33% of the Claimant’s recovery. (Id., Kramer Decl. ¶ 37.) The requested fees are fair and reasonable given counsel’s experience and time spent on the case.  Therefore, the Court grants the Petition.
