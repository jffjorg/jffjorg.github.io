```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the plaintiff, Showroom Interiors LLC, is entitled to relief from the dismissal entered on August 1, 2024. The plaintiff's counsel admits to calendaring the wrong hearing date, resulting in the failure to file a timely case management statement or attend the hearing. The judge finds that the dismissal was caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, and therefore grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal.
