And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the plaintiff, 1200 Management LLC, against the defendants, Liron Shvartz and Black Rock Market Café, Inc. The plaintiff demurred to the defendants' 32 affirmative defenses, arguing that they failed to state sufficient facts to constitute a defense. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to specifically state the grounds for each affirmative defense, as required by the California Rules of Court, and therefore disregarded the demurrer.

The judge then reviewed each affirmative defense and found that most of them alleged sufficient ultimate facts to withstand demurrer. However, the judge did address one defense, which was related to the statute of frauds, and found that it was potentially applicable to the case. Therefore, the judge overruled the plaintiff's demurrer to that defense.

The judge also suggested that a better way for the plaintiff to proceed would be to propound discovery to ask for supporting evidentiary facts regarding the affirmative defenses. Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's demurrer is overruled, and the defendants' affirmative defenses are sufficient to withstand demurrer.
