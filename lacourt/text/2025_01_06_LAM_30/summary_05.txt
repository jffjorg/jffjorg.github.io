And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the pleadings and the parties' submissions and has made a tentative ruling on the motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents. The motion is stayed pending the scheduling of an informal discovery conference. The parties have attempted to meet and confer prior to filing the motion, and the Court finds that the meet and confer declaration is sufficient. The motion seeks to compel Defendant Zara Barani to produce all the documents demanded in Plaintiff's September 19, 2024, deposition notice, as well as monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,200. The Court has considered the legal standards regarding discovery and has applied them liberally in favor of discovery. However, the Court finds that the present motion is stayed pending participation in an informal discovery conference, as required by local court rules.
