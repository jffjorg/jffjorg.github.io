LEGAL AUTHORITY
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. 
Taylor v. City of Los Angeles
Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. 
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.”  SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.  “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747. 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case “with reasonable
precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the
defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of action.” Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal. App. 2d 636, 643-44.
The court may, upon a motion, or at
any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.  CCP § 436(a). 
The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court.  CCP §436(b).  The grounds for a motion to strike are that
the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws.  CCP
§436.  The grounds for moving to strike
must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  CCP §437.
DISCUSSION
Demurrer
Defendants Hanh P. Le and 157th
St. Gardena, LLC demur to the fourth cause of action for IIED and fifth cause
of action for private nuisance on the ground that they fail to state sufficient
facts to constitute a cause of action.
The complaint alleges that
plaintiffs have resided at the property since 1999, subject to a written lease
with defendants’ predecessor in interest. 
Defendants purchased the property in July 2021.  As of the date of the purchase, plaintiffs’
monthly rent was $850.  Complaint, ¶10.  Immediately after purchasing, defendant Le
sent correspondence to all tenants, including plaintiffs, alerting them of the
purchase, that they would be managing the property, and that the rent would
increase to $1,800 in the near future. 
Id., ¶11.  Beginning in December
2021, plaintiffs reported that the windows were experiencing water intrusions
during a rainstorm.  Le responded that
she could not do anything to help, that defendants are not plaintiffs’
landlords, and that plaintiffs should contact the former owner for
repairs.  Plaintiffs sent another text
and Le responded “[n]ew owners need their units back” and for plaintiffs to
“move on with their life.”  Id., ¶12.
Plaintiffs also allege that
following another water intrusion in November 2022, plaintiffs contacted the LA
Dept. of Public Health.  LADPH conducted
an initial inspection and cited the property for numerous cracks and
peeling/blistered paint.  A reinspection
in February 2023 revealed that none of the listed violations has been
corrected.  LADPH did not close the case
until June 22, 2023.  Id., ¶13.  In January 2024, water intrusions again
occurred.  Plaintiffs immediately
notified defendants, who again refused to timely address the issues.  Plaintiffs made complaints to the city of
Gardena.  The city issued a notice of
violation.  As of date of complaint, the
city has not closed out the notice of violation.  Id., ¶14. 

Plaintiffs also allege that on
November 1, 2022, defendants sent a letter to plaintiffs indicating a rent
increase to $1045.  Plaintiffs attempted
to contact defendants regarding the illegality of the rent increase pursuant to
City of Gardena Municipal Code. 
Plaintiffs were forced to contact the city and schedule a
mediation.  A mediation was held and the
rental rate was increased to $1021.  Id.,
¶15.
Plaintiffs further allege that on
October 3, 2023, defendants served a 60 day notice to quit on plaintiffs,
claiming that they intended to demolish or substantially remodel the
property.  Plaintiffs were the only tenants
at the property that received such a notice. 
Defendants “granted” plaintiffs one month free rent.  Plaintiffs contacted the Fair Housing
Foundation regarding the notice who informed defendants that the notice was in
violation of Gardena Municipal Code. 
Id., ¶16.  Beginning in December
2023, defendants began refusing to process and/or cash plaintiffs’ rental
payments.  Id., ¶17.  On January 17, 2024, Le stated in a text
message to plaintiffs that defendants would not accept any rent check from
them.  Id., ¶18.  On February 22, 2024, plaintiffs received a
notice of unlawful detainer.  Defendants
did not serve a three day notice to pay rent or quit.  Further, plaintiffs timely submitted their
rent payments but defendants did not process and/or cash them.  Id., ¶19.
Fourth cause of action for IIED
The tort of intentional infliction
of emotional distress is comprised of three elements:  (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the
defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the
probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff suffered severe
or extreme emotional distress; and (3) the plaintiff's injuries were actually
and proximately caused by the defendant's outrageous conduct.  McMahon v. Craig (2009) 176 Cal. App.
4th 222, 234.  “In order to meet the
first requirement of the tort, the alleged conduct . . . must be so extreme as
to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.”  Id. at 234-35. Whether conduct is
sufficiently extreme and outrageous so as to be actionable may be determined as
a matter of law.  Cochran v. Cochran
(1998) 65 Cal. App. 4th 488, 494.  To
avoid demurrer, the plaintiff must allege such acts with great
specificity.  Yau v. Santa Margarita
Ford, Inc. (2014) 229 Cal. App. 4th 144, 160-61.  “Behavior may be considered outrageous if a
defendant (1) abuses a relation or position which gives him power to damage the
plaintiff’s interest; (2) knows the plaintiff is susceptible to injuries
through mental distress; or (3) acts intentionally or unreasonably with the
recognition that the acts are likely to result in illness through mental
distress.”  Newby v. Alto Riviera
Apartments (1976) 60 Cal. App. 3d 288, 297. 
“[I]t is clear that the availability of a remedy for breach of implied
warranty of habitability does not preclude a tenant from suing his landlord for
intentional infliction of mental distress if the landlord’s acts are extreme
and outrageous and result in severe mental distress.”  Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.
App. 3d 903, 922.
The complaint incorporates the
prior allegations and alleges that defendants’ conduct in intentionally failing
to repair and maintain the property was outrageous and beyond all boundaries
and reasonable civilized conduct. 
Defendants knew that failing to repair and maintain the property would
result in plaintiffs suffering emotional distress and other damages.  Defendants acted with reckless disregard of
the probability of causing plaintiffs severe emotional distress.  Defendants intentionally failed to repair and
maintain the property in an attempt to save money, increase their cash flow,
intimidate plaintiffs into not complaining, and/or to cause plaintiffs to
abandon the property.  Complaint, ¶49.
Defendants argue that the
allegations are generalized, do not show that the conduct was extreme and
outrageous, or that defendants intended to cause plaintiffs emotional distress.
In opposition, plaintiffs argue
that the allegations are sufficient.
            The Court finds that the allegations
do not show that defendants engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct or that
such conduct “exceeded all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized
community.”  Plaintiffs also do not show
that defendants intended to cause plaintiffs emotional distress.  Rather, plaintiffs allege that defendants’
conduct was based on monetary considerations. 
The allegations are also insufficient that plaintiffs suffered severe
emotional distress.
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE
TO AMEND as to the fourth cause of action. 
                        Fifth cause of action
for private nuisance
To establish an action for private
nuisance, (1) “the plaintiff must prove an interference with his use and
enjoyment of his property”; (2) “the invasion of the plaintiff’s interest in
the use and enjoyment of the land must be substantial, that is, that it causes
the plaintiff to suffer substantial actual damage”; (3) “the interference with
the protected interest must not only be substantial, but it must also be
unreasonable, i.e., it must be of such a nature, duration, or amount as to
constitute unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of the
land.”  Mendez v. Rancho Valencia
Resort Partners, LLC (2016) 3 Cal. App. 5th 248, 262-263.  
The complaint alleges that the
substandard conditions impacting the subject property, including unabated water
intrusion issues, among other problems at the property, led to plaintiffs
encountering substandard habitability conditions on a daily basis.  Complaint, ¶53.  These conditions obstructed plaintiffs’ free
and quiet use of the property to such extent as to materially interfere with
plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of the subject property.  Id., ¶54.
Defendants argue that the claim is
duplicative of the negligence cause of action.
In opposition, plaintiffs assert
that they have no objection to the Court sustaining the demurrer as to this
cause of action.
The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND as to the fifth cause of action.
 
            Motion to Strike
            Defendants
request that the Court strike paras. 26 (under general allegations), 37, 40,
and 41 (under second cause of action for tortious breach), 47 (under third
cause of action for negligence), 49 and 51 (under fourth cause of action for
IIED), 58 (under fifth cause of action for private nuisance), 65 (under sixth
cause of action), 70 (under seventh cause of action), and prayer at paras. 85
(as to second cause of action), 87 (as to third cause of action), 89 (as to
fourth cause of action), 91 (as to fifth cause of action), and 95 (as to
seventh cause of action) for punitive damages. 
Civil Code §3294 authorizes the
recovery of punitive damages in non-contract cases where “the defendant has
been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice . . . .”  The Court in Taylor v. Superior Court
(1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 894-95, found that “[s]omething more than the mere
commission of a tort is always required for punitive damages.  There must be circumstances of aggravation or
outrage, such as spite or ‘malice,’ or a fraudulent or evil motive on the part
of the defendant, or such a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests
of others that his conduct may be called willful or wanton.” 
“’Malice’ means conduct which is
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” 
Civil Code §3294(c)(1).   
As the Court noted in College
Hospital v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 713, Section 3294 was
amended in 1987 to require that, where malice is based on a defendant’s
conscious disregard of a plaintiff’s rights, the conduct must be both
despicable and willful.  The Court in
College Hospital held further that “despicable conduct refers to circumstances
that are base, vile, or contemptible.”  Id.
at 725 (citation omitted).
A claim for punitive damages may
not be based on conclusory allegations of oppression, fraud or malice, but
instead must be based on factual allegations which support such a
conclusion.  See Smith v. Superior
Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1041-42 (Court of Appeal
issued a peremptory writ directing trial court to issue order striking
plaintiff’s prayer for punitive damages because “[t]he sole basis for seeking
punitive damages are . . . conclusory allegations” which were “devoid of any
factual assertions supporting a conclusion [defendants] acted with oppression,
fraud, or malice”).
A tenant may state a cause of
action in tort against his landlord for damages resulting from a breach of the
implied warranty of habitability.”  Stoiber
v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal. App. 3d 903, 918-19; see also Smith v.
David (1981) 120 Cal. App. 3d 101, 112 n.3 (a tenant “may seek general and
punitive damages for . . . breach of warranty [of habitability]”).  The court in Stoiber found that
plaintiff stated sufficient facts to support exemplary damages when she “alleged
that defendant had actual knowledge of defective conditions in the premises
including leaking sewage, deteriorated flooring, falling ceiling, leaking roof,
broken windows, and other unsafe and dangerous conditions . . . [and] alleged
defendants ‘In maintaining said nuisance, . . . acted with full knowledge of
the consequences thereof and the damage being caused to plaintiff, and their
conduct was willful, oppressive and malicious.’”  Stoiber, supra, at 920 (citation
omitted). 
            Defendants argue that the
allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.
            In opposition, plaintiffs argue that
the allegations are sufficient.
            The Court rules as follows:  The motion is DENIED as to paras. 26, 37, 40,
41, 65, 70, and prayer at paras. 85 and 95 as the allegations are
sufficient.  See Stoiber,
supra.  Plaintiffs have alleged breach of
habitability.  The allegations support
malice in that defendants had actual knowledge of the defective conditions,
defendants failed to act, defendants maintained the defective conditions, and
defendants acted with full knowledge of the consequences and the damage (health
and safety) being caused to plaintiffs.  
The motion is GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO
AMEND as to paras. 49, 51, and 89 in light of the ruling on the demurrer as to
the fourth cause of action for IIED.  
The motion is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE
TO AMEND as to paras. 47 and 87 based on negligence and 58 and 91 based on
private nuisance (see ruling on demurrer as to the fifth cause of action).  “Inasmuch as Civil Code section 3294 requires
as a prerequisite to the recovery of punitive damages that the defendant ‘has
been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice,’ the cases have uniformly
recognized that proof of negligence, even gross negligence, or recklessness is
insufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages.”  Dawes v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal. App. 3d 82, 87 (citations omitted). 
 
ORDER
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH 20
DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND as to the fourth cause of action for IIED and SUSTAINED
WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to the fifth cause of action for private nuisance.
The motion to strike is DENIED as
to paras. 26, 37, 40, 41, 65, 70, and prayer at paras. 85 and 95.  The motion is GRANTED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO
AMEND as to paras. 49, 51, and 89.  The
motion is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to paras. 47 and 87 and 58 and 91.
            Defendants
are ordered to give notice of ruling.
