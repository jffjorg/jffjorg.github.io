English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc. to the fourth cause of action in a lemon law action brought by Arlene Ramirez. The court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, finding that the economic loss rule bars recovery in tort for purely economic losses. The court also concludes that Ramirez has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim for negligent repair. The ruling is based on the court's analysis of the legal standard for demurrers, the economic loss rule, and the lack of binding authority to support Ramirez's claims.
