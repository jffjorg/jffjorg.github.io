And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the complaint brought by the defendants, including the City of Glendale, the Glendale City Attorney's Office, the Glendale Police Department, and Ian Torley. The demurrer is sustained because the complaint fails to allege a recognized duty on the part of the moving defendants, and the claims alleged are subject to several immunity statutes. The judge grants the demurrer with leave to amend, giving the plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint.

The judge also grants the motion to strike the claims for punitive damages against the City of Glendale, citing Government Code section 818, which prohibits public entities from being liable for punitive damages. The motion to strike punitive damages against defendant Ian Torley, who is not a public entity, is denied.

The judge orders the parties to meet and confer before any further demurrer or motion to strike may be filed. The judge also orders the parties to appear remotely via LACourtConnect, which offers free audio and video appearances.
