And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying, without prejudice, the motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Svetlana G. Brouke. The motion was filed by The Hundley Law Firm, which is seeking to be relieved as counsel due to the client's failure to respond to over 20 attempts to contact her. The judge noted that the moving papers do not include a proposed order, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362 (e). The judge also noted that the proposed order is necessary to provide the client with important warnings and information concerning further proceedings, and to provide contact information for the client going forward. The judge ruled that the motion must be denied unless the moving attorney can show that a proposed order on the proper form and including the required information has been properly served on the client and other parties.
