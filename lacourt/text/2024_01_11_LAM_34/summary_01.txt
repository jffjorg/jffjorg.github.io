```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion to be relieved as counsel filed by plaintiff's counsel Aaron Darsky is denied as moot. The reason for this is that the plaintiff has substituted counsel Aaron Darsky for counsel Angela Swan with the consent of both the client and the attorney, as allowed by California Code of Civil Procedure section 284. Therefore, the former counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel is no longer necessary.
