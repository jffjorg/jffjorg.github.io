Mary Danner, Nicholas Scheib, Adilya Kamiyeva, and Marlene Maro filed their
Complaint against Defendants LA Valley Management, LLC, LA Valley Management

arising from Plaintiffs’ tenancies with Defendants. 
 
On March 28,

Complaint. 
 
On June 1,
2023, by request of Plaintiffs, the Clerk’s Office dismissed with prejudice all
Plaintiffs except Plaintiff Kristien Amer (“Plaintiff”) from the First Amended
Complaint. 
 
        On
December 14, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel, Aaron H. Darsky, filed: (1) Judicial
Council Form MC-051, Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil; (2) Judicial
Council Form MC-052, Declaration; (3) Judicial Council Form MC-053, Proposed
Order; and (4) Proof of Service. 
 
        On
January 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed her Judicial Council Form MC-050, Substitution
of Attorney—Civil. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
        With the consent of client and attorney,
Plaintiff has substituted Counsel Aaron Darsky for Counsel Angela Swan. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 284.) Thus, former Counsel Darsky’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel is moot. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
        The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is
DENIED as moot.
