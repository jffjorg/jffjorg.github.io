The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by Carolina Ruiz against Neomie F. Hernandez and her counsel, Anthony Willoughby II. The motion seeks an award of expenses and attorney's fees in the amount of $3,580.00.

The Court found that Hernandez's motions to compel responses were based on confusion regarding the applicable Code of Civil Procedure requirements, rather than an intentional misuse of the discovery process. Therefore, the Court did not find that Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 was violated and declined to award sanctions against Hernandez.

The Court further noted that Hernandez's counsel had been confused about the applicable Code of Civil Procedure requirements and had not intentionally sought to misuse the discovery process. As a result, the Court did not find that Hernandez's counsel had engaged in any wrongdoing worthy of sanctions.

The Court denied Carolina Ruiz's motion for sanctions and ordered Hernandez to give notice of the order.
