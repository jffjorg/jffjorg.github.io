The motion was based on allegations that Hernandez's motions to compel responses to discovery requests were frivolous and in bad faith. The judge found that there was no evidence of intentional misuse of the discovery process and that Hernandez's counsel had merely been confused about the applicable Code of Civil Procedure requirements. As a result, the court declined to award sanctions against Hernandez.
