Plaintiff alleges in April 2018, it leased the premises located at 608 S. Mateo Street and 609 Imperial Street, Los Angeles, CA to Defendants. The parties amended the lease in June 2018 and July 2018.

Proc. § 2033.280(c).) Monetary sanctions are mandatory against a party, attorney, or both whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) Here, Plaintiff’s counsel testifies that he propounded a second set of RFAs on Jennemann on July 19, 2023. (Revitz Decl., ¶3.) The responses were due on August 23, 2023. (Id., ¶5.) To date, Jennemann has not responded. (Id., ¶6.)Because Jennemann failed to provide any response to Plaintiff’s RFAs, the request is granted. The genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in Plaintiff’s motion are admitted.Sanctions are mandatory here because Jennemann failed to serve timely responses to the RFAs. Court awards Plaintiff $1,087.50 in sanctions for 2.5 hours of attorney time. DATED: December 13, 2023 ____________________________ Hon. Jill FeeneyJudge of the Superior Court
