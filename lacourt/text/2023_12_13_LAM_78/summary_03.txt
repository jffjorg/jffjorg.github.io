And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, General Motors, failed to repair serious defects in a 2022 GMC Yukon XL purchased by the plaintiff. The defendant failed to appear at an independent discovery conference, and the plaintiff's motion seeks to compel the defendant to produce documents related to the vehicle's defects, including warranty policies, repair orders, and customer complaints. The court grants the motion in part, ordering the defendant to produce specific documents, and denies it in part. The court declines to impose sanctions, stating that the motion was avoidable by both sides. The defendant is ordered to produce the requested documents within 20 days of the order, and a privilege log must also be produced if any documents are withheld based on a claim of privilege.
