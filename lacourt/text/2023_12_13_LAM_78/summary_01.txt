The judge has granted Plaintiff's motion to deem requests for admissions admitted as to Defendant Jennemann. The Plaintiff's counsel propounded a second set of requests for admissions (RFAs) on July 19, 2023, and the responses were due on August 23, 2023. However, Jennemann failed to respond to the RFAs. As a result, the court granted the motion and deemed the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted. Additionally, the court imposed sanctions in the amount of $1,087.50 against Jennemann for failing to serve timely responses to the RFAs. The sanctions are payable within 20 days after the date of this order.
