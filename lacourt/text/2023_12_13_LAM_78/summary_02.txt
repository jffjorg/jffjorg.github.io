And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to compel further responses to requests for production and form interrogatories in a lawsuit filed by Annette Brewer against Methodist Hospital of Southern California. The lawsuit alleges violations of the California Family Rights Act, Labor Code, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Plaintiff seeks to compel the Defendant to provide further responses to requests for production and form interrogatories that were previously served. The Court grants the motion as to form interrogatory 12.1 and denies it as to request 25. The Court also grants the motion in part as to Requests Nos. 27 and 29, but orders that the Defendant must provide the name and last known contact information of employees who made complaints about the Defendant's employees, Kelly Rivers and Anahid, under a protective order. The Court imposes sanctions of $1,350 on the Defendant for its misuse of the discovery process.
