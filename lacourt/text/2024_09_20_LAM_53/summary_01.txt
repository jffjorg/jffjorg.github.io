And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories. The defendant, Sommer Ray Beaty, had requested that the plaintiffs, Anthony Aiello and Anthony's Worldwide Productions, LLC, serve further responses to her discovery requests. However, the judge found that the defendant did not properly serve the moving papers on the plaintiffs and did not provide them with sufficient notice of the hearing date. As a result, the judge denied the motion and ordered the defendant to provide notice of the ruling. The judge also noted that the trial in this case is scheduled to begin on October 30, 2024, and therefore was unable to continue the hearing on the motion to a date before the discovery motion cutoff date passes.
