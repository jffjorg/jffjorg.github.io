MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Kristin Davidkhanian           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Kristin Davidkhanian (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order granting her leave to file a First Amended Complaint to add a cause of
action for failure to produce her personnel file in violation of Labor Code
section 1198.5, the facts giving rise to which Plaintiff discovered in April
2024.  (Notice of Mot., p. 3:22-25; Banayan
Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)
The court finds that (1) it is in furtherance of justice to allow
Plaintiff to amend her complaint to add a cause of action for the alleged
failure to produce her personnel file in violation of Labor Code section
1198.5, and (2) defendants Advanced Skin Care Center, Inc., Elena Janev, and
Cyrus Rafael Lavian, M.D., have not shown that they will be misled or unduly
prejudiced by the amendment.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (a); Mac v. Minassian (2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 510, 519
[“‘ “California courts ‘have a policy of great liberality in allowing
amendments at any stage of the proceeding so as to dispose of cases upon their
substantial merits where the authorization does not prejudice the substantial
rights of others.’  [Citation.]” ’”].)  The court therefore grants Plaintiff’s
motion.
ORDER
            The court grants plaintiff Kristin
Davidkhanian’s motion for leave to file first amended complaint.
            The court orders plaintiff Kristin
Davidkhanian to file the First Amended Complaint, in the form attached as
Exhibit A to the motion for leave to file first amended complaint, within 5
days of the date of this order. 
            The court orders plaintiff Kristin
Davidkhanian to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
