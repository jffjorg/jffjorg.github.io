Motion
to Compel Arbitration
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Rex Wise alleges defendants Solgen Construction,
LLC, Sunlight Financial, LLC and Cross River Bank, denies ever executing a
30-year loan agreement for the financing of solar panels to Plaintiff’s
residence. Plaintiff sought to cancel the contracts, but defendants refused. 
 
Plaintiff alleges a Public Injunction enjoining Solgen
Construction, LLC from engaging in solar panel installations without adhering
to certain standards, due to prior fraudulent activities.
 
On August 1 and 24, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint and
first amended complaint for Fraudulent Concealment; Negligence; Violations of
The Elder Abuse And Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (Welfare &
Institutions Code §15610.07, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Rosenthal Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act (Civil Code §1788, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Home
Solicitation Sales Act (Civil Code §1689.5, Et Seq.); Violations Of Business
And Professions Code §7150, et seq.; Violations Of The Truth In Lending Act (15
U.S.C. § 1601, Et Seq.); Violations Of The Credit Services Act (Civil Code
§1789.10, Et Seq.); and, Violations Of The Unfair Competition Law (Business
& Professions Code §17200, et seq.)
 
On November 1, 2023, Sunlight Financial LLC filed a notice
of stay of proceedings based on the filing of a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy petition
on October 31, 2023. On November 2, 2023, the court stayed the entire case. On
January 16, 2024, Sunlight Financial filed a notice of termination of stay. 
 
RULING: Continued.
Defendants Sunlight Financial LLC and Cross River Bank move
to compel arbitration. 
 
The motion was continued from November 15, 2023, following
the imposition of the stay by the court on November 2, 2023. Plaintiff was not
given the opportunity to address the impact of the stay since the opposition
was initially filed on November 1, 2023, the same date as the filing of the
notice of the stay. The reply lacks any acknowledgment of the stay even though
it was filed on January 16, 2024. Sunlight Financial filed a notice of
termination of stay on the same day.
 
Notwithstanding the notice of
termination of stay by Sunlight Financial LLC, the original notice of stay
indicates Sunlight Financial, LLC remains a named party in the bankruptcy
petition. [Notice of Stay of Proceedings.] The notice of termination of stay
provides no indication of the bankruptcy status of Sunlight Financial, LLC
notwithstanding the termination of the stay. The court declines to determine
any termination of bankruptcy jurisdiction absent a verified statement from
Sunlight Financial, LLC. Assuming continuing jurisdiction, the Bankruptcy
Trustee maintains the ability to exert certain rights or require approval for
any actions involving Sunlight Financial LLC assets. (M & M Foods, Inc.
v. Pacific American Fish Co., Inc. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 554, 560-561; Bostanian v. Liberty Savings Bank (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1075, 1083-1084.) 
 
As for the motion by Cross River
Bank, while the court finds no bar to Cross River Bank moving to compel
arbitration, the court prefers the participation of all parties, and seeks to
avoid potential piecemeal adjudication. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subd.
(c-d).) Solgen Construction is not an identified moving party to the subject
motion. The motion lacks address of Solgen Construction as a potentially
integral party to any arbitration. 
 
Thus, rather than proceed with pending questions on Sunlight
Financial, LLC and Solgen Construction, the court instead elects to postpone
consideration of the motion in order to allow further clarification of raised
concerns. The court therefore continues the hearing for 60 days to be
determined at the hearing. 
 
The parties are each ordered to submit supplemental briefs
of no more than five (5) pages of points and authorities per brief, plus any
declarations or exhibits. The court specifically requests address of the status of Sunlight Financial, LLC, such as whether a
discharge of Sunlight Financial, LLC from the Bankruptcy Court occurred; the
basis of the release from the stay if Sunlight Financial, LLC remains before
the Bankruptcy Court; any notice or approval of the subject motion by the
trustee; the necessity of Solgen Construction as a participating party in
arbitration in order to accord complete relief in the arbitration proceeding;
and, any basis of joinder for Solgen Construction to the arbitration. The
supplemental brief, opposition(s), and reply, are due pursuant to statutory
guidelines indexed the new hearing date (e.g. 16 court, nine (9) court days,
and five (5) court days from the new hearing date).
 
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel on calendar for February
14, 2023.
 
Defendants to provide notice to all parties.
