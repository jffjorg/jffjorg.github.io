The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of United Broadway Real Estate Company, LLC v. Enrique Martinez. The plaintiff filed a complaint for unlawful detainer against the defendant, alleging that the defendant breached a five-year lease and owes $39,200 in delinquency as of October 31, 2023. The defendant answered the complaint and the court overruled the defendant's demurrer on December 15, 2023. The plaintiff then moved to deem the defendant's responses to requests for admissions admitted, which the defendant opposed. However, the motion was unopposed and the court granted it, deeming the requests for admissions admitted. The court also imposed sanctions of $250 against the defendant, payable within 30 days. The trial is scheduled for February 9, 2024, and a motion to compel production of documents is scheduled for February 13, 2024.
