And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for fraud in the second amended complaint without leave to amend. The defendants, Kamran and Ramin Rahimi, had challenged the fraud claim on the grounds that the plaintiff, Elliot Tishbi, fails to allege a separate and independent cause of action from the breach of contract claim, including a claim of damages beyond the contract. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendants never intended to pay the fee and had made misrepresentations to induce the plaintiff to agree to the oral contract. The court found that the fraud claim is not pled with sufficient factual particularity and that the plaintiff cannot allege a fraud claim arising from the non-performance of the oral contract. The court also found that the damages sought are not from the lost commission, but from the "lost profits" from the failed overseas textile purchase, which lacks a separate and independent basis for recovery in fraud. Therefore, the court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend as to the second cause of action.
