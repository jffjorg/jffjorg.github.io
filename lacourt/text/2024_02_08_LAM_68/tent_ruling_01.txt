to the Second Amended Complaint

Cause of Action: Fraud
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Elliot Tishbi alleges an oral agreement with
defendants Kamran and Ramin Rahimi in May 2021, whereby if Plaintiff found a
tenant to enter into a one year minimum lease for premises located at 794-796
Stanford Avenue, Los Angeles, Defendants would pay Plaintiff a $50,000 fee. Plaintiff
alleges the placement of a tenant for a three year lease term. No fee was ever
paid. 
 
On January 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach
of Oral Contract, Fraud, and Violation of Penal Code section 496, subdivision
(a). On July 5, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the complaint. On
August 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint for Breach of Oral
Contract, Fraud, and Violation of Penal Code section 496, subdivision (a) on
August 1, 2023. On December 11, 2023, the court overruled the demurrer to the
breach of contract cause of action, and sustained the demurrer to the remainder
of the first amended complaint with 20 days leave to amend. On December 29,
2023, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint for Breach of Oral Contract,
and Fraud.
 
RULING: Sustained
without Leave to Amend.
Defendants Kamran and Ramin Rahimi submit a demurrer to the
second cause of action for fraud in the second amended complaint. Defendants
challenge the fraud claim on grounds that Plaintiff fails to allege a separate
and independent cause of action from the breach of contract claim, including a
claim of damages beyond the contract. Defendants also contend Plaintiff added
new, inconsistent factual allegations from the complaint and first amended
complaint in order to evade a demurrer. Plaintiff in opposition denies pleading
the fraud claim as an improper alternative to the breach of contract claim.
Plaintiff additionally maintains the fraud claim is pled with sufficient
factual particularity. 
 
The court electronic filing system shows no reply on file at
the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see
also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a
pleading “by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all
material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions
of fact or law . . . .” ’ ” (Berkley v.
Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the
court liberally construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action
has been stated.  (Picton v. Anderson Union High School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th
726, 733.)
 
“A demurrer for
uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects
uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616; Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
135, 139 [“[U]nder our liberal pleading rules,
where the complaint contains substantive factual allegations sufficiently
apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet, a demurrer for
uncertainty should be overruled or plaintiff given leave to amend.] 
 
“‘The elements of fraud, which
give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a) misrepresentation (false
representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or
“scienter”); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage.’” … [¶] ‘Promissory fraud’
is a subspecies of the action for fraud and
deceit. A promise to do something necessarily implies the intention to
perform; hence, where a promise is made without such intention, there is an
implied misrepresentation of fact that may be actionable fraud.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 638.) “Fraud
in the inducement is a subset of the tort of fraud. It ‘occurs when “‘the
promisor knows what he is signing but his consent is induced by fraud, mutual
assent is present and a contract is formed, which, by reason of the fraud, is
voidable.’”’ (Citations.)” (Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294-295.) “[I]n
order to support a claim of fraud based upon the alleged failure to perform a
promise, it must be shown that the promisor did not intend to perform at the
time the promise was made. (Conrad v. Bank of America (1996) 45
Cal.App.4th 133, 157 accord Tenzer v. Superscope, Inc. (1985) 39 Cal.3d
18, 30.)
 
On the inconsistencies argument, the court addresses the
standard for a sham pleading. “Where a party files an amended complaint and
seeks to avoid the defects of a prior complaint either by omitting the facts
that rendered the complaint defective or by pleading facts inconsistent with
the allegations of prior pleadings” the pleading is considered a sham pleading.
(Owens v. Kings Supermarket (1988)
198 Cal.App.3d 379, 383-384; Berman v.
Bromberg (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 936,
946 [“A pleader may not attempt to breathe life into a complaint by omitting
relevant facts which made his previous complaint defective”].) A pleader
is entitled to explain any inconsistencies. (Ibid.) 
 
Defendants focus on the additional allegations regarding
“lost profits” from an “overseas” order, as the basis of the contention for
newly manufactured allegations regarding efforts to evade the prior orders
sustaining the demurrer. As addressed below, the court finds the additional
arguments inconsequential to the demurrer itself, and therefore declines to
determine any improper inconsistencies.
 
The fraud claim initially appears to arise in promissory
fraud in that Defendants never intended to pay at the time of making the
purported agreement. [Sec. Amend. Comp., ¶ 31.] Plaintiff then adds in said new
allegations regarding the needed commission for an overseas textile purchase.
[Sec. Amend. Comp., ¶ 32.] Finally, Plaintiff also alleges fraud based on “an
attempt to avoid litigation” through an offer to pay the commission if
Plaintiff delayed suing. [Sec. Amend. Comp., ¶ 36.] 
 
Consistent with the prior holdings, Plaintiff cannot allege
a fraud claim arising from the non-performance of the oral contract, no matter
how the claim is framed and pled. (Tenzer v. Superscope, Inc., supra,
39 Cal.3d at pp. 30-31; Conrad v. Bank of America, supra, 45
Cal.App.4th at p. 157.) Decoupling the fraud claim from the breach of contract,
as argued by Plaintiff, renders the damages sought as not from the lost
commission, but the “lost profits” from the failed overseas textile purchase.
[Sec. Amend. Comp., ¶ 42.] The court finds the additional lost opportunity
profits in the overseas textile deal allegations, also lack a separate and
independent basis for recovery in fraud.
 
Again, assuming the change in the basis of the claim, the
elements of fraud still require consideration of the reliance and causation
elements of the claim. “The plaintiff must also plead the injury or damage
suffered and its causal connection to plaintiff's reliance on the defendant's
misrepresentations.” (Thrifty Payless, Inc. v. The Americana at Brand, LLC
(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1230, 1239.) “Actual reliance occurs when a
misrepresentation is an immediate cause of [a plaintiff's] conduct, which
alters his legal relations, and when, absent such representation, he would not,
in all reasonable probability, have entered into the contract or other
transaction.” (Conroy v. Regents of University of California (2009) 45
Cal.4th 1244, 1256 (internal quotation marks omitted).)
 
Essentially, Plaintiff seeks to allege fraud by
characterizing the lease commission as part of a separate, unrelated business
dealing with third parties. The presumption further requires a finding that the
communication of urgency to receive said payment, due to the pending
transaction for the overseas shipment in no way reflects back on the purported
agreement between the parties. The court finds no basis for an independent
fraud claim under this factual scenario. 
 
The operative complaint indicates Plaintiff agreed to
perform the brokerage services for payment, whether or not the secondary deal
was pending or not. Knowledge of the outstanding “overseas” textile order by
Defendants in no way alters the underlying agreement between the parties for
payment of a commission upon the placement of a tenant for a minimum of one
year. Thus, the court finds no basis of reasonable reliance or causation based
on knowledge of the other pending transaction(s) with third parties. The
promise on the failure to perform claim arises from the core lease commission
agreement, not the overseas transaction. The damages are therefore subsumed
into the breach of contract claim and cannot be separately pled as an
alternative fraud claim.
 
After three successive efforts, and three demurrers, the
court finds Plaintiff is unable to establish a basis of a claim against
defendant on the fraud claim. The court therefore sustains the demurrer without
leave to amend as to the second cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41,
subd. (e)(1); Youngman v. Nevada Irr. Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.) Defendant
