  RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED 
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
December
   12, 2024




 


 


 



 
Niko
 Kravchenko, Esq. seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiff
 Terri Rivers on grounds that irreconcilable
 differences of opinion have arisen relating to the handling of the case.
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal
should be granted. (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
The Court notes that trial in this
matter is set for April 28, 2025, and no prejudice will result from granting
this motion. Although the proposed order did not identify the final status
conference scheduled for April 16, 2025 at 9:30 a.m. the Court has inserted
that information. The motion to be relieved is GRANTED effective upon filing
proof of service of the Court’s Order on Form MC-053. 
Moving party to give notice.
Dated
this 12th
day of December 2024
