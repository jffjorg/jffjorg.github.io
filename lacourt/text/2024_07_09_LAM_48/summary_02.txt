And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the petition to confirm the arbitration award to August 29, 2024. The petition was filed by Stris & Maher LLP on November 8, 2023, and an opposition was filed by Daniel S. March on January 4, 2024. The court has stricken two motions filed by the petitioner, one on May 23, 2024, and another on May 29, 2024, due to lack of compliance with the law or court orders. The petitioner has dismissed Respondent Tony Diab on June 3, 2024. The court has ordered the petitioner to file a copy of the agreement to arbitrate by August 24, 2024.

The judge notes that the petition does not include a copy of the agreement to arbitrate, and that arbitration of attorney-client fee disputes is voluntary for clients and only mandatory for attorneys when commenced by the client. The court has determined that the burden of proof for confirming the award is on the party seeking to enforce it, and that the court must first find that the parties agreed in writing to arbitrate their dispute. The judge has also cited a relevant case, Toal v. Tardif (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1208, 1220.
