to arbitrate, (2) the names of the arbitrators, and (3) the award and the written

The court must either confirm the award as made, correct the award and confirm
it as corrected, vacate the award, or dismiss the proceeding.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)
The
petition complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4.  The petition includes a copy of the parties’ agreement
to arbitrate.  (Petition,  Ex. 4(b).) 
Natalie Panossian-Bassler served as the sole arbitrator.  A copy of the arbitration award is attached to
the petition.  (Petition,  Ex. 8(c).) 
The proposed judgment contains the exact language of the arbitrator’s award.  Respondent has not opposed the petition.
Accordingly,
the unopposed petition is GRANTED.  The Court
will sign the proposed judgment.
Moving

Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
