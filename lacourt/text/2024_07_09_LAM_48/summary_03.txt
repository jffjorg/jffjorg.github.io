Significant Statements:
  - "If a defendant is not validly served with a summons and complaint, the court lacks personal jurisdiction and a default judgment in such action is subject to being set aside as void." (Lee v. An)
  - "If the court has acquired jurisdiction, i.e., summons has been served, but service of summons has not resulted in actual notice to a defendant, although the defendant has acquired actual knowledge of the action from another source, this does not preclude a defendant from seeking relief under section 473.5." (Olvera v. Olvera)
  - "The law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, and only very slight evidence is required to set aside an entry of default." (Elston v. City of Turlock)
  - "When evaluating a motion to set aside a default judgment on equitable grounds, the 'court must weigh the reasonableness of the conduct of the moving party in light of the extent of the prejudice to the responding party.'" (Lasalle v. Vogel)
