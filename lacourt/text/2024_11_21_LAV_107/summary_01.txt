And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the parties' submissions regarding the motion to enforce the settlement agreement. The judge has determined that the settlement agreement was conditioned on certain events occurring, including the complete execution of the agreement by all parties, notification that the BMW FS Settlement has been fully executed, and notification of entry of the court order as set forth in the Stipulation & Order. Since Atinger has not submitted evidence showing that these conditions were satisfied, the judge has denied the motion to enforce the settlement agreement. Additionally, the judge has determined that Atinger is not entitled to attorneys' fees since they are not the prevailing party.
