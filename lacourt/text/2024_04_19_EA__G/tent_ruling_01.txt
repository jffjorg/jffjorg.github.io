BACKGROUND
This is a contractual fraud
action. In July 2017, Plaintiff Ming-Hua Chiu decided a purchase a warehouse in
San Bernardino for Chiu’s retail marijuana business. In order to facilitate the
purchase, Chiu allegedly entered into an oral agreement with Defendant Paul
Tsai in which Chiu and Paul Tsai agreed to form an entity for the purchase and
operation of the warehouse. Chiu also agreed to allow Paul Tsai to manage the
day-to-day operations of the warehouse as Chiu lived in Taiwan. Paul Tsai then allegedly
formed Defendant Huaone Group, LLC (Huaone Group) with Paul Tsai as the sole
officer, manager, and member. During the process of purchasing the warehouse, Paul
Tsai allegedly told Chiu that Chiu needed to pay an additional $200,000 to the
seller and had Chiu send the funds to Defendant Ching Chun Cheng. Chiu alleges
that Cheng was not in fact an owner of the warehouse.
In October 2017, Paul Tsai
allegedly told Chiu that funds were needed for the renovation of the warehouse
and Chiu agreed to wire a total of $330,000. In February 2018, Paul Tsai
allegedly told Chiu that the warehouse had been burglarized and that the
renovation work had been destroyed. But when Chiu asked for evidence of the
burglary, Paul Tsai allegedly failed to produce any. Paul Tsai’s wife,
Defendant YiChun Tsai, also told Chiu that they had allegedly spent more than
$200,000 for hiring an attorney and had been charged $360,000 for the repair of
the warehouse by the government. Chiu alleges YiChun Tsai was unable to present
any evidence to support these representations.
In April 2018, Chiu asked
Paul Tsai to transfer the warehouse’s title to Chiu. Paul Tsai allegedly agreed
and on April 2, 2018, prepared and executed a grant deed that transferred the
title of warehouse from the Huaone Group to Chiu. In March 2019, Chiu alleges
Paul Tsai then sold the warehouse to Defendant America United Development, LLC
(AUD), an entity owned by Paul Tsai. In September 2021, Chiu then alleges AUD
sold the warehouse to third parties. Chiu alleges Chiu first discovered the
warehouse had been sold when Chiu hired a real estate agent to manage the
property in December 2021.
On January 19, 2022, Chiu
filed a complaint against Huaone Group, AUD, Paul Tsai, Cheng, YiChun Tsai, and
Does 1-50, alleging the following causes of action: (1) fraud, (2) breach of
fiduciary duty, (3) breach of contract, (4) conversion, (5) common counts, (6)
fraudulent transfer, and (7) declaratory relief.
On June 6, 2022, Chiu
dismissed Cheng from the present action.
On October 25, 2023, the
court held an informal discovery conference where it ordered AUD, Paul Tsai,
and YiChun Tsai to respond to Chiu’s form interrogatories, special
interrogatories, and requests for production by December 1.
On December 19-20, 2023, Chiu
filed the present motions.
On January 17, 2024, default was
entered against Huaone Group.
A hearing on the present
motions is set for April 19, 2024.
ANALYSIS
Chiu
moves for issue and evidentiary or terminating sanctions against AUD, Paul
Tsai, and YiChun Tsai (collectively, Tsai Defendants) for their failure to
comply with the court’s October 25 order. The court rules as follows:
Legal Standard
The
court may impose a monetary sanction, issue sanction, evidence sanction,
terminating sanction, or contempt sanction on a party who engages in conduct
that misuses the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) Misuse of
the discovery process includes “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery” and “[d]isobeying a court order to provide
discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d), (g).) Because the purpose
of sanctions is remedial and not punitive, sanctions should “serve to remedy
the harm caused to the party suffering the discovery misconduct.” (Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 74.)
“[A]bsent unusual circumstances, nonmonetary sanctions are¿warranted only if a
party willfully fails to comply with a court order.” (Aghaian v. Minassian (2021)
64 Cal.App.5th 603, 618-619.) Terminating sanctions should only be ordered when
there has been previous noncompliance and it appears a less severe sanction
would not be effective. (Link v. Cater (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1315,
1326.)
Discussion
In
an informal discovery conference on October 25, 2023, the court ordered the
Tsai Defendants to respond to Chiu’s discovery requests in the following
manner. With regards to Chiu’s first set of form interrogatories, the court
ordered AUD and Paul Tsai to respond to Nos. 9.1, 9.2, 12.1, 17.1, 50.1, 50.2,
50.3, and 50.4. The court also ordered YiChun Tsai to respond to Nos. 9.1, 9.2,
12.1, 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, and 50.4. As to Chiu’s first set of special
interrogatories, the court ordered AUD to respond to Nos. 2, 12, 13, and 14;
Paul Tsai to respond to Nos. 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 14; and YiChun Tsai to
respond to Nos. 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10. Last, with regards to Chiu’s first set
of requests for production, the court ordered AUD to respond to Nos. 1-15, Paul
Tsai to respond to Nos. 1-23, and YiChun Tsai to respond to Nos. 1-21. The
court ordered all responses to be verified without objection and served on Chiu
by December 1, 2023.
After
the Tsai Defendants failed to provide the responses by the December 1, 2023
deadline, Chiu’s counsel gave the Tsai Defendants’ counsel an additional two
weeks to provide responses. (Li Decl., ¶ 5-7.) The Tsai Defendants’ counsel
acknowledged the extension. (Li Decl., Ex. E.) In the afternoon of December 14,
the Tsai Defendants’ counsel requested another extension to December 18,
stating counsel was awaiting the Tsai Defendants’ final input and signatures on
the draft responses and that the Tsai Defendants were currently traveling in
Taiwan. (Li Decl., Ex. F.) Chiu’s counsel refused to give the extension and
proceeded with the present motion. (Li Decl., ¶ 8.) Because this is the first
time Chiu has moved to compel compliance with the court’s discovery order, the
court finds nonmonetary sanctions are premature. Instead, the court will give the
Tsai Defendants an additional ten (10) days to comply with the court’s order.
If Defendants fail to do so, Chiu may resubmit the present motions and seek
nonmonetary sanctions.
Chiu
also requests an award of sanctions. Because the Tsai Defendants failed to
timely comply with the court’s previous order and necessitated the filing of
the present motions, the court finds sanctions are warranted. Accordingly,
utilizing a lodestar approach and in view of the totality of the circumstances,
the court awards sanctions against the Tsai Defendants and their counsel and
finds reasonable attorney fees and costs in the total amount of $228.75 for
each motion (0.75 hours for drafting the motion and attending the hearing at an
hourly rate of $225 an hour plus $60.00 in filing fees).  Sanctions totaling $2,058.75 are awarded to
Plaintiff, payable by Defendants in thirty (30) days.
