STEPHEN CLEGG and MICHAEL EMMENs,
  individually, and on behalf of other aggrieved employees 
 
        
  vs.
 
BOB’s DISCOUNT
  FURNITURE, LLC
 


 Case
  No.:  21STCV15281   
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: June 6, 2024



 
Plaintiffs’
motion for approval of representative action settlement is GRANTED.
 
            On
3/28/2024, Plaintiffs Stephen Clegg and Michael Emmens, individually, and on
behalf of other aggrieved employees, filed suit alleging: (1) violation of
California Labor Code Sections 2800,2802, and 2804; (2) violation of Business
and Professions Code section 17220. 
 
Now,
Plaintiff moves for approval of the Representative Action Settlement. 
 
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
 
            The
parties have agreed to a Gross Settlement Amount of $900,000. After deduction
of attorney’s fees and litigation expenses, litigation enhancement to
Plaintiffs, and settlement administration costs as discussed in the Agreement,
the remaining amount to be divided between the Labor and Workforce Development
Agency (LWDA) and the aggrieved employees as required by Labor Code section
2699(i) is $562,222.68 with $421,667.01 (or 75%) going to the LWDA and
$140,555.67 (or 25%) distributed to the aggrieved employees.
 
To determine whether a settlement is fair,
adequate and reasonable, the court must independently and objectively analyze
the evidence and circumstances before it in order to determine whether the
settlement is in the best interests of those whose claims will be
extinguished. (Kullar v.
Foot Locker Retail, Inc.¿(2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 116, 130.) A non-exhaustive list of factors that the trial
court should consider in evaluating the reasonableness of a class action
settlement agreement includes the strength of plaintiffs' case, the risk,
expense, complexity and likely duration of further litigation, the risk of
maintaining class action status through trial, the amount offered in
settlement, the extent of discovery completed and stage of the proceedings, the
experience and views of counsel, the presence of a governmental participant,
and the reaction of the class members to the proposed settlement. (Id.
at 129.) 
 
            Here,
the parties participated in two different mediations, and the Settlement Amount
reflects the competing risks associated with litigating these claims.
Plaintiffs’ motion thoroughly sets through an analysis of the competing risks
here, to show that considerable thought and investigation was put into the
decision to settle the claims. 
 
            The
Court also finds the $300,000, or 33.3% of the Gross Settlement Amount, and
$19,077.32 in litigation reimbursement fees and costs to be reasonable.  (See Laffitte v. Robert Half Intern. Inc.
(Cal. 2016) 205 Cal.Rptr.3d 555, 573.) 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion for approval of representative action
settlement is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
