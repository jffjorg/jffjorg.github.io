## English Summary

The judge's tentative ruling states that the case, which was stayed due to the defendant's bankruptcy filing, can potentially proceed.  

The court is waiting to confirm if all parties agree that the Bankruptcy Court's decision to lift the stay is acceptable. If agreed upon, the court will determine the remaining time to bring the case to trial and set a trial date accordingly. 

The judge is also considering the possibility of extending this timeframe to accommodate the trial schedule, as the case appears to be lengthy.  The defendant suggests the case might be eligible for statutory preference, which could impact the trial scheduling.
