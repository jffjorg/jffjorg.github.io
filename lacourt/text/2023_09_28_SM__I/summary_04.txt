## English Text Summary

The judge has tentatively ruled to sustain the demurrer filed by the property manager, meaning the plaintiff's complaint against the property manager needs to be revised. 

The plaintiff claims the property manager failed to address a water leak that damaged their property, arguing they are a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the property manager and the COA. However, the plaintiff hasn't sufficiently explained how the contract supports their claim. 

The judge suggests the plaintiff attach the contract to their amended complaint, or at least paraphrase the relevant parts. The judge also denied the motion to strike, meaning the plaintiff can still pursue claims for punitive damages. The plaintiff has 30 days to amend their complaint.
