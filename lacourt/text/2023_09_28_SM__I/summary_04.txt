And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by the property manager with leave to amend. The plaintiff alleges that the property manager failed to take appropriate action regarding a water leak that damaged their property, despite the problem being obvious for years. The property manager claims that it owes a duty to the COA, but not to the plaintiff, as a third-party beneficiary. However, the plaintiff has not adequately alleged this status or provided sufficient contract language to support their claim. The judge suggests that the plaintiff attach the contract or paraphrase its language to support their claim. The plaintiff has 30 days to amend the complaint. The motion to strike punitive damages is denied, as the complaint is sufficient to allege punitive damages at the pleading stage.
