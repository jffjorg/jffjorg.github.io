 Case Number:  SC123657    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  I On the eve of trial, defendant sought bankruptcy
protection.  Plaintiff informed the court
of that and the court entered a stay of the entire case.  The court is informed that Triurol has
successfully moved the Bankruptcy Court for relief from that stay.  The court will inquire whether all parties
agree that the stay is lifted.  While the
court notes that the normal 14 day stay of the order was superseded by the
Bankruptcy Court, the court does not know whether any party is planning to
appeal the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling or whether any other grounds exist for the
court to maintain the stay of the entire case.
If all parties agree that the stay ought to be lifted, the
court will inquire as to when the time to bring the case to trial expires and
the court will set a trial date accordingly. 
The court might also seek to have the parties agree to further extend
that time to allow the court to fit this case (which appears to be a long one)
into its trial docket.  The court is
aware that Triurol is suggesting that the case might be entitled to statutory
preference.
