The judge found the Plaintiff's complaint insufficient because it didn't include the specific CC&Rs (governing documents) allegedly breached and didn't demonstrate that the Plaintiff had attempted alternative dispute resolution (ADR) as required by the CC&Rs. 

The judge also reminded the Plaintiff that there are resources available to help self-represented litigants, and urged them to utilize those resources. Finally, the judge highlighted the need for the Plaintiff to comply with California Civil Code Section 5950 when filing the amended complaint.  Failure to do so could result in the case being dismissed without further opportunity to amend.
