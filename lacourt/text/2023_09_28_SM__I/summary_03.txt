And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's complaint will be sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiff is suing the HOA for alleged breaches of the CC&R's, but failed to attach the relevant documents and quote the appropriate sections. The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint and attach the required documents. The plaintiff must also address the defendant's contention that the plaintiff failed to attempt alternative dispute resolution before filing the suit. The judge notes that the plaintiff claims to be unable to afford counsel, but advises the plaintiff to seek out free or low-cost resources available to self-represented litigants. The judge also reminds the plaintiff of the requirements of Civil Code section 5950, which must be met in order to avoid dismissal of the case.
