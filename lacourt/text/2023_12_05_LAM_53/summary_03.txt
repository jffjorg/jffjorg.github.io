And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Robert B. Broadbelt III regarding a motion to be relieved as counsel for defendant Smart Resources Nursing Registry. The court grants the motion, finding that defendant's counsel, W. Dan Lee, has shown sufficient reasons for withdrawal and has served the defendant with the moving papers. The court also notes that plaintiff Angela Brown's opposition to the motion is insufficient, as she has not cited any authority supporting her request that the court deny the motion. The court orders W. Dan Lee to be relieved as counsel effective upon the filing of the signed "Order Granting Attorney's Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil".
