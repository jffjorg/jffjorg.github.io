  Case Number:  24AHCV00190    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING REQUESTS
FOR ADMISSIONS SET TWO BE DEEMED ADMITTED I.         INTRODUCTION
On April 7, 2023, Plaintiff Cynthia
Ricks (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant L.A. Downtown Medical
Center, Inc. and Does 1 to 10 (“Defendant”), alleging medical negligence.
Plaintiff claims that Defendant breached its duty of care as a healthcare
provider when she slipped and fell on a foreign substance in the cafeteria
while she was a patient at Defendant’s facility, resulting in serious injuries.
On September 18, 2024, the Court
granted Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition.
On August 2, 2024, Defendant
electronically served Requests for Admissions, Set Two, on Plaintiff.
Plaintiff’s responses were due by September 2, 2024, but she did not provide
any responses. On September 6, 2024, Defendant sent a follow-up letter to Plaintiff’s
counsel, extending the deadline for responses to September 13, 2024. Despite
this extension, Plaintiff failed to respond.
Defendant now moves to have the
Requests for Admissions, Set Two, deemed admitted due to Plaintiff’s failure to
provide timely responses by the extended deadline.
Moving Party Position
Defendant moves for an order
deeming the matters in its Requests for Admissions, Set Two, admitted due to
Plaintiff’s failure to respond in a timely manner. Defendant asserts that
Plaintiff did not provide any responses by the September 2, 2024, deadline, and
despite an extension to September 13, 2024, no responses were received by the
time this motion was filed on September 23, 2024.
Opposition
Plaintiff opposes this motion,
arguing that it is moot because they provided response to Requests for
Admissions, Set Two on October 16, 2024.           
            II.        REQUESTS
FOR ADMISSIONS 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other
party to the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth
of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law
to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after
service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed
shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a
copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared . . . .”¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.250(a).)  
If a party to whom request for admissions are served fails to provide a
timely response, the party to whom the request was directed waives any
objections, including based on privilege or the work product doctrine. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(a).) The requesting party can move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
request be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this order unless the party to
whom the request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to
the hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
Defendant electronically served its RFAs Set Two on Plaintiff’s counsel
on August 2, 2024 (Exhibit A; Kim Decl. ¶3). Plaintiff’s responses were due by
September 2, 2024, but no responses were received. Despite this, Defendant
extended the deadline to September 13, 2024 (Exhibit B; Kim Decl. ¶6). As of
September 9, 2024, no responses had been provided (Motion, p. 4).
However, on October 16, 2024, before the hearing on this motion,
Plaintiff served responses to Defendant’s RFAs, Set Two (Yeager Decl. ¶2).
Because Plaintiff served responses before the hearing, Defendant’s motion to
deem the RFAs admitted is rendered moot. Pursuant to CCP section 2033.280(c),
the Court must deny the motion to deem the RFAs admitted.
Accordingly, Defendants request to deem the RFAs admitted is DENIED as it
is moot. 
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this order.
 
Sanctions
            Defendant has not requested any
sanctions.
            
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Motion by Defendant
for an Order to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted Set Two is DENIED. 
Defendant is ordered to provide
notice of this order.
