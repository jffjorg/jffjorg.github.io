The judge has also continued the Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to Enter Default Judgment to March 11, 2025. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative ruling must send an email to the court to indicate their intention to submit. If all parties submit, no appearances before the court are required unless there is a companion hearing.
