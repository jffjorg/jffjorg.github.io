The Judge grants the unopposed motion to seal exhibits and portions of the Declaration. The motion is based on the attorney-client privilege concern, which is an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record. The Judge finds that the proposed redaction is narrowly tailored and there are no less restrictive means to achieve the overriding interest. The motion is granted for Exhibit 1 (Billing Records) and Exhibit 6 (References to Confidential Information). The Judge also orders that the hearings scheduled for January 14, 2025 be continued to January 16, 2025.
