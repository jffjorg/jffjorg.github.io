  CASE NO.: 21STCV33388
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION
  TO COMPEL DEPOSITION OF DEFENDANT AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 9, 2025



 
On September 9, 2021, Plaintiff
Elana Malekan filed this action against Defendant Rebeka Shadpour and others.
On
December 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Defendant’s deposition.
If
a party or an officer, director, managing agent, employee of a party, or person
designated as the person most qualified to testify fails to appear for examination
or produce documents without serving a valid objection, the demanding party may
move to compel attendance, testimony, and production.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
Plaintiff
noticed Defendant’s deposition eight times between February 4, 2022 and October
18, 2024, for mutually agreed-upon dates. 
(Azadegan Decl. ¶¶ 6, 11, 15, 20, 24, 28, 33, 40.)  Defendant did not appear for two depositions,
and Plaintiff took two certificates of non-appearance.  (Azadegan Decl. ¶¶ 8, 43.)  For other deposition dates, Defendant’s counsel
claimed scheduling conflicts on short notice, sometimes the day before the deposition.  (Azadegan ¶¶ 12, 19, 22, 25, 29, 34, 42.)
Defendant
argues that “there has been no bad faith attempt” to avoid the deposition, and “[t]he
series of continuance has just been a result of agreed upon continuances and a series
of unfortunate events.”  (Opposition at pp.
6-7.)  Defendant is “amicable to setting an
agreed upon deposition date,” and “Plaintiff’s motion to compel could have been
avoided without the unnecessary waste of judicial resources had Plaintiff and Mr.
Azadegan continued to meet and confer with Defendant and Mr. Zadeh.”  (Id. at p. 7.)
Plaintiff’s
counsel’s declaration sets forth over two and a half years of attempts to meet and
confer about deposition dates.  All dates
had been agreed-upon, yet Defendant still has not appeared.
The
parties have now agreed (after this motion was filed) to a deposition date of January
17, 2025.  (Azadegan Reply Decl. ¶ 4.)  Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.  Defendant Rebeka Shadpour is ORDERED to appear
for deposition on January 17, 2025.
Defendant
is ordered to pay sanctions of $7,232.50 to Plaintiff within 30 days.
The
request for evidentiary and issue sanctions is denied without prejudice.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
