And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motions to compel discovery and deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted. The Defendant failed to serve timely responses to the Plaintiff's discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for Production of Documents, and RFAs. As a result, the Plaintiff filed motions to compel responses and deem the RFAs admitted. The Judge found that the Defendant failed to serve substantially compliant responses and therefore granted the motions. The Defendant is ordered to provide verified responses to the discovery requests within 30 days and to pay $2,000.00 in sanctions to the Plaintiff within 30 days. The Judge also deemed the RFAs admitted by the Defendant.
