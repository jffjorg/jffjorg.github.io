  CASE NO.: 24STCV10782
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO COMPEL
  DISCOVERY; GRANTING MOTION TO DEEM RFAs ADMITTED
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 9, 2025



 
On
April 30, 2024, Plaintiff Ricardo Vilchis Mendoza filed this action against Defendant
Realty Masters & Associates Inc. and others.
On
October 18, 2024, Plaintiff served Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories
(Set One), Request for Production of Documents (Set One), and Requests for Admission
(Set One).  Defendant never served responses.
On
December 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions to compel responses and to deem the RFAs
admitted.  Each motion includes a request
for sanctions.
Where
a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests, the court may make
an order compelling responses.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve timely responses
waives any objections to the request, including ones based on privilege or the protection
of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)
When
a party fails to timely respond to a request for admission, the propounding party
may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any
matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)  The party who failed to respond waives any objections
to the demand, unless the court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing
that the party (1) has subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and
(2) that the party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)  The court shall
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the
party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the
hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is
in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
Defendant
filed no oppositions to these motions and did not serve timely responses.  It does not appear that Defendant served substantially
compliant responses prior to the hearing.
Accordingly,
the motions are GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered
to provide verified responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatories (Set
One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Request for Production of Documents
(Set One), within 30 days.  Requests for Admission
(Set One) is deemed admitted by Defendant.
The
requests for sanctions are granted in part. 
Defendant is ordered to pay total sanctions of $2,000.00 to Plaintiff within
30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
