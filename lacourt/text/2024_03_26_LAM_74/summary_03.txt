This tentative ruling addresses a motion for monetary, issue, or evidentiary sanctions filed by Plaintiffs Raul Naranjo and Raul Naranjo Jr. against Defendant General Motors, LLC. The dispute arises from a defective 2020 Chevrolet Silverado and Defendant's failure to produce its person most knowledgeable (PMK) for deposition despite a court order. The court finds that Defendant misused the discovery process and failed to make a good faith effort to ensure the deposition took place in time. As a result, the court will award Plaintiffs monetary sanctions in the sum of $3,375.66. Defendant is ordered to pay Plaintiffs' counsel's attorney fees within 30 days of this order.
