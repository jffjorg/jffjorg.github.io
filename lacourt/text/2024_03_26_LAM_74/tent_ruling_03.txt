 Case Number:  23STCV11411    Hearing Date:   March 26, 2024    Dept:  74 Raul Naranjo, et al. v. General
Motors, LLC
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Monetary,
Issue, or Evidentiary Sanctions
The court considered the moving
papers, opposition, and reply.
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a defective
2020 Chevrolet Silverado (Subject Vehicle).
            On May 22, 2023, Plaintiffs Raul
Naranjo and Raul Naranjo Jr. (Plaintiffs) filed a complaint against Defendant
General Motors, LLC (Defendant).
            On November 2, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed a motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s person most
knowledgeable (PMK).
            On January 8, 2024, the court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion and ordered Defendant to produce its PMK by February
8, 2024. 
            However, the deposition did not take
place by February 8.
            On February 16, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed this motion for sanctions.   
DISCUSSION  
            Plaintiffs
seek monetary, evidentiary, or issue sanctions against Defendant. Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030, the court may impose sanctions against a
party that has misused the discovery process. One such misuse is disobeying a
court order to provide discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).) On
January 8, 2024, the court ordered Defendant to produce its PMK for deposition
by February 8, 2024. But Defendant did not do so. The court notes Defendant
offered to produce its PMK on February 8, but Plaintiffs were unavailable on
that date. (Quezada Decl., ¶ 4.) Be that as it may, Defendant failed to make a
good faith effort to ensure the deposition took place in time. That is, Defendant
did not timely respond to Plaintiffs’ emails on January 12, 19, and 26 about
scheduling the deposition before the deadline. (Quezada Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4.) Nor
did Defendant provide Plaintiffs with alternate dates before the deadline.
Thus, Defendant cannot blame Plaintiffs for its failure to obey the discovery
order.
            Given
the foregoing, sanctions are appropriate. Because Defendant has tried to
arrange alternate dates for the deposition after February 8, the court does not
find that issue or evidentiary sanctions are necessary. (Quezada Decl., ¶ 5; Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
793 [“The penalty should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery.”].) Accordingly, the court will award Plaintiffs monetary
sanctions in the sum of $3,375.66 ($550 x (2.5 hours (motion) + 3.5 hours (reviewing
opposition, drafting reply, and preparing for and attending hearing) + $75.66
(filing fee).) Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, and she has
substantiated her request for attorney fees with a breakdown of work performed.
(Quinn Decl., ¶¶ 12-14.) 
CONCLUSION 
            The
court grants Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions. Defendant shall pay
Plaintiffs’ counsel attorney fees in the sum of $3,375.66 within 30 days of
this order.
            Plaintiffs
shall give notice.
