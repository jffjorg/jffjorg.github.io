And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of summons and cross-complaint filed by Francesco Benincaso, a specially appearing cross-defendant. The motion was filed in response to the service of summons and cross-complaint on him. The Judge has determined that the substituted service attempted on Francesco Benincaso was defective because it was left at the home of Michael Benincaso's wife, which is not Francesco Benincaso's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address. As a result, the Judge has granted Francesco Benincaso's motion to quash service of the summons and cross-complaint. Plaintiff Michael Benincaso shall be notified of this ruling.
