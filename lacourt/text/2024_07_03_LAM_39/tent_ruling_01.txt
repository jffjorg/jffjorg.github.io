MOTION
Plaintiff Sujey
Tinoco (“Plaintiff”) prevailed at trial against Defendant Teresa Medical
Center, Inc. (“Defendant”).  Plaintiff
moves for attorney fees.  Defendant has
not opposed the motion.
 ANALYSIS
In actions under
the Fair Employment and Housing Act, “the court, in its discretion, may award
to the prevailing party . . . reasonable attorney's fees . . . .”  (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd. (b).)  The court finds Plaintiff is entitled to
attorney fees as the prevailing party against Defendant.  The prevailing party must seek an award of
attorney fees through a noticed motion and bears the burden of proof to justify
the amount sought. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5)(A).)
In the instant
matter, Plaintiff contends her attorneys billed $733,130.65 in attorney fees.
This lodestar figure is based on billing at hourly rates of up to $1,000 for
attorneys and $300 for paralegals. “The reasonable market value of the
attorney's services is the measure of a reasonable hourly rate. This standard
applies regardless of whether the attorneys claiming fees charge nothing for
their services, charge at below-market or discounted rates, represent the
client on a straight contingent fee basis, or are in-house counsel.” (Chacon
v. Litke (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1234, 1260, internal quotations and
citations omitted.) Based on the court’s review of the case file, including
Plaintiff’s detailed summary of the services performed and by whom, the court
concludes a collective $500 per hour is a reasonable rate for attorneys and
$200 per hour is a reasonable rate for paralegals engaged in similar litigation
in the Los Angeles area, and these hourly rates amply compensate Plaintiff’s
counsel for their work on this case. 
The court declines
to award compensation for 23.6 hours of work performed by law clerks and an investigator,
which the court views as part of the overhead of running a law office.  In addition, the court notes there are
entries by attorneys and paralegals described as “developed case strategy,” and
there are also many entries related to conferences in which multiple attorneys and
paralegals were involved.  Thus, while
solely considering the multiple entries concerning developing case strategy and
not those related to conferences, the court deducts 56 hours of attorney time
and 17 hours of paralegal time.  This
amounts to a deduction of $31,400 (for attorneys, 56 hours multiplied by $500
equals $28,000, and for paralegals, 17 hours multiplied by $200 equals
$3,400).  
The court,
therefore, adjusts the lodestar figure to $472,465 and grants Plaintiff’s
motion for an award of attorney fees in that amount.  This figure represents $403,425 for attorney
time calculated by multiplying 806.85[1]
hours by $500 and $100,440 for paralegal time calculated by multiplying 502.20
hours by $200, for a total of $503,865, and then deducting $31,400 from that
amount.  The court declines to award a
multiplier.
Plaintiff also
seeks costs and expenses.  As required,
Plaintiff submitted a cost memorandum on Judicial Council Form MC-011, pursuant
to Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a).  Plaintiff
is awarded costs in the amount of $24, 837.28. 
This amount represents a deduction from Plaintiff’s cost bill of
$1,514.10 which Plaintiff designated as “Other” without an explanation of the
costs or expenses to be attributed to it.
Plaintiff is to
give notice of, and file proof of service concerning, this order.
