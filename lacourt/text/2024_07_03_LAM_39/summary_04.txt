Here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff had signed an arbitration agreement when working for the defendant, which specifies that the Federal Arbitration Act governs. The plaintiff's claims arose after May 2, 2022, and are therefore subject to the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021. The judge disregards the plaintiff's amended complaint, which was filed after the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The judge sets an order to show cause regarding the status of the arbitration to be heard on January 9, 2025, and orders the defendant to provide notice of this order and file proof of service.
