[1]The
court’s tabulation of the number of attorney hours billed in the case is 806.85.  But the summary of time billed Plaintiff attached to her motion indicates that amount is
892.1 hours.  It appears the discrepancy results from an error in the total amount of hours attributed to attorney Sylvia Panosian at
the end of the summary.  It indicates she
billed a total of 87.2 hours when it should have been 2 hours, given the information Plaintiff provides.
