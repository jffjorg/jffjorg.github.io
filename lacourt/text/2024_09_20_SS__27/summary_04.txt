And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Gilbert Guerrero, has moved to compel further responses to his Form Interrogatories, Set Three, from the defendant, Franklin Vladimir Lopez Alas, et al. The defendant has also requested sanctions against the plaintiff. The court finds that the defendant did provide amended responses to the discovery requests at issue, which were served on the plaintiff on July 16, 2024. As a result, the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses is denied.

However, the court finds that the plaintiff's failure to withdraw the motion or take it off calendar after being informed of the amended responses, despite having ample time to do so, is unjustified. Therefore, the court grants the defendant's request for sanctions and orders the plaintiff and his attorney to pay $1,500 in attorney's fees to the defendant within 20 days.

The parties are advised to submit to this tentative ruling by email, failing which they should appear remotely or in person for oral argument. If neither party submits nor appears, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
