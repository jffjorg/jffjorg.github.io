CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV08055 AN DO, et al. vs
MARTA E. MELENDEZ, et al.  
Moving Party: Counsel Charlotte Konczal
Responding Party: Unopposed 
Notice: Sufficient¿¿ 
Ruling: The Court Will Hear From The Parties
 
Attorney Charlotte Konczal currently represents both Defendants
Mara Melendez and Rodolfo Ortiz. Counsel claims there is a conflict of interest
between the two defendants, preventing her from representing both, and that she
was unable to communicate with Rodolfo Ortiz to resolve the issue through
substitution of attorney. From the papers submitted, it is unclear what the
specific conflict is. Furthermore, although Plaintiff alleges diligent effort
to resolve the issue, the only action taken, as indicated in the papers, was
mailing the motion papers to Mr. Ortiz’s last known address, return receipt
requested. However, the Court requires further clarification on the nature of
the conflict and the adequacy of efforts made to notify Mr. Ortiz of the
motion.
 
At the same time, the Court acknowledges that a conflict of
interest is a valid reason for withdrawal and notes that counsel has submitted
the required forms: Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion),
MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) for withdrawal. Additionally,
the next hearing is an order to show cause re dismissal, set for March 3, 2025,
which should be sufficient time for Mr. Ortiz to retain new counsel.
 
The Court will hear from counsel regarding the nature of the
alleged conflict and whether sufficient attempts have been made to notify Mr.
Ortiz of the present motion.
