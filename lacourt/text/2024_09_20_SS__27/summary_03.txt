And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to withdraw as counsel filed by Charlotte Konczal, who represents both defendants, Mara Melendez and Rodolfo Ortiz. The motion is unopposed and the judge acknowledges that a conflict of interest is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, the judge requires further clarification on the nature of the conflict and the adequacy of efforts made to notify Mr. Ortiz of the motion. The judge notes that counsel has submitted the required forms for withdrawal, but is concerned that the efforts to notify Mr. Ortiz were insufficient, as counsel only mailed motion papers to his last known address. The judge will hear from counsel regarding the nature of the alleged conflict and whether sufficient attempts have been made to notify Mr. Ortiz of the present motion.
