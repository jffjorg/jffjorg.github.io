The judge grants the motion to consolidate two related actions, County of Los Angeles vs. Henry Uriel Villatoro, et al. (Case No. 23STCV20365) and Triretta Kennedy vs. Henry Uriel Villatoro, et al. (Case No. 24SMCV01429).

The judge finds that the cases are related and that consolidation will streamline the resolution of the disputes, avoiding unnecessary costs and delay.
