GUDINO, et al. vs EDNA MORALES, et al.
Moving Party: Defendants
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS
GRANTED. 
 
On September 2, 2022,
Plaintiff filed his complaint. On October 10, 2022, Defendants filed their
answer. The trial is currently set for October 28, 2022. Defendants move the
court to continue the trial for 60 days because the parties have a mediation
scheduled for November 28, 2024 with Barry Plotkin, Esq, and all parties
stipulate to the continuance of the trial. The court grants the continuance so
the parties' mediation can take place; however, the court does not find good cause
to reopen discovery, as none of the factors to reopen discovery under CCP
section 2024.050 have been discussed.
The new Trial Date is
set for December 18, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status Conference is
continued to December ___, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. All trial related dates will not
follow the new trial date.
