And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial, which is currently set for October 11, 2024. The defendant had filed a motion for summary judgment against the plaintiff, with a hearing set for April 23, 2025. The judge finds that continuing the trial date to hear the motion for summary judgment constitutes good cause, especially since no parties have filed an opposition alleging prejudice. The court will meet with the parties to set a new summary judgment date.
