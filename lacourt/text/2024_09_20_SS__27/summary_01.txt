And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion for sanctions against the plaintiffs and their counsel. The motion arises from the plaintiffs' failure to attend scheduled independent medical examinations (IMEs) and the subsequent cancellation fees incurred by the defendants. The judge found that the plaintiffs failed to provide adequate notice for the IMEs and failed to respond to meet-and-confer attempts to resolve the issue. The judge ordered the plaintiffs to pay the defendants $3,000 in sanctions for the first IME and $1,500 for the second IME. The judge also noted that the cancellation fees were reasonable and common for a doctor to charge. The judge gave the parties an opportunity to submit to the tentative ruling or appear at the hearing to argue.
