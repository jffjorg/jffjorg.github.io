  Case No.:  23STCV23007
  Hearing Date:  November 6, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend
  complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 25, 2023, Plaintiff
Laura Garcia filed this employment action against Defendants King Pelican
Laundry LLC and Brett Walker. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint on June 13, 2024. 
Plaintiff worked for King Pelican Laundry,
owned by Brett Walker and his wife, Claudia Walker. Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants stole her tips and fired her after she notified them of a
disability. 
On October 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Defendants have
not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The court may, in furtherance of justice,
and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc, §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.) Courts must apply a policy of liberality in
permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, including during trial,
when no prejudice to the opposing party is shown. (Duchrow v. Forrest
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377.) In determining the extent of prejudice to
the opposing party, the court must consider various factors, such as whether
the amendment would delay trial or increase the discovery burden. (Demetriades
v. Yelp, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 294, 306.)
A motion for leave to amend a complaint
must be accompanied by a declaration that explains: (1) the effect of the
amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule
3.1324(b).)
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks to amend the
complaint to do the following: (i) allege alter ego against Brett and Claudia
Walker; (ii) add a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional
distress; and (iii) add Claudia Walker as a defendant on certain causes of
action. (Valencia Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) Plaintiff was informed in September 2024
that King Pelican Laundry intended to file for bankruptcy. (Id., ¶ 4.)
Thus, Plaintiff seeks to establish the Walkers as the company’s alter egos. (Ibid.)
The amendment is necessary and proper to ensure remediation for the harms
inflicted on Plaintiff. (Id., ¶ 8.) 
            Plaintiff has made a sufficient
showing to justify the amendment. The Court finds no prejudice to Defendants. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for leave to
amend complaint is GRANTED. Second Amended Complaint shall be filed within 10
days of this order.
