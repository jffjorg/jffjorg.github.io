And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Defendants Sung Joo Na, Kyonga Nam, and Jongju Na to set aside the default judgment entered against them on November 26, 2019. The judge finds that the Defendants were never served with the summons and complaint, and therefore, the Court lacks jurisdiction and the judgment is void. The judge cites the cases of Renoir v. Redstar Corp. (2004) and Paterra v. Hansen (2021) to support this conclusion. The Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion, and the judge concludes that the motion is granted. The hearing on this matter is set for November 6, 2024.
