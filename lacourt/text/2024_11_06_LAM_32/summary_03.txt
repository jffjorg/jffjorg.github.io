And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Verizon's motion to strike certain allegations in Majestic's cross-complaint. The motion is granted with leave to amend as to punitive damages and denied in all other respects.

The judge has found that the FCC has preemption authority over RF emissions standards, but private agreements are not preempted. Therefore, Majestic's claims are not preempted, and it has the right to enforce its private lease agreement with Verizon.

The judge has also ruled that punitive damages are not recoverable in breach of contract actions, and that Majestic's cross-complaint alleges Verizon's breach of contract and trespass. The level of RF emissions does not determine whether Verizon trespassed, and there are no aggravating facts demonstrating malice, oppression, or fraud sufficient for punitive damages.

The judge has denied Verizon's motion to strike as to the claims for breach of contract and trespass, but granted the motion as to the claim for punitive damages. The parties are ordered to file amended pleadings to conform to the ruling.
