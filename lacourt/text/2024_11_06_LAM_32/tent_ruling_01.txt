KAP SOON MOON,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
SUNG JOO NA, et al., 
                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  19STCV08038
  Hearing Date:  November 6, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion to set aside default 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 8, 2019, Plaintiff Kap Soon
Moon filed this action against Defendants Sung Joo Na, Kyonga Nam, Jongju Na,
and Leading Town SDUS, Inc. 
            On November 26, 2019, default
judgment was granted for Plaintiff against Defendants. 
            On September 3, 2024, Defendants
Sung Joo Na, Kyonga Nam, and Jonju Na filed the instant motion to set aside the
default. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Lack of proper service renders the Court
without jurisdiction, and the judgment is void. (Renoir v. Redstar Corp.
(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1154.) A void judgment may be set aside at any
time. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473(d); Paterra v. Hansen (2021) 64
Cal.App.5th 507, 539.)
DISCUSSION
            Defendants aver that they have never
been served with any document in the case, including the summons and complaint,
and that they did not learn about the case until January 2024. (S. Na Decl. ¶¶
5-6; Nam Decl. ¶¶ 6-7; J. Na Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) 
            Plaintiff does not oppose the motion
and presents no evidence to rebut Defendants’ showing that they were not
served. Lack of proper service renders the Court without jurisdiction, and the
judgment is void. (Renoir, supra, 123 Cal.App.4th at p. 1154.) 
CONCLUSION
            The motion to set aside default
filed by Defendants Sung Joo Na, Kyonga Nam, and Jonju Na is GRANTED.
