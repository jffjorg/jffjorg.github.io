And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add alter ego allegations against Brett and Claudia Walker, add a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and add Claudia Walker as a defendant on certain causes of action. The judge finds that the amendment is necessary and proper to ensure remediation for the harms inflicted on the plaintiff. The judge also finds no prejudice to the defendants. Therefore, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint and orders the plaintiff to file a second amended complaint within 10 days.
