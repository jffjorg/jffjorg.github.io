SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Javier Guerrero, a 17 year old with Down Syndrome, alleges defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) failed to ever provide any “formal
assessment,” and therefore never developed a Individualized Education Plan. 
 
On
February 20, 2019, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Unruh Civil Rights Act,
California Government Code section 11135, Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress, Negligence, and Article I, Section 7(A) & Article IV, Section
16(A) of the California Constitution (19STCV06007). On March 11, 2019,
Plaintiff filed a preemptory challenge thereby leading to assignment to
Department 17. On August 27, 2019, the court found the later filed case was
related to a previously filed Petition on the Government Claim, 19STCV05995,
thereby leading to the assignment of all cases to Department 68.
 
On
October 16, 2019, the court sustained the demurrer of LAUSD to the later filed
case with 20 days leave to amend. The cases were subsequently removed to the
Central District Federal Court and remanded back to the court. 
 
On
April 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint for California Disabled
Persons Act, Cal. Civ. Code Section 54, et seq.; Violations of California
Education Code sections 200, 201, 220, 262.4, 56381; Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress; Violation of The Equal Protection Clause of the California
Constitution, Article I, Section 7(A) & Article IV Section 16(A);
Negligence; and, Negligence Per Se. On June 20, 2023, the court sustained the
demurrer to the entire first amended complaint without leave to amend. The
court entered judgment on July 5, 2023. 
 
On
September 13, 2023, the court entered an order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for
new trial, and sustaining the demurrer to the first amended complaint as to the
first, second, and third causes of action, and granting the motion to strike
the claim for attorney fees. On October 3, 2023, Plaitniff filed a second
amended complaint for Violation of The Equal Protection Clause of the
California Constitution, Article I, Section 7(A) & Article IV Section 16(A);
42 U.S.C. section 1983 (Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment); Negligence;
and, Negligence Per Se. On November 14, 2023, without stipulation or leave of
court, Plaintiff filed a third amended complaint for California Constitution,
Article I, Section 7(A) & Article IV Section 16(A); Negligence; and, Negligence
Per Se.
 
Meanwhile,
on November 2, 2023, the court denied the petition for relief from the claim
filing requirement/leave to file a late claim. A notice of appeal was filed on
December 27, 2023.
 
RULING: Continued for
Supplemental Briefing
The
court first addresses the pending appeal on the related case for petition for
relief from the claim filing requirements and/or leave to file a late claim. The “perfecting” of an appeal imposes an automatic stay on the case
on “matters embraced therein…but the trial
court may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action and not affected
by the judgment or order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 916, subd. (a).) “The
purpose of the automatic stay provision of section 916, subdivision (a) ‘is to
protect the appellate court's jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until
the appeal is decided. The [automatic stay] prevents the trial court from
rendering an appeal futile by altering the appealed judgment or order by
conducting other proceedings that may affect it.’” (Varian Medical Systems,
Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 189.) 
 
In
the order granting the motion for new trial, the court ordered in relevant
part: “The Court grants Plaintiff’s Motion for New Trial, in part, on the issue
of whether Plaintiff complied with the Government Code Claims Act and the
timing requirement for filing a lawsuit after the service of a claim under the
Government Code Claims Act. As set forth above, the Court reverses its prior
ruling (Exhibit 1) on that issue.” Notwithstanding the September 13, 2023,
order apparently granting Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint on at
least the first two causes of action, on November 2, 2023, the court denied the
petition for relief from the claim filing requirement/leave to file a late
claim. A notice of appeal was filed on December 27, 2023.
 
The
court appreciates the subject demurrer as a challenge to the addition of the
negligence per se cause of action, which was never part of the original
complaint, or the first and second amended iterations. More broadly however, it
remains unclear to the court from the November 2, 2023, order denying the
petition on the related case, whether the entire complaint remains subject to
demurrer on grounds of an invalid underlying claim, as presumably addressed in
the pending appeal. (Henry M. Lee Law Corp. v. Superior
Court (2012)
204 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1383-1384; Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v.
Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th at p. 189.) 
 
The court therefore requests clarification on whether the action
is subject to a stay pending the appeal on the petition, or whether the parties
contend the subject remains sufficiently outside the scope of the demurrer, as
to allow consideration of the demurrer and motion to strike. The court
therefore sets a Hearing for OSC re: Stay of the Case Pending Appeal on the
Petition.
 
Due to the high volume
of law and motion scheduled in the courtroom prior to the court assuming the
department, and new setting standards now in place, the immediate calendars
show a number of blocked dates. The court therefore sets the supplemental
hearing for March 20, 2023.  Any and all
briefs are limited to no more than five (5) pages each side of authority, but
the parties may also present any declarations. Any and all supplemental briefs,
if required, shall be filed no later than nine (9) court days before the new
hearing date—March 7, 2024. 
 
The court further
reserves a potential new demurrer date for Thursday April 4, 2024, if
determined necessary. The court deems the demurrer and motion to strike fully
briefed, and will not review any further briefs related to the documents
outside the March 20, 2024, hearing, unless specifically indicated in the
written order following the OSCre: Stay of the Case
Pending Appeal on the Petition. 
 
LAUSD to give notice.
