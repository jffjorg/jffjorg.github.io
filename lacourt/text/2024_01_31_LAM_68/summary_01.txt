And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Javier Guerrero, against the Defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant failed to provide a formal assessment and therefore never developed an Individualized Education Plan for a 17-year-old with Down Syndrome. The Judge has denied the petition for relief from the claim filing requirement and has set a hearing for March 20, 2024, for supplemental briefing. The Judge is considering whether the action is subject to a stay pending the appeal and has reserved a potential new demurrer date for April 4, 2024.
