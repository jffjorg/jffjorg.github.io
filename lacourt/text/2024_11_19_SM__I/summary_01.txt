```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to approve the settlement without prejudice, pending further information. The settlement was reached through mediation and totals $210,000, with the employees' share being approximately $28,000. The named plaintiff, Richard, is also receiving a separate PAGA Incentive Payment of $5000, which the court finds unclear and may be invalid. The judge is also questioning the justification for the payment and the fees requested by counsel, which total $70,000. The court has requested further justification and information, including the time spent by counsel on the case and the expert's report, before it can approve the settlement.
