 Case Number:  22SMCV00400    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to DENY WITHOUT PREJUDICE.  Plaintiff can amend, but he needs to comply
with the Code of Civil Procedure and explain the reasons for the amendment and
provide a red-lined version of the new complaint as against the original
complaint.  If that is done, the court
would be likely to grant the motion.
