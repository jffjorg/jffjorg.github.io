MOTION
TO ENFORCE SETTLEMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:                   Defendant
Laurette Ollar
 
RESPONDING PARTY:      No
opposition
 
 
On September 24, 2021, Plaintiffs, Mary Orozco, Carlos
Orozco, Elizabeth Orozco, and Chaydy Vega, filed this action against Defendants
Laurette Ollar (“Ollar”) and Catherine Egeland, for injuries arising from a
motor vehicle collision. 
  
On January 23, 2023, Ollar filed this motion to enforce the settlement
with Plaintiffs.  The motion was heard on
March 16, 2023.  The Court continued the
hearing to May 16, 2023, to allow Ollar to pursue requests for dismissal. 
 
On May 11, 2023, Ollar’s counsel filed a declaration stating
that Plaintiffs Mary Orozco, Carlos Orozco, and Elizabeth Orozco had signed and
returned their request for dismissal forms. 
As to Plaintiff Chaydy Vega, counsel was still attempting to locate
Chaydy Vega and to send her a request for dismissal form.  The Court continued the hearing for this
motion to July 28, 2023 to allow Ollar’s counsel more time to obtain a signed
dismissal form from Chaydy Vega.
 
On July 28, 2023, the Court noted that Counsel had not filed
anything to apprise the Court of the status of locating Chaydy Vega and/or
obtaining her signed dismissal form.  The
Court continued the hearing for this motion to October 2, 2023 and stated it
would be the last continuance of the motion. 
Counsel was directed to file a supplemental brief apprising the Court of
the status of their investigation at least 7 court days before the hearing.  Counsel was also cautioned that failure to
comply could result in sanctions.  
 
Ollar’s counsel has not filed a supplemental brief or
report.  The Court has afforded Ollar multiple
opportunities to comply with the Court’s orders.  Given the Court’s warning that the hearing
for this motion would not be continued further, the Court now DENIES Ollar’s
motion to enforce the settlement and imposes sanctions of $250 against Ollar’s
counsel for failure to comply with the Court’s orders.  Sanctions are to be paid within 30 days of
this order.  
  
Moving party to give notice.
