## English Text Summary:

This tentative ruling addresses three motions filed by Plaintiffs Desiderio and Herlinda Sandoval against Defendant Maria Guerrero in a personal injury case arising from a motor vehicle collision.  

The motions sought to compel Defendant to respond to discovery requests, including interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission. Defendant initially failed to respond within the required timeframe, leading Plaintiffs to file the motions.

However, Defendant subsequently served complete responses, albeit late.  The Judge found these responses substantially complied with legal requirements, rendering the motions moot.

Despite the late responses, the Judge found sanctions against Defendant were warranted under the law.  The Judge decided to impose a $1,050 sanction, based on the time Plaintiffs' counsel spent dealing with the discovery issues. The Judge, however, did not impose sanctions on Defendant's counsel due to his explanation for the late responses, which included being unavailable due to paternity leave.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Desiderio Sandoval and Herlinda Sandoval v. Maria Guerrero. The plaintiffs had filed motions to compel responses to discovery requests, which were served late by the defendant. The defendant argued that the motions were moot because she had served verified responses to the discovery requests, but the court found that the responses did not substantially comply with the Code of Civil Procedure.

The court granted the motions to compel responses and deemed the requests for admission admitted against the defendant. The court also imposed sanctions on the defendant in the amount of $1,050, representing 3 hours at the plaintiffs' counsel's hourly rate. The court found that the defendant's counsel had substituted into the case and had difficulty contacting the defendant, and that counsel had gone on paternity leave, so counsel did not counsel discovery abuse.

The court noted that the motions to compel responses were moot because the defendant had served late responses, but the court still imposed sanctions because the defendant had failed to serve timely responses to the requests for admission. The court also noted that the defendant's counsel had a burden to show that he or she did not counsel discovery abuse, and that counsel had met that burden.
