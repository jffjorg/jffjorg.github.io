**Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

The judge is granting defendants' request to continue the trial date in the case of Menfil Dela Cruz v. Kamo Khachaturov and Infinity Precision, Inc. This is the second time the defendants have requested a continuance.

The judge finds good cause for the continuance because essential discovery has not yet been completed, despite defendants' diligent efforts. Specifically, the plaintiff's independent medical examination has not occurred, and the plaintiff has not been able to depose any personnel from Infinity Precision, Inc. 

Since the motion is unopposed and this is the second continuance request, the judge finds no prejudice will result from the delay. The trial date is continued to January 19, 2024, and all related deadlines are also pushed to that date.
