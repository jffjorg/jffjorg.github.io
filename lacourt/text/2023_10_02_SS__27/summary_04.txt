The judge, Kerry Bensinger, issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to enforce the settlement filed by the defendant, Laurette Ollar, due to the failure to obtain a signed dismissal form from the plaintiff, Chaydy Vega. The court imposed sanctions of $250 on Ollar's counsel for failing to comply with the court's orders. The ruling is based on the case number 21STCV35336, involving the plaintiffs Mary Orozco, Carlos Orozco, Elizabeth Orozco, and Chaydy Vega, and the defendants Laurette Ollar and Catherine Egeland. The motion to enforce the settlement was filed on September 24, 2021, and the hearing was held on October 2, 2023, which was the last continuance allowed by the court. The plaintiffs had signed the dismissal forms, except for Chaydy Vega, and the defendant's counsel was unable to locate her and obtain her signed dismissal form. The court directed the counsel to file a supplemental brief apprising the court of the status of their investigation, but they failed to comply, resulting in the sanctions imposed.
