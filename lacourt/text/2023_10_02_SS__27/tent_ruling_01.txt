MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Jorge
Ledezma, Ledezma Robles & Babaee LLP
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On August 21, 2023, Jorge Ledezma, counsel for Plaintiff, Maria
Cervera, filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS 
 
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved
as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to the
client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration
in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052));
(3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other
parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving
counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
Jorge Ledezma seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff
for the following reason: “An irreparable breakdown of attorney-client
relationship has occurred that makes it impossible for attorney to represent
this client.”  (MC-052.)   
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.).  
 
Upon review, the Court finds the Motion complies with Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362.  Accordingly, the
Motion is GRANTED.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            The
unopposed Motion to be Relieved is granted and effective upon the filing of the
proof of service of this signed order upon Plaintiff.
            Counsel to
give notice.
