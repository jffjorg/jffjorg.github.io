And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to attend a physical examination with Dr. Korchek in Los Angeles County is granted. The plaintiff had objected to the examination on the grounds that it was more than 75 miles from his residence, but the court found that there is good cause for the travel involved. The court noted that the plaintiff has frequent contact with California and has spent 30 to 40 percent of his time in California over the last five years. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to apprise the defendant of his intention to move to Sweden and belatedly notified the defendant of his relocation. As a result, the court ordered the plaintiff to attend the physical examination on November 22, 2023, and the defendant is responsible for paying the plaintiff's travel expenses, including food and lodging.

English text:
This is a summary of a tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger in the case of Umar Saifullahkhan Babar v. Nu Mach (case number 21STCV21291) regarding a motion to compel the plaintiff to submit to a physical medical examination at a location more than 75 miles from the plaintiff’s residence. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant for injuries arising from a motor vehicle collision in Rosemead, California. The defendant served the plaintiff with a demand for a physical examination, which the plaintiff objected to on the grounds that it was more than 75 miles from the plaintiff’s residence. The plaintiff had relocated to Sweden during the pendency of the litigation. The defendant offered to pay for the plaintiff’s reasonable travel expenses, hotel expenses, and meal expenses if the plaintiff agreed to attend an examination with Dr. Korchek in Los Angeles County, but the plaintiff refused.

The legal standard for compelling a physical examination is that it does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful, protracted, or intrusive and that it is conducted at a location within 75 miles of the examinee’s residence. If a party desires to obtain discovery by a physical examination other than that described in Article 2, they must obtain leave of court and the court shall grant a motion for a physical or mental examination only for good cause shown. If the place of the examination is more than 75 miles from the residence of the person to be examined, an order to submit to it shall be entered only if both conditions are satisfied: (1) the court determines that there is good cause for the travel involved, and (2) the order is conditioned on the advancement by the moving party of the reasonable expenses and costs to the examinee for travel to the place of examination.

The court finds good cause exists to compel the plaintiff's attendance for a physical examination with Dr. Korchek in Los Angeles County due to the plaintiff's frequent contact with California, the burden upon the plaintiff to travel to California for his physical examination being slight, and the plaintiff's failure to apprise the defendant of his intention to move to Sweden and belatedly notifying the defendant of Plaintiff’s relocation. The order granting the defendant’s motion is strictly conditioned upon payment of the plaintiff’s reasonable travel expenses.
