**English Summary:**

Judge Kerry Bensinger issued a tentative ruling in the case of Hughy Addison versus the City of Santa Monica. The judge sustained the City of Santa Monica's demurrer based on two primary reasons: 1) Plaintiff's complaint failed to clarify whether he complied with the applicable claims statute, and 2) the complaint lacked allegations supporting a statutory basis for the claim against a public entity. 

The judge noted that common law negligence claims cannot be asserted against public entities in California; they must be based on a valid statute.  

Although the demurrer was sustained, the judge granted Addison leave to amend his complaint within 20 days.
