And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, is considering a motion by Adam Mirza, counsel for Plaintiff Arturo Leal, to be relieved as counsel of record. The motion is unopposed, but the notice of motion is defective and needs to be amended. The judge notes that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, making it difficult for Mirza to effectively prosecute the case. The judge grants the motion, but only after the amended notice of motion is filed and served on all parties. The hearing on the motion is continued to November 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM in Department 27 at the Spring Street Courthouse.
