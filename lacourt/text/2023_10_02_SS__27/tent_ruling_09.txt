MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Adam
Mirza, BD&J, P.C.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On August 10, 2023, Adam Mirza, counsel for Plaintiff,
Arturo Leal, filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
            The Motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS 
 
California Rule of Court rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved
as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to the
client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
Adam Mirza seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for
Plaintiff for the following reason: “There has been a significant breakdown in
the attorney-client relationship, which has significantly impeded counsel's
ability to effectively prosecute this case and represent Plaintiff's interest.  A voluntary substitution of attorney form
could not be obtained from Plaintiff. Plaintiff's counsel is unaware of any new
counsel.”  (MC-052.)   
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.).  
 
The notice of motion is defective.  The notice incorrectly indicates that the
hearing is to take place in Department 27 of the Central District at 111 North
Hill Street.[1]  Counsel is directed to serve an amended
Motion on all parties bearing the correct address and the current dates for all
future hearings in this matter.  Counsel
is to file the amended Motion no later than 5 court days before the hearing.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
 
            The Motion
cannot be granted because of the defect noted in this order.  On the Court’s own motion, the Hearing on
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel scheduled for 10/02/2023 is continued to 11/02/2023
at 01:30 PM in Department 27 at Spring Street Courthouse.
 
Moving party to give notice.
