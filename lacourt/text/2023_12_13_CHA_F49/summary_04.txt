And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the third-party claim of exemption filed by Alicia Rodriguez, the spouse of judgment debtor Edward Gonzalez. The claim is based on the argument that the debt was incurred prior to their marriage and that the levied bank account remains sole separate property. However, the court finds that Rodriguez lacks sufficient evidence to establish separate property, as the only evidence presented is a printout of the account with no proof of no commingled funds. The court also notes that Rodriguez failed to provide any new evidence or argument in support of the exemption despite being invited to do so. As a result, the court denies the third-party claim and dissolves the temporary restraining order enjoining the San Mateo County Sheriff from levying the account.
