And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for psychiatric-psychological-counseling records of Solomon Perkins, the plaintiff. The defendants served a deposition subpoena for production of business records, but the plaintiff failed to respond or oppose the motion. The court finds that the defendants have shown good cause for the discovery and that the records are directly relevant to the claims. The court orders the production of the records within 30 days. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the motion was not made or opposed in bad faith.
