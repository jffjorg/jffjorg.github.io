And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The motion was filed by Superior Construction Group, Inc. to substitute the name of the plaintiff from Superior Construction, Inc. to Maroun Sadaka, an individual doing business as Superior Construction. The judge found that the motion complies with California Rules of Court regarding the proposed amended complaint and that there is no basis for denying the motion. The judge further found that the proposed amended complaint does not state a legally barred claim and that the opposition's arguments regarding the failure to initially plead the claims via a party with a valid contractor's license and the potential for a sham pleading are more appropriately addressed in a demurrer, motion for judgment on the pleadings, or summary judgment.
