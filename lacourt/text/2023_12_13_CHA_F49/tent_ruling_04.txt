THIRD PARTY CLAIM OF EXEMPTION
 
MOVING PARTY: Third Party, Alicia Rodriguez
RESPONDING PARTY: Judgment Creditor, Premier Financial
Services, LLC
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Third Party Claim of Exemption
 
OSC re: Preliminary Injunction
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On January 17, 2017, Premier Financial Services, LLC
filed a Application for Entry of Sister State Judgment. The petition
incorporates a certified copy of a default judgment entered in Lake County
Florida by Premier Services against BEM Properties, LLC, and Edward Gonzalez
for $63,3809.19. Abstracts of judgment were issued on December 18, 2017, and
May 10, 2023, which led to writs of execution.
 
RULING: Denied.
Third party Alicia Rodriguez moves for a claim of exemption
on grounds that while Rodriguez is the spouse of judgment debtor Edward
Gonzalez, the debt was incurred prior to their marriage. Rodriguez maintains
the levied bank account existed before marriage and remains sole separate
property. [Declaration of Alicia Rodriguez.]
 
On September 11, 2023, the court granted the ex parte
hearing staying any writ of execution by the San Mateo County Sheriff on the
Chase Bank account attaching $52,628.37. The court ordered Rodriguez to duly
file and serve any new motion per statutory code, but no new items were filed. 
 
Judgment Creditor filed a timely opposition. Judgment
Creditor challenges the exemption on grounds of insufficient evidence
establishing separate property in that the declaration of Rodriguez only shows
a printout of the account, without any proof that any and all of the funds in
the account are solely Rodriguez’s property without any contribution from
Judgment Debtor. 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 720.330 states:
 
Promptly after receipt of the notice
of the hearing on the third-party claim, the levying officer shall file the
following papers with the court:
(a) The third-party claim that was
filed with the levying officer pursuant to Section 720.120 or 720.220.
(b) Any statement filed by the
creditor with the levying officer pursuant to Section 720.280 in
opposition to the third-party claim of a secured party.
(c) Any undertaking of the creditor
filed with the levying officer pursuant to Section 720.160 or Section
720.260.
(d) Any undertaking to release filed
by a third person pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 720.610).
(e) Any notice filed by a public
entity pursuant to Section 720.160 or Section 720.260.
 
“At a hearing on a third-party claim, the third person has
the burden of proof.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 720.360.) A claimant may make an
argument for exemption: “In the case of community property, by the spouse of
the judgment debtor, whether or not the spouse is also a judgment debtor under
the judgment.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 703.020, subd. (b)(2); See, § 703.110.) 
 
The entire claim depends on the declaration of Rodriguez
without any exhibits, though referenced by Judgment Debtor in opposition.
Again, the court invited Rodriguez to submit any and all evidence and argument
in support of the exemption, but no new motion was forthcoming. Thus, even
assuming the existence of the account prior to the marriage, other than a claim
of separate property in the declaration, Alicia Rodriguez presents no evidence
establishing the levied bank account funds constitute separate property within
the community property of the marital estate. In other words, the claim of
exemption lacks any argument or evidence of no commingled funds (deposits from
both parties) into the account, thereby establishing a clear cut exemption. (See
Fam. Code, § 910, et seq.) Without such proof, the court finds Rodriguez fails
to establish a basis for exemption regardless of whether the account was opened
prior to the marriage or not. 
 
The application also lacks any alternative basis of relief.
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 703.580, subd. (b), 706.051, subd. (b).). 
 
The third party claim is therefore denied. Third party
claimant also otherwise presents no new and separate application or support for
the preliminary injunction. Given the lack of any exemption, the court finds no
basis for a preliminary injunction, and dissolves the temporary restraining
order enjoining the San Mateo County Sheriff from levying the account.
 
Judgment Creditor to provide notice.
