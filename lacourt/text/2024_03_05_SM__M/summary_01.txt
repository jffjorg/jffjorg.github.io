And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to quash service of summons filed by Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., and David Zaslav (collectively, the "WB Defendants") is GRANTED. The WB Defendants argue that Plaintiff Leibel did not effectuate valid service as to any of the defendants. The Judge finds that the Proof of Personal Service (POS) filed by Plaintiff is facially defective and does not identify any of the people specified in CCP § 416.10(a), (b) as authorized to accept service on behalf of the WBD corporate entities. The Judge also finds that the service of summons was invalid against the WBD Defendants because it was not served on any authorized person and did not comply with CCP § 412.30. Additionally, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff fails to oppose the motion, and therefore fails to demonstrate any facts which might support jurisdiction despite any of the discussed inadequacies with the service of summons.
