Defendants Steven Fein and Sheila Fein



 
MOTION
 
            This case arises from injuries Plaintiff
Rodrigo Castillo (“Plaintiff”) sustained after falling 20 feet from a tree he
was trimming on the property of Defendants Steven Fein and Sheila Fein
(“Defendants”).  
 
The Court granted Summary Judgment in Defendant’s favor on the basis
that the Plaintiff assumed the risk in agreeing to climb and trim the tree.  (June 21, 2023 Minute Order.)
 
Plaintiff moved for a new trial, which the Court denied, having found
no irregularity in the court proceedings, abuse of discretion, error in law, or
insufficiency of the evidence.  (October
17, 2023 Minute Order.)  
 
Plaintiff now moves for reconsideration of the Court’s order denying a
new trial.    Defendants have opposed the motion and
Plaintiff has replied.
 
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTION
 
            Defendants object to the late
declaration of Alexander Zeesman and accompanying exhibits that were
purportedly filed on October 17, 2023, although the Court has no record of this
declaration or exhibits as being filed with the Court until the current motion
for reconsideration.  
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section 659a
provides:
 
Within 10 days of filing the notice, the moving
party shall serve upon all other parties and file any brief and accompanying
documents, including affidavits in support of the motion. The other parties
shall have 10 days after that service within which to serve upon the moving
party and file any opposing briefs and accompanying documents, including
counter-affidavits. The moving party shall have five days after that service to
file any reply brief and accompanying documents. These deadlines may, for good
cause shown by affidavit or by written stipulation of the parties, be extended
by any judge for an additional period not to exceed 10 days.
 
            Plaintiff moved for a new trial on
September 1, 2023.  Thus, the opposition
was due by September 11, 2023, and the reply due by September 16.  Even if the declaration and exhibits were
appropriate to include as reply evidence and even if Plaintiff had shown good
cause for failing to file it sooner by affidavit or written stipulation, the
absolute latest date the Court had jurisdiction to consider it was September
26.  The Court has no record of this
declaration being filed with the Court until November 9, when the current
motion for reconsideration was filed.
 
            Therefore, Defendants’ objection is
sustained as the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the belated Zeesman
declaration or supporting exhibits.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, subdivision (a), “[w]hen an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make an
application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the
matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.  The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)  Where
the statutory requirements are met, reconsideration should be granted; upon
reconsideration, however, the court may simply reaffirm its original
order.  (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 202.)  
 
The moving party on a motion for
reconsideration “must provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory
explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time[.]” (Mink
v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342, internal quotations
& citations omitted; see New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 221 [on a motion for reconsideration, a party must present
new or different facts, circumstances, or law, which the moving party “could
not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced” in connection with
the original hearing].)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 660, subdivision (c) provides:
 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 12a of
this code [extending dates that fall on a weekend or court holiday to the next
court day], the power of the court to rule on a motion for a new trial shall
expire 75 days after the mailing of notice of entry of judgment by the clerk of
the court pursuant to Section 664.5 or 75 days after service on the moving
party by any party of written notice of entry of judgment, whichever is
earlier, or if that notice has not been given, 75 days after the filing of the
first notice of intention to move for a new trial.
 
“The 60-day limitation
period of section 660 is mandatory and jurisdictional.”  (Jones v. Sieve (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d
359, 369.)  With respect to the intersection
between a Section 1008 motion for reconsideration and a Section 660 motion for
a new trial, Jones court held:
 
[T]he power of a trial court to rule on a motion
for a new trial is constrained by the jurisdictional 60-day limitation period
of section 660, which is a specific statute, and cannot be extended or expanded
by 0the procedural device of moving under section 1008, a general statute, for
reconsideration of an order granting or denying a new trial motion, which
necessarily involves a request to correct judicial error.
 
Instead, the onus is on the party seeking
reconsideration under section 1008, of an order granting or denying a new
trial, to do so within the 60-day jurisdictional time frame.
 
(Id. at p. 370; see also Collins
v. Sutter Memorial Hosp. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1, 11 [“An order made after
the 60–day period purporting to rule on a motion for new trial is in excess of
the court's jurisdiction and void”].)
 
            Here, the notice of entry of
judgment was served electronically on August 10, 2023.  Therefore, by October 26, 2023 (75 calendar
days + 2 court days for service), the Court had lost the jurisdiction to grant
a motion for a new trial.  However, Plaintiff
did not file the instant motion for reconsideration until November 9, after the
jurisdictional limitations period set forth in Section 660 has expired.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration is denied as the Court is without authority to rule on the
underlying motion for new trial under Code of Civil Procedure section 660.
 
            The Clerk of the Court shall provide
notice of the Court’s ruling.
