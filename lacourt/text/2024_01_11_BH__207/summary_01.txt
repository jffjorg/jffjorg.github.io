And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's order denying a new trial. The plaintiff had sought to reconsider the court's order after the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, finding that the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury by climbing and trimming a tree on the defendants' property. The court denied the plaintiff's motion for new trial, finding no irregularity in the court proceedings, abuse of discretion, error in law, or insufficiency of the evidence. The plaintiff has now moved for reconsideration, arguing that new evidence was not presented at the original hearing. However, the court has found that the plaintiff's belated filing of the new evidence is outside the statutory time frame and therefore lacks jurisdiction to consider it. The court has also noted that the plaintiff did not file the motion for reconsideration within the 60-day jurisdictional time frame, as required by law.
