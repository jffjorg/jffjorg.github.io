And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the issue of attorney's fees in the case of Dr. Lauren Pinter-Brown v. University of California at Los Angeles et al. The plaintiff, Dr. Pinter-Brown, sought an award of attorney's fees in the amount of $12,104,100, while the defendants opposed the motion. The Court previously approved a subset of the requested attorney's fees in the amount of $6,052,050, and the parties agreed on the calculation of the fees the Court found reasonable.

After considering all relevant factors, the Court determines that no lodestar multiplier is appropriate in this case. The Court found that the legal issues in the case were not particularly novel, and that the plaintiff's counsel did not demonstrate extraordinary skill in presenting the case. The Court also noted that the plaintiff's counsel did not protect the record during the first trial, which led to the need for a second trial.

The Court awarded the plaintiff a total of $3,926,753.75 in attorney's fees, which is the amount the parties agreed on. The Court declined to apply a multiplier to the attorney's fees, citing a lack of extraordinary skill or difficulty in the case. The Court also considered the factors mentioned in Ketchum v. Moses and Nichols v. City of Taft, and determined that they did not justify a multiplier in this case.

The Court's ruling is tentative, meaning that it is subject to change after further briefing and argument.
