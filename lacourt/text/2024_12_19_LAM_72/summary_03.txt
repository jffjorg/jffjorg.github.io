And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case brought by Rhonda Rudolph against Living Spaces Furniture, LLC, Susana Grennon, and Charlynn Lok. Rhonda is seeking to amend her complaint to change her first claim from discriminatory termination to retaliatory discrimination. The judge grants the motion for leave to amend, allowing Rhonda to file and serve a Second Amended Complaint within five days. The judge notes that the amendment changes the nature of the claim, but finds that it is proper to allow the amendment. The judge also notes that the trial is scheduled for July 7, 2025, and the discovery cut-off is January 24, 2025, so defendants may need additional time for discovery of the new claim.
