Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrers filed by the defendants (Aley & L Group, Corporation, Luis Del Cid, and Maria Del Cid) to the second, third, fourth, and fifth claims in the First Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiff (10869 Drury Lane Prop, LLC).

* The judge overrules the demurrer to the second claim, trespass, finding that the plaintiff has adequately alleged lack of permission for the defendants' entry onto the property.
* The judge sustains the demurrers with leave to amend to the third and fourth claims, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, finding that the plaintiff has not adequately alleged an existing relationship between itself and potential tenants.
* The judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend to the fifth claim, unjust enrichment, finding that the plaintiff cannot state a claim against the defendants as sublessees, and that unjust enrichment is not a cause of action in California.
* The judge denies the motion to strike as moot, as it is no longer necessary in light of the other rulings.
